They're not very discreet, tricky to aim properly and they end up in landfill with all other plastic waste. Pregnancy tests haven't really evolved since the 1980s, but a Philadelphia company is trying to change that.
Lia Diagnostics has created the first-ever biodegradable pregnancy test that can be flushed down the toilet and the product received U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance for over-the-counter use last week.
The device ditches all plastic and digital components and is constructed out of paper. They say it uses the same plant fibres as most toilet paper brands and weighs less than six squares of the leading brand of three-ply bathroom tissue.

The paper pregnancy test has a coating that repels liquid long enough to take the test, but eventually breaks down like toilet paper when flushed.
Lia CEO Bethany Edwards says two million pounds of plastic and digital waste from at-home pregnancy tests end up in U.S. landfills every year.
With a background in materials science research and product design, Edwards and co-founder Anna Simpson sought to redesign the generic pregnancy test.
“Single-use diagnostics are only used for a couple of minutes and they're all made out of plastic and non-sustainable materials,” Edwards told TechCrunch. “It's been the same stick test since 1987 and that's kind of crazy.”
The new device works like the traditional at-home test, measuring hormone levels in the user's urine. Two indicator lines appear to signal whether the hormone is detected and one line if not.

The company says – like most traditional tests – that the Lia is 99 per cent accurate when used on the first day of the user's expected period.
The difference is that the user doesn't have to worry about disposing of the test discreetly, no matter what the desired result may be.
Edwards pointed out that, for example, women who are trying to get pregnant are frequently using pregnancy tests and “have trouble hiding the pileup of tests in the trash,” further adding to the stigma of infertility.
Users will be able to purchase the pregnancy test on Amazon starting mid-2018, with the device priced between US$9 to US$20 (the price range of at-home pregnancy tests already on the market). The company says it will provide one pregnancy test to non-profits such as Quebec's SOS Grossesse and Planned Parenthood for every $10 donation it receives.

For the fourth consecutive year, the Cleveland Cavaliers and Golden State Warriors will meet in the NBA Finals.
The best-of-7 series tips off Thursday night at Oracle Arena in Oakland, Calif., and unless LeBron James is able to clone himself, the Cavs don't stand a chance.

In fact, the Warriors should sweep this series.
James is the best player in the game, and one could argue he is the best ever. I'll leave that debate for another day, but in saying that, this is James' ninth NBA Finals appearance in his 15-year career including the last eight years in a row. That's insane.
But he can't carry the Cavs to another upset, can he?

No, not against Golden State.
Not with Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green.
The Warriors opened as 12-point favourites in Game 1, the biggest point spread in an NBA Finals opener since the Los Angeles Lakers faced the Philadelphia 76'ers in 1991, a series L.A. won in five games.
The Warriors dominated the Cavaliers to win last year's final in five games. In 2016, Cleveland rallied past Golden State to become the first team in NBA history to win the Larry O'Brien Trophy after trailing 3-games-to-1. The Warriors took their first meeting in the Finals, in 2015, in six.
I guess I will give the Cavs one game, a win in Game 3, but that's it. The Warriors are again set to be crowned NBA champions.
Don MacIntyre, MLA for Innisfail-Sylvan Lake, resigned from the United Conservative Party Caucus on Friday citing family reasons.
“Hi folks. Resigning from politics today to focus on our family. Thanks everyone! #AbLeg #ucp,” the politician tweeted.
Hi folks. Resigning from politics today to focus on our family. Thanks everyone! #AbLeg #ucp — Don MacIntyre (@Don_MacIntyre) February 2, 2018
“At approximately noon today, Don MacIntyre resigned from the United Conservative Caucus,” UCP Leader Jason Kenney said in a brief statement issued Friday afternoon.
Global News has reached out to both MacIntyre and the UCP for further comment.
MacIntyre was first elected to the Alberta legislature as a Wildrose Party member in 2015 before the party merged with the Progressive Conservative Party to form the UCP last year.
He was a a member of the Standing Committee on Resource Stewardship and had spent time as shadow minister for electricity and renewables.
Last year, MacIntyre faced calls for his resignation over his controversial views on climate change.

While speaking to reporters about the NDP government's carbon tax, MacIntyre said it's not clear how much humans contribute to climate change.
“The science isn't settled,” he said.
MacIntyre's name was also tied to a contentious blog post made by several Wildrose members that compared the NDP government's carbon tax to a famine caused by Soviet government policies in Ukraine during the 1930s that killed millions of people.The Wildrose Party later apologized for the Holodomor blog post.

Before entering politics, MacIntyre's biography online says he worked for the alternative energy program at the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology and as the chief technical officer for a private overseas geothermal company.
News of MacIntyre's resignation came just hours after Alberta MLA Derek Fildebrandt was officially kicked out of the UCP caucus. The move came after he pleaded guilty to a charge related to an illegal deer hunt late last year.

“As elected representatives, we must be expected to show the highest level of integrity,” UCP leader Jason Kenney said in a statement about Fildebrandt's departure. “MLA Derek Fildebrandt has unfortunately demonstrated a pattern of behaviour that does not meet that standard.”

Members of Canada's Olympic moguls mens and womens teams were training at Apex this week

Describing the training environment at Apex Mountain a “dream,” the Penticton head coach of the Canadian men's moguls team says his guys are ready to rock the Olympics.
After spending the last 10 days on the local ski hill, Rob Kober, his coaching staff and team members boarded the 6 a.m. flight Thursday at Penticton Regional Airport on the first leg of their journey to Pyeongchang, South Korea and the XXIII Olympic Winter Games.
“It's the perfect course up here on Kristi's Run and we've been enjoying ideal conditions. I can't imagine a better set up for a pre-Olympic camp,” said Kober who has been at the helm of Canada's powerhouse for a dozen years. “The course here is ideal for adding intensity in a relatively safe environment, and we kind of fly under the radar so that helps minimize distractions.
“I think having that kind of environment where everything is ideal on the snow we can insulate the athletes and keep it fun, keep them well-fed and rested and we can do all that here.”
He credits the outstanding programs at Apex over the years for producing top calibre skiers like former Summerland Olympian Kristi Richards and Penticton's Andi Naude, 22, who will be seeing her first action in the Olympics this year on the women's team.
“I'm biased but I think Andi's going to win,” said Kober, whose two sons Jordan and Josh and daughter Chloe are all involved in the sport. “Andi's awesome, she's awesome, can't say enough good stuff about her, and right now she's really peaking at the right time.
“I think Andi's best stuff is the best stuff out there right now.”
Naude joined the national team at age 16 and narrowly missed the cut for the 2014 games in Sochi.
And for his part, if results are any indication of success, Kober is definitely on the right track.
The Canadian men finished one, two in the 2014 Olympics and the silver medalist that year, Mikaël Kingsbury, is back for his third try at a gold.
Kingsbury has been burning up the course on the World Cup this season and is favoured to wind up on the top shelf of the podium this time.
“Mik's been on a terrific tear here for quite a while and hopefully will live up to those expectations,” said Kober.
The Canadian men suffered what he described as a “devastating” blow a couple weeks ago when their number-two guy, Philippe Marquis, tore his ACL at a World Cup event in Deer Valley, Utah.
The injury, however, has not kept the 28-year-old veteran off the skis.
“He trained last night at Apex and he looks great and he's going to try, but it's a pretty terrible injury,” said Kober. “It's been done before but with no ACL it's a pretty aggressive mission.”
With such a strong, experienced team the coach is not planning to come back home empty-handed.
“If I'm honest, nope,” he said about being satisfied without winning a medal. “To be successful we definitely need to come out there with some hardware, that's for sure. At the same time, I would say how we handle failure — hopefully we won't have to — but how we handle that will define our team as much as anything.”
He added: “For me, the way I think about our team, our program and any individual athlete is definitely not going to be defined by the results from any one event, whether it's the Olympic Games or anything else.”
The teams will begin training in Pyeongchang on Feb. 5 with both the men's and women's first qualifying rounds going at night on Feb 8.
The women's second qualifying round and finals will be Feb. 11 and the men's second qualifying and finals are Feb. 12.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of the Interior this week quietly removed Obama-era reforms to the leasing of federal land for oil and gas drilling in a move to “simplify and streamline” the process, according to a memo sent to field staff on Wednesday.
The instruction memorandum sent to field officials by the acting director of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management updated the review process for leasing out federal land for oil and gas production to speed up permitting of new lease sales.
The memo effectively erases the reforms implemented by the Obama administration aimed at including input from environmentalists and local tourist industry groups in the process of leasing federal land for drilling, which the oil and gas industry said was time-consuming and redundant.
“This (Instructional Memorandum) aims to simplify and streamline the leasing process for more efficient and effective oil and gas lease management,” the memo said, adding that policy changes would result in “additional revenue from increased lease sales” and reduced costs for environmental reviews and responses to protests.
The new policy would limit the environmental review of a specific lease sale to six months and no longer requires site visits by BLM officials.
“The clear direction is to issue as many leases as possible, as quickly as possible, without considering resource conflicts or the desires of local communities,” said Nada Culver, senior counsel at the Wilderness Society, a public lands advocacy group.
The previous administration decided to reform how oil and gas leases were approved after nearly 80 leases on land near national parks and monuments in Utah had to be canceled by BLM amid a barrage of lawsuits by environmental groups.
Under the Trump administration's “energy dominance” agenda, the Interior Department has taken steps to undo environmental regulations and open up more federal land and waters to energy exploration.

Shortly before Donald Trump's inauguration last month, Jerusalem's mayor unveiled a video tribute to the incoming president for his much-touted campaign promise to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
On Tuesday, on the eve of the first White House summit between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Mayor Nir Barkat emphasized his support for the move during a conference in the city.
“There's no more important symbol than the American Embassy,'' Barkat said.
Relocating the embassy would be cheered by many Israelis and the government. But the move would be controversial because it would anger Palestinians, risk destabilizing Arab allies of the U.S., and upend decades of American diplomatic orthodoxy that has resisted moving the embassy absent a peace deal between Israelis and Palestinians.
Control over Jerusalem and its holy sites in the Old City has been one of the most intractable disputes through failed rounds of Israeli-Palestinian talks, and has the potential to ignite violent clashes throughout the region.
Though Israeli officials frequently refer to the entire city as Israel's eternal capital, Palestinians claim the eastern sections of the city that were controlled by Jordan before the 1967 Arab-Israeli War as the capital of their future state. The U.S., like the rest of the international community, has kept its embassy to Israel in Tel Aviv for decades to avoid a move that would prejudge bilateral talks.
For Palestinian leaders, moving the embassy — even if to the city's western section — would be tantamount to a de facto recognition of Israel's annexation of East Jerusalem after the 1967 war.
“This would be the end of an era, probably the end of the two-state solution, or at least the end of any role for Washington in our region,” Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said in an interview this month with the online news service the EU Observer. “It would be a total disaster.''
Trump, who is scheduled to meet with Netanyahu on Wednesday, recently told the Israel Hayom newspaper that he was still mulling over the idea of moving the embassy.
“I am studying the embassy [issue] and we will see what happens,” Trump told the newspaper. “It isn't an easy decision.”
Trump apparently is squaring his approach to Israel with the foreign policies of successive administrations before him. The White House recently issued a statement saying that building new Jewish settlements in the West Bank was liable to hurt prospects for peace.
Daniel Shapiro, the ambassador to Israel under President Obama, said the Trump administration appears to be recognizing that unilateral moves would jeopardize a long-standing U.S. interest in promoting peace.
If the embassy were moved to Jerusalem, the undertaking would need to involve coordination with U.S. allies and be part of a diplomatic process with Palestinians, Shapiro said.
“If they just announce it in a speech without consultation, without appropriate planning, it wouldn't be the smart way to do it,'' he said.
Trump apparently cooled to the idea of moving the embassy following a meeting this month with King Abdullah II of Jordan, an ally in the U.S. fight against Islamic State extremists and other militants.
Jordan, which holds the status of a custodian of the Muslim holy sites in the Old City, warned the administration that such a move could stir up protests in Arab countries and alienate Sunni-dominated allies. It could also trigger unrest in the Palestinian territories and East Jerusalem, where allegations of Israeli attempt to assert control over Muslim holy places have sparked protests and attacks.
In Jerusalem, the U.S. Consulate annex — a fortress-like building with security guards outside — handles visas and passports and lies in an area controlled by Israel before the Arab-Israeli War. An adjacent plot of land with a hotel is also owned by the U.S. government.
“They will not move the embassy to Jerusalem. It's too difficult to move,'' said Mike Andrew, a Palestinian American who had taken a taxi from Ramallah in the West Bank to renew his children's passports. “So far it's a lot of talk.''
Though Congress passed a law in 1995 calling for the move of the embassy, successive presidents have exercised a special waiver to delay the move every six months. Trump will have to decide in May whether to use the same waiver or allow the embassy to move.
The president's ambassador nominee, David Friedman, supports the move. He vowed at a Republican campaign event in Jerusalem in October that Trump would fire State Department officials who opposed the move.
Friedman, a patron of West Bank settlements who owns a private residence in Jerusalem, reportedly said he would want to live and work in Jerusalem as ambassador. Friedman's confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is expected to start Thursday.
Guy Avihod, an Israeli American who said he could see the consulate's flag from his Jerusalem home, also expressed skepticism that Trump would overturn the policy, but said it would be a symbolic gesture to Israel.
“Jerusalem is such a consensus of always being part of Israel for 3,000 years,'' he said. “So, when our biggest ally dismisses that and says, ‘No, Tel Aviv is the capital,' it's dismissing Israel to the core.”
Ashraf Ajrami, a senior advisor to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, told Israeli army radio that the Palestinians would demand that the U.S. open an embassy in East Jerusalem and recognize it as the capital of a Palestinian state in response to a move. Currently, the U.S. Consulate General on the western side of the city serves as the unofficial embassy to the Palestinians.
Veteran diplomats on both sides of the divide warned against a hasty move.
“If the American government is making a decision on the core issues, this would be a terrible blow,'' said Alon Liel, a former director general of Israel's Foreign Ministry. “Everyone knows such a unilateral move is the end of two states.''

ISLAMABAD - The Pakistan People's Party Parliamentarians will contest the July 25 elections on its traditional ‘arrow' symbol in alliance with the PPP, the parent organization.
The PPPP announced on Tuesday that despite the Election Commission of Pakistan's decision to allot ‘sword' as election symbol to the PPP, the party will form an alliance with the PPPP to contest on the ‘arrow' symbol.
“The PPPP will contest on the ‘arrow' symbol in alliance with the PPP (which has ‘sword' as its symbol). The two parties have agreed to contest on the (single) ‘arrow' symbol. The PPP will retain its ‘sword' symbol but will contest with the PPPP (with the ‘arrow' symbol',” said a PPPP spokesperson. He said the PPPP was led by Asif Ali Zardari while the PPP was headed by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari.
Earlier in the day, the ECP allotted election symbols to political parties for the July 25 polls. The PPP, founded by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, had contested the 1970 elections with ‘sword' as its symbol. ‘Sword' was used by the party before it was removed from the list of election symbols by the ECP following polls in 1970. The PPP has not contested elections as a party since 1996. The PPPP has been contesting on behalf of the PPP.
PPP Secretary-General Nayyar Hussain Bokhari said the party opted for the ‘sword' symbol for elections in 1970. After the martial law was imposed in 1985, the ‘sword' was removed as an election symbol. “Even the ECP did not enlist it as an official symbol,” he said.
Bokhari said that the ‘sword' was the PPP's right as Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto opted for it. Four other parties had applied for the ‘sword' symbol, including the Pakistan Peoples Movement, which was launched by former PPP leader Dr Tanveer Zaman. The Pakistan People's Party (Workers) had also filed a petition in the Supreme Court contending for the sword symbol as well. Naheed Khan, the wife of Safdar Abbasi, had filed the petition.
Naheed Khan said that the PPP leadership contested the elections under their parliamentarian wing and was just taking the ‘sword' symbol out of spite. “If Bokhari can swear he will fight elections on the ‘sword' and not the ‘arrow', we will believe him,” she added.
PPPP Secretary General Farhatullah Babar said there was no need of a formal alliance between the PPPP and the PPP as they were accepted as the same party by the people.
The law, he said, allowed two parties to contest under one symbol if they were in agreement. “The law permits the PPP and the PPPP to contest on the arrow. When the two parties agree, there should be no issue,” he said.
He added: “We have a precedent in shape of the MMA (Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal) where several parties kept their identities but contested under one symbol in the past.”
Zardari and Bilawal are the elected leaders of the PPPP and the PPP. They co-chair the PPP. The PPPP has been contesting the polls on behalf of the PPP since 2002 and efforts to re-engage the PPP have faced legal hurdles. The PPPP will contest the fourth successive general election for the PPP in July as the merger of the electoral extension with the parent party seemed tricky.
The PPPP was created from within the PPP in 2002 during the military regime of Pervez Musharraf to dodge a law that prohibited the parties led by convicted leaders from contesting the polls. The law kept the late Benazir Bhutto and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif out of the electoral race.
The law – now scrapped - also banned individuals from becoming the prime minister for a third term. While the PPP created a separate branch to contest the polls, Sharif relinquished his post to his brother Shahbaz Sharif to make way for his party – the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz to contest the polls. Both the parties performed reasonably well keeping in view that arch nemesis Musharraf was in power.
The PPPP contested again in 2008 to win the general polls for the PPP and in 2013 to end up as the second largest bloc in the National Assembly. It won elections in Sindh to form the provincial government.
PPP sources said that Zardari and Bilawal had been considering the ‘Punjab crisis' in the recent weeks and hope to improve the party's standing in the July 25 polls.
“We are banking on South Punjab. We are being realistic and are trying to get whatever share we can get. We know, we will not be winning too many seats in Punjab. We hope some independents will join us after the polls to improve our tally,” said a senior PPP leader.
PPP South Punjab Secretary General Natasha Daultana said the party was mobilizing workers in rural Punjab and was optimistic to grab some seats. “We are not out. We are in the game. The opponents had ruled us out in the past but we made a comeback each time. We will return strong again,” she said.
Punjab was once a stronghold of the PPP during the peak of Zulfikar Bhutto but it slowly drifted away to the right-wing or pro-right parties. The ruling PML-N has been firmly in control of the province over the recent past. Its monopoly has. however, been challenged by Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf.
The province, with a bigger population than all the other provinces combined, is effectively the ‘king-maker' with scores of the National Assembly seats up for grab.
American Serena Williams dropped a large hint that she could soon be back on court competing when she posted an Instagram photo of a pair of dazzling gold and white tennis shoes.

Chris Fradkin, a UC Merced lecturer and alumnus, is heading to Brazil in search of “lost science.”
The term, first coined in 1995 in a Scientific American article by W. Wayt Gibbs, refers to the untold amount of viable scientific research that goes unread and undiscovered due to the struggles and barriers faced by researchers in developing countries around the world.
It's a subject close to Fradkin's heart, and he was recently awarded a Fulbright fellowship to continue his research into the many factors preventing Brazilian scientists — and, by extension, those in other “emerging” nations — from successfully disseminating their work to the scientific world at large.
In 2014, after earning his Ph.D. at UC Merced, Fradkin began a 14-month fellowship in Brazil. While there, he had the opportunity to guest edit a special English-language issue of a journal whose articles had been translated from Brazilian Portuguese.
“The articles were supposedly professionally translated to English, but they were almost unreadable to me,” he said. “The intent in Portuguese was completely there, but the translation — to get it not just to English, but English that means something and conveys vision and ideas — fell short in many ways.”
Language alone does not account for the struggles that scientists in the so-called BRICS nations — Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, considered by economists as emerging nations that could soon be called “developed” — have faced over the years.
For example, Germany does not use English as a standard language for science or commerce. But it is in close proximity to several European nations that do, so most scientists learn to speak English more or less fluently in order to communicate at conferences and with colleagues.
The same can't be said for scientists in the more isolated BRICS nations, who must travel great distances to collaborate with English-speaking colleagues. Without those collaborations and the notoriety they could receive among those colleagues, Brazilian scientists struggle to place their work in top-tier journals.
Fradkin has already begun to research the factors that work against Brazilian scientists in “internationalizing” their work — or creating an impact with it on an international level.
In a recent study Opens a New Window. , he found that simply providing English translations was not enough, indicating that the quality of those translations must improve. Additionally, he found Opens a New Window. that one of the most significant predictors of a Brazilian journal's international impact is not the number of English-speakers collaborating on its articles, but the number of English-speaking members of its editorial board.
“Chris' analysis on Brazil's psychology journals was accurate, unbiased and critical,” said Lilian Calò, coordinator of science communication at the Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information. “The scientific community cannot treat Brazilian authors in a condescending manner when they submit a paper to an international journal. I think the research Chris is conducting does us a tremendous favor in showing our improvements, and more importantly, our capacity to keep improving.”
As he continues to develop and refine his research, Fradkin hopes to help uncover Brazil's “lost science” — some of which could make a major impact internationally if communicated in the right way and in the right places.
“There may be findings in a Brazilian journal that connect water pollution to birth defects — say in the slums outside São Paulo,” Fradkin said. “That could be of huge value to scientists in the U.S., the U.K. or France. But there's so much else to read that scientists aren't looking in lower-tier journals, and they don't have time to struggle through a poorly done translation. It becomes a huge barrier.”
The Fulbright Program, which aims to increase mutual understanding between the people of the U.S. and the people of other countries, is the flagship international educational exchange program sponsored by the U.S. government.
“Fulbright allows international students to immerse themselves in the U.S., and it sends people like me to other countries to participate and collaborate with non-native speakers,” Fradkin said. “It promotes widening one's experience and developing relationships, which in this day and age is essential.”

The 2018 BMW 5 Series lineup has added another member in the form of a diesel-powered variant. Unlike the previous generation, the new diesel-powered 5 Series, dubbed the the 540d xDrive, comes standard with all-wheel drive and starts at $62,995 including destination. This makes it $1,500 more than a 540i xDrive, which isn't very much. However, the diesel-powered model is $8,800 more than a rear-drive 530e iPerformance and $7,050 more than a 530e xDrive iPerformance, both of which are currently the most fuel efficient 5 Series models available.
Under the hood is a new 3.0-liter turbodiesel I-6 with 261 hp and 457 lb-ft of torque, an increase of 6 hp and 44 lb-ft compared to the outgoing 535d. An eight-speed automatic is the only transmission available. Despite the extra horsepower and torque, the 2018 BMW 540d xDrive is one of most efficient 5 Series variant with an EPA rating of 26/36 mpg city/highway. The 530e iPerformance, which is a plug-in hybrid that features a 2.0-liter turbo-four coupled to an electric motor, is EPA rated at 29 mpg combined and can travel 370 miles on a full tank and a full charge in rear-drive guise or up to 16 miles solely on electric power. The 530e xDrive is slightly less efficient at 28 mpg combined for a total range of 360 miles and an electric only range of 15 miles. All the efficiency of the hybrid does come at the cost of total output because the 530e is rated at 248 hp and 310 lb-ft combined.
Standard features on the 2018 BMW 540d xDrive includes leather upholstery, 16-way power adjustable front seats, 40/20/40 split-folding rear seats, LED headlights and fog lights, a 12-speaker audio system, Bluetooth, BMW's iDrive interface with a 10.2-inch touchscreen, navigation, an 8.8-inch digital instrument cluster, a rearview camera, adaptive cruise control and two USB ports. Options include a 360-degree camera system, soft-close doors, Nappa leather upholstery, multi-contour seats, a wireless charging pad, a rear-seat entertainment system, Apple CarPlay, premium audio systems from Harman Kardon or Bowers & Wilkins, active steering, dynamic dampers, active roll stabilization, an adaptive drive system, active park assist, and a head-up display. Active driver assistance features such as blind spot warning and lane departure warning are available as part of the Driver Assistance package. Tick the box for the Driver Assistance Plus package and you get the Active Driver Assistant Plus, which bundles together forward collision warning, pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, and lane departure warning.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - India's retail inflation likely breached the central bank's 4.0 percent medium-term target in November after unseasonably heavy rains sent food prices soaring, a Reuters poll showed. A vendor arranges vegetable at his stall in a market in Mumbai, November 13, 2017. REUTERS/Shailesh Andrade/FilesIn the poll of more than 30 economists, annual consumer inflation, due to be released on Dec. 12 at 1200 GMT, was seen surging to a 13-month high of 4.20 percent in November from October's 3.58 percent. The higher inflation rate is unlikely to push the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to change its key rate any time soon, economists in the poll said. November's heavy rains “created lots of damage” for perishable fruit and vegetable crops, said Rupa Rege Nitsure, group chief economist at Larsen & Toubro. “We have seen that translated into price rises for onions, tomatoes and other perishable commodities”. Increased house rent allowances for government employees and rising crude oil prices added to inflationary pressures alongside higher raw material costs due to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rollout, she said. Wholesale prices are expected to have risen 3.78 percent last month from a year earlier, compared to a 3.59 percent rise in October. NEUTRAL STANCE At its Dec. 6 policy meeting, the central bank raised its inflation projection by 10 basis points to between 4.3 and 4.7 percent for the six months ending in March. It kept interest rates steady and stressed a neutral policy stance. The RBI cut rates by 200 basis points from January 2015 until August this year while food and energy prices were down. It is likely to keep them unchanged through the end of 2018, according to a separate Reuters poll. “Interest rates will remain stable for some time before they (the RBI) start hiking them because industrial growth is still weak,” Nitsure said. “Recovery is happening in a few sectors but it has not spread to all sectors and private investment sentiment also remains low.” Industrial output growth eased to 3.0 percent in October from September's 3.8 percent, as demand continued to suffer from disruption caused by the new national sales tax as well as last year's currency clampdown that wiped out over 85 percent of the cash in circulation. But halting a five-quarter slide, India's economic growth rebounded in the three months ending in September with businesses starting to overcome troubles from implementation of the new tax. “We still have some output gap but it's not as bad as it used to be a couple of quarters back. It will not make any sense for the RBI to just react to the (inflation) number. They also have to look at other factors,” said Arun Singh, lead economist at Dun & Bradstreet India in Mumbai. The poll also showed India's trade deficit likely narrowed to $13.75 billion last month from October's near three-year high of $14.02 billion.

PARIS (Reuters) - The French government will send more police to Calais to crack down on migrant gangs, the interior minister said on Friday, after gang rivalries erupted into a brawl that left five migrants suffering serious gunshot injuries.
Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said he was sending more riot police to the northern port, where asylum seekers and economic migrants hoping to reach Britain continues to fall prey to smugglers undaunted by a long-running security operation.
Thursday's explosion of violence was a stark reminder that the dismantling of a sprawling camp in late 2016 had failed to halt the arrival of migrants in Calais. It came weeks after Britain promised millions of pounds in extra border control support.
Eritreans and Afghans fought running battles in broad daylight, some armed with rods and metal poles, television pictures showed. It was not clear who was armed with firearms.
Calais Mayor Natacha Bouchart said her town was confronted by all-out gang warfare.
“There will be people here at their wits' ends faced with this increasingly violent presence among a certain number of migrants, who it is plain to see are organised in gangs,” Collomb told reporters after spending the night in Calais.
“We know there are gang leaders ... and it is these networks we must dismantle,” the minister added.

FOOD HANDOUTS
Promising to ease the pressure on Calais, where Britain's southern shores can be seen on a clear day, Collomb said that within two weeks the government would take over control of food distribution from local aid groups and conduct the handouts outside the town.
That, he said, would remove an incentive for the migrants to gather in Calais.

Francois Guennoc of the Auberge des Migrants charity told BFM TV that the government still lacked a coherent strategy. “Every time you arrest 10 people, another 10 fill the void.”
Collomb indicated the French government was concerned that hundreds of thousands of migrants would head to France after their asylum requests were rejected in other European countries, above all Germany.
He said half a million migrants, many of them people who had initially been allowed into Germany, had had their requests for asylum rejected.
“The situation's untenable,” he told reporters, noting that France registered a record 100,000 asylum requests in 2017. Tens of thousands more had been turned around at the border, he said.
More asylum seekers in France came from Albania than any other country, according to official data. Collomb said that while Germany dealt with Albanian cases in several days, France took two to three years.

While we all knew Sony Pictures Animation was releasing an animated Spider-Man movie in December of next year and that Miles Morales was the lead, until this weekend Sony hadn't released the title or even confirmed whether Peter Parker would be making an appearance in the movie. But with CCXP (Comic-Con Experience) happening in São Paulo, Brazil, Sony decided to use the biggest Comic-Con in South America to unveil new details about the web-swinger's upcoming animated adventure by having producers Phil Lord and Chris Miller take the stage with Erico Borgo from Omelete to answer a few questions.
One of the big things fans wanted to know was, how would Peter Parker factor in the movie?
In the various Miles Morales Spider-Man comics, which first started in 2011, we have seen different versions of the Peter Parker/Miles Morales relationship. In Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man, Miles is bitten by a spider infected with Parker's blood. Even though he has amazing abilities, Miles decides he just wants to live a normal life. But after watching Spider-Man die at the hands of Green Goblin, Miles is inspired to try his hand at being Spider-Man.
Conversely, in Miles Morales: Ultimate Spider-Man, Peter Parker is alive and well and has a relationship with Miles. They even team up to fight Norman Osborn.
Which brings us back to the upcoming animated Spider-Man movie. Shortly after world premiering the trailer and announcing the title as Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, Lord (who also has sole credit on the screenplay) and Miller revealed that Peter Parker is definitely in the movie and plays a middle-aged mentor to Miles. While you might think this means Peter Parker has a big role, Lord and Miller made it clear this is a Miles Morales movie and Parker is passing the baton to Miles as the new Spider-Man.
Now before I go any further, I'm going to show you how if you were paying close attention during the trailer, you might have already picked up on some of this information and how, I think, the film is actually using some of the comic book storylines.
At the very end of the trailer, Miles is in a train station, sitting on a bench, talking to someone. In the scene, he says, “Wait…so how many of us are there?” The person sitting next to him is Peter Parker. He's the one on the left in the picture below!
Going even further down the rabbit hole, towards the beginning of the trailer, Miles is in a cemetery and we can see what looks like Peter Parker on the headstone:
Next, when Sony Pictures Animation sent out the press release for the trailer, they included this info about the picture below
Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) falls through an alternate-universe New York City in Sony Pictures Animation's Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse
Finally, when the studio tweeted about the trailer, they said:
Enter a universe where more than one wears the mask.
Based on the above info, I think the animated movie is going to follow at least part of the storyline of Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man by chronicling how Miles Morales got his powers and showing the death of Spider-Man. This would explain why Miles goes to the cemetery to visit Peter Parker's grave. The film could then show Miles deciding to use his newfound powers for good, and as he tries them out, somehow ends up in an alternate universe where Peter Parker is still alive and becomes the mentor that Lord and Miller talked about.
By doing this, you get to show a different side of Peter Parker that fans have never seen in a movie. You make all the Miles Morales fans happy because he's the star of the show. And they've opened the door to a world where everything you know about Spider-Man is different and the future possibilities are endless. Finally, you make it very easy for people to understand this animated movie has nothing to do with the live-action Spider-Man movies, which I'm sure will make Marvel Studios happy. It's a win-win for everyone.

John Boyega keeps finding himself gearing up for apocalyptic warfare.
The “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” star is at the center of the new “Pacific Rim: Uprising” trailer that Legendary Pictures released Friday, leading a new generation of heroes to take the evolved aliens of the futuristic franchise to task.
“We were born into a world at war,” Boyega's rebellious Jake Pentecost narrates in the teaser.
“Between the monsters who destroyed our cities and the monsters we created to stop them, we thought we had sacrificed enough,” he says. “But the war we thought we finished is just beginning. And the only thing standing in front of the apocalypse is us.”
“Pacific Rim Uprising” is the sequel to Guillermo del Toro's 2013 “Pacific Rim,” which, according to Legendary, was “only a prelude to the all-out assault on humanity” featured in the latest chapter.
(Del Toro's film, starring Charlie Hunnam and released by Warner Bros. before Legendary was sold to China's Wanda Group, was considered only a modest success, hauling in $411 million globally at the box office on a production budget approaching $200 million.)
Boyega's Pentecost, whose father, Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba), gave his life to secure humanity's victory against the monstrous Kaiju in the previous film, struggles to live up to his dad's legacy and abandons his robotic Jaeger pilot training only to get tangled up in the criminal underworld. But with a new threat that promises to end humanity looming yet again, Jake is enlisted by his estranged sister, Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi), to help lead the next generation of pilots, including gifted rival Lambert (Scott Eastwood) and 15-year-old Jaeger hacker Amara (Cailee Spaeny), against the formidable and cantankerous aliens featured in the trailer.
Del Toro, who penned the original script and has stayed on the project as a producer, turned over directing duties in April 2016 to “Daredevil” and “Spartacus” director Steven S. DeKnight. DeKnight was given a new script written by Jon Spaihts, but that one underwent another rewrite by Derek Connolly a short while later.
The film, which also stars Jing Tian, Burn Gorman, Adria Arjona and Charlie Day, is due in theaters March 23.

Officials are concerned that damage to an emergency spillway could dump large amounts of water into the Feather River, which runs through downtown Oroville.
It could be the solution thousands of Rocky View County parents have been waiting for in the face of a $1 million transportation shortfall.
On Monday, Alberta's education minister, David Eggen told reporters the province could be open to parents paying for school bus fees despite newly passed legislation.
“There's certainly a mechanism to change school fees if people want to make that choice, it's possible,” Eggen said. “Absolutely.”
Bill 1, which was introduced last year, eliminated school bus fees for students who live 2.4 kilometres or more from the designated school they attend.
READ MORE: Province promises new regulations will reduce school fees for Alberta parents
On its website, Rocky View Schools states its jurisdiction provides educational services to almost 24,000 public students from kindergarten to Grade 12 and includes several urban and rural communities which surround the city of Calgary.
“In consultations, many parents expressed they would like to pay the transportation fee they were used to paying before,” Rocky View Schools Board of Trustees chair Todd Brand said.
Earlier this year, parents were asked to fill out a survey looking at different options to deal with the shortfall.
The list of solutions includes changing school bell times, increasing rural bus commutes — in some cases to three hours per day — and moving bus stops in urban communities.

“The worst would be if they eliminated busing for anyone under 2.4 kilometres,” Airdire parent Marilyne Aalhus said. “A lot of kids would be walking to school and that's a long distance for a child who might be starting Grade 1.”
“Before, we just paid the same and everybody was happy.”
In the survey, trustees stated the shortfall was due to a number of factors, including provincial grant revenues not keeping pace with the cost of inflation, a $360,000 carbon levy and Bill 1.
In light of Eggen's comments, Brand said Rocky View School administration will be reaching out to the Ministry of Education, adding the board's April 12 deadline for a decision could be pushed back.
“We're very open to solutions and conversation,” Brand said.
YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar denied on Friday that there were mass graves in a village in troubled Rakhine state, where a military crackdown on insurgents has triggered the flight of nearly 690,000 minority Rohingya Muslims to neighbouring Bangladesh.
The Associated Press has reported it had confirmed the existence of more than five previously unreported mass graves in the village of Gu Dar Pyin, through interviews with survivors in refugee camps in Bangladesh and through time-stamped cellphone videos.
The Myanmar government's Information Committee, part of the office of civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, said in a statement on its Facebook page that local authorities and security officials formed a “ground team” that investigated the report.
“The ground team went to the locations that were mentioned in the AP news story as where the bodies were buried and found out that it is not true,” the statement said.
“Besides, they met with local elders and villagers and asked whether there were mass killings or not and the villagers told them that there were none.”
The statement said, however, that 19 “terrorists” had been killed when they attacked security forces in the village in late August and that their bodies had been “properly buried”.
Two Rohingya residents, who were still in the village and spoke to Reuters by telephone, disputed the government's statement and said that there were mass graves there. They said senior military officers visited the area on Friday, took photographs and held a meeting with the villagers.
The residents, who declined to be identified for fear of reprisal, were speaking by telephone to a Reuters reporter at the Balukhali refugee camp in Bangladesh. The reporter was put in touch with them by former residents who have fled Rakhine.
One resident said his father attended the meeting, where officers asked how many people had been killed in the violence, who burned their houses and whether there were mass graves there.
“The villagers were frightened and said they didn't know how many had died or who had burned their houses but said, yes, there are mass graves here,” the resident said.
Another resident of the village said three senior military officials arrived late in the morning, took pictures of a mass grave beside his house and then called a meeting at the school.
“The senior officials are gone now but a large group of military men stayed behind and the villagers are scared,” the resident said.
Suu Kyi's spokesman referred requests for comment on the villagers' description of events to the Rakhine state government. A spokesman from the state government was not immediately available. The military said it had no immediate comment.
The AP's Director of Media Relations Lauren Easton said the agency stood by its reporting.
Reporters are not allowed access to the area, in the north of Rakhine state. The army launched a sweeping counteroffensive there in response to Rohingya militant attacks on Aug. 25.
The United Nations has condemned the army's campaign as ethnic cleansing. Myanmar denies that, saying its forces were carrying out legitimate counterinsurgency operations.
The military has acknowledged that Buddhist villagers and soldiers killed 10 people it described as captured Muslim terrorists and buried them in a grave in the village of Inn Din in early September. It has said action will be taken against those responsible.

To kick off the new year, Architosh looks at five emerging technology trends happening broadly across society and what their influence and impacts may be on the AEC industry and the professionals that drive it—including architects, builders, engineers and environmental stakeholders like the citizens of cities.
Architosh already highlights leading edge technology trends in AEC. Our AIA BEST of SHOW honors awards has specific categories for highlighting actual products on the cutting edge. And our deeper discussion on these applications and technologies look at wholesale themes.
However, we can look further afield; we can examine things that are still on the fringe of society and perhaps just a bit closer than the fringe? Autonomous vehicles and drones are a perfect example of the latter. Adaptive learning and crowd learning are examples of the former.
Here are five technology trends with broad implications for society, and some narrower forecasts and observations on how they may impact the AEC (architecture, engineering, and construction) industry and the professionals that serve its stakeholders.
Trend 1: Autonomous Vehicles
We have all heard a lot lately about autonomous vehicles and how shortly humans may not even be allowed by law actually to drive. If such tech futures come true what will happen to our cities, towns, and even buildings and how will this impact the field architecture, urban design, and planning?
The answer to these questions is varied, complicated, and intensely interesting. A lot will depend on other technology trends and how they bear out, as well. But here are some important forecasts.
Before humans are forbidden by law from driving both advanced Lidar and WiFi technology will need to mate up with upgraded highway systems and town roads. Highways may get dedicated “autonomous lanes” while some towns may have dedicated autonomous streets. Engineers involved in roads, bridges, and tunnels will all need to skill-up in the sensor technologies and new design requirements and methodologies in the era of autonomous vehicles.
Moreover, architects will be challenged with finding new uses for parking structures, as more autonomous cars drop off their occupants and then either drive home, drive to a charging station, or become rental rides for other people who do not own cars at all. Telsa has expressed a vision where exactly such a thing happens—once Tesla's vehicles are fully autonomous owners will be able to add them to the Tesla shared fleet from an app on their phone. A world where your car is working for money while you are at work or on vacation says two things: fewer people will own cars and how cars operate autonomously will change everything from roads, drop-offs, and our perhaps garages at home.

When will all this play out? Futurist Amy Webb and her company predict 20-30 years but things could happen sooner. AEC pros in their 20's and 30's should all start thinking about these changes today and develop expertise and creative solutions to these environmental changes.
Trend 2: Drones
Today AEC pros use drones to fly over construction sites and take aerial photography. We have all seen the ones over the new Apple Campus, for example. Yet, Amazon and others predict a future where drones deliver goods directly to our homes. And Amazon just was awarded a US patent on a Zeppelin like airship which shoots out delivery drones. Sound like Star Wars to you? (see image 02)
MORE: Amazon patented a hovering airship warehouse that shoots out delivery drones
How might drone delivery affect buildings?
In the near future armies of drones will fill the sky, in areas such as law enforcement, delivery of goods, clandestine operations, and microdrones. The latter are tiny drones small enough to investigate collapsed buildings and bridges and areas with hazardous materials. Regular sized drones can also be used by building inspectors to review completed work in hard-to-reach or dangerous places (like sloping roofs during icy winters). Structural and civil engineers can use such microdrones as part of their investigative services, and mechanical engineers can use microdrones to inspect the insides of ductwork in buildings.
Back to drones for delivery. The FAA has not yet regulated airspace for drones, but experts predict that to be completed in 3-5 years. Amazon's airship patents currently violate FAA regulations. Regulated airspace for drones will likely operate in zero – 200 feet for hobbyists and journalists, etc., and 200 – 400 feet for commercial drones (e.g., UPS, Amazon, etc.).
As futurist Amy Webb has noted in her book, The Signals Are Talking: Why Today's Fringe Is Tomorrow's Mainstream, changes to FAA rules regarding airspace for drones could impact future urban development, including height limitations on skyscrapers.

CONCORD, N.C. — Bill Elliott remembers taking his son to a kart race out west that Chase Elliott badly wanted to win. He was just a little boy and when he spun his kart, he couldn't get it restarted and his shot at victory was gone.
"He was devastated," Elliott recalled with a laugh. "It's just his DNA."
A dozen or so years later, Chase Elliott is still very hard on himself.
The latest disappointment came last week at Dover when his first Cup Series victory was right in front of him. But with just over a lap remaining, Kyle Busch chased him down and denied Elliott his long overdue first trip to victory lane. He'd been close to a Cup win before, but this defeat was by far the most painful for one of NASCAR's emerging stars.
"That's as close as I've been finishing one off, and when you go through defeats like that, I don't think you'll ever forget it," Chase Elliott said. "There is no silver lining. It was nobody's fault but my own, and I take full responsibility for it.
The hurt hung with Elliott for a day or two, but moving past the disappointment is paramount to his ability to learn how to win in a Cup car. His first chance at redemption comes Sunday at Charlotte Motor Speedway, the opening race in the second round of NASCAR's playoffs. The field of 16 drivers has been cut to 12, and with unpredictable Talladega Superspeedway looming next week, Elliott wants to knock out a strong finish at Charlotte.
"I think you take that frustration (from Dover) and everything that came with giving that race away and apply it to the upcoming week," Elliott said. "This is an important round."
Elliott has leaned on Hendrick Motorsports teammate Jimmie Johnson, the seven-time NASCAR champion, as well as his Hall of Fame father in dealing with the disappointments that come from racing. It was Johnson who got to Elliott's car first at Dover to give Elliott a chance to calm down before facing television cameras .
Johnson's advice to Elliott was to learn from Dover, even though Johnson wasn't sure how Elliott could have changed his strategy to hold off Busch. Elliott had taken command of the race by running a low line that he never adjusted, even though lapped traffic clogged the line and gave Busch the time to catch him.
"From where I was in third, I thought Chase made the right move protecting the bottom," said Johnson, an 11-time Dover winner. "But there are many pieces to that mental game of winning, and one is just not handing them to somebody. Like nine out of 10 times, Chase ran the exact right line. But there is a way to learn how to win them and I feel like Chase has put in his time and he's only going to be stronger for it."
Scores of fans have replicated Amber's cheeky nude picture using props from their own homes
Amber Rose shocked the world this weekend when she proudly displayed her naked body – complete with full pubic bush – on Instagram.
The American model, who has got behind feminist campaigns like the Slutwalk in the past, had her post taken down by the social network site hours after sharing it, but remained defiant about her right to bare her body.
“When IG deletes ur fire ass feminist post but you really don't give a f*** because everyone picked it up already #amberroseslutwalk #bringbackthebush ,” she wrote on the picture-led platform yesterday.
She then called on her fans and followers to replicate her pose and started sharing pictures of those with the best interpretation of her instructions.

“Amber Rose challenge anyone? Lol post your version of my picture and hashtag #AmberRoseChallenge behalf of feminism, body positivity and not conforming to society norms of how we should live, what we should wear and where we should shave,” she wrote.
And her legion of fans did her proud, grabbing their nearest wig or household item to pay tribute to her work.
One man made himself a makeshift black bikini top by ruching it up and tucking it around his waist, with a thick dark wig on his privates to look exactly like Amber.

Another used a pineapple to preserve his remaining modesty in his full-frontal shot, while a bald-headed man went all-out in a bondage-style harness and a strategically placed ice-cream emoji.

It wasn't just the men having a go at their own Rose-style pruning – one woman redid Amber's pose with a packet of McDonald's fries on her lap, while another lady grabbed a box of Pop Tarts and laid languorously back on her stairs.

The former stripper's lady garden caused quite the stir – as it was no doubt designed to do.
“SlutWalk,” she captioned the original snap, referring to the protest that calls for an end to rape culture, including victim blaming and slut-shaming of sexual assault victims, and is due to take place for the third time this October.

Stunned fans flooded the snap with comments, with one simply asking: “Girl, what are you doing?????!!!?!?!?!”
Another said she should never have posted it, writing: “It's beautiful and natural. But shouldn't have posted on social media but hey I won't hate on her hustle.”
“She has a lot of confidence to post this…something most of y'all lack,” wrote a third.
While a fourth shared “please tell me this isn't real”.

And: “I'm all for the SlutWalk n sh** but this is going too be far like girl this ain't porn hub.. why do I see ur bush on INSTAGRAM (sic).”
And other fans questioned if it had been photoshopped as the tattoo below her naval is missing, as is her right upper-thigh tattoo of paw prints.
Just a few hours after the mum-of-one uploaded the snap it had vanished.
Instagram's community guidelines read: “We don't allow nudity on Instagram. This includes photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and close-ups of fully-nude buttocks.
“It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings and sculptures is OK, too.”
For the fourth time in four years, the Golden State Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers find themselves facing off with the NBA Championship on the line. It's a new-age rivalry that has blossomed with the Stephen Curry-led Warriors winning in 2015 and 2017, while LeBron James inspired the Cavs to a title in 2016. Before the part four of this intense rivalry begins on Friday, here's a look at some of the most interesting storylines around the 2018 NBA Finals:
The importance of LeBron James
The importance of LeBron James to this Cavs outfit — widely called as the worst team the 33-year-old had taken to the NBA Finals — is widely stated. But he also has the stats to back that up. Playing in his 15th season, James averages 34.0 points, 9.2 rebounds and 8.8 assists per game in the playoffs coming into the NBA Finals. For both points and assists, he's the Cavs' leader. He's also racked up 612 points in the first three series of the 2018 postseason — 16 more than any other player has scored at this stage in the playoffs historically.
Tellingly, the 33-year-old also leads the playoffs charts for: points per game (34.0), points scored in the clutch (35), double-doubles (13), triple-doubles (3), secondary assists per game (1.3), points per game scored on drives (12.1), and free throw attempts per game (9.7).
Warriors dominated matchups during season
The two times that the Cavaliers and the Warriors came face to face in the regular season, the latter won. In their first matchup, on Christmas Day, they lacked talisman Stephen Curry due to an injury. But Draymond Green stepped up with his first triple-double of the season as his side won 99-92. Disturbingly for the Cavs, they just could not score for the final 1:58 while the Warriors racked up seven points in a row.
A month later, in a match played on the Martin Luther King Jr Day, Cavs came racing out of the blocks and ended the first half with a seven-point lead. However, the Warriors caught up soon enough and then left them in a trail of smoke as they won 118-108.
Unfamiliarity reigns among familiar opponents
With the two teams having met successively for three straight finals, one would assume that the teams know each other like the back of their palms. Yet, thanks to a trade deadline day upheaval from the Cavs at least, their side bears a much different look and feel than the one which took on the Warriors even during the regular season in December 2017 and January 2018. They traded players like Jae Crowder, Dwyane Wade and Isaiah Thomas while bringing in George Hill, Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance among others.
Among friends and family
While the Cavs versus Warriors matchup is now becoming one of the most talked-about modern rivalries, there are a lot of sub-plots too involving the two teams.
Take Kevin Durant and Cavaliers' Kendrick Perkins for instance. The duo was on the same team, Oklahoma City Thunder, for five seasons. Durant even called Perkins “one of the best teammates I've ever had” during his memorable acceptance speech on winning the 2013-14 NBA MVP Award. He recollected late-night calls and texts of encouragement from Perkins during the speech.
Warriors coach Steve Kerr was a teammate of Larry Nance Senior for just over three seasons while he was a player at the Cavaliers. Kerr's team will face Nance's son, Cleveland's Larry Nance Junior, in the Finals.
Cavs' Kevin Love and Warriors' Klay Thompson were childhood friends, who grew up in Oregon. They played on the same Little League baseball team, almost making it to the Little League World Series. Interestingly, Klay's brother Trayce is now an outfielder for the Chicago White Sox. Klay's other brother Mychel Thompson played for the Cavaliers in 2011-12. Steph Curry's brother Seth Curry also was with the Cavs in 2013-14.
Cleveland's George Hill and Golden State's David West were part of the core of the Pacers, who made it to the Conference Finals in 2013 and 2014, losing twice to LeBron James and the Heat.
No. 25 seed Morgan City gave No. 8 seed Belle Chasse all it wanted, but in the end, the Cardinals had a little bit more, avoiding an upset bid with a 4-3 victory in 11 innings in Class 4A bi-district action in Belle Chasse Monday.
With one out in the bottom of the 11th inning and Belle Chase trailing 3-2, the Cardinals' Erin Ragas deposited a 2-1 pitch into right-centerfield for a two-run double to end a marathon game and lift Belle Chasse to a 4-3 victory.
"I told my guys to keep their heads up as this is a very emotional loss for us,” first-year Morgan City coach Joel Dagile told Nola.com/The Times Picayune. “It was an uphill battle for this team having different coaches every year, but all year long, we've stressed to this team that we just have to keep getting better.
“We tell them to trust their teammates, and I feel like we did that today,” Daigle added. “Sometimes you have to take what you want, and we failed to do that tonight. We had the opportunity to put this game away twice, and we couldn't do it, but I am extremely proud of how my guys battled."
While the game was low scoring, the teams had plenty of opportunities throughout as each team left 10 runners on base, including eight in scoring position.
Early on, Morgan City (15-20) had runners in scoring position in each of the first three innings but could not push a run across.
Belle Chasse (24-9), which stranded a runner a third in the second inning, finally got on board in the fourth when Rylan Thayer reached base on a two-out error and scored one batter later on Holden Dejean's single to right field for a 1-0 Belle Chasse advantage.
The Tigers tied the game at 1 in the sixth when Ethan Nguyen, who led off the inning with a walk, eventually scored on a fielder's choice.
Morgan City starting pitcher Logan Tingle retired the Cardinals in order in the next two innings, including striking out the side in the sixth inning, but Belle Chasse threatened to end the game in the bottom of the seventh. Dejean led off the inning with a double, but he was caught stealing for the inning's third out.
The Tigers took a 2-1 lead in the top of the eighth when Nguyen, who led off the inning with a walk, scored on Morrquise Charles' double.
In the bottom of the eighth, Matt Barthelemy connected on a one-out double and scored two batters later with two outs on D'Angelo's double to left field.
Morgan City stranded a runner at third base in the ninth, and Belle Chasse left runners on third base in the bottom of the ninth and 10th innings.
Morgan City's Alex Brocato, who singled to open the 11th, scored with two outs on Kade Dupre's single to centerfield for a 3-2 Morgan City lead.
In the bottom of the 11th, Dejean walked, advanced to second on Isaac Phillips' single, stole third base, and he and Phillips scored with one out on Ragas' walk-off double to end the game.
Mark Plaisance earned the win in relief of Barthelemy. In four innings, Plaisance surrendered one run (one unearned) on three hits with three walks and seven strikeouts.
Barthelemy pitched the game's first seven innings and surrendered two runs (one earned) on two hits with five walks, one hit batter and 10 strikeouts.
Barthelemy and Dejean led the Belle Chasse offense. Barthelemy finished 3-for-5 with a double, a stolen base and a run, while Dejean was 3-for-4 with a double, four stolen bases and a run. Other top Belle Chasse offensive contributors were: Phillips, 2-for-4 with an RBI and a run; Ragas, 1-for-3, a double and two RBIs; and D'Angelo, 1-for-3, a double, an RBI and a stolen base.
Chris Pitre, the final of three Morgan City pitchers, suffered the loss. In 0.1 innings, he surrendered one run (one earned) on two hits.
Tingle pitched the game's first eight innings. He surrendered two runs (one earned) on eight hits with one walk and 10 strikeouts.
Charles pitched two innings and surrendered one run (one earned) on one hit with five walks and three strikeouts.
Offensively, Charles led Morgan City with a 2-for-4 performance with a double and an RBI. Other top Morgan City offensive contributors were Mitchell Mancuso, 1-for-5 with a double and an RBI, and Dupre, 1-for-5, an RBI.
Belle Chasse will continue postseason play this weekend when it meets the winner of No. 9 Benton and No. 24 Pearl River in a best-of-three series. Benton and Pearl River will meet Tuesday at 5 p.m. in Benton.
Your fantasy team suffered a loss. Maybe a player got injured. Maybe he's just not playing well. Either way, you get to play the waiver wire now. It's all good when you're looking through the list of names, hoping to find the spark that will ignite your squad to the playoffs and beyond. But when it's in the with new, it has to be out with the old. Sometimes, it's easy to see the player that no longer deserves a spot on your roster. Sometimes ... not so much. Don't worry. We're here to help. Consider us the break up counselor that will help ease the separation.
All ownership percentages based on NFL.com leagues
Martavis Bryant, WR, Pittsburgh Steelers (63.8 percent owned)
Bryant was listed in this space earlier this season but earned some new life thanks to injuries and a suspension to Juju Smith-Schuster. Yet Bryant has yet to really take advantage of any of those recent opportunities. In the two games without Smith-Schuster, Bryant had a combined 10 catches for 73 yards and one touchdown. Not great, Bob. For the season, he's had just one game with more than 48 yards receiving. So just as I wrote weeks ago ... it's not happening for The Alien this year.
Ameer Abdullah, RB, Detroit Lions (86.7 percent owned)
Why do we do this to ourselves with Lions running backs? No one ever believed that any Lions running back was going to be a fantasy stud this year. But there's always a scenario in which one can convince themselves that maybe -- just maybe -- Ameer Abdullah could be a nice RB2 option. Spoiler alert: he wasn't. In actuality, Abdullah has been outscored by Theo Riddick and hasn't even posted 60 scrimmage yards since Week 4. It's okay, you don't have to lie to yourself anymore. Abdullah's just not gonna be that dude for you.
Amari Cooper, WR, Oakland Raiders (89.9 percent owned)
Remember that huge game Cooper had against the Chiefs on Thursday night? That was fun. That was also the only time he made a real impact in your fantasy lineup. Certainly his injury situation over the past couple of weeks hasn't helped anything. But even when Cooper was healthy, there wasn't much production to speak of. He had four games with fewer than 10 receiving yards. Four. Games. With. Fewer. Than. Ten. Yards. I feel like I need to just repeat that sentence a few more times. But I'm pretty sure my editors would just cut it out. Anyway, drop Amari Cooper.
Bilal Powell, RB, New York Jets (83 percent owned)
It's kinda funny that in a season where so many of the Jets players have exceeded our fantasy expectations that the one guy we thought could be a viable fantasy option has fallen on his fantasy face. The Jets haven't really been able to fully integrate Powell into the offense, in part because the team has insisted on using Matt Forte and Elijah McGuire as part of a three-man rotation. Now that we know Josh McCown is done for the season with a broken hand, we can probably officially close the book on Powell as well.
Corey Davis, WR, Tennessee Titans (58.2 percent owned)
A lot of the highly touted rookie receivers have left us high and dry this year. Davis began the year dealing with a nagging injury but even when he's been on the field, the results have been underwhelming. It's not all on Davis' shoulders, though. The Titans offense as a whole has been pretty uninspiring and the rookie wideout is feeling the effects of that. Regardless of whose fault it is, Davis hasn't been a productive fantasy option. Now isn't the time to wait for things to get better.

SB 1070 allowed officers in Arizona to arrest a person without a warrant if they believed the person had committed an offense that could lead to deportation. The law made it a crime for people in the country illegally to seek work, and required police to check the immigration status of people they suspect are in the country illegally when they are stopped for other reasons.
Sometimes on draft day, news breaks that forces you to think on your toes. This was certainly the case for the owners in our latest mock draft.
An hour before our start time, we received official word of Ezekiel Elliott's six-game suspension, as well as the trades of Sammy Watkins (to the Los Angeles Rams) and Jordan Matthews (to the Buffalo Bills). Quite an eventful day, one that made each of us reassess our draft boards on the fly.
For our fifth mock draft of this preseason, our ESPN fantasy football crew on this day -- comprised of fantasy writers and editors and NFL Nation writers -- went with a 12-team, non-PPR setup.
Editor's Picks Why you shouldn't pick your fantasy QB too early -- or too late Quarterbacks post huge point totals, but with so many to choose from, it can be easy to go all-in on a favorite or wait until the end. The secret to drafting passers in fantasy lies somewhere in the middle.
How far should suspend Elliott drop in fantasy drafts? Eric Karabell examines the value of Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott, noting this is not the same as when Le'Veon Bell was suspended. 1 Related A couple of weeks earlier, our analysts took part in a 12-team PPR draft, so it's worth comparing to see the many differences between the two drafts due to the difference in scoring setup -- it's always important to note those players whose values rise or fall when not using a point-per-reception system -- as well as any news that has come about since then.
The participants for this mock, in order of draft position, were Eric Karabell, Jordan Raanan, Leo Howell, Tristan H. Cockcroft, Dan Graziano, Mike Triplett, Keith Lipscomb, Michael Rothstein, Field Yates, Matt Bowen, KC Joyner and Jim McCormick.
You can see where Elliott, McFadden, Watkins and Matthews went below, but here are quick takeaways on them, as it relates to this mock:
• Elliott, who had been the third overall selection on average in ESPN live drafts (tied with Antonio Brown with an ADP of 3.9), fell to 28th overall to Cockcroft in this one. That may seem early to some, because of the fact that you'll have to stash him on your bench for more than a month, but Tristan offered this reasoned take on why he's well worth it at this point, including the possibility of his suspension being reduced:

"I can't tell you how many times I've had a draft within hours of breaking news. ... In instances like this, guesswork generally drives. For suspended players, I like to go with the old rule of thumb of 'player's new projected seasonal total plus X games of replacement-level performance.' So in this example, Elliott's six missed games drops his ESPN projection from 306.1 to 191.3, and in a 12-team non-PPR league, my historical estimates have a replacement-level player earning somewhere in the 6-8-point range per game. By the way, if you go with the value based drafting (VBD) angled replacement method of 31st-best player, that'd be a 10-point average, but I think seven is more realistic (meaning 42 total points from the replacement). That would result in a 233.3-point season for Elliott plus his replacement, which would put him right at the back end of the RB1 class, and in this mock he was the 13th player at the position off the board. The third round feels right, and I have no problem going with a piece-it-together strategy in his absence considering the strength of my quarterback and wide receivers. Plus, let's not discount the possibility of either an appeal delaying Elliott's suspension taking immediate effect, or shortening it."
• Watkins' value decreased slightly, maybe because of less confidence in his new quarterback, Jared Goff, as his ADP was 40.9 entering the draft, but he was selected 44th by Graziano, who had this to say about drafting the Rams' new No. 1 wideout:
"Wide receiver seemed deep at that point, and the two RBs I'd taken seemed kind of dull (Lamar Miller and Isaiah Crowell). I like Miller and Crowell, but not real high ceilings. I wanted a WR there and the other options were Jarvis Landry and Allen Robinson types. I felt like Watkins has superstar potential if healthy, and would give me two No. 1 WRs when he plays. I figured I could easily get WR2 insurance later, and did so with Emmanuel Sanders. I have spoken with a few sources this summer who are high on Watkins' health. It's a flier, but one with big upside. The Rams' WR depth chart doesn't throw a lot of roadblocks in his path."
• Matthews' move to the Bills was viewed as a positive in this mock, considering his role with the Eagles was in question. Yates selected Matthews 88th overall, nearly 40 spots higher than his ADP entering the draft (115.8). Since the No. 1 WR role is clearly up for grabs in Buffalo, and only rookie Zay Jones and veteran Anquan Boldin stand in the way, it was well worth it for Field to take a shot on Matthews, who will serve as a WR5 for his team. Of course, Matthews suffered a chip fracture in his sternum in his first practice with the Bills on Sunday -- after this mock draft was conducted -- and is "week to week," according to NFL Nation Bills reporter Mike Rodak.
Practice makes perfect, so take a few minutes and jump into an ESPN mock draft!
• Lastly, McFadden was taken by yours truly just two picks after Matthews in Round 8. This was all about the quality of the Cowboys' offensive line and the fact that I don't expect Run-DMC to be forced to split the workload much for the first six games of the season. At that point in the draft, I didn't think there was any other back available who was guaranteed to get six full games as the featured option (assuming good health, of course). I couldn't pass up the opportunity.
Note: This draft took place before the Jordan Matthews sternum injury and before Marqise Lee left Sunday's practice with a right leg injury. There was no official word on the severity of Lee's injury at the time of this story being published.

While Indian citizens settled in the United States grapple with President Donald Trump's visa restrictions, with the issue getting significant media attention, another country has been denying the right to live and work to its foreign working professionals and immigrants without much notice. The United Kingdom, over the past few months, has made certain changes to make it difficult for immigrants to obtain an Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) or a permanent residency status.
The rule as of now stands that, any foreign citizen can apply for permanent residency if he/she has completed a minimum of five years' lawful residency in the United Kingdom. However, according to the Hindustan Times, tax experts have noticed a pattern in the rejection of such requests by professionals from countries like India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.
As per the report, the Tier-1 (general) visa they used was discontinued in 2011 while former applicants were eligible to apply for ILR until April 2018 if they made up the required number of points on their application.
But, these "applications were turned down by home office caseworkers citing clause 322(5) of the UK Immigration Act, a discretionary rule aimed at denying convicted criminals and terrorists the right to live in the UK", the report states.
This rule was invoked by the UK government citing apparent differences in their declared earnings to the tax department and the home office, leading to a questioning of their "good character", another Hindustan Times report said.
This move led to over 30,000 people signing an online petition calling on the UK government to stop “abusing” a national security clause to deny hundreds of highly-skilled Indian professionals the right to live and work in the country.
Britain's home secretary Sajid Javid told a parliamentary committee earlier in May that he would “urgently” look into some of the cases of extreme hardship while an ongoing UK home office review into the cases is completed. “It is an important issue because if people are being turned down for their Tier-1 applications for the wrong reasons or for information not being looked at properly, it needs to be looked at properly. If it is a case of genuine error, then it should be taken into account,” Javid told the House of Commons home affairs select committee (HASC) on Tuesday. The government has also put on hold any deportations.
However, he was warned by cross-party members of HASC that these developments might eventually lead to another Windrush scandal. The Windrush scandal, as exposed by The Guardian, involved members of the Windrush generation and their children (63 migrants from the Carribean), who arrived in the UK from 1948 onwards, being wrongly targeted by the UK government's “hostile environment” policies designed to deter illegal immigrants. It led to many of them being rendered unable to claim welfare support, while others were wrongfully detained or even deported.
The scandal had resulted in the resignation of Javid's predecessor Amber Rudd in April 2018 for allegedly misleading the Parliament over the scale of the problem.
However, owing to the controversy, UK immigration minister Caroline Nokes had launched a review into the cases to distinguish between those involving “genuine fraud” and others that may have fallen victim to “overzealous” caseworkers. “A review into the specific HMRC (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs) related Tier-1 issue raised by the Chair was commissioned immediately following the minister's appearance at HASC and is ongoing,” a UK home office spokesperson was quoted a saying in The Hindustan Times report.
Immigrants denied permission to work amid staff shortage
Another startling revelation which has come post a poll conducted by YouGov on behalf of the UK campaign group '38 Degrees' is that the UK is denying overseas doctors and medical staff from countries like India to work in the country even as there is a shortage of staff in the state-funded National Health Service.
According to the poll, as many as 71 percent of the surveyed Britishers said that the UK should instead decide on visas for NHS staff "based on what the NHS needs" and to not follow the monthly quota cap on Tier-2 visas for skilled professionals while addressing the ongoing medical staffing crisis in the country.
The cap under the Tier-2 visa category to allow companies to bring in professionals from outside the European Union (EU) is set at 20,700 per year, with a monthly limit of around 1,600. Until December 2017, that limit had been exceeded only once in almost six years but since then that limit has been breached nearly every month.
According to a Times of India report, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association Council (BMA), called for a "more flexible immigration system which does not end up turning away doctors desperately needed to fill staff shortages in the NHS". "The Tier-2 visa quota has been reached for the fifth month in a row, yet there are still more than 1,00,000 NHS posts unfilled, with vacancy rates rising. At a time when the NHS is under enormous strain and struggling to fill positions, the current visa restrictions and arbitrary caps for non-EU workers entering the UK are inexplicable and threatening patient care and safety," he said.
"We as an organisation have supported the Health Education England (HEE) initiative to bring doctors in from India on a Lean and return basis, which addresses the acute shortage faced by the NHS. But the Home Office has been absolutely bureaucratic and are stopping these doctors from coming in," the report quoted Ramesh Mehta, president of the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (BAPIO) as saying. While experts warn that access to overseas professionals remains crucial for the growth and development of the UK economy.
Sarah O' Connor writes for The Financial Express, "A decent migration policy, for EU and non-EU workers, would recognise that a person's value to society is based on more than their wealth, or their salary. It would ditch fixed numerical targets, which lead to perverse outcomes. And it would reflect a truth that ministers seem to have forgotten: that skilled people have choices. The big danger for Britain on the eve of Brexit is that, as ministers debate hubristically which workers to allow in, the workers in question decide they would rather take their skills elsewhere".
Modi takes note
Meanwhile, due to the ongoing issue, Prime Minister Narendra Modi refused to sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Britain agreeing to facilitate the return of thousands of illegal Indian immigrants. Sources at the Indian High Commission in London told the Times of India, that the bilateral agreement on the return of illegal Indians, which junior home minister Kiren Rijiju had pencilled in January, was not signed in April when Modi visited London because India “did not see any progress on the British side of the agreement”.
The deal was supposed to be the centrepiece bilateral agreement signed during Modi's visit. According to the Times of India report, British prime minister Theresa May had told Modi in India in November 2017 that “the UK would consider further improvements to its visa offer if, at the same time, we can step up the speed and volume of returns of Indians with no right to remain in the UK”. However, according to Indian officials, "we are not seeing that" happen.
EXCLUSIVE
PEPSICO is allowing employees to swap out Australian public holidays based on the "Christian Anglo-Saxon calendar" for ones "more culturally relevant" to them such as Chinese New Year or Eid.
The trial concept, dubbed "floating cultural holidays", was first introduced last year as part of the company's broader diversity and inclusion drive, which this month saw the local arm recognised with a prestigious global award.
"We have around 45 nationalities in our Australia and New Zealand business, it's something that we're increasingly recognising, celebrating and trying to find new ways of creating broader awareness of cultural differences," said PepsiCo senior HR director Shiona Watson.
"What we've said to our employees is we recognise for the most part the Australian public holiday system is based on a Christian Anglo-Saxon calendar. We said we'll allow our employees some flexibility."
Ms Watson said some public holidays such as Christmas, Easter, Anzac Day and Australia Day were still non-negotiable.
"We've kept them for now," she said. "As with every program we'll stop and evaluate. We've just started with the Labour Day public holidays, Queen's Birthday and sporting holidays [such as] Melbourne Cup."
PepsiCo Australia senior HR director Shiona Watson.
Ms Watson was one of eight female employees and leaders from the local business who earlier this month received PepsiCo's Harvey C. Russell Inclusion award at a ceremony in New York, presented by CEO Indra Nooyi.
The award is named after PepsiCo's former vice president, who became the first African-American vice president of a major international corporation in 1962. The local team was recognised for its efforts in increasing female representation, pay equity and flexibility.
The winners, who all received an allocation of shares, included Ms Watson, culture, diversity and engagement lead Laura Sprules, and chief information officer Ursula Phillips, along with about 60 other global employees.
Ms Watson said as a result of efforts to increase female representation in "non-traditional functions", 60 per cent of the research and development team and 70 per cent of the sales leadership team were now women.
She said the supply chain was now an area of focus, with PepsiCo, like many Australian companies, struggling to attract and develop female talent in manufacturing.
Around 40 per cent of PepsiCo's 1800 local employees are women. Ms Watson said the goal was to have a 50-50 split at middle management level and above. By 2025, PepsiCo aims to have 50 per cent female senior leadership, up from 41 per cent today.
"This isn't about just focusing on hiring women, it's about focusing on hiring the best possible talent within the market, but creating environments where everyone has the capacity [to succeed]," she said.
Ms Watson said in terms of hiring mechanisms, there was "no silver bullet" when it came to boosting the number of women in a particular area.
PepsiCo global chairman and CEO Indra Nooyi.
"It's about making sure your frameworks and processes are not building in unconscious bias or over-indexing factors which are irrelevant," she said. "To be honest, there's nothing that we've had to specifically change. It's about making sure the way we language ads, the way we look at criteria on a resume, the way we ask questions in the interview process, to make sure you're not [introducing bias].
"From the entire team's perspective, we look at unconscious bias training, we talk about things that are inherent in our subconscious that we need to be aware of. That's one element. Another really important element is the culture you create - ensuring that we are creating flexibility for all and where we reward for performance, not gender."
Employees at PepsiCo now receive a market-leading 16 weeks paid parental leave, up from 12 weeks, and former CEO Robbert Rietbroek championed family-friendly flexible work policies. Ms Watson said Mr Rietbroek would also encourage people to apply for promotions.
"Without leadership support, flexibility remains words on paper," she said. "One of the things Robbert was very good at doing was saying, 'Actually if you look at the requirements of the role and our internal talent, I think two individuals actually meet that criteria. They haven't put their hand up for the role yet and I want to understand why.'
"It's about nurturing and developing your internal talent. Sometimes people just need the vote of confidence that says we believe you have the skills to do the role. It's just about opening that door and saying come on through."
The award recognised the team's efforts "working towards" 100 per cent pay equity, but Ms Watson said men and women were paid equally.
"I always say 'working towards' because it's about maintaining consistent vigilance," she said. "Someone gets promoted into a different level - it's not a static thing."
Ms Watson said PepsiCo considered diversity and inclusion not only a business imperative a "moral obligation".
"Having worked in a number of organisations, you feel the difference in this place," she said.
Luton defender Jack Stacey has urged his side to drive home their advantage at the top of League Two when they face Exeter at Kenilworth Road this afternoon.
Victory for the Hatters could put them 11 points clear at the summit after they wasted the opportunity to do so on Tuesday night, losing 3-2 at home to now second-placed Wycombe Wanderers.
A home win would also see Town move 12 ahead of today's opponents with 15 games to go, as Stacey said: “It was disappointing from Saturday (against Grimsby) doing so well with 10 men to keep a clean sheet and then going 1-0 down in the first minute, but we still believed the whole game we could get back into the game.
“Elliot (Lee) scored two great goals, and we had belief at half time that if we kept playing our way, we'd create chances.
"We did create chances, but none of them went into the back of the net for us.
“However, we need a bit of perspective too. We're still 10 points ahead of fourth, and we've got a great opportunity Saturday to push ourselves ahead of another team who in that pack behind us, so that's all we can look forward to now.”
Boss Nathan Jones was of a similar opinion too, as he wants his team to stop turning down the opportunity to forge an impressive lead.
He continued: “We've had chances and haven't taken them in the past, so it's a chance for us to get back on track first and foremost, as we want to get our performance level back on track.
"On Tuesday night, attacking-wise we were excellent, we really were, defensively we were poor, because we conceded from two counter attacks and they had a set-play too.
"Defensively, that's our biggest work. We've worked solidly on defending set-plays, we work solidly on defending the counter attack because we know we have a proactive structure, so that was the disappointing thing.
"But going forward I thought we were excellent, I thought we caused a good League Two side a lot of problems and the keeper was outstanding.
"The trouble was, every time we've had those (big games), at times we come out on the negative side of it.
"But in terms of performance levels, we're not in a bad place, it's just we need to tighten up and if we tightened up then it would have given us a better chance to win the game.”
Standing in their way is an Exeter side in excellent form themselves, winning three in a row to trail Luton by nine points with two games in hand.
Hatters won 4-1 at St James' Park back in October with a blistering 10-minute spell after half time, when they scored three times in 10 minutes.
Stacey, who played 38 games for the Grecians while on loan last season, added: “They were very good in the first 45, but in the end, our play, we created chances and ended up winning the game.
"We know it's going to be a test, as that first 45 is probably the best 45 we've played against this season, so it's going to be a good game.”
Hyundai Jungle Diaries – Exploring Kabini in the Creta
The second edition of the Hyundai Jungle Diaries sees us drive from Pune to Kabini and the Nagarhole national park. Here's a quick look at all that we witnessed there.

Another early morning saw us leave Pune for Karnataka and the Nagarhole National Park, also known as the Kabini Wildlife Reserve. The Creta was soon powering us along the highway and beyond. Just 50-odd kilometers we reached Kabini, a small off-road path led us to the riverside, and we even spotted a wild elephant in the distance! With our first sighting under our belt, it was time to continue and check in to our hotel for the night. The following morning it was time to take the safari and keep our fingers crossed in the hope that we see some amazing wildlife.
We didn't have to wait for too long for out first spotting – a majestic serpent eagle perched on a branch stared down its beak at us. In fact, there was a lot of birdlife on show, including the blue roller, the difficult to spot hoopoe, lapwings and more. We also saw more elephants, peacocks, peahens, deer and gaur on the safari.
The Creta was a breeze to drive around in, be it on the massive highway, or the back lanes leading to Kabini. The powerful 1.6-litre VTVT petrol engine and smooth six-speed automatic gearbox meant I could relax and thoroughly enjoy the drive.
This marks an end to part two of our Hyundai Jungle Diaries web series. We'll be putting up more episodes here, so watch this space. For a detailed account of our trip to Kabini, make sure to pick up the August Issue of Car India Magazine.

The image accompanied a brief story in the July 27, 1931, Los Angeles Times that reported:
Swooping down through a densely wooded section, Allen Russel, local pilot, made the first landing in the resort section of the high Sierras when he set his plane down at Pine Flat Meadows yesterday.
Russel, who is attached to the Trojan Flying Club of the United Airport, dropped into camp with a bundle of Los Angeles Sunday Times, at 7:30 o'clock in the morning, the first newspapers to be delivered by plane in the Sierras.
Another trip will be made to the resort by Russel in his Timm monoplane for the purposes of surveying the Myers Land Company high Sierras resort, El Capinero, so that additional space may be laid out for a permanent landing field for plane travel to and from Los Angeles.
The small community of Pine Flat is located in Tulare County 175 miles from Los Angeles. The Sierra mountain community is at 3,800 feet elevation.

NEW YORK-Delta Air Lines has increased the maximum possible payout to passengers to nearly $10,000 if they voluntarily give up a seat on an overbooked flight, the company told AFP Monday.
The boost is part of the airline industry's response to the global outrage sparked by last week's violent removal of a customer from a United Airlines Chicago flight after he resisted being “bumped” by the carrier.
Delta customer service employees will be permitted to offer up to $2,000 in these cases, up from the prior cap of $800. Supervisors will be able to grant up to $9,950, up from the prior limit of $1,350. The increases came after United came under fire after it called security officers to forcibly remove passenger David Dao from an overbooked flight in order to seat crew members for another flight. Video of the episode went viral, sparking calls for greater scrutiny of airlines from politicians. United, which is undertaking an audit of its practices, already amended some policies, saying it will require employees to be booked at least 60 minutes prior to departure. United evicted Dao and three other passengers from the flight to make room for employees.
The incident shined a new light on the practice of overbooking, which airlines increasingly rely upon to avoid losing money on seats left when some passengers do not show up for scheduled flights.
Delta has described overbooking as a necessary industry practice, in part because of weather uncertainty, and said the process can be managed effectively.

A Kelowna mother and her son were splattered in falling feces as it covered their car and came through the sunroof
A Kelowna woman has conjunctivitis in both eyes, a hefty car detailing bill to pay and a lot of anger after being splattered with feces that fell from the sky.
Susan Allan was in the car with her son in the early afternoon of May 9. She was stopped at the street lights on Spall Road and Bernard Avenue when an unwelcome deluge covered her car and came through the open sunroof.
“We were parked at the lights when the ‘sky poop' starting falling,” said Allan. “It got all over my car, it got all over (me) and got on my son, inside my vehicle. It was definitely falling from the sky.”
When they looked up they saw the bottom of an airplane as it flew overhead.
“It was just very wet and smelled terrible. I can't really describe the feeling … it was almost like chunks of mud falling from the sky hitting you in the face,” said Allan.
“My son said that the sensation he got was a cold feeling as it hit his face, then the smell was overwhelming for him and he almost got sick as it was hitting his face.”
They got out of their car and a woman nearby pointed the plane out to them.
“I mean we were covered in it, our vehicle and their vehicle was also hit with the same poop,” said Allan.
That “sky poop” sent Allan to her doctor's office out of fear of infection or catching something worse. Her doctor's note shows that she was diagnosed with conjunctivitis in both eyes as a result of “…being inundated with sewerage from an overhead plane, while driving her car.”

Transport Canada states that it takes all reports of possible debris coming from aircraft very seriously.
“Transport Canada is aware of the incident you describe and we are looking into it,” said spokesperson Daniel Savoie
“Each air operator is responsible for ensuring that their aircraft operate safely and in compliance with the Canadian Aviation Regulations. Section 602.23, ‘Dropping of Objects', states “No person shall create a hazard to persons or property on the surface by dropping an object from an aircraft in flight.” Any operator found to be in contravention of the Canadian Aviation Regulations will be subject to enforcement action under Transport Canada's mandate.”
As for Allan, she said she waited until this week to alert the media as she has hoped the airport would make it right, but after weeks of no reply she reached out to the media.
“I reported it to them hoping the airport would deal with me without having to go through the news to stop the embarrassment for both of us, but it didn't turn out that way so I had to go to the news.”
She claims she has been getting mixed messaging from authorities
“I was told that there were three planes that flew over that area at that time, then I was told that there was one plane that flew over that area at that time and now all of a sudden no plane flew over the area at that time,” said Allan. “I believe that the airport should take responsibility for what happened to me and my son, maybe clean out my car and compensate for the infection that I got in my eyes.
“I believe that they owe me an apology for both making me feel like I did something wrong by reporting it, and for it happening in the first place.”
The Kelowna International Airport has not yet replied to a request for comment.

Not so very long ago, cricket reporters went to work on days featuring India-Bangladesh games with a sense of overwhelming ennui. ‘Oh god not another one of those – what is there to write?!' used to be the plaintive wail of those who found the game on their duty roster.
Not to disrespect Bangladesh, but what the hell was there to write, anyway? For the most part, games between the two sides were occasions for off-colour Indian batsmen to fill their boots and puff up their CVs while earning some easy points to move up the rankings ladder. The most you could hope for was a blue-moon result, an upset that allowed you to get all gooey and patronizing about underdogs and Robert Bruce and all that guff.
Not anymore. Bangladesh ranks alongside England as one of the most improved teams over the last two years and more – and where England has earned its chops through all-out aggression, the sub-continental team has rid itself of the easy-beats tag with all-round skill and attitude, with discipline when it matters and resilience when it is called for and above all, with the calm certitude that they belong at this level.
This was best exemplified the other day in the game against New Zealand. In that game Bangladesh, punching way above its prescribed weight, bowled to plans and fielded with panache to restrict the Kiwis to 265, saw the top half of its batting sliced away by the incisive pace of Trent Boult and Tim Southee, and still won with 16 balls and five wickets to spare thanks to the composure of Shakib al-Hasan and Mahmudullah. That is how champions, even putative ones, play – with the knowledge that no game is lost in the field that is not already lost in the mind.
There is much about this Bangladesh outfit that reminds you of the Indian team that stunned the world – and, inadvertently, triggered a tectonic shift in the cricketing power centre – back in 1983. And in that sense, just as India announced itself with the win over West Indies in the lead up to that World Cup, the real Bangladesh turn-around began with its 2-1 defeat of South Africa back in 2015 – the fourth in a sequence of bilateral wins that began with Zimbabwe and included Pakistan and India. It is easy to dismiss those results as having come on home soil, but “We gained self-respect by beating those sorts of teams,” Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza pointed out in the pre-match press conference. That self-respect has in turn enabled them to trust themselves, to formulate plans for success rather than just show up to be rolled over.
Throughout this latest appearance on the world stage, they have had their bowling, led by a pace quartet with serious chops, lauded in song. Cricinfo recently carried a full-length feature on how Mortaza and coach Chandika Hathurusingha rebelled against internal typecasting and willing into being an emphasis on quality pace. What has gone relatively unsung is the fact that their batting unit has developed steel and character, to the point where it is now capable of holding its own against the best in the world.
The record tells the tale. Bangladesh batsmen have notched up three of the eight centuries recorded thus far in this edition of the Champions' Trophy. England has two, no other team has more than one. They have also notched up the two highest partnerships in the tournament thus far – and the quality of the partnerships, by Tamim Iqbal and Mushfiqur Rahim (166) against England and the one between Shakib al-Hasan and Mahmudullah (224) the other day against New Zealand tell their own story.
“We never give up,” Mortaza said in that presser, underlining the single fundamental change in the team make-up. “And once you have played at your best, you know how well you can play, and then things can change. I know, on our day, we can do anything.”
That's it, right there. And it encapsulates the chicken-and-egg paradox of sport: you have to win, you have to internalize the feel of victory, before you learn how to win (again, think of the differences between India '79 and '83). Bangladesh in recent times has tasted victories; they have tested their strengths and duct-taped their weaknesses, and now they have a lean and hungry look about them. “Such men”, Julius Caesar famously ventriloquized Shakespeare, “are dangerous.”

FEBRUARY 14, 2017 — Riviera Beach, FL, headquartered Tropical Shipping, a Saltchuk subsidiary, has ordered a series of MAN propulsion packages in China to complement an expansion of its vessel fleet.
With a current fleet of 15 vessels, Tropical Shipping has operated its freight-shipping service between Canada/South Florida and the Caribbean and the Bahamas for over a half century. The company delivers comprehensive cargo-transportation services, including dry, refrigerated, and less than container load.
Tropical has four 1,100 TEU containerships and two 300 TEU containerships on order at Chinese shipyards.
The four 1,100 TEU vessels are each equipped with an MAN B&W 6S60ME-C8.5 main engine, complete with TCA66-21 turbocharger and an SCR (Selective Catalytic Reduction) module to achieve Tier III compliance.
SCR unit is fitted to achieve Tier III compliance
The propulsion package also features three MAN 6L23/30 Holeby GenSets with MAN TCR14 turbochargers, as well as the latest generation of CP propellers, the VBS1550-5 Mk5, which is a five-bladed design combined with the MAN Alpha rudder-bulb concept.
The two 300 TEU vessels are each powered by one MAN 27/38 engines, with TCR turbochargers.
The new vessels are due to enter service from June 2018 on.
Bjarne Foldager, Vice President – Promotion & Sales, Two-Stroke Business – MAN Diesel & Turbo, said: "The marine market is currently very challenging but, in winning orders like this, we see some green shoots of recovery. Tropical Shipping has chosen to expand its fleet with proven technology from our portfolio and I am confident they will be served well by it."
The ME-C engine
MAN Diesel & Turbo initially introduced electronic, fuel injection control on its large bore, ME-C engines, which are a more compact form of their ME-B counterparts. The ME-C range's electronic controls are characterized by:
fully integrated electronic control
low SFOC
superior performance parameters
appropriate fuel injection pressure and rate shaping at any load
improved emission characteristics
smokeless operation at any load
lower NOx on command.
These advantages are gained by the use of variable, electronically-controlled timing of fuel injection and exhaust valves during operation.
Additionally, all software and hardware are upgradable for the lifetime of the engine.
The MAN 23/30 GenSet
The 23/30 engine is one of MAN Diesel & Turbo's most successful workhorses, and has a half-century history of operational stability with over 12,000 sales to date.
The engine is popular with shipowners for its reliability and "forgiving" service demands. Applications for the engine include tankers, bulk carriers and product tankers as auxiliary engines.
The engine is mostly HFO-driven with gas and marine oil also used in special environmental areas. The 23/30 engine is optimized for part-load operation, typically at 40-65%, and features an mep that is < 20 bar. As a result, the engine experiences reduced operative stress – compared to its competitors – meaning a decreased demand for spare parts and significantly reduced running costs over its lifetime.

One of the hottest tickets in the property calendar takes place tomorrow (Sunday, October 8), as the Open Eco Homes event sees some of Cambridge's most desired eco-friendly homes open their doors to the public.
Both innovative new developments and renovated homes will be open for tours to interested homeowners across Cambridge, Girton and Impington, with some of the most desired homes already fully booked up to tours from eager buyers.
Thirteen properties in Cambridge will be opened in total over the next two weekends - including the brand new Cambridge Mosque, the first eco-friendly mosque in Europe.
Organiser Allan Shepherd says: “What people get from an Open Eco Home tour is inspiration and good advice from people who have already done it.
“As well as the tour, we make a guide for each home so people get the details of relevant contractors, technologies and techniques for creating the home they want."
If you've missed out on an opportunity to view any of these homes tomorrow, don't worry: more tours are open for booking next Saturday (October 14) for the second Open Eco Homes event.
Here's our rundown of the best homes opening their doors to the public tomorrow. Some of these are already fully booked out- but we're making sure you won't miss out.
Macfarlane Close, Impington
Originally built in 1962, this retrofitted home has been renovated over recent years by the current owners Shaun and Fran, who bought the house in 2011. Tours to this home are now fully booked tomorrow, but it's still worth mentioning due to the extensive renovation project undertaken to modernise this home.
The pair removed and rebuilt internals walls and floors, which made a significant difference. Electric usage was consequently reduced, while improvements extended to outside too, where there is now more parking space.
The whole house is now insulated, with very low heating demand due to newly installed mechanical ventilation and heat recovery extract units. Just cooking at the house now provides enough heat for the entire property!
Pease House, Girton
This home in Girton was the creation of self-builders Nick and Kate, who wanted to use the opportunity to reduce their environmental impact through both the design and the materials utilised.
The pair spent approximately a year working with AC Architects planning the project, researching available products and creating accurate drawings for a design specification document.
The overall building cost was £350,000, and it was completed back in June 2012. The home is oriented and designed to benefit from solar gain, with key features including structurally insulated panels, rainwater harvesting features and to top it all off, a Renault Zoe electric car.
St Margaret's Road, Girton
Built back in 1930, homeowners Jenny and Stephen retrofitted their home with energy efficient features such as a Ventive passive ventilation and heat recovery system. However, the renovation was not an eco project- in fact, they just wanted to improve the energy efficiency of their home, due to the very low efficiency of the original design.
The pair carried out the work in two phases. Firstly, in 2014, they extended the kitchen, added a second storey bathroom and fitted underfloor heating. A year later, they replaced and insulated the roof, installed the Ventive system and added internal insulation.
Chesteron Road, Cambridge
The oldest property opening its doors as part of Open Eco Homes dates back to 1896. Back in 2009, owners Nicola and Arthur replaced a former shopfront with a modern two storey bay windows, before insulating the "envelope" of the house with wall, floor and loft insulation.
The renovation didn't just stick to energy efficient features, as two new shower rooms were added. However, due to the addition of solar thermal panels, hot water is provided for both rooms in an energy efficient manner- with heat recovery ventilation installed for the property too.
Due to the enormous demand for this event, this is the only property listed here you can still book to see. A full list of all available properties can be found on the Open Eco Homes website.
Silverwood Close, Cambridge
After moving into this 1930s end of terrace home back in 2001, homeowner Patrick knew something needed to be done. During winter, it was freezing, even with the boiler running full blast.
Since then, the house has been fitted with insulation in the loft, as well as cavity and external wall insulation. There is also underfloor heating, as well as two different types of mechanical ventilation and heat recovery in two different rooms, which help keep the air warm inside the home.
St Barnabas Road, Cambridge
This new build property was created alongside architects Nilsson Pflugfelder, with advice from Baufritz UK- the sponsors of the eco homes event.
The materials used were consciously chosen for personal and planetary health: no MDF or PVC was used, while there are no toxins in the paints and glues. The property has no carpets, using wooden flooring throughout - with the only thing stopping this from being a fully "vegan home" being the use of whey (a by-product of the dairy industry) in the wood fibre wall insulation.

Los Angeles County's office market has been expanding and rents have been rising for years — and thanks to companies like Netflix, that dynamic continued in the first quarter.
The Los Gatos, Calif., movie-streaming company is taking all the space of a large Hollywood building that opened its doors in the beginning of the year.
Terms of the lease with developer Hudson Pacific Properties for the 323,000-square-foot Icon building were not disclosed, but landlords typically ask for about $5.50 a square foot in monthly rent for new Hollywood offices, well above the county-wide rate.
That rate hit an average of $3.13 per square foot a month in the first quarter, up from $3.03 in the prior quarter and $3 in the same period a year earlier, according to real estate brokerage CBRE Group Inc.
Rents have been rising since 2013 and some observers expect the market to cool, but Petra Durnin, CBRE's director of research and analysis, said landlords remain in the driver's seat.
“The market is still healthy,” she said. “I know the sentiment out there is that things are slowing down, but we still see quite a bit of road ahead of us in the market.”
New jobs are still being created in the region, albeit at a tepid pace. That means “there is room for a little rent growth and for vacancy to come down a bit more,” Durnin said.
New office construction grew the market by nearly 750,000 square feet last quarter, a jump from the 100,000 square feet delivered in the previous quarter and 460,000 square feet a year earlier. There are now about 205 million square feet of offices in Los Angeles County, according to CBRE.
Overall vacancy was 14.1% in the first quarter, a rise from 12.8% at the end of 2016 but down slightly from 14.8% a year ago.

Middleton Grange is going green.
The shopping centre's ‘Grow Your Own' campaign is designed to get local families passionate about healthy eating.
We hope we will encourage more people into the garden as well as taking the time to consider what they're actually eating. Mark Rycraft
From 11am until 3pm today and tomorrow, the centre will be welcoming shoppers to visit its specially-created indoor allotment where there will be a variety of different vegetables and fruit on display.
Throughout the event, customers will be encouraged by dedicated Middleton Grange gardeners to take part in a variety of gardening games.
They will include a healthy eating trail hunt around the centre, where participants will look for hidden food facts and items of fresh fruit and vegetables.
Children who take part will also receive their very own Grow Your Own kit, which will include a selection of seeds as well as basic tools to help get them started at home.
And its spades at the ready for participants, who will be able to dig deep to win some top prizes, with several golden tipped carrots waiting to be unearthed.
Centre manager Mark Rycraft, Middleton Grange Shopping Centre manager, said: “We hope we will encourage more people into the garden as well as taking the time to consider what they're actually eating.
“Our Growth Your Own kits will also provide a fun yet educational way for little ones to learn the process of how these essential food groups go from the soil to our plates.”
A Hartlepool primary school has beeing given the go-ahead to expand to cope with increased pupil numbers.
Clavering Primary School is set to extend its school hall, which also doubles as the dining room, and a classroom, after seeing its numbers go up by 60% since it opened.
The school has received a number of previous approvals to allow the premises to be extended over the years to keep up with growing demand from families.
Headteacher Helen O'Brien said: “Clavering Primary School was originally built for 250 pupils.
“As the town's population size has increased and more and more families are wanting their children to be educated at Clavering, we now have over 400 pupils.
“Extending the school; building new and reshaping current classrooms; and increasing the size of our school hall, which doubles up as our dining hall, are all vital to continue to provide the outstanding offer that we believe Clavering pupils enjoy.”
Two letters of objection from local residents were sent to the council for the latest application.
They were concerned that the extensions would cause additional loss of light to their homes, and the addition of flat roofs would lead to increased noise, mess and annoyance from nesting gulls.
The extensions were given unanimous backing from Hartlepool Borough Council's Planning Committee.
A council report stated: “The extensions are considered to be in keeping with the existing design of the school.
“They will individually appear as very modest and subservient additions when viewed in the context of the host building as a whole.”
It added: “It is not envisaged that the extensions will adversely affect the level of light currently received by the surrounding properties despite concerns to the contrary.
“They will stand almost 40 metres away from the nearest adjoining dwelling with, in the case of the dining hall extension, a building and a substantial hedge in between.”
PARIS — A young American man tried an underhand serve while cramping during a five-setter at the French Open. Hmm. Seen that before, haven't we?
Except there was one key difference this time: For 21-year-old Jared Donaldson against No. 4-seed Grigor Dimitrov on Wednesday, unlike for 17-year-old — and eventual tournament champion — Michael Chang against Ivan Lendl in 1989, the unorthodox strategy didn't come in a victory.
Dimitrov came back to beat the 57th-ranked Donaldson 6-7 (2), 6-4, 4-6, 6-4, 10-8 in a second-round match that lasted 4 hours, 19 minutes on the new Court 18 at Roland Garros. The most memorable aspect was Donaldson's two unusual service motions; he won the point the first time, but not the other.
"I would never try it if I was feeling 100 per cent and stuff," said Donaldson, who could barely move by the end because of painful cramps in his legs. "But obviously Grigor was playing so far back on the return that I felt like, 'You know, maybe it's just something that I'll try.' He obviously wasn't expecting it, you know what I mean? It's kind of a cheeky way to get a point."
Donaldson said he has never seen footage of what Chang did 29 years ago. He did, however, know of the episode: Chang used an underhand serve while cramping during a fourth-round win over Lendl on the way to the French Open title; he remains the youngest man to win a major singles championship.
Dimitrov was not angered by the tactic.
Quite the opposite, actually, shrugging his shoulders and conceding it was smart for Donaldson to try it.
"It was beautiful, right?" Dimitrov said. "He wanted to use something different to kind of try to put me off guard."
Before his first underhand attempt, Donaldson was actually two points from the victory, leading 6-5 in the fifth set and at love-30 on Dimitrov's serve. But Dimitrov took the next four points.
In the next game, at 6-all, 40-30, Donaldson successfully used the underhand motion. He hit a short serve that two-time Grand Slam semifinalist Dimitrov returned long to allow Donaldson to hold.
Former Ole Miss quarterback Shea Patterson announced Monday on Twitter that he plans to transfer to Michigan.
Patterson could potentially be eligible to play for the Wolverines this fall due to the NCAA sanctions currently facing his old program. The NCAA said players heading into their senior season with the Rebels would be free to transfer without penalty when the governing body ruled to ban Ole Miss from postseason play next season.
Editor's Picks NCAA hits Ole Miss, Freeze with penalties The NCAA came down hard on the Ole Miss football program for lack of institutional control, penalizing the Rebels with a second bowl ban and additional scholarship restrictions.
Patterson, who will be a junior in 2018, will have to apply for an individual waiver from the NCAA to avoid sitting out a year in Ann Arbor.
Patterson was born in Toledo, Ohio, an hour south of Michigan's campus. He and several of his former teammates visited the Ann Arbor campus this past weekend. He publicly announced his decision to transfer Monday.
The former No. 1 quarterback recruit in the country, Patterson threw for 2,259 yards and 17 touchdowns in seven games this past fall before suffering a season-ending leg injury in late October.
If eligible, Patterson is expected to compete for the starting job in 2018. He joins a quarterback group that includes redshirt freshman Brandon Peters and freshman Dylan McCaffrey.
Peters started three games late in the season for Michigan, passing for four touchdowns and 486 yards before a head injury sidelined him for the last week of the regular season. McCaffrey is a former five-star prospect and younger brother of first-round draft pick Christian McCaffrey. He did not play as a true freshman in 2017.
If Patterson can compete for playing time in 2018, it will mark the fourth time in Jim Harbaugh's four seasons as a head coach at his alma mater that he holds a quarterback competition in the offseason. Peters competed with Wilton Speight, who plans to transfer this winter, and redshirt senior John O'Korn a year ago.
O'Korn and former starter Jake Rudock are both players who transferred to Michigan during Harbaugh's tenure after starting elsewhere in their college careers.
Kabul: According to the information given by the official, minimum of 25 Taliban militants lost their lives while as many as 10 got wounded as fighting for the control of Mirza Olang district in Afghanistan continued on Monday.
“Some strategic areas have been re-taken in Mirza Olang and mop-up operations backed by air fire continue,” military official said.
According to the official, Taliban district chief Mawlavi Amrullah was among those killed.
Both the Taliban and the Islamic State in a coordinated operation last week overran Mirza Olang district, killing over 50 civilians and forcing hundreds to flee their houses for safer places.
Meanwhile, 19 militants were killed and eight injured when government aircraft targeted Taliban hideouts in Aqcha district.
Taliban militants who have intensified activities and gained ground in Jawzjan and neighbouring Faryab and Saripul provinces are yet to comment on the situation in the region.

ACCA women members from Lahore attended a learning session at the Punjab Commission on the Status of Women Thursday where they heard from the Chairperson Fauzia Viqar. At the occasion, Ms. Viqar stated that since PCSW was established in 2014, various endeavours have been taken to support women's economic empowerment, including inter aliaskills development opportunities and residence for survivors of violence, and a vibrant 24/7 helpline to address women's legal and other queries. PCSW's Leadership Initiative recruits dynamic women Executives from the private sector, and recommends them for placement on Boards of public entities in Punjab, to improve diversity of thought and innovation in the public sector. Establishment of an Economic Incubator and Employment Facilitation Hub are also in the pipeline.
Also speaking at the event was Haroon Jan Regional Head of Member Affairs “even though over 50% of our total global membership are women, in Pakistan we do lag far behind. Professional finance roles are a perfect career choice for women in the 21st century due to the technological advances and flexibility in work. More and more employers need to invest in human capital as well as social and relationship capital to ensure they have the right gender equity. I hope this collaboration with PCSW means that our members, both men and women can play a constructive role for empowering women in Punjab.”
According to ACCA's report Building a Better Business Through Finance Diversity “As businesses become more global, teams comprising individuals with a wide range of experiences are better placed to support the business.
St Vincent and the Grenadines Argyle International Airport was officially opened on Monday evening with a flag-raising ceremony in which Prime Minister Dr Ralph Gonsalves said that the facility is “a symbol, it is a metaphor of what is possible in us.”
“Do not ever allow any people, any nation to impose on us limitations to our imagination,” he told the large crowd that turned out to the opening of the EC$700 million (US$259 million) facility, six years behind schedule.
“Only we, as a self-governing people under God, with our own individual sense of being; only we must impose limitations on ourselves. Any other notion is a colonial one, and it is debilitating and it will hold us back,” said Gonsalves, who in 2005 announced his administration's plan to build an international airport at Argyle, on the eastern side of the island.

(Reuters) - West Ham United midfielder's Joao Mario's instant impact has impressed goalkeeper Adrian, who believes the new signing must persist with his attacking approach when they travel to Brighton and Hove Albion in the Premier League on Saturday.
Portugal international Mario, who arrived on loan from Inter Milan in the January transfer window, impressed on his debut as a depleted West Ham's drew 1-1 with Crystal Palace in midweek.
“It was a magnificent performance from Joao, considering he has just come to the Premier League and this was the first time he had played at this different tempo and intensity,” Adrian told the club's website (www.whufc.com).
“He played a great 90 minutes, was always sharp, was always trying to go forward and sharp with his passing and dribbling. He played really well and he has to keep going in this way.”
Mario, 25, linked up well with Mexico striker Javier Hernandez in a move that led to a penalty that midfielder Mark Noble converted to equalise against Palace.
“Chicharito did a really good job for us,” Adrian added. “Football is like life. Sometimes you have good moments and sometimes you have less good moments but now he has his chance and he is showing us he is a great striker and helping us.”
West Ham were without 10 first team players against Palace, including influential forward Marko Arnautovic and midfielder Manuel Lanzini.
The 12th-placed West Ham will welcome back defenders Winston Reid and Jose Fonte for the trip to Brighton, who are 15th.

Here's where it's cheaper to take an Uber than to own a car
Ride-sharing companies have long touted the cost benefits of their platforms. Well, depending on the city, it can be cheaper on a weekly basis to take an UberX or UberPOOL than it is to own a personal car, according to Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers partner Mary Meeker's 2018 annual internet trends report.
In four of the five largest cities in the U.S., it is indeed cheaper to rely on Uber than it is to own a car. Meeker's analysis took into account cost of gas, car insurance, maintenance and parking.
So, if you live in New York City, Chicago, Washington, D.C. or Los Angeles, it's cheaper to take an Uber. But that's not the case in Dallas, where the average weekly cost of car ownership is $65 compared to the average weekly Uber cost of $181.
Meeker's report also looked at the rise of on-demand workers in the U.S. Last year, there were 5.4 million on-demand workers in the country. This year, there are an estimated 6.8 million people working in the on-demand economy.
“These are big numbers,” Meeker said onstage, noting how these types of jobs are helping to supplement income for people, provide greater flexibility and improve work-life balance.

Enbridge Inc. has signed a deal to sell its Canadian natural gas gathering and processing business in the Montney, Peace River Arch, Horn River and Liard basins in B.C. and Alberta to Brookfield Infrastructure and its partners for $4.31 billion.
“This investment represents an exciting opportunity to invest in scale in one of North America's leading gas gathering and processing businesses based in Western Canada,” Brookfield Infrastructure CEO Sam Pollock said in a statement Wednesday.
“The business is strategically positioned for the continued development of the prolific Montney Basin.”

The midstream assets include 19 natural gas processing plants and liquids handling facilities, with a total operating capacity of 3.3 billion cubic feet per day and 3,550 kilometres of natural gas gathering pipelines.
Enbridge has been selling non-core assets in an effort to reduce debt.
Chief executive Al Monaco says with $7.5 billion in deals announced this year the company has more than doubled its initial target of $3 billion.

In May, Enbridge signed a $1.75-billion agreement with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board to sell a 49 per cent stake in most of its wind and solar power assets and a $1.44-billion deal to sell Midcoast Operating LP to an affiliate of private equity firm ArcLight Capital Partners LLC.
Enbridge says it will continue to hold its long-haul regulated natural gas transmission assets which include the Westcoast transmission system in British Columbia and the Alliance pipeline that carries natural gas from Western Canada to the Chicago market.

The deal, which is subject to a number of customary conditions, is expected to close in two phases, with the facilities subject to provincial regulation expected to close this year and those under federal rules anticipated to close in mid-2019.
While holding that Delhi is not a state, the Supreme Court on Wednesday limited the ambit of the lieutenant-governor's powers.
The constitutional position of Delhi has been cloaked in a badly-drafted provision under Article 239AA. It states that Delhi is still a Union Territory, but with a special status, and will be known as the National Capital Territory (NCT). It will also have a state Assembly, to which the people will elect representatives.
Before the central government, in 1991, added Article 239AA to the Constitution through the 69th amendment, Delhi was like any other Union Territory in India. The constitutional provision is self-contradictory — on one hand, it holds that Delhi is a Union Territory, but then it states that it will also have elected representatives of its own.
The essence of a representative democracy is that the elected representatives, not nominated individuals, should exercise the executive power. In this case, the elected government in Delhi is of the Aam Aadmi Party, whereas the lieutenant-governor is a central government nominee. Even though the Centre is also an elected government, a body of directly-elected representatives should be able to exercise the executive powers in Delhi.
On Wednesday, the Supreme Court broadly stuck to this principle and pronounced a judgment that is good in law. When it comes to a constitutional provision like Article 239AA, the only way to interpret it correctly would be the way the Supreme Court did in its final verdict. In three different judgments, the top court upheld the principle of "aid and advice" and its supremacy. Justice DY Chandrachud, one of the five judges who heard the case, emphasised constitutional morality and the need for it while interpreting the Constitution.
There is no disagreeing that any legal document — be it the Constitution or any other statute — should be interpreted in the spirit with which it was framed.
Now, there is a broader question that needs addressing: What should be Delhi's constitutional position? Laws only reflect the policies the governments of the day adopt. The matter of Delhi's statehood was also a policy decision compelled by the political situations of the day. As hybrid structures in constitutional schemes have failed historically, policy-makers should opt for conventionally-recognised structures of governance. This means that Delhi should either be granted full statehood, or it should remain a Union Territory like any other.
A Union Territory with an elected government does not make any sense. If there are no powers vested in the elected representatives, and a nominated authority in the form of an L-G can override the elected representatives at will, it is bad in law.
Article 239AA(3) explicitly mentions the limitations of the Delhi government with respect to three subjects — public order, police and land. But Article 239AA(4) adds a proviso that the matter should be referred to the President of India when there is doubt about whether it falls under the purview of the Council of Ministers or the lieutenant-governor, which in turn means that the central government will take the final call. The provision effectively gives the Centre the power to run Delhi.
This constitutional anomaly was drawn from the recommendations of the Balakrishnan Committee, which had suggested granting Delhi statehood but with limits. This, I believe, was not the right recommendation to make, and that Delhi was just fine being a Union Territory. Today, residents of Delhi have an elected municipality, an elected state government and elected members of parliament. This resulted in populism, which peaked with the AAP's election to power.
At the end of the day, Delhi is just a metropolitan city that does not deserve to be a state. If Delhi is granted statehood, or is even made a state with limited powers and an elected government, why shouldn't Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai or Hyderabad be given the same status?
Mumbai contributes 7 percent to India's gross domestic product and 33 percent to the taxes collected in the country. It certainly makes a better case to be a state. Being the seat of power does not give Delhi special reason to be a state, or even a special Union Territory. In fact, this makes a better case to give Delhi the status of an even stronger Union Territory.
It should be understood that Delhi's limited statehood was a political decision enacted through a badly-drafted constitutional provision, and it should be corrected by a political decision by the central government. Delhi's limited statehood should, therefore, be dissolved.

Ford Mustangs are tough to ignore. Thanks to a healthy rivalry with the Chevrolet Camaro and monthly sales that always number in the thousands—not the hundreds—the Mustang has survived through six generations. The muscle car's appeal goes beyond the allure of an available eight-cylinder engine at a somewhat affordable price. It's also the bold styling. And since the sixth generation made its debut for the 2015 model year, Motor Trend has thoroughly covered the Mustang with reviews and comparison tests. Check out some of them below, along with Mustang photos you won't find anywhere else.

Choi Soon-sil, a close friend of President Park Geun-hye (Yonhap)
An independent counsel looking into the corruption scandal involving President Park Geun-hye said Wednesday that Park and her confidante Choi Soon-sil made hundreds of phone calls while Choi was on the run in Germany amid the spiraling corruption scandal.The independent counsel said that President Park and Choi had some 570 calls using phones registered under borrowed names from April to late October in 2016, with the last phone conversation made on Oct. 26 a few days before Choi's return to Korea to face the prosecutorial probe.“President Park had 127 calls with Choi while Choi was in Germany (from September to October),” lawyers for the counsel team said at the court, saying that a search of the presidential office was necessary to obtain the evidence.The revelation came as the Seoul Administrative Court held a hearing on the counsel team's request to suspend and cancel the presidential aides' disapproval of a search and seizure operation on the presidential compound.The “burner” phones respectively used by President Park and Choi were registered by Yoon Jeon-choo, a Cheong Wa Dae staffer, on the same day, the lawyers said. Choi was staying in Germany to avoid public scrutiny after the scandal surfaced in late October.Earlier last month, former presidential aide Jeong Ho-seong admitted that President Park had used a phone under a borrowed name for security reasons and he personally had paid for it, during Park's impeachment trial.“It is certain the material to prove it is in the presidential compound. If the search is blocked, it poses a great difficulty to the investigation to finding the truth about the corruption scandal,” the team said.The independent counsel filed a lawsuit with the Seoul Administrative Court on Friday after presidential aides denied the team's entry into the presidential compound, citing security reasons.Two focal points are whether the counsel team has the legal mandate to file a suit against another government body to invalidate an administrative action and whether the search is in the national interest.Under Korean law, searching top security sites with state secrets requires approval from the person in charge of the location. But the law prohibits the person from stopping the search unless it undermines the national interest.The ruling is expected Thursday at the earliest, given the court-issued search warrant is valid until Feb. 28 and the deadline for the investigation also ends on the same day.If their request is dismissed, it is “impossible” to execute the search warrant on the presidential office, the counsel team had earlier said.The counsel team has been investigating Park's involvement in extorting donations from local firms for the K-Sports and Mir foundations, creating a blacklist of left-wing cultural figures and Choi's meddling in state affairs -- key reasons behind Park's impeachment.The lawsuit increases pressure on the presidential office amid the continued deadlock between President Park and the counsel team over its plan to question Park face-to-face.Park's lawyers and the counsel team are allegedly in the process of discussing the timing and location for the questioning. Park earlier called off the planned interrogation, accusing the team of leaking information to the media.The counsel team appears to have made another last-ditch effort to prove Park's involvement in the scandal by requesting an arrest warrant for Samsung Group's de facto chief Lee Jae-yong for the second time a day earlier.Lee is suspected of offering donations to the K-Sports and Mir foundations, both allegedly under Choi's control, in return for the Park administration's backing of its merger of two affiliates.By Ock Hyun-ju ( leaticia.ock@heraldcorp.com
(CNN) — It's a natural instinct, and one of our better qualities as humans: We see something unspeakable happen, even to a stranger, and we want to help.
Less than 24 hours after shocking video of Robert Godwin Sr. being shot to death was posted on Facebook Sunday night by his alleged killer Steve Stephens, no less than nine GoFundMe pages had cropped up claiming to benefit his family and his legacy.
No matter how much goodwill you harbor, that certainly raises a red flag. Were people genuinely trying to raise money to help Godwin's grieving loved ones? Or was someone trying to co-opt a tragedy to turn a quick buck?
Fortunately, GoFundMe staffers say the latter is hard to pull off. The charitable giving site has protections in place to keep donations from falling into the wrong hands.
Here's how to know your money, like your heart, is in the right place.
How do I know a GoFundMe donation is going to the right people?
The bottom line is, even if a random person starts a GoFundMe, the money goes to whatever person or cause is named. This cuts down on people using others' tragedies or causes for personal gain.
“It's not uncommon for someone to create a GoFundMe after a news report,” GoFundMe spokesperson Bobby Whithorne tells CNN. “In this case, we have spoken with the GoFundMe campaign organizer, members of the Godwin family and local authorities to guarantee the money will be deposited directly in a family member's bank account.”
Also, whoever started the campaign doesn't get the money, say, to distribute to their named cause. The beneficiary gets it directly from GoFundMe.
“When a campaign is created on behalf of another individual, the funds are collected by our payment processors, the funds are held, and then the funds are released only to the person named as the beneficiary,” Whithorne says. Multiple accounts also can be funneled to one beneficiary, he said.
How can I find the ‘official' GoFundMe page for a cause or person?
As mentioned above, there doesn't have to be one single fundraiser for an individual, but Whithorne says GoFundMe tries to direct people to a main account. You might find this account through family members, people close to the cause or a more official source like law enforcement.
In the Godwin case, police said Monday that the family had not set up a GoFundMe account. If and when they did, police promised to release the information for it. GoFundMe also spoke to the Godwin family and is directing donors toward this account.
“We encourage campaign organizers and beneficiaries to be transparent,” Whithorne says, meaning it is easiest if those individuals broadcast and verify their own accounts. But remember, even the account is quote-unquote “unauthorized,” the money will still go to the named cause.
Whithorne also says donors can reach out to campaign organizers themselves or to GoFundMe directly.
“We have a team of people to answer questions about donors,” he says. GoFundMe teams also vet information about campaigns and reach out to proposed beneficiaries to secure a chain of command for the funds, Whithorne says.
What if people are lying about their GoFundMe causes?
Now THIS is a question that needs a little more answering. Because GoFundMe has staffers involved in the process (and isn't just a third-party transaction host), it's hard for fraud to occur. Whithorne says abuse of the system occurs in “less than 1/10th of 1%” of all campaigns.
However, what is stopping people from, say, faking an illness or a hardship and cashing in on a concerned public? CNN has reached out to GoFundMe for more specific answers on that. But Whithorne says all donations are protected by a guarantee which would issue a full refund in the event of “intentionally misleading” campaigns.

Houston Texans defensive end J.J. Watt, who helped raise more than $37 million for people affected by Hurricane Harvey, was named the recipient of the prestigious Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award Presented by Nationwide at NFL Honors on Saturday.
"This award is about the inherent good that lies within humanity," Watt said after accepting his award. "It's about the city of Houston and its ability to overcome adversity at a time when it all seemed lost. It is about the hundreds of thousands of people from all over the country and all over the world who donated to a city they may have never been to, to people that they may never meet. But they donated simply because they saw their fellow humans going through a difficult time and they wanted to help out.
"I cannot express how humbled and honored that I am to be mentioned in the same sentence as Walter Payton. A man who did everything right not only on the field but also off of it."
Carolina Panthers tight end Greg Olsen and Baltimore Ravens tight end Benjamin Watson were the other finalists for this year's award, which recognizes an NFL player each year for excellence on and off the field.
In the wake of Hurricane Harvey, Watt posted a video on social media announcing a fundraising campaign with an initial goal of $200,000, to which he matched the first $100,000. In 19 days, he raised more than $37 million. Watt then dedicated himself to finding organizations that will apply the funds in the way he has promised the donors and victims of Harvey.
"I cannot thank everyone enough for their support and donations from across the country and around the world," Watt said in October to those who donated to his fundraising campaign. "You have truly shown what is possible when everyone bands together for one common cause. While we are going to do some truly incredible things with this $37 million to make it stretch as far as possible, it is only one small step in the massive recovery effort that lies ahead. I encourage you to please continue to find organizations to donate to, whether they be some of the ones listed below or others. Houston will bounce back from this and we will rise up stronger than ever."
Watt's dedication to charitable service stretches beyond his efforts in aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. In 2010, he started the Justin J. Watt Foundation in Wisconsin out of a desire to help underserved kids. His personal motto of "Dream Big, Work Hard" culminated into a mission that he continues to use to impact communities nationwide. The foundation has provided more than $3.4 million in funding to middle schools and organizations that have insufficient funding for after-school athletic programs or no after-school athletics whatsoever for sixth through eighth grade children.
"J.J. is one of the most selfless, giving and inspiring young men in the NFL and we are proud he is a Houston Texan," Texans owner Robert McNair said in a statement. "During one of Houston's worst disasters, J.J. was our shining light after raising more than $37 million for victims affected by Hurricane Harvey."
Watt has been named to the Pro Bowl four times and is a four-time first-team All-Pro. Leading the league in sacks in 2012 and 2015, J.J. was named NFL Defensive Player of the Year both seasons and in 2014 as well. Watt, who missed most of the 2017 season with a fractured tibial plateau in his left leg, has played in 88 games for the Texans and recorded a total of 394 tackles and 76 sacks.
The NFL Foundation, Nationwide and United Way Worldwide will donate $500,000 in Watt's name. A total of $250,000 will be donated to the winner's charity of choice and $250,000 will be donated in his name to expand the NFL Foundation's Character Playbook across the country.
Olsen and Watson will each receive a $100,000 donation to their charity of choice and a $100,000 donation in their names to expand Character Playbook. All other 29 nominees (one from each team) will receive a $50,000 donation to their charity of choice and an additional $50,000 donation in their names to Character Playbook.
PanARMENIAN.Net - The Islamic State (IS) group announced on Monday, December 11 afternoon that they have begun a new battle in the northwestern countryside of Albukamal city, Al-Masdar News says.
The terrorist group's statement did not specify in particular which town or village their forces were going to attack in the Albukamal countryside.
IS' statement comes just hours after their forces lost more than 2,000 square kilometers of territory to the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) and their allies in the southwestern countryside of Deir ez-Zor.
IS will likely target the recent gains by the Syrian Army in a bid to reestablish a presence along the western bank of the Euphrates River.
I've always felt sort of bad for Nakula and Sahadeva Pandava.
I mean, think about it. Sure, they got to share in the Glory of the Pandava Brothers, such as it were, but always as an afterthought. There was Yudhishthira the Just, Arjuna the Valiant, Bheema the Strong, and after you're done listing them, you go, “Oh and the twins, whatstheirnames, Nakula and Sahadeva.” On the other hand, even in a famous family, not everyone can be equally famous. Someone's got to stay at home and handle the admin.
Nakula and Sahadeva are a little bit like the culture guy and the food guy from Queer Eye, we know they're there and they're certainly very attractive, but what do they do exactly apart from teaching someone how to make an omelette or giving a pep talk? I suppose they serve to round out the crowd — two's company, three's a crowd, but five, five is a party.
[Other members of the Queer Eye cast as Mahabharata characters: The interior design guy is doing all the heavy lifting (Bheema), followed by the hair guy who is the breakout star of the show (Arjuna) and the clothes guy is generally moral and upstanding (Yudhishthira).]
The story of Nakula and Sahadeva really begins with the story of their mother, Madri. Unlike the other three Pandava brothers, the twins had a different mother, one who died really early on in the story. So they were raised by their stepmother Kunti their entire life.
We all know that ancient piece of gossip — Pandu, their dad, didn't actually father any of his five sons, since he was “under a curse” that meant he'd die if he ever had sex. (Sure, honey, it happens to everyone.) But the Pandavas' PR team is so good, we've all collectively decided that if they must be illegitimate, they must at least be sons of gods, the next best thing.
Pandu had two wives — Kunti, who chose him at her swayamvar, and Madri, an arranged marriage, but who, it is implied, was much hotter than Kunti. Kunti had, before her marriage, acquired a boon that allowed her to call down on any god to impregnate her. She offered to share this with Madri, so both of them could be the mothers of sons. (It's a given that the gods never father daughters with humans.)
While Kunti had called on the gods of justice, valour and strength respectively to father her three boys, Madri, that cunning creature, went a different route. She decided to save time — and have a crazy god-menage-a-trois — by calling upon two minor gods at the same time: twins, the Ashvins, known for being young, handsome, and athletic. It's like they both used sperm donors, and while Kunti hand-picked one NLS lawyer, one IAS topper and one IIT grad, Madri was like, “Eh, whatever, as long as they're hot.”
Twins were born from this threesome with twins, and soon Madri wanted another go (she was young, her husband couldn't have sex with her, and I always see her as more highly-sexed than Kunti, who seemed satisfied with her lot). However, Kunti refused to share the god-aphrodisiac boon with her again because, she argued, it wasn't fair that Madri got two children from a single encounter, and what if she tried calling twins again? As the senior queen, Kunti wasn't entirely comfortable with Madri having as many or, gods forbid, more children than herself.
I suspect Kunti was also a little jealous of Madri: Pandu's inevitable death-by-sex struck because he eventually couldn't control himself, cavorting in the forest with second wife Madri, while first wife Kunti stayed in and looked after the kids. Pandu died, pretty much immediately after the sex, and Kunti found Madri weeping over the body and promptly started to victim-shame her, saying things like, “Why did you let him take you out alone?” Madri kills herself to join her husband in the afterlife not much after this because, as she admits to Kunti, she wouldn't be able to raise all the boys equally, as though they were all born to her and not just two of them, and Kunti was nice like that. She really was, there's never any mention of her making a distinction between Nakul and Sahadeva and their three half-brothers.
But it turns out the sperm donors actually did make a difference, because all the Pandava brothers took after their fathers. Nakula and Sahadeva were no exception, except their dads weren't good at much except horses and being very handsome, both of which qualities the brothers had. And it's not like the twins didn't fight well during the Mahabharata war or weren't super loyal to their family, it's just that their three older brothers had better stories, better lines, and ultimately, stories are told about heroes, not just two people who were pretty cool but not very important.
Indian myths, especially the big ones, your Ramayana and Mahabharata, generally deal with siblings in a similar sort of way. The heroes — Rama, the Pandavas — are from families where all the brothers grow up in the shade of the eldest.
In the Ramayana, crown prince Rama, born the eldest of four half-brothers, is sent into exile when one of his stepmothers gets Rama's father to put her biological son Bharata on the throne instead. So accompanied by one of his brothers Lakshmana as sidekick, Rama gets to enjoy alone-ish time with his beloved wife in exile, and then go on a grand adventure, befriending monkeys, killing a king, avenging his name and so on and comes back to claim his throne in the end. It's epic.
Bharata keeps the throne warm for Rama until then, and happily and competently so. He is only praised as a foil to Rama, his story arc is that of the Good Brother, he exists in this tale as an example of what good brothers do, they defy their mothers when their brother's happiness is at stake, they wait for the rightful heir to return, they do not challenge the filial hierarchy. They may never be royal, Lorde, but they are definitely loyal.
But “good brother” isn't as faint praise as it sounds. It's nice to be a good brother, and the epics put value on that. Stories of heroes in Indian mythology often feature their tightly-knit families. One can't get along without the others — the hero is only the hero because of his bro back home dealing with things: united we stand. And one's downfall is everyone else's — back in the Mahabharata, the eldest Pandava Yudhishthira gambles away the lives of his brothers and his wife after he runs out of money to bet with.
Also by the way, many powerful modern-day Indian families would do a lot better really looking at the lessons from these texts instead of just worshipping the heroes. Maybe they'd be a lot happier now.
Actually, I don't feel so bad for Nakula and Sahadeva after all. They were part of the story, just following a different destiny. You know, they were offered their own kingdom? An uncle on their mother's side said they didn't have to be fourth and fifth in line to Yudhishthira, they could inherit his kingdom right then, no questions asked. They accepted — with one caveat. They always wanted to be able to live with their brothers instead.

After her glorious Grammy sweep on Sunday night, Adele woke up to a #BoycottAdele hashtag, with many Beyoncé fans questioning her "unfair" win over their idol. But calls for a boycott are scarcely new for Adele. Last year, after she endorsed Hillary Clinton for president, Trump supporters launched a similar hashtag. Buffeted by the competitive politics of the right and left, the English singer will likely think longingly back to the uncomplicated very first #BoycottAdele hashtag that trended briefly in 2015 after the release of her hit single "Hello."
It had nothing to do with politics and everything to do with tea.
The millions of fans who have watched the music video of "Hello" know that a steaming cup of tea has a central role to play in providing succor to the singer's lovesick heart.
Artfully stained with sepia and loss, the retro video opens with a deeply depressed Adele walking into a shut-up house enrobed in dustcovers. Outside, it's wickedly cold and blustery. Inside (her broken heart) the temperature's pretty tundra-like too. So while she lavishly mourns the loss of her coffee-drinking lover in song, Adele does what the English do when things look bleak. She pops the kettle on. There's a delicately patterned china cup and saucer waiting to be filled. So far, so good.
Then, the singer does something absolutely shocking. She pours hot water into the cup and then pops in a tea bag. Instead of the other way around, of course. This casual switching of steps was an outrage and nothing short of tea treason. British twitter sputtered with indignation.
How reassuringly English. A country that has fought two opium wars with China to protect its precious tea supply takes the beverage very seriously.
Ask the man who is the au currant hero, George Orwell. He may have fought totalitarianism all his life, but when it came to making a pot of tea, it was his way or the highway. His popular essay, "A nice cup of tea," is an 11-point disquisition on how to achieve just that. Orwell would have been horrified by Adele's – and the modern streamlined style of – tea-making. Not merely by the presence of a teabag but by the absence of a teapot. "If the tea is not loose in the pot it never infuses properly," he declaimed. In order to get a good infusion, one "should take the teapot to the kettle, and not the other way about. The water should be actually boiling at the moment of impact, which means that one should keep it on the flame while one pours."
As for that other great anti-totalitarian Brit, John Lennon, he could imagine a world without heaven and religion, but not without tea – brewed the right way, of course. A few years ago, his widow, Yoko Ono, wrote a piece for The New York Times called "The Tea Maker," in which she affectionately recalled their midnight tea-making kitchen trysts. "Yoko, Yoko, you're supposed to first put the tea bags in, and then the hot water," John would admonish her. And so Ono allowed him to make the tea his way. But, for tea purists, there's an unfortunate twist to this story. As Ono tells it:
One night, however, John said: "I was talking to Aunt Mimi this afternoon and she says you are supposed to put the hot water in first. Then the tea bag. I could swear she taught me to put the tea bag in first, but ..." "So all this time, we were doing it wrong?" "Yeah ..." We both cracked up...
So Adele should take heart. She has the great Beatle on her side. But though once a committed tea drinker, Adele has given up her 10-cups-a-day habit. Not because of the tea trolls but because of the pounds she was putting on from the heavily sugared cups.
Meanwhile, her "Hello" video has launched a range of "Hello, it's tea" merchandise and several cheeky parodies, including changing the soulful line of Lionel Richie's 1983 hit, "Hello," to "Hello, is it tea you're looking for?" In another very funny send-up, an English radio presenter rewrote the lyrics to make tea the star. So instead of belting out "Hello from the other side," we have:
Where the hell's my cup of tea? My ginger nut needs dunking see Have you even turned the kettle on? I should have had it by now But all my biscuits are gone I love tea It's me and tea.
On Sunday night, after an awkward, overwrought but sincere-sounding acceptance speech in which she nervously lavished praise on Beyoncé, Adele accidentally broke her trophy in half. As if it were a ginger nut biscuit she was dying to dunk into a cup of tea. With all of those boycott hashtags, she could certainly do with a cuppa.

The Los Angeles Police Department said Tuesday it is investigating 52 complaints of misconduct filed by former patients of USC 's longtime campus gynecologist as detectives launch a sweeping criminal probe into the scandal that has rocked the university.
LAPD detectives also made an appeal for other patients who feel mistreated to come forward, noting that thousands of students were examined by Dr. George Tyndall during his nearly 30-year career at USC. More than 410 people have contacted a university hotline about the physician since The Times revealed the allegations this month.
Tyndall's “behavior and practices appear to go beyond the norms of the medical profession and gynecological examinations,” said Asst. Chief Beatrice Girmala. "We sincerely realize that victims may have difficulty recounting such details to investigators. We are empathetic and ready to listen."
FORT WALTON BEACH, Fla. – Authorities say a Florida couple lied to their 13-year-old son about having brain cancer so they could use his fictitious illness to raise money for nonexistent medical expenses.
The Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office says on social media that 34-year old Ginny Long and 47-year old Robert Long were arrested Thursday and charged with one count of child abuse and nine counts of fraud.
Detectives say the Longs set up a T-shirt fundraiser for the boy at his school last May and shared the bogus cancer diagnosis on their Facebook accounts. A GoFundMe site was also set up for the boy. The sheriff's office didn't say how much money was raised.

The sheriff's office began investigating in November, after school resource officers began to suspect the boy was being exploited.
Jail records didn't list attorneys for the Longs.
It's the third ball of the sixth over, Kolkata Knight Riders' (KKR) captain Gautam Gambhir has just started to break free. He lofts one over extra cover for four off Washington Sundar. And then goes one step ahead and lofts him for six over long on by charging down the track. For an 18-year-old off-spinner bowling in the powerplay, there might be a thousand things fluttering inside the mind. What now? What should be my next step? How do I stop him? However, it's not the case with Washington. He trundles in the next ball, gives it extra flight and pitches it full outside off; Gambhir goes for a swipe across the line, doesn't get the desired connection and holes out to deep mid-wicket. The battle is won, in the simplest of ways.
M Sundar, Washington's father, fondly recalls that short battle at the Eden Gardens in the 2017 edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) as our chat veers from his son's early days towards his biggest strength.
"His mind . He is fearless," Sundar senior tells Firstpost. “If somebody is bowling at him at 148 Kmph or 150 on a wicket like Perth or in South Africa, he won't show any fear. He is a fearless boy with intelligence."
Washington ended as the second-most economical bowler, behind Pawan Negi (for bowlers who have bowled 30 overs or more) in his debut season in the IPL with an economy rate of 6.16. However, the one thing that stood out was his fearless bowling in the Powerplay.
"I do a lot of homework for sure looking at different batsmen. I plan different things for different batsmen," Washington told Firstpost before getting the national call-up. "For me to execute them in the match is very important and I should be really prepared to execute them under pressure, playing in front of big crowds against the likes of Pollard, Warner, Buttler or McCullum. Just by looking at the guy who is 17 they would want to put the pressure on you straightaway. Bowling against these guys was a big challenge and I was able to hold my nerve. People like Mahi bhai (MS Dhoni) and (Steven) Smith helped me a lot to stay in the present and made sure I know what to do."
It was Rising Pune Supergiant (RPS) coach Stephen Fleming's idea of unleashing Washington in the first six overs since they were up against Sunrisers Hyderabad which comprised of three left-handers — David Warner, Shikhar Dhawan and Yuvraj Singh — in their top order. It would prove to be a masterstroke.
"During the IPL he was asked whether he would be comfortable bowling in first six overs, and there was no hesitation on his part," recalls Hrishikesh Kanitkar, assistant coach of Rising Pune Supergiants. "He just said, yes for sure, and the way he said it was as if he had been bowling in the first six overs throughout his life and was like his fifth or sixth year of the IPL. It was very normal like 'okay, fine.' So he was up to it."
While there was a steady progression in his junior career, it was since the IPL that the 18-year-old started taking giant strides. In the Tamil Nadu Premier League (TNPL) post IPL, he ended up as the highest run-getter (459 runs at 76.50 and SR of 154.54) and second-highest wicket-taker (15 wickets at 12.73 and an ER of 6.16). Success followed him in the Duleep Trophy where he scalped 11 wickets and scored 130 runs on debut. A month later, he conjured figures of 8-1-23-2 when almost every other bowler was hammered around the MA Chidambaram stadium in the tour match against Australia. A maiden first-class hundred followed, in the 2017-18 Ranji Trophy.
Washington was hitting all the right notes which the selectors couldn't ignore. In January this year, he was dropped from the Tamil Nadu T20 side for the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, but eleven months later he got a maiden national call-up for One-Day Internationals (ODI) and Twenty20 (T20)side.

As a six-year-old, Washington would accompany his father — a Tamil Nadu Ranji probable from 1993 to 1996 and a first division cricketer — during matches to watch him play. Sundar Senior would utilise the little time in between sessions to feed tennis balls to Washington, who loved hitting them around. Slowly, Washington's interest in the game increased and soon he fell deeply in love with the game. Sundar spotted the spark very early and his son soon started juggling between school and practice sessions. However, with Sundar, Washington's top priority was never in doubt.
"I saw this boy having special talent at the age of six, so I decided to keep studies as the second option," says Sundar.
“He started hitting the ball with a beautiful swing and hand-eye co-ordination. He had the ability to play straight naturally. Normally when you bowl underarm to kids, they play towards mid-wicket or square leg. But Washi used to play very straight. That impressed me. Sometimes when I bowled underarm with protection, he wouldn't accept it. He would say 'father bowl at whatever speed you can bowl.' Then I used to bowl medium pace."
Soon, Sundar — who was inspired by former colleague and teammate WV Raman — modelled Washington's stance on the former India batsman. A home-run academy meant that Washington was never short of training space. Not just the batting, work on all-round development had started by the age of 10.
"One thing my dad made sure was that he didn't want me to stand still after I finished my batting," Washington recalls. "He wanted me to try things, bowl off-spin, leg-spin, medium-pace, and keep wickets. By the time I was in sixth standard, I was able to do everything, so I had options of doing different things for different teams that I played."
After impressive performances playing for the U-16s, Washington was selected for the National Cricket Academy (NCA) camp the same year, where, under the tutelage of bowling coach B Vasu, his bowling took wing. It was Vasu, Sundar and M Venkataramana's combined efforts that shaped Washington the bowler. The 18-year-old's gallant display in powerplays during the IPL was a result of Sundar's vision and systematic training at a very young age. As the coach of his academy, Sundar had started moulding Washington for the toughest of scenarios.
"He had natural loop and off-spinner's arc, at that time he was very short. In 30-over academy matches in Chennai, I used to make him bowl the last three overs, 26, 28 and 30, always," Sundar says. He used to give less than 10 runs in last three overs in U-14 tournaments and bowled without any fear as a 10-year-old. From 12 onwards, he started bowling with the new ball, first, third and fifth overs. 99 percent of the time, his first over would be a maiden or just one or two runs would be scored. Sometimes he used to get 2-3 wickets in the first over itself. He used to bowl with two slips and all."
Nerves of steel were forged at a very young age which started paying dividends on the bigger stage.
"He (my father) always wants me to play with guts and insists on this day in and day out," Washington said. "He wants me to be someone who is cool and calm under difficult situations. He's moulded me this way. It helped me a lot especially in the IPL. When I was given the ball in my debut game against the Sunrisers, I was up against David Warner and there was definitely a lot of pressure especially for someone who is 17. But I did manage to hold my nerve because of the learning imparted by my father."
At the age of 12, Washington amassed 596 runs and taken 33 wickets from 11 games in a local division league, playing with players twice or thrice his age, that was the time he realised he could make a career out of cricket.
The hard work had doubled by now which resulted in Washington's steady rise through the junior ranks. By 16, he had made it to the India U-19 squad. A glimpse of his talent was on display in the 2016 U-19 World Cup where he consistently bowled frugal spells which included valiant figures of 9-1-18-0 in the final against West Indies. This was the first step towards entering the limelight. A maiden first-class call-up was not far away.
***
Every journey at some point gets punctuated by a bumpy ride. At the start of 2017, Washington was left with a lot of soul searching to do. The 17-year-old was dropped from the Tamil Nadu T20 side for the Syed Mushtaq Ali tournament on the back of a difficult maiden Ranji season. It did hurt, but in turn instilled extra motivation which translated into success in the Vijay Hazare and Deodhar Trophies where he played a crucial role in helping his side clinch both the trophies.
"In the one-and-a-half months before Vijay Hazare Trophy, I worked really hard on all aspects. I used to come to the ground for both the sessions," Washington said. "I never used to take a day off and made sure I batted, bowled and trained well. I wasn't expecting too many things, just wanted to get better and fitter as a player and those things paid off."
This is where it all started to turn around for the youngster. Having followed Washington's development closely at Tamil Nadu, Hrishikesh Kanitkar suggested Washington's name to RPS management when Ravichandran Ashwin pulled out of the 2017 IPL due to injury.
"I had no doubt in suggesting Washy's name because one thing I knew for sure is that he doesn't get fazed by situations or opponents," Kanitkar explains. "I knew that even if he was up against experienced and very good batsmen in the IPL, he would bowl the way he bowls. With Washy, what you see is what you get."
Heading into the league, Washington had just one aim — learn as much as possible. The IPL invariably proved to be the turning point.
"When I went to the IPL, I was in a very good frame of mind and rhythm. All I had to do was to hold my nerve and be very, very focused because I was aware that those 45 days can change my life. But I didn't put too much pressure (on myself). I was just 17 and wanted to enjoy the game," he says. "I gained a lot of experience as well. Bowling against some of the stars did give me massive confidence and made me believe in what I am able to do and what I am capable of doing."
With consistent performances, the path seemed clear for a national call-up, but there had to be another twist in the tale. Washington flunked the Yo-Yo Test and missed out on the bus for the Australia T20 series in October.
"We were a little bit surprised because we all thought that a score of 16.1 was not that difficult for someone who was playing regularly," says Kanitkar. "But what we realised was that he had just played a Duleep Trophy game in which he had bowled a lot of overs, was on the field all the time and batted for long periods as well. And to immediately travel after that for a fitness test was a little unfair. Also he had some hamstring tightness at that time. Apart from that there was no reason why he won't be able to pull through."
With Washington, there was the inevitable strong response. He stepped up the hard work. Determination coupled with a fresh mind and constant motivation from Kanitkar and Sundar helped him clear the test which paved the way for Sri Lanka T20 series selection.

Talk to Washington and the first thing that strikes the mind is his simplicity. The word 'bhaiya (brother)' is often repeated while he talks in a soft and apologetic tone. It is this simplicity that rubs off on his game as well. He doesn't like to complicate things and more importantly he is very clear in his mind.
The Tamil Nadu all-rounder's secret of success against Australia, where he got Steven Smith and Glenn Maxwell in the tour game, was pretty simple, "I was just trying to hit the right areas. Because there was something in the wicket, I knew I would be able to get some purchase and bowl a good spell at the end of the day. I just tried concentrating doing the right things," he recalls.
I try to quiz him further. And what happens when his plans go wrong?
"Definitely I will have to go back to my run-up and again try to do the same thing. Or again try to not bowl in the area where he is expecting me to bowl. Everyone gets hit but it's how you come back that makes a huge difference. Even if you have been hit for a six and have given 10 runs in four-five balls, it matters how you manage to give just a single and finish the over with 11 runs instead of giving another six or four and making it 16-18 runs which will make a lot of difference," Sundar explains.
The clarity in thought is palpable. Apart from his hard work and fearlessness it's his uncluttered mind that stands out.
"He (Washington) is someone who is very keen to learn, a very simple person. He likes to keep everything simple. He works on his game and wants to get better," Kanitkar says.
"If you see all the IPL games and even the Deodhar and Vijay Hazare trophies, when a batsman has got the better of him, Washington has been unfazed. What usually happens is that when a batsman steps out and hits you for a boundary or a six, the bowler invariably tends to drop it short (next ball) because he expects the batsman to step up and hit again, but with Washington, he knows what he wants to bowl and he will trust his ability, that's something that he's got which is special."
According to Sundar, this quality is innate and he draws a really interesting parallel.
"My mentor and godfather PD Washington used to be like that. Most of his habits, mental aspects are available in my son Washington. PD Washington was very simple, natural, helpful, and very honest, Washy is having all these qualities, by God's grace."
A national call-up at such a young age doesn't surprise Sundar. In fact he feels it's a bit late as it should have come at 16 which in itself speaks volumes of how highly he rates his son.
At 18, Washington will soon enter the most crucial phase of his life. How will he respond to this challenge? Well, with Washington it has to be very simple.
"Whatever comes I should be ready. Whatever it may be. I don't really want to expect too much. I just want to wake up every day, practice, work hard, and get better so whenever my turn comes, wherever it might be, I should be ready," Washington signs off in a typical Washington way.

Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Paul Richardson suffered an AC sprain in his right shoulder during Sunday's 48-17 preseason win over the Los Angeles Chargers, according to coach Pete Carroll.
"It really was kind of self-inflicted," Carroll said. "He took off for that ball. It was a great deep ball. And he left his feet to go get it and landed on his shoulder. He got crunched pretty good.
Editor's Picks Trevone Boykin, Blair Walsh shine as Seahawks pile up 48 points vs. Chargers Trevone Boykin took a step toward being the Seahawks' No. 2 QB, going 12-for-15 passing, while Blair Walsh nailed two field goals and all six PATs.
"It's an AC sprain, and it's going to be a bit. I don't want to throw a number on it, but he got hurt."
The injury occurred when Richardson made a diving 25-yard reception down the left sideline from Russell Wilson in the first quarter. But he landed hard on his right shoulder and exited the game.
Richardson had been running with the starters ahead of Jermaine Kearse during training camp. He had a strong finish to last season and is entering the final year of his contract.
With Richardson sidelined, Kearse and Tyler Lockett are the most likely candidates to take his place in the starting lineup opposite Doug Baldwin. Kearse has started 45 games the past three seasons. Lockett spent most of the offseason recovering from a broken leg but has looked healthy during practice and is on track to be ready for the regular season. He did not participate in Sunday's preseason opener.
Superstar Rajinikanth turns 67: A low-key birthday, but massive plans ahead for films and politics
December 12 is marked in the Tamil Nadu calendar as the birthday of superstar Rajinikanth. For the last two decades, fans of Kollywood and especially those of the reigning superstar eagerly look forward to 12/12.
This year, with Rajinikanth's imminent entry into politics being one of the most talked about debates on television, all eyes are on Poes Garden, the star's residence in Chennai.
As per national media he was supposed to make the big decision today, on 12 December “to float his own party and plunge into politics”.
But it looks to be a quiet birthday, with the superstar keeping a low profile and his fans celebrating online with common display pictures and offline with huge wall posters. There are the usual sponsored birthday specials in Tamil publications.
A source close to the superstar revealed to Firstpost: “The superstar is out of station for a day today. Fans may be celebrating the birthday with prayers, functions, and few are holding a special screening of sir's iconic films. As of now he is scheduled to meet his fans before the year ends.”
The latest buzz is that Rajinikanth, who turns 68 today, will take a call on politics only after the December 18 results of the Gujarat polls are announced. He also wants to keep away from Tamil Nadu's keenly contested RK Nagar by-poll, which is to be held on December 21.
In the last few months Rajinikanth kept a studious silence, with one-time arch rival Kamal Haasan hogging the headlines with his sensational statements and open war with the state government. So far he has restrained from making any remarks on EPS led ADMK government in Tamil Nadu, and has also not commented on Vishal's botched up entry into politics.
2018 is going to be the most crucial year in his life. He has two biggies coming up for release back to back – 2 Point O on 27 April and Kaala on 15 April. The release dates are tentative and may change. Meanwhile Kollywood trade sources have warned Rajinikanth that with nearly Rs 600 Crore riding on him with 2 Point O (Budget Rs 450 Cr) and Kaala (Budget Rs 150 Cr), it is better that he keeps his mouth shut regarding politics.
They've pointed out the case of Padmavati to him, which is still undergoing release pangs due to political opposition. Trade sources are keeping their fingers crossed regarding Kamal Haasan's Viswaroopam 2, which is now getting ready for release in the first quarter of 2018.
The buzz is that after it became clear that 2 Point O was likely to get delayed due to time consuming VFX and special effects, Rajinikanth went silent. He met a few Tamil Nadu distributors of the film at the Dubai audio launch and told them the film will release in April. He also assured them that he will not be doing anything like jumping into politics and risk his film career. The trade buzz is that till Kaala releases, he will not form or join any political party and is looking more at the big picture – 2019 Lok Sabha elections.
As of now Rajinikanth has stopped listening to new film stories or holding discussions with directors.
A source close to Rajinikanth said: “Superstar Rajinikanth is still the number one because he knows the importance of the box-office from where he derives his strength and he will not do anything to upset the apple cart. He has been able to keep Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi in good humour for the last 25 years at the peak of his career, something which Kamal Haasan or modern day heroes aspiring for a political career could never do. It is a very thin dividing line between politics and cinema in Tamil Nadu.”
Senior political journalist GC Sekhar, who has been tracking Rajinikanth since 1996, says – “It looks like after waiting all these years, Rajinikanth is in no hurry to take the plunge immediately. Last time he met his fans he asked them to be prepared for war. And when he meets his fans again I'm sure he will review the preparations. The actual declaration of war – a political party – will come just ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. By then Kamal Haasan and Vishal might have got exhausted by their sprint.

For the third year in a row, Rajinikanth has chosen to keep away from the fan frenzy on his birthday. His spokesperson said Rajinikanth opted for a low-key birthday following Cyclone Ochki, in which nearly 500 Tamil fishermen are still missing and 40 people have died.

French composer and multiple Oscar- and Grammy-winner Michel Legrand is scoring Orson Welles' final film, “The Other Side of the Wind,” Variety has learned.
This will mark Legrand's second Welles project. The veteran composer, whose work includes “Yentl,” “Summer of '42,” “The Thomas Crown Affair” and “The Umbrellas of Cherbourg,” scored Welles' last completed film, “F for Fake,” in 1974. Welles died in 1985.
Legrand, 86, has been secretly working on the film since December. Orchestral recording began on Monday in Belgium and will continue with a jazz ensemble later this week in Paris.
The composer calls it “one of the most exciting and delicate scores” he has written in his 60 years of working in movies. “I asked myself constantly, ‘How would Orson have reacted?' The very subject of the film touched me: the idea of the passage of time, the renewal of inspiration. I am proud to be the link between these two Welles films. I take it as a gift from Orson, through the clouds.”
Said producer Frank Marshall: “After working with Michel on ‘F for Fake' and wanting a jazz-based score, Orson always spoke about him doing the music for ‘Wind.' So it is wonderful to have this three-time Academy Award winner on board, and a thrill to sit and spot the music with Michel, who, at 86 years old, still has tremendous energy, creativity and a twinkle in his eye.”

Legrand is responsible for some of the most memorable film music of the past 60 years. Seven of his 13 Oscar nominations are for songs, many of which have gone on to become standards: “I Will Wait for You,” “The Windmills of Your Mind,” “What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?,” “Pieces of Dreams,” “How Do You Keep the Music Playing?” and two from “Yentl,” “Papa, Can You Hear Me?” and “The Way He Makes Me Feel.”
His other scores include “The Umbrellas of Cherbourg,” “The Young Girls of Rochefort,” “Ice Station Zebra,” “The Go-Between,” “Lady Sings the Blues” and “The Three Musketeers.” His five Grammys include one for his television score for “Brian's Song” and two for his 1975 jazz album “Images.”
The long-awaited “Wind” was in production off and on from 1970 to 1976; it stars Welles' directing colleagues John Huston and Peter Bogdanovich. Bogdanovich has consulted on the edit, working with Marshall and producer Filip Jan Rymsza to complete the film per Welles' original vision.
Netflix is expected to stream the film at some point in the future, probably later this year.
A Nova Scotia Supreme Court judge has ruled on an affidavit submitted by Lorne Grabher in his bid to get his licence plate back.
Despite the case being scheduled to go to trial in the fall, lawyers representing Grabher and the Crown appeared in court on Friday to hear whether portions of Grabher's affidavit laying out his argument for getting his plate back would be admissible.

Supreme Court Justice Pierre Muise ruled Friday that he agreed with Grabher's assertion that his son being allowed to have a “GRABHER” licence plate in Alberta, and that Grabher's business was able to bear his name could be relevant at trial.
Muise said both showed that the name had been sanctioned by the government.
However, full paragraphs were stricken from the document after Muise ruled that they were opinion-based or furthered a legal argument — something not acceptable in an affidavit.

The Crown was awarded costs associated with the affidavit's challenge.
Grabher will have to pay $750, though that will not be due until the outcome of the trial has been decided.

Nine-year-old Lewin Tubuna aims to raise £2,500 for Alice House Hospice by completing a coast-to-coast cycle from Whitehaven in Cumbria to Hartlepool in just three days.
Lewin aged eight with dad Suli, mam Lynsey and little sister Mia.
He is already up to £1,790 thanks to support from local businesses.
Lewin and his dad Suli will start their journey on August 22.
They are hoping to complete the challenge on August 25 which is also Lewin's 10th birthday.
Hospice community fundraiser Janice Forbes, of Alice House, said: “Lewin is a truly remarkable young man and he has done an amazing job fundraising so far.
“He has great family and friends behind him, as well as supporters from the local business community.”

Back in February, YouTube gave people the ability to live stream directly to their channel from their phones… with one catch: it was only open to folks with 10,000 subscribers or more.
If you've been dying to hop on the live streaming train but haven't hit that 10k mark yet, good news: they've dropped the requirement to 1,000 subscribers as opposed to 10,000. It's still not open to everyone, but that's a considerably smaller hurdle.
The change quietly happened sometime in the past few days, but got swept up amongst the April Fools' noise that comes with changing anything near the beginning of this month. A support page confirms the change, and a rep from YouTube confirmed that it should be open to everyone with 1,000 subscribers or more — not a random pool.
So why not just open it to everyone, regardless of subscriber count? A few possible reasons:
NEW YORK (AP)  Yadier Molina reached for a ball in the dirt the other day at Yankee Stadium, the sort of pitch he usually smothers with ease using his chest protector and a square set of shoulders.
This time, though, he tried to make a backhand stab with his mitt as the ball skipped by.
Poor technique, to be frank, from an eight-time Gold Glove winner widely considered one of the greatest defensive catchers in baseball history. Molina knew it, too, and slammed his mask to the ground as he chased toward the backstop.
Its just two weeks into the season, but something seems off about the St. Louis Cardinals.

Molina is only one example. Long known for winning The Cardinal Way, St. Louis entered Monday with the worst record (3-9) in the National League and its poorest start since 1988 courtesy of shoddy play all over the diamond.
I think its magnified when it happens this early, manager Mike Matheny said. Rightfully so.
For an organization that takes immense pride in attention to detail and executing properly, all the ugly miscues have been startling.
St. Louis had committed 10 errors, plunked seven batters and thrown five wild pitches through Sunday. Not to mention the 44 walks issued by a pitching staff sporting an NL-high 4.98 ERA.
The 34-year-old Molina, recently signed to a $60 million contract covering 2018-20, has permitted a passed ball in each of the past two games.
And the bullpen thus far? Yikes.
The answer is work right now, Matheny said. Weve got to work hard but work smart, making sure that were attacking the little things that were seeing that are keeping us from the results that were looking for.
The hitters have hardly been immune.
The Cardinals were batting .212 with just 42 total runs, next-to-last in both categories among NL teams. Their slugging percentage of .332 was by far the lowest in the league.
We all know that were going to bounce out of this funk sooner than later, said Matt Adams, batting .174. But its believing in ourselves and believing in this team. We know that were a good team.
Even in mid-April with 150 games to go, its strange to see St. Louis at the bottom of the standings. After all, this is a club that made 12 playoff appearances in 16 seasons from 2000-15  five straight before falling one game short last year at 86-76.
But this season, a walk-off win on opening night against the World Series champion Chicago Cubs has been about the only major highlight.
Swept this past weekend by the New York Yankees, the Cardinals hoped to find their footing back home. They took an overnight flight to St. Louis to begin a three-game series Monday evening against Pittsburgh.
The thing that I like when you have a good start is its something that you just, you go back to. You go back to, hey, remember, this is what we do, Matheny said. We havent seen it yet, and thats concerning. We will see it, and I think well see it for long periods of time. But at the beginning, especially when you have younger players, and we have some guys who havent been around that long, they need to sense that winning expectation. ... Its amazing how powerful that is.
A closer look at whats gone wrong:
THE FORMER ACE
Adam Wainwright is 0-3 with a 7.24 ERA and appears to be fading fast. The 35-year-old righty, losing zip on his fastball, has allowed 21 hits in 8 2/3 innings over his past two outings. Hes yet to last longer than five innings in any of his three starts. The stuff is good. Ive gotten through lineups all the way and pitched nine innings with way worse stuff than I have right now, Wainwright said. I really cant understand it. I cant explain it. I just have to keep going. I just have to know that this isnt how its going to be.
THE NEW GUYS
After finishing 17 1/2 games behind the rival Cubs last year, St. Louis attempted to close the gap by signing center fielder Dexter Fowler away from Chicago for $82.5 million over five years. The leadoff man had struck out in nearly one-third of his at-bats and was hitting .143 with one extra-base hit through Sunday. Looking to boost the bullpen, the Cardinals gave free-agent lefty Brett Cecil a $30.5 million, four-year contract last November. He entered Monday with a 9.00 ERA in seven outings. Like they say: Its not how you start, its how you finish, Fowler said.
MISSING YOU
Without much speed to speak of, the Cardinals relied on the long ball last year. They hit 225 homers, most in the NL. But then they let three players go who combined for 60 of those home runs: Brandon Moss, Matt Holliday and Jeremy Hazelbaker. Without them, St. Louis has struggled to find production at the plate. Jhonny Peralta was batting .120, Kolten Wong .148 and Randal Grichuk .182. Well get it figured out, Matheny said.
A dozen children are learning what it takes to be a police officer as they participate in a week-long day camp with the Longueuil police department.
On Wednesday, the kids took part in a search-and-rescue simulation at Parc Michel-Chartrand in Longueuil, on Montreal's South Shore.
“Since I've been a police officer in Longueuil… I've met young people who had a bad opinion of the police,” said Audrey Desaulniers, who created the program in an attempt to change people's perception of the police.
She has been with the force for four years.

Longueuil police spokesperson Jean-Pierre Voutsinos told Global News the kids are “little ambassadors.”
“They'll meet with the emergency response team and learn how to deal with a disappearance,” he said.
He added that the apprentice officers will learn how the force functions and the basic tricks of the trade.

As one of the campers, Ana Rubeco said the program has changed how she sees police officers in her community.
“I always thought that when police officers put the uniform on — I thought they like didn't have any friends or family and were just robots — but now I see that they are people too,” she said.
Various other workshops will be held over the course of the week, introducing participants to the fire department, specialized patrol units and judicial agencies.
They will also visit the Longueuil courthouse and the Quebec National Police School in Nicolet.
Despite pledges made at a conference in London 18 months ago, a UNICEF report states that 534,000 Syrian refugee children in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt, and a total of 2.3 million Syrian children around the world that are not enrolled in any formal education.
World leaders at London's “Supporting Syria” conference in February 2016, set a goal of having all school-aged Syrian refugee kids enrolled in formal education by the end of the 2017 school year. Because they neighbour Syria, these five countries have received the highest volume of Syrian refugees, with Lebanon topping the list at 844,021.
In addition, the report states that over two million Syrian children around the world are not in school, and even more are at risk of dropping out entirely.

“Donors and host countries have promised that Syrian children will not become a lost generation, and yet six years into the crisis, that is exactly what is happening,” Bill Van Esveld, senior children's rights researcher at Human Rights Watch said in a statement about the pledge's progress.
The conference also launched a UN-led $8-billion education aid appeal for 2017, which allotted $3.4 billion for Syria and $4.6 billion for the host countries, that was only 25 per cent funded by July 2017, according to UN figures.
WATCH: 2nd year of Edmonton summer camp welcomes returning Syrian kids
“The governments involved urgently need to fix what's not working and to do that they need better information on how many children are in school and on how funding is being delivered,” Van Esveld continued.
At the time of the conference, it was estimated that 715,000 Syrian children remained out of school in these nations.
York University professor Ranu Basu who works with the university's Centre for Refugee Studies, explains that educating refugees in times of mass migration has always posed a challenge.
WATCH: Red tape blamed for delaying arrival of Syrian refugees
“This is something that has been an age-old problem. What the challenge is, particularly in the last few years, is the scale.”
She goes on to say that these nations, already face high rates of poverty among their own populations, are “hosting most of these refugees in really, really difficult situations.”
Some reasons for this persistent issue includes a lack of national resources as well as many children getting jobs immediately to help support their families.

“There's the question of livelihood, it's all about livelihood. Questions of citizenship are also crucial in this case,” Basu said.
Canada hasn't been spared from the challenges of educating Syrian refugees, even on a smaller scale. While it is illegal in Canada for children not to be in school, Basu explained that teachers and educators often have trouble keeping them in class, for similar reasons.
“One of the challenges teachers reiterated was many [parents] pulling [their children] out for a couple of months at a time,” she explained. “In high school, a lot of them are working two or three jobs.”

Even when students are attending class, several issues remain.
Overcrowding has proved overwhelming for many Canadian schools, with examples from Halifax and Regina. Ahead of the 2016/2017 school year, reports cited some regions preparing to accept thousands of new students ahead of the 2016/2017 academic year.
In addition, Basu explained that undocumented immigrants in Canada cannot apply to universities as domestic applicants and need to pay international fees.

Canada has been called on by non-profits like CIGI to contribute to the effort to educate Syrian refugee children both domestically and around the world, and just a few years ago donated $103 million to child-education projects abroad including help for displaced Syrian children.
Basu believes however, Canada could be doing more.
“Canada can have a larger voice in the conflict and peace negotiations. These conversations really need to happen.”
ISLAMABAD - A former judge of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday filed an appeal in the Supreme Court against the Peshawar High Court (PHC) for dismissing his petition, challenging the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) decision of not considering his name as a permanent judge of the high court.
Azim Khan Afridi was appointed as an additional judge of the IHC against a reserved seat for FATA on November 21, 2011, however, the JCP in its meeting on October 22, 2012, did not confirm him (Afridi) as the permanent judge of IHC over his alleged wrongdoing.
According to media reports, there were allegations against him (Afridi) that during his tenure as the additional judge of IHC, he appointed 45 of his favourites in the lower judiciary, and the JCP did not make him permanent judge of the IHC.
Afridi challenged the JCP decision in the PHC on December 26, 2012. The PHC after keeping his petition for five years dismissed it on September 5, 2017, as not maintainable and beyond territorial jurisdiction.
Azim on Friday filed the appeal under Article 185 of Constitution and made the secretary law ministry, the secretary JCP, the secretary parliamentary committee and incumbent chief justice and judges of IHC as respondents. He has contended that the findings of the PHC were erroneous and patently illegal.
In his appeal, filed through Muhammad Moazam Butt, Afridi stated that despite untiring, onerous, faithful and dedicated contribution, he was blamed and not confirmed by the JCP.
Afridi said that complaints against Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui were concealed from the JCP to ensure his confirmation as the judge.
Afridi claimed that the entire conspiracy for removing him was aimed at misleading and deceiving the entire nation regarding his involvement in illegal appointments in the lower judiciary of Islamabad. His career and future was purposely destroyed and he was not considered for confirmation despite the meritorious record, hard work and excellent decisions for improving the administrative working of the IHC.
The petitioner said that since his repatriation to PHC, he served as District and Sessions Judge, Judge Special Court Narcotic and Chairman Service Tribunal but the impression (about him) has constantly been haunting him. He urged the apex court to “do away with” the allegations levelled against him by the JCP so that he could resume his “lost position”.
A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, Doc Rivers thought maybe the Clippers had a chance. They had talent, he thought. They could surprise people.
Injuries threatened all of that, but Monday, at least for one night, they found a new hope.
On the same night he was honored with a “Star Wars”-themed bobblehead, returning guard Milos Teodosic hit a clutch three-point shot in the final minute of the Clippers' 96-91 win against the Toronto Raptors at Staples Center.
It's the team's second consecutive victory, both against probable Eastern Conference playoff teams.
“The injuries happen,” Rivers said before the win, “and you go into survival mode.”
Survival mode for this team is drastically different for the Clippers than it has been in the past when Blake Griffin or Chris Paul was sidelined because of an injury. Those teams, even minus a star, still had more talent than most of their opponents.
This version of the Clippers, minus Griffin and starting guard Patrick Beverly and again without Danilo Gallinari after another glute injury, has to win in different ways. It has to do it with effort and force.
“That's got to be one of our talents right now,” Rivers said. “… We scrapped. We played hard. … That's who we have to be right now.”
Monday, the Clippers responded to an early push from the Raptors, who were playing on a second consecutive night after winning Sunday at Sacramento.
The Raptors, one of the NBA's top scoring teams, scored 30 points in the first quarter before the Clippers' defense tightened.
Toronto wound up making only 40% of its shots, 24.1% from three-point range, and was limited to 61 points in the last three quarters.
“We were able to make them shoot tough shots,” Clippers center DeAndre Jordan said. “And, ultimately, we had to get stops to win the game. That's what we did.”
The Clippers trailed by seven points midway through the fourth quarter before going on a 22-10 run to close the game.
They took the lead for only the second time in the game when Austin Rivers made a driving layup. And while the offense couldn't score for the next two minutes, the defense shut out the Raptors to keep the two-point edge.
Jordan extended the lead on a tip-in, but a layup and a free throw by Kyle Lowry made it seem like Toronto might escape with a win.
But Teodosic, back in the lineup after sitting out 22 games because of a plantar fascia injury in his left foot, stepped in and hit the big three-pointer that helped seal the win.
“He's gutty,” Doc Rivers said.
The Clippers even escaped the game without a serious injury — progress considering the kind of season they've had — though it wasn't without suspense.
Montrezl Harrell, who scored a season-high 17 points, landed awkwardly after blocking a shot during the fourth quarter, forcing Rivers to call a timeout and hope for the best.
And the Clippers, for a change, got lucky. Harrell stayed in the game.
“We got a break,” Doc Rivers said. “I called him ‘Lazarus.' He rose from the dead.”
The Clippers now leave on a four-game trip as they continue trying to resurrect their season, and they know they'll be short-handed.
Monday, despite being less talented, the Clippers played harder and more balanced, with six players scoring at least 14 points.
“That's the way we've got to play,” forward Sam Dekker said. “Doc said before the game, ‘We've been dealt a [crummy] hand with injuries.' Every night, we feel like we have a new starting lineup, a new injury, a new this or that. But he said to stay resilient and keep working hard. And, good things will happen.”
Good things happening? They at least can hope.

Alia Bhatt injured on sets of Brahmastra in Bulgaria while shooting for action scene, advised bed rest for fifteen days
Alia Bhatt has injured herself on the sets of Ayan Mukerji's supernatural drama Brahmastra in Bulgaria. The big budget film has a number of intense action sequences. Alia was shooting for one of them when she met an accident.
DNA reports that while performing a stunt, Alia fell and hurt herself. She suffered from severe shoulder and arms injuries and has been advised to take bed rest. Such a situation would keep Alia out of shooting for a while now. The same report states that her arm and shoulder have been bandaged and held up in a sling. The actress has got blood clots in her arms too. Team Brahmastra has also confirmed this news on being contacted. However, they did not confirm if Alia is heading back home post injury.
Though the outdoor shoots of Brahmastra were supposed to be wrapped up by the end of this month, now the team is working out a plan B. Alia can only shoot for close-up scenes and the team is checking if they would need any right now, as reported by DNA.
The film, which has Ranbir Kapoor as the male lead, involves major action scenes that include Alia's presence too. Alia plays the love interest of Kapoor in the film.
Brahmastra is going to be the first part of an adventure trilogy that also stars Amitabh Bachchan in a pivotal role. The film is produced by Karan Johar's Dharma Productions.

Mortgage rates advance for Wednesday
Posted: 9 am ET
Multiple closely watched mortgage rates notched higher today. The average rates on 30-year fixed and 15-year fixed mortgages both climbed higher. The average rate on 5/1 adjustable-rate mortgages, meanwhile, tapered off.
Mortgage rates are constantly changing, but they remain much lower overall than they were before the Great Recession. If you're in the market for a mortgage, it may make sense to go ahead and lock if you see a rate you like. Just be sure to shop around.
Compare mortgage rates in your area now.
30-year fixed mortgages
The average 30-year fixed-mortgage rate is 3.81 percent, up 6 basis points over the last week. A month ago, the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage was higher, at 3.92 percent.
At the current average rate, you'll pay a combined $466.53 per month in principal and interest for every $100,000 you borrow. That's an extra $3.41 compared with last week.
You can use Bankrate's mortgage calculator to get a handle on what your monthly payments would be and see how much you'll save by adding extra payments. It will also help you calculate how much interest you'll pay over the life of the loan.
15-year fixed mortgages
The average 15-year fixed-mortgage rate is 3.04 percent, up 4 basis points from a week ago.
Monthly payments on a 15-year fixed mortgage at that rate will cost around $693 per $100,000 borrowed. That's obviously much higher than the monthly payment would be on a 30-year mortgage at that rate, but it comes with some big advantages: You'll save thousands of dollars over the life of the loan in total interest paid and build equity much more rapidly.
5/1 ARMs
The average rate on a 5/1 ARM is 3.14 percent, down 2 basis points over the last week.
These types of loans are best for those who expect to sell or refinance before the first or second adjustment. Rates could be substantially higher when the loan first adjusts, and thereafter.
Monthly payments on a 5/1 ARM at 3.14 percent would cost about $429 for each $100,000 borrowed over the initial five years, but could increase by hundreds of dollars afterward, depending on the loan's terms.

Bluegrass music lovers take note. The 11th Annual Sally Gap Bluegrass Festival starts Wednesday and runs through Saturday.
For the third straight year, the festival is featuring four nights of entertainment.
Wednesday night will once again be gospel night with Virgil Bowlin and Peerless Mountain and New River Rising set to perform.
Thursday night features a couple of new events, including the first ever Sally Gap Band Competition and bluegrass karaoke with Kenny Stinson and his band, Perfect Tym'n.
“It's like Karaoke but with a live band,” noted Sarah Williams, one of the festival organizers.
Bowlin will also have a free beginners jam on Thursday.
Friday night will be ladies night with five-time International Bluegrass Music Association female vocalist of the year Dale Ann Bradley performing.
“Dale Ann Bradley, who is closing ladies night, just got inducted into the Bluegrass Hall of Fame a few weeks back,” Williams noted.
Also performing Friday will be Kenny Stinson and Perfect Tym'n, and Hedi and Ryan Greer.
On Saturday, Virgil Bowlin and Peerless Mountain, Bobby Hamblin and the Lawless and the Clay Hess Band will perform among many others.
Williams noted that her son, Brady Wallen, would be playing with the Clay Hess Band Saturday.
For the fifth year in a row, the festival will take place at 80 Savoy Beatty Road in Williamsburg on a portion of Whitley County Fiscal Court's 100-acre industrial site. The site is also known as the new Whitley County Fairgrounds.
Benefits good cause
There is a $10 admission charge on Wednesday, a $20 admission charge on Thursday, and a $25 admission charge Friday and Saturday for the festival. A four-day pass is available for $60.
Williams said there are still some campsites that are available for a $50 fee to cover the four-day festival.
Proceeds from the festival go to benefit the American Traditional Music Project.
“The American Traditional Music Project has been a non-profit program for 15 years. In the past, they have put on school programs to educate children about bluegrass music,” Williams noted. “They have also done teacher workshops where teachers can get continuing education credits and learn how to introduce Bluegrass into their classrooms.”
This year's festival will once again feature various workshops, including a workshop for children to introduce them to the origin of various instruments, which is being sponsored this year by Gibson's Music. Children taking part in the workshop will get to build their own musical instrument.
There will also be free fiddle, guitar, banjo and mandolin workshops over the weekend for festival attendees.
Some of the adult workshops will be conducted by Bowlin, who is an instructor at the Hazard Community & Technical College's Kentucky School of Bluegrass & Traditional Music.
There will also be a free workshop on clogging, which will be taught by Ms. Duffy from Canada, and Bowling will also teach a shape note workshop.
The American Traditional Music Project hopes to start offering free music lessons for children, whose families can't afford lessons, and for veterans with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), who are undergoing music therapy.
“It hasn't actually kicked off yet, but that is what we are working towards,” Williams added about the free music lessons.
About 1,000 people attended last year's festival and Williams is expecting about the same number of people this year.
Entertainment for the Wednesday show will start at 5 p.m.
Entertainment for the Thursday's show starts at 5 p.m. Entertainment for the Friday show will start at 2 p.m. and Saturday festivities start at 1 p.m.

Anthony Scaramucci, the short-lived White House Communications Director, took to CBS' “Late Show with Stephen Colbert” to levy some stiff accusations about the inner workings of the Trump administration.
During an appearance slated to air Monday night and taped earlier in the day, Scaramucci told Colbert in an interview segment previewed by CBS that he felt his relationship with former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus was “adversarial,” and then reiterated his feelings that Priebus and Trump advisor Steve Bannon have been leaking information to the press.
“There was no love lost there,” said Scaramucci of his relationship with Priebus.
When asked by Colbert if he felt Bannon might leave the White House soon, Scaramucci replied, “that's up to the President,” and then added, “If it was up to me, he'd be gone. But it's not up to me.”
CBS is expected to air the full interview between Colbert and Scaramucci Monday night.
This appearance is Scaramucci's first on one of the nation's late-night programs since he left the White House after a short and controversial tenure. Scaramucci appeared Sunday on ABC's “This Week” Sunday public affairs program

The Vancouver Aquarium says for the first time, scientists have sequenced the genome of the beluga whale.
The research was completed using genetic material Qila and Aurora, the two belugas who died at the facility last year.
The project was funded by Genome BC and completed by BC Cancer's Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre (GSC). The results were published Monday in the scientific journal Genes.

Vancouver Aquarium head veterinarian Dr. Martin Haulena said the information gleaned from the mother and daughter beluga could go a long way to protecting future cetaceans.
“Once you know the template, the model, the sort of fingerprints of how these animals are put together that means it's easier to investigate things like pathogens and exposure.”
WATCH: Two beluga whales die weeks apart at Vancouver Aquarium
Indeed, researchers only got the idea to sequence the belugas' genome when the pair fell ill last fall.
Dr. Steven Jones with the GSC suggested that studying the pair's DNA could help veterinarians determine what was making them sick.

Researchers eventually determined that a toxin was responsible for the whales' deaths, after ruling out a virus or bacteria. The exact substance that killed the pair remains unknown.

While the belugas couldn't be saved, researchers said their deaths have advanced the scientific understanding of their species.
“We had a lot of beluga DNA and we realized we had enough to sequence the complete beluga genome,” said Dr. Jones in a statement.

In November, Chester the false killer whale died at the aquarium, however this time veterinarians believe it was caused by a bacterial infection.
Helen, a Pacific white-sided dolphin, is now the last cetacean currently living at the Aquarium — though the facility owns several belugas on breeding loan to U.S. facilities.
In May, the Vancouver Park Board approved a motion banning the aquarium from bringing any new cetaceans to its Stanley Park facility.

China will ban all domestic ivory trade and processing by the end of 2017, state media reported Friday, a move hailed by activists as a “game changer” for African elephants.
African ivory is highly sought after in China where it is seen as a status symbol prices for a kilo (2.2 pounds) can reach as much as $1,100.
“China will gradually stop the processing and sales of ivories for commercial purposes by the end of 2017,” the official Xinhua news agency said, citing a government statement.
“Before that deadline, law enforcement agencies will continue to clamp down on illegalities associated with the elephant's tusk,” Xinhua added, citing an official with the State Forestry Administration.
The announcement follows Beijing's announcement in March to widen a ban on imports of all ivory and ivory products acquired before 1975, after pressure to restrict a trade that sees thousands of elephants slaughtered every year.
Xinhua said the complete ban would affect “34 processing enterprises and 143 designated trading venues, with dozens to be closed by the end of March 2017”.
“This is great news that will shut down the world's largest market for elephant ivory,” Aili Kang, executive director of the Wildlife Conservation Society in Asia, said in a statement.
“I am very proud of my country for showing this leadership that will help ensure that elephants have a fighting chance to beat extinction. This is a game changer for Africa's elephants.”
Conservationists estimate that more than 20,000 elephants were killed for their ivory last year, with similar tolls in previous years. The WWF campaign group says 415,000 of the animals remain.
The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which took effect in 1975, banned the ivory trade in 1989.
China permits the resale of ivory bought before the 1989 ban — and also has a stockpile purchased with CITES approval in 2008, which it releases for sale with certification.
WWF also praised China's move to a complete ban but called on the Chinese territory of Hong Kong to bring forward a plan to end its ivory trade by 2021.
WWF said legal research published by the conservation group shows an ivory ban could be imposed “much sooner under current Hong Kong law”.
“With China's market closed, Hong Kong can become a preferred market for traffickers to launder illegal ivory under cover of the legal ivory trade,” said Cheryl Lo, senior wildlife crime officer at WWF.
The United States the world's second-largest consumer of illegal ivory after China announced in June a near-total ban on the trade of African elephant ivory but with notable exemptions including antiques.

Padmaavat: Karni Sena chief Lokendra Singh Kalvi says his group hasn't withdrawn protest
Jaipur: Shree Rajput Karni Sena chief Lokendra Singh Kalvi on Saturday dismissed reports that his outfit has withdrawn protests against Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Padmaavat and said it must be some "fake news" circulated by a "fake Karni Sena".
He also said that his group has made the BJP pay - via its loss in the Rajasthan bypolls - for not respecting the sentiments of the protesting Rajputs.
"There are many fake Karni Senas emerging in India. At present, there are eight such entities operating in the country with vested interests," Kalvi told IANS.
The Rajput leader, whose group has been at the forefront of massive protests against Padmaavat, said there has been a "duplicacy" in matters pertaining to Karni Sena's functioning.
He stressed that there was "only one Rajput Karni Sena operating in India and I proudly say that I am the founder of that organisation". He also asked people to "beware of such similarly named organisations functioning and operating in the market".
The Shree Rajput Karni Sena has been protesting the Deepika Padukone starrer since its inception, claiming the film distorts history.
"We started the initial protests against the release of the film, which we still continue to do. However, the other duplicate Karni Senas are creating a dubious situation by releasing contradictory and fake news," Kalvi added.
Speaking on the Bharatiya Janata Party's loss in the Rajasthan bypolls, the Rajput leader said, "Around 17 organisations have joined hands and declared that they will make sure that BJP loses elections on each and every seat. And we proved what we said. Congress won with a big margin while BJP was a loser on its home turf."
"Jauhar ki jwala mein bahut kuchh jalega. Aur bhi bahut ghatnayen hongi (The fire of jauhar will burn down many things, there is more to come). Padmaavat will decide many things in future. We want the government to understand via political loss how it has hurt the sentiments of people here," Kalvi said.
"We have hit hard on notes as well as votes. Bhansali was expected to get Rs 500 crore return. However, we scuttled his dreams and cut the profit margin to Rs 150 crore. Similarly, the vote share of the BJP was reduced," he added.
"I have met 21 Chief Ministers and am I looking forward to meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi soon. I have got the call from PMO asking about my schedule and have given them my schedule. Will see when can I meet him and apprise him on the present situation," Kalvi added.
The Rajput leader strongly denied having any political aspirations. "None of us have any dream of floating a political party," he said.
The Rajput Karni Sena on Friday had announced that it had decided to end the protests against Bhansali's Padmaavat stating that the film "glorifies the valour of the Rajputs".
Shree Rashtriya Rajput Karni Sena's Mumbai leader, Yogendra Singh Kartar, said that a few members of the outfit watched the film on the directions of the organisation's national President Sukhdev Singh Gogamadi and found that the "film glorifies" the valour and sacrifice of Rajputs, and "every Rajput would feel proud" after watching it.

Ranbir Kapoor-starrer action adventure Shamshera is set to hit theatres on 31 July, 2020.
Ranbir Kapoor and Sanjay Dutt... #Shamshera release date finalised: 31 July 2020... Costars Vaani Kapoor... Produced by Aditya Chopra... Directed by Karan Malhotra... Starts 2018-end... Shooting will wrap by mid-2019. — taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh) July 4, 2018
Produced by Yash Raj Films, it features Kapoor as a dacoit, a character that Kapoor has not explored in his previous films. In May 2018, director Karan Malhotra roped in Sanjay Dutt to play the villain in the film. This will mark Dutt's first film under the Yash Raj banner.
In a statement issued by Yash Raj Films, the Agneepath director had said, “Shamshera is a ferocious and fearless character in the film. Therefore his nemesis, the villain had to be even more fierce and monumental in every aspect. Who better than Sanjay sir to give us that impact on screen?”
Kapoor is paired with Befikre actress Vaani Kapoor, who plays a travelling performer in the film, making it the first on-screen collaboration between the two actors.
Shamshera will be a "high-octane" film with "jaw-dropping action sequences," according to Yash Raj Films.
Kapoor will be working with the production house after nine years following box office hits Bachna Ae Haseeno (2008) and Rocket Singh: Salesman of The Year (2009).
Shamshera is set in the heartland of India and will go on the floors by the end of 2018. The shooting will wrap up by mid-2019.
After 29 games, the New York Islanders stand at 16-10-3, which is good enough for fourth place in the Metropolitan Division. However, there is no room to rest. While the Islanders hold the first wild-card spot, the Pittsburgh Penguins and the New York Rangers are right behind them. Coming into the season, not many people would have those two teams missing the playoffs. Now, the Islanders will have to fend them off.
If they want to keep that position, they'll have to improve their recent play. The Islanders are losers of their last three games and are a mediocre 5-4-1 in their last 10. Despite this latest slump, Hockey Reference still has the Islanders' chances of clinching a postseason berth at 77.1 percent. There's no doubt the Islanders have a playoff offense, but if the scoring stops, can they still get in? Let's find out.
Goals, Goals, and More Goals
The Islanders have scored a whopping 103 goals this season, good for second in the NHL. This offensive outburst is due in part to their new second line made up of Andrew Ladd, Jordan Eberle, and Mathew Barzal. Eberle was acquired in a trade with the Edmonton Oilers, and Barzal is in his first season as a pro since being drafted by the Islanders in 2015.
Barzal has been the second-line center behind Tavares the Islanders have longed for. In 29 games, Barzal has eight goals and 20 assists for 28 points. Barzal has been a big reason that the second line has been so dominant driving play with great puck possession numbers. Barzal's Corsi-for is 55.8 percent, Ladd's is 56.3 percent, and Eberle's is 56.9 percent. Anything over 50 percent means that player is controlling the puck more often than not.
The second line hasn't been the only line that's been effective. Josh Bailey is currently in the midst of a career year, with 32 points in 29 games and 27 of those points registering as assists. To put that in perspective, Bailey had 32 points in all 82 games just two seasons ago. Bailey's vision has helped Tavares and Anders Lee bury 17 goals each.
However, one can't expect the Islanders to continue this pace all season. In their last three games, the Islanders have scored three goals or fewer, which is below their team average of 3.6 goals per game. Those three games were losses. This team can certainly score, but constantly outscoring the opponent won't always work as the games get tighter come playoff time.
Logjam at Defense
Since garnering more playing time, Ryan Pulock has proved he belongs. The 23-year-old is averaging 16:31 time on ice in 16 games and has a Corsi-for of 53.1 percent. As impressive as he's been, there's a feeling he can do more offensively. Perhaps he will with a solidified role. With Johnny Boychuk out the past few games, and Thomas Hickey being placed on the IR, coach Doug Weight has had to shuffle his defense pairs a bit.
Outside of Johnny Boychuk and Nick Leddy, the defense is a tad suspect. Pulock is improving and Calvin de Haan is doing his job. Yet, the Islanders haven't nailed down their third pair. Dennis Seidenberg has played in just 11 games and acts mostly as the team's seventh defenseman. Based on his play, that's the way it should be.
Adam Pelech, Thomas Hickey, and Scott Mayfield are the other three defensemen competing for the final two spots. All three have been adequate and average, but Hickey's latest injury makes the decision a little bit easier. However, when he returns, he should get his spot in the lineup back.
Out of the three, Hickey provides the most stability and has shown he can step up in big moments. Don't be surprised if the Islanders deal a defenseman at the trade deadline, because there's simply one too many vying for playing time.
No Clear Number-One in Net
Last but not least, the Islanders' biggest problem. Their situation in goal may be the only thing between them and a playoff run. Neither Thomas Greiss nor Jaroslav Halak has given the Islanders reason to believe they can carry the workload as a starter. Greiss has been the bigger disappointment of the two with a terrible .890 save percentage and a 3.79 goals-against average.
Halak has been slightly better, but he still holds a .903 save percentage of his own and a 2.93 goals-against average. Both are considered below average by league standards and are a big reason the Islanders are ranked 28th in the NHL in goals against. The team defense hasn't been great, but any team needs a few big saves and both goaltenders haven't been able to come up with them.
Do The Islanders Make It?
I fully expect the Islanders to test the market on goaltenders in the coming months. So far, this team has exceeded expectations, but that can fade quickly with one bad stretch. While the Islanders can roll four scoring lines, they still rotate between two backup goalies.
If the Islanders don't make any changes in net, I still think they have what it takes to make the playoffs, but it won't be easy. Maybe a goalie like Robin Lehner would be available for trade. If the Islanders acquire a starting-caliber goalie, I could see them being one of the best teams in the Eastern Conference outside of the Tampa Bay Lightning. Until then, they'll likely be fighting for their playoff lives the rest of the way.

The Detroit Lions proved correct the popular thought of football being a pass-first game in 2017.
Detroit finished seventh in points scored (410) and 13th in the NFL in yards per game (337.8), despite finishing dead last in rushing with 76.3 yards per contest.
That's simply remarkable.
Detroit missed the playoffs due to a 9-7 finish and a strong year from the NFC South, which produced both wild cards. For much of the season, though, the Lions were in the hunt. Their downfall was a lack of consistency from week to week.
That isn't discouraging Lions receiver Marvin Jones.
"We have all the ability to be the best in the league," Jones said Friday from radio row at Super Bowl LII, via the Detroit Free Press. "We have all the tools."
We "could" do anything. An asteroid "could" strike the planet before kickoff Sunday. You "could" stumble upon the greatest source of renewable energy on earth and effectively render fossil fuels useless. Dez "could" have caught it.
But Jones has reason to be confident, starting with, well, himself.
Jones morphed into one of the league's most under-appreciated big-play threats in 2017, seemingly coming down with a huge grab on a weekly basis. The numbers -- 61 receptions, 1,101 yards and nine touchdowns -- back it up. The most telling: His 18.0 yards per reception, the highest per-catch mark of any receiver with 20 or more grabs in the 2017 season.
Yes, you read that correctly. No one was consistently worth big gains through the air more than Jones.
Add that in with top-three passer Matthew Stafford, fellow 1,000-yard receiver Golden Tate, the return of left tackle Taylor Decker and a healthy Rick Wagner, and the Lions are set up for success in 2018.
"With our second year, you have seen a lot of improvement," Jones said. "You have seen a lot of continuity within all of us, because it was all of our first year in the system, [offensive coordinator] Jim Bob [Cooter] included, so we're all getting to know each other and stuff. And this past year I think a lot of things were done. It was great in terms of how we connect with each other, what we expect and stuff like that. and he's great at doing it, so it's nothing but excitement coming forth."
Much has been made of the improvement of Detroit's offense since Stafford and Cooter were paired together in the middle of the 2016 season. Imagine if Detroit can get something going on the ground while also expecting a defensive improvement under Matt Patricia, who's expected to be hired as Detroit's new head coach after Super Bowl LII.
The Lions rolled with speedy-but-flukey back Ameer Abdullah (3.3 yards per carry in 2017) and satellite back Theo Riddick in 2017, but enter a draft rich at the running back position. Detroit's second-round pick (52nd overall) could be used to find a key contributor (USC's Ronald Jones, Daniel Jeremiah's No. 12 prospect, comes to mind).
The adjustment period under a new head coach, the potential personnel changes (is Eric Ebron returning?) and the way the rest of the NFC North takes shape (Aaron Rodgers' healthy return, the future of the Vikings, Chicago's continued rebuild) will all directly affect the potential of Jones' prediction coming true. With Stafford, Jones, Tate and even the promising Kenny Golladay, the Lions appear to be positioned for more offensive success in 2018.
Cibulkova suffers surprise defeat, Barty cruises in Nottingham
Antonia Lottner had plenty to celebrate at the Rosmalen Grass Court Championships as she sent Dominika Cibulkova packing.
by Omnisport News 14 Jun 2017, 23:19 IST
Dominika Cibulkova
Top seed Dominika Cibulkova suffered a surprise defeat at the Rosmalen Grass Court Championships on Wednesday as she was beaten by qualifier Antonia Lottner in a three-set thriller.
Little had been expected of world number 161 Lottner ahead of their first-round meeting in 'S-Hertogenbosch but she took advantage of Cibulkova's serving troubles to seal a 7-5 2-6 6-4 win.
Lottner broke the two-time Wimbledon quarter-finalist on four occasions to secure her first win on the WTA Tour and a second-round meeting with Evgeniya Rodina.
Four of the quarter-finalists in the Netherlands are already decided after victories for Carina Witthoeft, Lesia Tsurenko, Natalia Vikhlyantseva and Anett Kontaveit.
In Nottingham there was another qualifier celebrating after Kristie Ahn cruised past Magda Linette 6-3 6-1 in the Aegon Open second round.
Ashleigh Barty avoided a similar fate to Linette, though, as she only dropped three games in a comprehensive 6-2 6-1 win over Jana Fett, the Australian setting up a potential quarter-final with top seed Johanna Konta.
Wednesday also saw straight-set wins for Donna Vekic and Tsvetana Pironkova - the latter needing 77 minutes to dispose of Kurumi Nara 6-3 6-2.
The RCMP are investigating what prompted the driver of a pickup truck to reverse across a Red Deer parking lot and smash into a pizzeria, injuring an employee and causing “very extensive damage” to the restaurant on Thursday night.
“While preliminary investigation indicates that this occurrence appears to be intentional, we can't speculate at this time,” Staff Sgt. Jeff McBeth, of the Red Deer RCMP detachment, said in a news release on Friday.
According to police, officers were called to the Westview Shopping Plaza shortly after 9 p.m., after a pickup truck was seen crashing into Papa Baldy's restaurant. They said an employee suffered minor injuries and three people were either inside or near the pizzeria when the crash occurred.
“We had a very tragic and disgusting thing happen tonight,” reads a post attributed to “Mama Baldy” that was posted to the restaurant's Facebook page on Thursday night.
“Our store was attacked by an unknown person.”
View photos of the damage the pizzeria sustained below:
“[Restaurant staff] are more than lucky and blessed to be able to walk away with only bumps and bruises, I am in total disgust and shock that someone would do something like this and put innocent people in danger.”
The RCMP said they are looking for the suspect who was driving the pickup truck, which is described as a black Dodge Ram, loaded with concrete in the rear box. They said it will have damage on its rear end.
A photo of the suspect vehicle can be seen below.
“All efforts are being made to solve this crime and we are looking for public tips,” McBeth said. “As always, public tips can be crucial to our ability to solve and reduce crimes.”
“We thank our lucky stars that there were no valued customers in the store at the time and all my staff are safe,” reads a post on Papa Baldy's Facebook page.
Anyone with information about the suspect or what happened is asked to call the Red Deer RCMP detachment at 403-343-5575 or their local police department. Tips can also be anonymously submitted to Crime Stoppers by phone at 1-800-222-8477 or online.
HONG KONG (Reuters) - A British banker, jailed for life in Hong Kong last year for the murder of two Indonesian women he tortured and raped in his luxury apartment, is due to launch an appeal on Tuesday. Rurik Jutting, who is in his early 30s, a former Bank of America employee, had denied murdering Sumarti Ningsih, 23, and Seneng Mujiasih, 26, in 2014 on grounds of diminished responsibility due to alcohol and drug abuse and sexual disorders. The Cambridge-educated Jutting pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter in a case that gripped the financial hub. The jury unanimously found him guilty of murder and he was sentenced to life in prison in the former British colony in November last year. Jutting's lawyer, Michael Vidler, said the grounds for appeal would focus on the “directions given by the deputy judge to the jury”. Jutting is expected to appear in court. In strongly worded closing remarks at the end of the trial, Deputy High Court Judge Michael Stuart-Moore said the case was one of the most horrifying the Chinese-ruled territory had known. He described Jutting as the “archetypal sexual predator” who represented an extreme danger to women, especially in the sex trade, and cautioned that the possibility he would murder again if freed would be very likely. It took the jury, made up of four women and five men, about six hours, including a lunch break, to reach its decision. Lawyers for Jutting, the grandson of a British policeman in Hong Kong and a Chinese woman, had previously argued that cocaine and alcohol abuse as well as personality disorders of sexual sadism and narcissism had impaired his ability to control his behaviour. The prosecution rejected this, stating Jutting was able to form judgements and exercise self-control before and after the killings, filming his torture of Ningsih on his mobile phone as well as hours of footage in which he discussed the murders, bingeing on cocaine and his graphic sexual fantasies.

A new report by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives (CCPA) has found that child-care costs across Canada have risen faster than inflation in 71 per cent of cities since 2016, and in 82 per cent of cities since 2014.
This is the fourth report in an annual series the CCPA conducts to provide a picture of the median costs for child care in Canada's 28 largest cities, including full-time care for infants (under 18 months to two years), toddlers (two to three years) and preschoolers (four to six years).

“This year, we've found that the costs of childcare are getting worse,” David Macdonald, senior economist at the CCPA, says to Global News. “Parents are probably thinking it's time for a time-out on these fees.”
The biggest increases were seen in Toronto, both compared to last year and 2014. The Greater Toronto Area has the highest infant care fees at $1,758 per month, while the suburbs of Mississauga and Vaughan follow closely at $1,400 per month. Preschoolers have the most numerous spaces in Toronto, and the costs average $1,212 per month, followed by $1,000 a month in major cities including Ottawa, Calgary, Richmond and Vancouver.
Since 2014, Toronto has experienced the highest preschool care costs, rising six times faster than inflation, while Richmond saw the highest hike since 2016 at roughly 10-times faster than inflation.
“When we compare fees to other years, it's usually for preschool fees,” since these are the most used child-care programs, Macdonald says. “Prior to these years, most families are either finding a relative to take care of their kids or they're doing it themselves.”
There is, however, a silver lining to the 2017 findings, albeit a faint one. Since banning waitlist fees, Ontario saw a drop in these charges (which typically range from $20 to $40, and can add up if parents are putting their kids on multiple lists), although some facilities in Toronto continue to charge to put your child on a waitlist. The same trend was seen in British Columbia, although it's not due to public policy, Macdonald says since the government has not taken action to ban waitlists.
The cheapest cities for childcare remain Quebec, Winnipeg and Charlottetown, where the governments have set low fees and provide operational grants to providers.
“The costs in Quebec have gone up by a substantial percentage — 20 per cent — since the start of this survey [in 2014], but they're still by far the cheapest in all the provinces,” Macdonald says.
The reason for this increase is that the government now uses a sliding scale to determine how much to charge for child care based on the median income of the city. However, he says, from a dollar perspective, it's still the cheapest province.

“Montreal is still eight-times cheaper than Toronto. Where Montreal parents pay $168 per month in child care, irrespective of the age of the child, in Toronto, the cheapest is for preschoolers and it's still $1,200 per month.”
For the first time this year, the CCPA also analyzed the costs in selected rural areas. The report notes that in rural areas of Ontario and Alberta, the fees are not significantly cheaper than in nearby cities.
“Where Canadians live largely determines whether they will be able to access affordable child care,” Martha Friendly, executive director of the Childcare Resource and Research Unit, said in a statement. “Governments that set fees and provide operational funding consistently have the lowest child-care fees, compared to areas where the market is left to decide what families will pay.”
Macdonald calls child care affordability “an accident of birth,” pointing to the disparity of costs between Ottawa ($1,000) and Gatineau ($183).
“There is hope for 2018 since the federal government has shown that it's more interested in childcare costs than ever before,” he says. “The amounts are likely too small to have an impact on fees directly for now, but it's promising and we're seeing a variety of provincial measures being put into pilot projects. Another year will tell if some of the bigger provinces will change their system.”
GUCA, Serbia (Reuters) - The 57h Guca Brass Band Festival, Serbia's liveliest traditional music event, has attracted tens of thousands of people crowding the streets and savoring the trumpet beat.
Guca, a normally sleepy town with only 3,700 people in the rolling hills of southwestern Serbia, is hosting the country's biggest party, with 50 brass bands competing for the coveted Golden Trumpet.
Launched in 1961 with just four bands and only 2,500 visitors, Guca has since received more than 15 million people.
The “Dragacevo Trumpeters Assembly,” as the festival is officially called, now lures not only Serbians but tourists from around the world.

"One Serbian girl in Germany told me about it ... and now I'm here, it's great, I love it," said Maria, a Bulgarian tourist in her 20s.
The music has a long tradition in Serbia - it goes back to a royal decree establishing a military brass band in 1831.

The bands, those competing for the prize and those weaving through dozens of tents teeming with guests eating, drinking and partying, make good money from tips.
Most visitors drink beer and plum brandy and eat barbecued meat or a local delicacy, seasoned spicy cabbage with three kinds of meat which simmers for hours in large clay pots.
In an attempt to avoid the serious road accidents which have marred the festival in the past, police have ordered all drivers along the two roads leading in and out of Guca to take a breathalyzer test.
Chelsea defender Andreas Christensen has thanked former club captain John Terry for his advice which helped the 21-year-old overcome his recent poor form.
The Denmark international has imposed himself in the centre of Chelsea's defence this campaign, making 36 appearances across all competitions, but made costly errors in recent matches.
Christensen has been culpable for goals conceded against Barcelona in the Champions League and Manchester City and Manchester United in the Premier League, leading the Dane to seek out Terry, who is currently at Aston Villa, for advice.
"My team-mates have seen all my other performances, so they know that these mistakes aren't typical for me," Christensen told Eurosport.
"I have had a small talk with John Terry. He has also experienced setbacks and it is always nice to talk to someone watching it from the outside and to learn that they have experienced the same.
"He told me that it is natural to make mistakes and he tried to put it in perspective for me saying that... we can't change a goal scored against us, so when we make mistakes it is more crucial and it is easy for people to point fingers.
"I have realised it, looked at it and now I have moved on."
Christensen seemed to have regained his composure in last Sunday's 2-1 win over Leicester City in the FA Cup quarter-finals and says manager Antonio Conte's continued trust in him has made a positive impact.
"I thought I might be out of the next match (after the errors) but I try to tell myself that before these matches I have played all the other ones almost with no mistakes at all," Christensen added.
"I hope that is the reason I get to start because the coach knows he can trust me, I haven't made any mistakes but been very solid for a long period. I am focusing on all the good games I have played this season."
Chelsea, who are fifth in the league, host Tottenham Hotspur on 1 April in a match between teams eyeing a top-four finish.
Jenni Konner, left, and Lena Dunham at the Sundance Film Festival in January for director Matt Wolf's movie "It's Me Hilary: The Man Who Drew Eloise."
“What am I going to change my Twitter bio to?” Jenni Konner wonders aloud.
A few days before the finale of “Girls” — the HBO series she's run for the past five years alongside Lena Dunham — Konner is in the midst of a minor existential crisis. On her social media page, the 45-year-old has long characterized herself this way: “i write, direct and ep #Girls on HBO.”
As of Monday, that will no longer be the case.
“I'm in a definite postpartum scene right now, as you can tell by the fact that you're up at my house and I'm drinking wine at 5 o'clock,” she says lounging on a pool chaise in her backyard, hidden in one of the winding hillsides of Nichols Canyon.
Across the country in New York, Dunham was feeling similarly discombobulated. She'd made plans to watch the finale with co-star Allison Williams and pizza. But saying goodbye to the show she began work on at 23 was proving challenging.
“I miss everybody already,” Dunham, now 30, said over the telephone last week. “At a certain point, my entire life was making the show … then I entered a long-term relationship, I had a career, I was financially stable, I was living in a neighborhood that Hannah has probably never even walked through. Our lives diverged.”
While they may be moving away from “Girls,” Dunham and Konner aren't ready to bid farewell to each other. They're still running their feminist newsletter, Lenny — an amalgamation of their names — which is about to celebrate its second anniversary. And through their joint production company, A Casual Romance, they're planning a “VICE”-esque Lenny docuseries for HBO and looking at making their first film.
Plus, they're totally co-dependent. Every morning, Dunham texts Konner first thing to make sure her partner made it through the night.
“It'll say, like, ‘Hi, baby!' but it's to make sure I'm alive,” said Konner. “If I don't respond, I'm dead, or something terrible has happened. So I have learned to respond instantly.”
Alan Branch's return to practice was paramount — particularly because he plays defensive tackle, he explained.
The New England Patriots defensive lineman spent the start of training camp on the physically unable to performance, and was unable to participate in drills. He sounded pleased to get back on the field for the first time on Monday.
“It's important just for me to get out here as soon as I was able to get out here,” Branch told reporters after practice Monday. “It's just the more practices you get under your belt, especially as a defensive tackle, the better, just because I can't go into the grocery store and tell someone to line up and push them in the face. A lot of the other spots, like receiver, quarterback, you can practice catching and throwing, things of that nature. Defensive tackle is a different beast.”
Branch missed the start of the last three training camps. In 2015 and 2016, he couldn't pass the conditioning test. He wouldn't disclose why he missed the first two weeks of 2017 training camp.
“You can ask Bill [Belichick] that one,” Branch said.
Branch immediately took his place with the starting defense, as he was a core member of the Patriots Super Bowl-winning team in 2016. Entering his 11th season, Branch figures to have another large role on the team, which is exceptional for the 32-year-old who didn't think his career would last this long.
“My plan coming out of college was to play 10 [seasons] and be done,” Branch said. “I'm blessed enough where I'm physically still able to play.”
Branch was then asked what fuels him to keep playing past that 10-year goal.
“It's the camaraderie, the competition level, especially,” he said. “I don't think there are too many other jobs out there where you can go against another person, and just try to enforce your dominance on them, and have the satisfaction feeling knowing that you defeated double teams against two players trying to stop you from getting to a place, or getting back to the quarterback and causing havoc.”
Samsung Electronics Co Ltd is expected to post its smallest profit growth in more than a year in the second quarter, as lacklustre sales of its premium Galaxy smartphones overshadow its highly profitable chip business.
Analysts expect Samsung's smartphone sales to drop in the April-June quarter, following a more than 2 percent drop in the previous quarter as consumers flock to cheaper models from Chinese rivals such as Xiaomi Corp.
Samsung's lead over Apple Inc in the global smartphone market is under pressure after the US firm's iPhone X exceeded market expectations while a lack of technological innovation dogs Samsung offerings.
“Functions (that) Samsung's mobile phones have been not attractive enough for customers to spend more money on,” said Song Myung-sup, analyst at HI Investment & Securities.
Samsung's latest Galaxy S9 flagship phone, launched in mid-March, boasts lots of software but little in the way of technological wizardry. It is on track to sell less in its launch year than its predecessor Galaxy S8 series sold in 2017 after its debut, analysts said.
This is expected to drag on profit growth when the Korean conglomerate posts second-quarter earnings on 6 July.
Analysts expect an operating profit of 14.9 trillion won ($13.3 billion) for the quarter, up 5.7 percent from a year earlier but less than the record 15.6 trillion won it posted in the March quarter, according to a Thomson Reuters poll.
Samsung, whose shares are down 9 percent so far this year, is also expected to issue guidance for the April-June quarter on 6 July, giving estimates for revenue and operating profit. It will disclose detailed results in late July.
Chinese Challengers
Samsung relies on traditional distribution to sell phones, whereas competitors have pulled ahead by leveraging online sales to provide high-end smartphones at competitive prices, Counterpoint analyst Shobhit Srivastava said.
Some investors are sceptical whether Samsung's upcoming line-up of foldable phones with sleek OLED screens will be innovative enough to gain traction with customers. The new Galaxy Note will debut on 9 August in New York.
“Samsung has to show something that will change the paradigm,” said Park Jung-hoon, a fund manager at HDC Asset Management that owns Samsung Electronics shares.
“Market watchers don't have high expectations for its smartphone business at the moment, when Chinese players have already caught up in technology and ideas.”
In China, the world's biggest smartphone market, Samsung's market share was just 1.3 percent in the first quarter, according to data from research firm Strategy Analytics, compared with Huawei's, 22.5 percent.
Chinese smartphone makers - Huawei, Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi — held the top spots in China, while Apple was the only foreign firm in the top five.
In India, Xiaomi displaced Samsung as market leader last year and continued to lead in the world's second-biggest smartphone market in the first quarter, according to a report from research firm Counterpoint.
To be sure, Samsung remains the world's largest smartphone maker, selling about 80 million gadgets a quarter and holding more than a fifth of the global market.
Its troubles in the mobile segment are overshadowing the success of its chips business, which generates about three quarters of Samsung's operating profit and about a third of its revenue.
Operating profit in the chips business is expected to grow about 50 percent to a record 12.5 trillion won in the second quarter versus a year ago, according to analysts, as servers, gaming PCs and cryptocurrency mining devices demand more firepower to process streaming data.
They called him “The Don,” and with good reason.A larger-than-life character with a sharp wit who thrived in the spotlight, Don Matthews took wicked pleasure in keeping people around him on edge with his abrasive, no-nonsense style.The Hall of Famer, who died Wednesday at the age of 77, was one of the most prolific coaches in CFL history with 231 wins and 10 Grey Cups on his resume.But he was also a controversial figure who had a high-risk, high-reward philosophy.Players traditionally loved suiting up for him because of his reputation for creating a winning atmosphere and protecting his athletes. During the regular season, Matthews' teams rarely hit during practice and he routinely allowed his players to participate in creating the weekly game plan.Article Continued BelowYet he maintained his distance. While known for being a “player's coach,” he could also be ruthless when it came to making tough personnel decisions and he wasn't afraid to bench a veteran or cut him outright if he wasn't producing.“It's that balance and to do that you must be brilliant,” said running back/slotback Mike (Pinball) Clemons, who won two Grey Cups over three seasons playing for Matthews in Toronto. “Some people try to be a player's coach but they let it go too far and the players run the roost.“He was a player's coach but he was also the boss and everybody knew that.”
The first thing Dave Asprey will tell you about his newly opened Bulletproof Labs in Santa Monica is that it's not a gym. Rather, he says, it's the world's first “human upgrade” facility dedicated exclusively to biohacking, or tweaking your biology for better performance.
At first glance, the light-filled space adjacent to his Bulletproof Coffee café on Main Street certainly looks like a gym, with personal trainers standing by and gleaming equipment lined up.
But take a closer look, and that equipment is unlike anything you're used to seeing in a health club, from the cockpit-style atmospheric cell trainer by the door to the rotating virtual float tank in the center of the room. These are the same machines that Asprey has in the $1-million performance lab at his house in Victoria, Canada.
“It has been a dream for several years to make this level of technology available for everyone,” said Asprey, the world's most famous biohacker. “Part of the role Bulletproof plays in society is to make people aware of all the things they can do to tap into their full power — and it's frustrating to me that this kind of amazing technology isn't more widely available because it makes such a big difference.”
With this first lab, Asprey and his partners are learning how to scale these “stacks” of treatments for mind, body and cellular health for a larger audience of Paleoites, Bulletproof podcast listeners and butter coffee drinkers, with locations to follow in other cities.
Brain and body hacks
Some of the lab's equipment might be familiar to elite athletes and hard-core fitness enthusiasts. There is the oxygen trainer, which uses a bike and an oxygen mask that alternates between 100% oxygen to low oxygen air to optimize cardiovascular function and performance. Or the cryotherapy chamber, in which three-minute stints in temperatures as low as minus 250 degrees Fahrenheit are meant to decrease inflammation, enhance recovery and boost the immune system.
Although Asprey may not want to call it a gym, many of the machines are designed to complement or expand on the gains its users have made at the gym, starting with the cheat machine, which delivers an adaptive resistance strength workout that eliminates the user's ability to “cheat” or use momentum, said to deliver a week's workout in 15 minutes.

There's also a bone density trainer to support all that muscle, as well as “cold cardio,” a cooling and compression bike that is being tested by NASA for space flights to Mars.
Other treatments for cognition and mental performance include neurofeedback; a dry float tank that induces a rejuvenating, dreamlike state; light therapy; and heart rate training to manage stress response.
While they're between treatments, members can have a vitamin IV infusion administered by a nurse at its in-house lab and clinic area.
“Most of the technologies are focused on recovery, immune system function, cellular health and cognitive performance, and other areas not available in the standard fitness concept,” Asprey says.
Pulling ahead of the research curve
If this all sounds a bit out there, it is.
Much of the research on this equipment is still in the early stages and therefore, like biohacking, it's an experiment you're performing on yourself in hopes of getting ahead of the research curve and feeling and performing better.
Because the treatments are unfamiliar to most people, staff members expect people to come in to try a few individual treatments before they commit to a membership, which ranges from $500 a month to around $1,500 per month depending on frequency of use. Each membership includes a battery of tests and an individualized treatment plan depending on performance goals.
It's certainly not inexpensive, but Asprey's team says if you come in once a week, it's comparable to pay for a very high-end personal training session. And for many, he says, it will be the thing that helps them feel and look better, when traditional workouts and dietary changes are not enough.
“This,” he says, “is about getting the best biological return on the effort you put in, and that works for everyone.”

Washington - A rifle-wielding opponent of President Donald Trump opened fire on US lawmakers practicing for a charity baseball game Wednesday, wounding a top Republican congressman and four others before he was fatally injured in a shootout with police.
The 66-year-old gunman was identified as James T. Hodgkinson of Belleville, Illinois, an ardent supporter of left-wing Senator Bernie Sanders - who said he was “sickened” by what he called a “despicable act.”
In an address to the nation, Trump appealed for unity following the early morning assault in the Washington suburb of Alexandria, Virginia, which came amid high political tension in the US capital after a vitriol-filled 2016 election. “We are strongest when we are unified and when we work together for the common good,” said the president.
Congressman Steve Scalise, the number three Republican in the House of Representatives, was expected to recover after being shot in the hip.
Four others were wounded: a congressional aide, a lobbyist and two Capitol Police officers.
A rifle-wielding opponent of President Donald Trump opened fire on US lawmakers practicing for a charity baseball game Wednesday, wounding a top Republican congressman and four others before he was fatally injured in a shootout with police.
The 66-year-old gunman was identified as James T. Hodgkinson of Belleville, Illinois, an ardent supporter of left-wing Senator Bernie Sanders - who said he was “sickened” by what he called a “despicable act.”
In an address to the nation, Trump appealed for unity following the early morning assault in the Washington suburb of Alexandria, Virginia, which came amid high political tension in the US capital after a vitriol-filled 2016 election. “We are strongest when we are unified and when we work together for the common good,” said the president. Congressman Steve Scalise, the number three Republican in the House of Representatives, was expected to recover after being shot in the hip.
Four others were wounded: a congressional aide, a lobbyist and two Capitol Police officers.
Hodgkinson's social media posts displayed strong anti-Trump sentiment. “I know he wasn't happy with the way things were going, the election results and stuff,” his brother, Michael Hodgkinson, told The New York Times. But he said news of the shooting came “totally out of the blue.” Sanders swiftly responded to report the suspect had volunteered on his presidential campaign. “I am sickened by this despicable act,” he said. “Let me be as clear as I can be. Violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society and I condemn this action in the strongest possible terms.”
All votes in the House of Representatives were cancelled for Wednesday, but the annual Congressional baseball game will go on as planned Thursday night at Nationals Park in the US capital. The shooting took place at around 7:00 am (1100 GMT) as the Republican team practiced for the charity game, a well-loved showdown between Senate and House members of both the Republican and Democratic camps.
Congressman Rodney Davis told CNN he was up at bat at the time, and Scalise was in the field at second base. “I was batting, we heard a loud noise.... The next thing I remember was somebody on the field yelling ‘Run, he's got a gun.'”
Alexandria police chief Michael Brown said his officers arrived at the scene within three minutes, engaged the suspect together with Capitol Police officers, and took him into custody. The gunman later died of his injuries.
Trump praised the “heroic” acts of law enforcement in subduing the shooter.
“Many lives would have been lost if not for the heroic actions of the two Capitol Police officers who took down the gunman despite sustaining gunshot wounds during a very, very brutal assault,” Trump said. “Melania and I are grateful for their heroism and praying for the swift recovery of all victims.”
Senator Rand Paul, also at the practice, said he believed the rapid intervention narrowly prevented a bloodbath. “It would have been a massacre. And having no self-Defence, the field was basically a killing field,” Paul told reporters.
Asked whether he thought it was a random shooting, Republican lawmaker Mo Brooks - who helped the wounded at the scene - told CNN: “It sure as heck wasn't an accident.”
“People know this is the Republican baseball team practicing,” he said. “He knew who we were.”
Scalise's office said the 51-year-old was in stable condition at a Washington hospital after being shot in the hip.
“Prior to entering surgery, (Scalise) was in good spirits and spoke to his wife by phone,” it added. Brooks described Scalise dragging his body across the field to get away from the shooter while the firing continued.
After the shots subsided, he and others at the scene attempted to tend to Scalise's wound, while Brooks took off his belt and used it as a tourniquet for a bleeding staffer who had been shot in the leg.
Scalise, a representative from the southern state of Louisiana elected to Congress in 2008, heads the conservative House caucus known as the Republican Study Committee.
The staunch conservative is among the lawmakers leading the drive to repeal former president Barack Obama's signature health care law, among other top Republican priorities.
Marcus Mariota's availability on Sunday against the Dolphins will come down to a pregame checkup.
That's the latest from Titans coach Mike Mularkey on his injured quarterback, who is listed as questionable on the team's injury report with a hamstring injury. He added that Mariota was a game-time decision.
"I think if I'm able to move around and I'm able to hand the ball off, and am able to drop back, then I'll definitely play," Mariota told reporters Friday. "It's a tough decision. ... To that point, I'm going to do my best to get healthy, and hopefully, I'll be ready to go."
Mariota tweaked his hamstring in last weekend's blowout loss to the Houston Texans and did not return.
Matt Cassel is the next man up should Mariota not be able to play against the Dolphins (1-2). The Titans also signed Brandon Weeden this past week for additional insurance.
The acquisition of Weeden makes one think that the Titans are leaning toward sitting their star, though Mike Mularkey's offense is nowhere near as effective without the speedy Mariota under center. Dolphins head coach Adam Gase will have to be prepared for multiple scenarios leading up to the pre-game inactives deadline.
Over the course of the next week we will look at the different candidates for governor through different issues. Wednesday is the second part of this series with a story that focuses on education. If you want to see our first story on the candidates' economic plans, click HERE.
Improving Alabama's low national education ranking has been a priority for almost every candidate running for governor. Below see the candidates responses on what they want to see done for the state's education system.
Democrats support a lottery, while not a single Republican voiced a lottery plan.
DEMOCRATS
Sue Bell Cobb
“I am advocating what I'm calling the Lifelong Learner Lottery," says candidate Sue Bell Cobb. It's the main component of her education plan.
Cobb says the lottery would generate $300 million, a common estimate for a lottery's revenue. It would spend $75 million to fully fund 4-year-old kindergarten. Another $30-35 million would go toward childcare on a sliding scale, as Cobb says childcare would become more expensive if 4-year-old kindergarten is paid for. Then, another $50 million would go to fully fund vocational or career tech programs with money helping pay for “state-of-the-art” instructors and equipment. The rest of the money would go toward filling any gap for students with Pell grants, covering the remainder of the expenses.
Cobb says her plan would say to the world that Alabama's “children are ready to succeed when they get to school.”
She'll call a special session in the first 30 days of her governorship to focus on the lottery, and would save money by having the special session during a regular session of the legislature.
Walt Maddox
The mayor said his plan would train workers through education with an “Alabama Education Lottery” plan that would, much like Cobb's plan, generate an estimated $300 million. Maddox would call a special session on the first day of his administration to discuss the lottery and deal with the state's education problems.
Under the “Alabama Education Lottery” the money would be split to provide Universal Pre-K, college scholarships similar to the Tennessee lottery plan, an effort to equalize funding between rural and urban schools, expand craft academy training, expand scholarship opportunity for apprenticeship programs.
And for 75 struggling schools, provide wraparound mental health and health services. The goal, address not only the academic deficits but other deficits.
When it comes specifically to the classroom, Maddox says he wants to increase teacher salaries with a plan that would tap into the state's rolling reserve, which is meant as a back up in case of an economic downturn.
REPUBLICANS
Kay Ivey
A former educator, Gov. Kay Ivey wants to continue her “Strong Start, Strong Finish” program. Ivey says under the program she would want to see every student reach the goal of being on grade level by the third grade. The program would also want to see computer science classes in every middle school by 2022 and offer programs to better prepare students to enter a skilled workforce.
Tommy Battle
For Battle, the issue with Alabama's education system is not the overall system but the pockets of poor performance within it.
In Huntsville, they have what he calls an accountability system which would test children both at the beginning and end of the year to make sure there was a year's worth of advancement. Battle also promotes getting the community involved to help improve education.
When it comes to a potential lottery, Battle sees it as nothing more than “a financial tool.” He supports a potential vote on the lottery but would only want to see the money go toward what he calls “job multipliers” like education. Battle said a potential lottery commission must be honest and transparent.
Battle voted against a lottery the last time people had a chance to vote on the issue.
Bill Hightower
Hightower says the state has a worker crisis and he would bring the need for workers into high schools by offering certification programs on the high school level. The state senator says the program could help give some kids a purpose and give them a better lifestyle.
Hightower is opposed to a lottery. Instead, he wants to undo earmarks to free up more funding for state programs, including education.
Scott Dawson
“We are at the bottom rung of the ladder and that's unacceptable,” says candidate Scott Dawson. His education plan starts with having mentors in the classroom. Dawson says the mentors could come through corporations, communities, churches and retirees to help the learning process.
Dawson also wants economics taught in middle school to give kids an earlier understanding of finance.
He promises to be at every school board meeting and to hold teacher summits for teachers to have a platform to voice their opinions.
His most radical education idea deals with drug tests for high school students, requiring mandatory drug tests for extracurricular activities. He says the tests would use snippets of hair and the costs of the tests will be paid for by partnering corporations.
Under Dawson's plan, the first alert of a failed drug test would go to parents, the second to school administrators and the third would have state sponsored drug rehab.
The reason for the plan? Dawson believes that if a child can't pass a drug test and is addicted, one of three things will happen to him.
They will be unemployed, on welfare They will commit a crime and be in prison They will eventually overdose

Boxing - Mayweather, UFC star McGregor agrees to August fight

(Reuters) - Undefeated boxer Floyd Mayweather and mixed martial arts champion Conor McGregor, two of the most popular athletes in their respective sports, have agreed to a crossover fight in the ring on August 26 in Las Vegas, Mayweather said in a tweet on Wednesday.
The fight is expected to gross millions of dollars with Mayweather a solid favourite.
Mayweather, 40, retired in 2015 with an unblemished 49-0 professional boxing record while boastful Irishman McGregor, 28, is the UFC's lightweight champion.
"IT'S OFFICIAL!!!" Mayweather wrote on his Twitter account alongside a short video that included still photos of both fighters.
"THE FIGHT IS ON," McGregor tweeted minutes before Mayweather's post.
The two fighters have gone back and forth for nearly a year regarding a potential showdown with both men previously stating they each wanted $100 million for the fight.
UFC president Dana White told ESPN that the fight will take place at the T-Mobile Arena and that McGregor will weigh in at 154 pounds.
Mayweather Promotions will publicize the event, which will be available on Showtime pay-per-view.
"I talked to Conor McGregor this morning," White said. "He is absolutely, 100 percent positive that he wins this fight."
If McGregor pulls that off, it would rank among the greatest boxing upsets of all time.
Mayweather is widely regarded as one of the best defensive fighters ever, and prides himself on his ability to evade punishment with his skilful movement about the ring while making adjustments against opponents on the fly.
McGregor, the UFC's reigning lightweight champion and former featherweight champion, is known as much for his bravado as for his explosive knockout power inside an MMA octagon.
The Irishman became the first UFC fighter to hold two belts simultaneously when he knocked out Eddie Alvarez in New York last November for the lightweight championship.
The UFC stripped McGregor of his featherweight belt shortly after that fight when he announced he would be taking some time off after he and long-time partner Dee Devlin had their first baby in May.
Known for his devastating striking and highlight-reel knockouts, McGregor is also quick and irrational on his feet, but few would back him to beat one of the most complete boxers of all time.
A win for Mayweather would move him ahead of former heavyweight great Rocky Marciano, who also retired with a perfect 49-0 career record.

David Hughes, longtime newspaper professional and special guest columnist for The Saline Courier, passed away Tuesday at his Benton home.
Saline County Coroner Kevin Cleghorn confirmed Hughes' death Tuesday.
Hughes returned to his roots recently, moving back to Arkansas after living in Virginia for many years. The retired photographer and newspaper editor continued his skill with the Courier, publishing a lengthy column, “Views From The Clock Tower,” each Sunday in the publication's Living section.
The piece was a favorite among many longtime Saline County residents as his work usually touched on the past and how things used to be around the county.
More information will be reported as it becomes available.

Less than month after its chief designer Ed Wood left the team, Williams has confirmed its head of aerodynamics Dirk De Beer has also stepped down from his role.
De Beer joined Williams from Ferrari last year and was hired to give the team a new aerodynamic direction this season. After a series of disappointing results in the opening six races, the team issued a short statement to confirm the South African had left the team.
"Williams can confirm that Dirk De Beer has stepped down from his role as head of aerodynamics, effective immediately," the statement said. "The team would like to thank Dirk for his hard work over the past year and wish him the best for the future.

"Chief engineer, Doug McKiernan, who joined Williams earlier this year will now assume full responsibility over the aerodynamic and design direction of the car, with Dave Wheater stepping up to take on the role as head of aerodynamics."
Williams disappointing start to the season followed a change in aerodynamic philosophy this year. Since 2014 the team had pursued a low-drag design, which proved fast at high-speed tracks but consistently off the pace at high-downforce venues. The change this season was intended to deliver a better all-rounder, but so far the car has missed the team's targets.
Former Mercedes man Paddy Lowe continues to head up the technical side of the team after joining as a shareholder at the beginning of last year.
"She already had two Olympic medals, so I knew I was going to be OK," Gibbs said of Meyers Taylor, who had won bronze in 2010 and silver in 2014. "I just didn't know what to expect. I think that was the scariest part about bobsled, is when you just don't know what's happening, you don't know where you are on the track, you don't know when it's going to be over and you don't know what it's supposed to feel like. So you're going down and it's like, 'Is it supposed to be this loud? Are we supposed to hit that wall? Is my head supposed to hit my knee?' It was a new sensation, but now it's just a normal day at the office."
What's in a (university building) name?
Influential people in a university's history — a founder, a major donor — often have the honor of having a building, department or other prominent feature on campus named for them.
But a look into the histories of the namesakes of buildings around many college campuses in America reveal ties to white supremacy and slavery. And in the modern era, those ties are increasingly seen as problematic.
At some schools, students and faculty are holding their universities accountable for their racial history by demanding their universities change the names of the buildings that honor those who advocated for and benefited from systems of white supremacy, slavery and systemic racism.
The newest example: Yale University. After a renewed push in 2015 by students to have a building name changed, Yale University announced Friday it is renaming one of its residential colleges named in honor of former U.S. vice president and white supremacist John C. Calhoun, who was a prominent proponent of slavery.
Nick Girard, a Yale sophomore, pointed out that the Calhoun name change “is the result of decades of activism and action” by students and faculty. “It is excellent to see the university finally recognize this continued activism and listen to the students, alumni and professors who have protested Yale's honoring a renowned supporter of slavery,” Girard told USA TODAY College.
Girard explained the tireless work it took for the change to happen. “So many invested academic, emotional, and mental labor in fighting to make a better, more inclusive Yale,” he said.

The decision to rename Calhoun College was not always on the table. As recently as last April, Yale president Peter Salovey said the name of the building would not be changed. But by August, he had announced a committee to explore renaming the building. The committee developed a set of principles to use when considering name changes, and the board voted to rename Calhoun College on Friday.
“John C. Calhoun's legacy as a white supremacist and a national leader who passionately promoted slavery as a ‘positive good' fundamentally conflicts with Yale's mission and values,” Salovey said in a post on the Yale website.
The post also mentions that it followed guidance from schools like Georgetown that have recently changed building names on their campus.
In 2015, Georgetown president John DeGioia announced that the university would be renaming two buildings on campus that were named for two university presidents who had authorized and advised the sale of slaves to pay off campus debts. Mulledy and McSherry halls were both renamed at the suggestion of the working group on slavery, memory and reconciliation, a panel of Georgetown students, administrators and faculty. Students had lobbied the university for the building name changes.
While schools like Yale and Georgetown have taken steps to address their ties with slavery, there is still an uphill battle being fought at others.
At Clemson and Winthrop universities in South Carolina, students and faculty have called for buildings on their campuses named Tillman Hall to be changed and have been at the center of contentious debates over the renaming efforts.
The buildings' names honor Benjamin Ryan Tillman, a former governor of the state and an avowed white supremacist. Tillman was a vocal proponent of lynching.
Last fall, Winthrop students held a sit-in to enter talks with administration about the renaming efforts and to remind the campus who Tillman was.
Many students believe having Tillman's name being attached to a prominent building on campus doesn't reflect the university they attend today.
“It sort of invalidates and nullifies all of the student activities and engagement that happen in this building because most of the activities in this building are headed by students of color,” Winthrop student Candace Livingston told USA TODAY College. Livingston pointed to events hosted at Tillman Hall as one example of how off-putting it can be for students of color “to be in a building named after a man that could care less about our bodies.”
In 2015, Clemson's faculty senate and the graduate student government both voted to rename Tillman Hall — a symbolic gesture, because only Clemson's board of trustees can officially change the name of a building on campus.
In February 2015, Clemson University board of trustees chair David H. Wilkins announced in a statement that they would not rename the building, citing that whether the name of the building was changed Tillman would still remain a part of Clemson's history:
“Every great institution is built by imperfect craftsmen. Stone by stone they add to the foundation so that over many, many generations, we get a variety of stones. And so it is with Clemson. Some of our historical stones are rough and even unpleasant to look at. But they are ours and denying them as part of our history does not make them any less so. For that reason, we will not change the name of our historical buildings. Part of knowledge is to know and understand history so you learn from it.”
Ongoing efforts to change the names of both Tillman Halls face strenuous challenges. South Carolina's Heritage Act says that any street, park or plaque named for a historical figure in the state cannot be renamed without a two-thirds vote from the state General Assembly.
But Winthrop students aren't backing down from the fight to have the building's name changed on their campus. They've begun planning a letter-writing campaign and have engaged in other conversations with university officials to advance their fight to change the name of Tillman Hall.

Every single thing we do each day is defined as a process. When you get up in the morning until you go to sleep at night, each thing you do is a process. The routine you go through getting ready for the day: dropping the kids off at school, dialing the phone, typing an email, preparing for a meeting, analyzing risk... each and every one of these activities encompasses one or more processes. How well each step of a process is executed determines the effectiveness of the outcome.
Most organizations have done little to truly define and map their processes. Enterprises expect new hires and existing staff to learn “how we do things here.” They expect compliance with policies and procedures without ever providing a true picture of what to do, when to do it, with whom you are expected to coordinate, or the issues that arise if the policy is not followed.
Yes, written proses in most organizations establish policies and procedures for the enterprise. Yet the frequent lack of compliance and violation of policy indicates that no one really reads them. Most just sit on the shelf and gather dust or, if they are online, few ever click on them. If they are read, many times they aren't understood or worst case, they are simply ignored. Ask yourself: How often and how thoroughly have you read every policy and procedure that affects your enterprise and department, those with which you are expected to comply or that you are tasked with enforcing? Do you thoroughly understand your responsibilities, the expectations of each policy and procedure, or the consequences you, your department or the enterprise face for non-compliance?
The best solution to gaining control of an enterprise's processes and ensuring broad compliance to the greatest extent possible is to map each process. Like the old saying goes: “A picture is worth a thousand words.” Process mapping produces defined process flow charts and yes-no decision trees. It not only simplifies educating personnel on what is expected, but enhances compliance with how an enterprise wants or must have things done. It also assists in readily identifying where processes can be enhanced or streamlined. When things do go wrong, it also makes it much easier to identify at what point someone deviated from the process or where it failed and to implement necessary changes as part of a root-cause analysis process.
One of the best examples of the value of process mapping and yes-no decision trees can be found in use with guard force procedures. At most enterprises, general instructions alone for the guard force are typically volumes long. On top of that there are numerous post-specific instructions for each location a guard or receptionist is assigned. The first time I deployed process mapping and yes-no decision trees to replace post orders for guards was in the late 1980s, and I was astonished with the results. We went from frequent complaints on the guards failing to do their job to a high number of compliments. We witnessed nearly a 99.9-percent accuracy level on the guards completing their tasks and doing so according to the defined process. We also found that training of new guards was dramatically enhanced, job satisfaction soared and complaints nearly vanished.
If you have a “best practice” or a method you have deployed that was particularly effective, I would appreciate it if you would share it with me. I am looking to potentially highlight them as part of the SECURITY 500 events that I emcee in the Spring on the West Coast and the Fall in Washington D.C.

Iran Focus
London, 17 Apr - Iran is in crisis but it is even more pronounced as the sham elections approach. Ehsan Aminolroaia, a member of the National Council of Resistance of Iran revealed in an interview that the stress and infighting appear to be getting to the mullahs' in a way that it hasn't before.
Aminolroaia said: “The turbulence and stresses of previous elections always emerged after the elections, while in this election, those issues are coming out beforehand. The Iranian regime is experiencing major political problems. This situation is the result of series of great events of the last few years that placed the Iranian regime in a defensive mode: such as uprisings of 2009 and 2010, the break-down of regime's dominated coalition groups (Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei's loyalists), the Syrian civil war and international sanctions.”
Aminolroaia explained that there are 12 major crises currently affecting the Regime's power struggle.
1. The mullahs are fighting each other for a chance to succeed Khamenei as Supreme Leader, which highlights their hunger for power.
2. The Iranian people have already shown their distaste and distrust for the Regime in their hundreds of thousands over the past 40 years but many believe that the time for a full-on overthrow of the Regime is now.
3. 2016 was the peak of protests against the Regime so far and this is only set to rise.
4. The Regime's hostility towards oppressed minorities like Arabs, Kurds, and Baluchs is only worsening.
5. The Iranian Regime is entrenched in three foreign wars in Iraq, Yemen, and especially Syria; none of which the Iranian people want.
6. Thankfully, the Iranian Regime failed to destroy the democratic resistance group Mojahedin-e-Khalq (though not for lack of trying) and the group still provides a democratic opposition to the mullahs.
7. When the nuclear pact was formed Iran was forced to give up its nuclear programme, which took away international leverage and has caused some within the Regime to fight back against the Supreme Leader.
8. Although it should be noted that the nuclear pact failed to improve international relations or bring all the economic relief that was promised to the people of Iran. Many sanctions are still in place.
9. The current ‘moderate' government has failed the people of Iran because it is by no means moderate. It has overseen over 3000 executions in four years and some areas are so poverty struck that malnourishment has become normal.
10. Iran's economy is at a stalemate because rather than create jobs or provide food or treat the sick, the Regime funnels its money in the Syrian Civil War to ensure that the Assad dictatorship remains in power.
11. The Regime has also funnelled money away from projects that could have prevented the water shortage in certain areas that led to droughts.
12. The gap between the rich and poor has only worsened since the Regime came into power. Now, 10 million people are unemployed and 20 million live in substandard accommodation.
Aminolroaia said: “Now, the regime wants to find a way to defend itself against an offensive threat, which is spreading. One can call this threat an accumulation of crisis or crises that are intertwined. The ruling power is disintegrated and its divided components are in a gruelling and erosive conflict of undermining or disabling each other. My emphasis is not only on the power struggle between Khamenei and Rouhani factions, but also there are some among Khamenei's ruling faction contributing to an ever-increasing division and disintegration.”
Well that's one way to avoid uncomfortable questions. Earlier this week, Ivanka Trump scored seven new trademarks in China for her fashion brand — just as her father was engaged in negotiations with Beijing. This sparked concerns about a potential conflict of interest, and when reporters asked her about this situation during a Tuesday conference call, Ivanka Trump just hung up.
On Tuesday, Ivanka co-hosted a White House media call with Holli M. Richmond, the director of the White House Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition. The call was tied to "White House Sports and Fitness Day," which is Wednesday. Assistant White House Press Secretary Ninio Fetalvo told reporters at the beginning of the call that Ivanka was scheduled to leave for a meeting partway, The New York Times reported, but that she would nonetheless take several questions first.
However, the first question Ivanka received was about the Chinese trademarks. Fetalvo intervened and said he would “refer those questions to the press office." Shortly afterward, another reporter posed a question about the president's fitness and diet routine, but after a brief pause, Fetalvo indicated that Ivanka had left for that meeting and was no longer on the call.
As The New York Times pointed out, Ivanka rarely takes questions from reporters in uncontrolled settings. So though the Chinese trademarks Ivanka recently obtained were unrelated to White House Sports and Fitness Day, reporters took the media call as an opportunity to broach the topic with her on the rare occasion that she gave them access.
Ivanka's work in the White House alongside her continued work on her own brand have been sparking ethical concerns ever since her father first assumed the presidency. China's decision to grant Ivanka her latest trademarks coincided with her father's efforts to save ZTE, a Chinese electronics maker. The U.S. Department of Commerce punished ZTE last month — by banning the company from purchasing tech components — after it conducted business with Iran and North Korea, thereby violating American sanctions.
According to a New York Times report, Trump administration critics are concerned that the president's attempt to save ZTE could appear to be a reward for a foreign government that granted his daughter the trademarks she sought. Ethics watchdogs Fred Wertheimer and Norman Eisen wrote that the timing of the ZTE negotiations could set a precedent for "foreign interests and governments to curry favor and buy influence with the president."
The question about Ivanka's Chinese trademarks was not the only one that went unanswered. According to CBS News, another reporter asked Richmond if the first lady would attend White House Sports and Fitness Day. She has not been seen in public since undergoing kidney surgery two weeks ago, and her absence has sparked numerous conspiracy theories, though her spokeswoman has indicated that her recovery is proceeding well. Richmond was unable to confirm whether or not the first lady would be in attendance, but did tell reporters that the president would deliver remarks at the event.
On the call, Ivanka had also received a question about whether her father had changed his fitness and diet routine following recommendations from his physician. Another reporter posed a similar question to Richmond after Ivanka left the call, but that question was also redirected to the press office.
Although Ivanka works as a senior adviser in her father's administration, Vanity Fair suggested that she still isn't necessarily accustomed to responding to the ethical concerns that have plagued her for months.

It has been many decades since the people in the Kashmir valley continue to face hurdles and killings by the so-called Indian personnels.
And the situation in the Kashmir valley has been more tense since the killing of the familiar rebel commander, “Burhan Wani” in 2016.
According to reports,451 people including 125 security forces,108 civilians,217 militants and one pro-government personnel were killed in 2017.In fact, Kashmir issue remains the core issue between Pakistan and India.
To me, Kashmir issue cannot be resolved until the other countries would help Pakistan and India on the negotiation table. But the recent visit of the Indonesian president Joko Widodo in Pakistan and addressing a joint sitting of the Pakistan's parliament, President Joko Widodo said that Pakistan and Indonesia will be working hand to hands to resolve the Palestinian conflict without mentioning the Kashmir issue.
According Mr reports, The Indonesian president came here directly from India where he was the chief guest at the country's 69th Republic Day grand parade.
The Indonesian president didn't mention Kashmir Issue, perhaps, those countries who love the relation with India do not want to oppose India, do not mention the issue.
But as the Indonesian president said that history is witnessed to the fact that any conflict in the world would not have been resolved by military or by weapons but negotiation or dialogues. Thus, India and Pakistan can reslove whole the issues through dialogues, including the Kashmir issues.

Sanju star Ranbir Kapoor on career highs and lows: Keep reminding myself that it's just a bend, not the end
Mumbai: Bollywood actor Ranbir Kapoor, who has showcased his versatility in a variety of roles but whose recent films have not fared well at the box office, says he keeps reminding himself that it is just a bend and not the end.
Ranbir, along with producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra and director Rajkumar Hirani, was present at the teaser launch of their upcoming mega project Sanju, a biopic on actor Sanjay Dutt, here on Tuesday.
In a past interview, Chopra had commented that "Ranbir is an incredible actor with stupid script choices".
So when asked if the biopic is going to change it, Ranbir told the media: "If every actor knew what he was doing and had a plan, everyone would be a superstar. So it is hard and I am trying to learn from my own mistakes."
"I keep reminding myself that it's just a bend, not the end. Life is very difficult and requires a lot of hard work and you have to keep working... Like Raju sir's film title, 'Lage raho...'," he added with a pinch of humour.
In Sanju, Ranbir has portrayed Sanjay's different avatars.
Did he make any special observations about Sanjay to portray him better on-screen Ranbir said: "I have always been a Sanjay Dutt fan. For me, it was a fan trying to play his icon. So I think the hardest thing I did was to give myself the confidence that I can play this man.
"When Raju sir told me about this film, I didn't have the confidence because I thought I wouldn't be able to do it. I don't have the courage, don't have the understanding or the acting chops to do it. This is not an acting gig for me. I haven't tried to show good acting, bad acting or showcase my talent. I think it was just the opportunity to be part of a story of a person who I consider to be my icon."
Ranbir has entertained audience in many hits like Bachna Ae Haseeno, Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani, Rocket Singh - Salesman of The Year, Wake Up Sid! and Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani.
The actor in a prior interview had said that he truly learned from Hirani what it means to entertain people.
Asked to elucidate on the same, Ranbir said: "What I learned from Raju sir is the power of entertainment. Not what's entertaining to you but what's entertaining to people, and I think when a filmmaker makes a film for an audience and not for himself, that's such a learning in itself and a selfless act."
Ranbir was also urged to act out a dialogue for the audience. But he said: "I feel very shy to mimic him (Sanjay) otherwise. When I was working on the film, it was a character I had to play. Otherwise mimicking feels like disrespecting him. And it's not just me...it's the hair and make-up that adds to my acting on the big screen. So, I don't want to disrespect Sanjay sir."
Presented by Fox Star Studios, the film will release on 29 June.

Jerusalem: Israeli aircraft hit a Hamas compound in the southern Gaza Strip on Saturday, after Palestinians there fired a rocket into the Jewish state, the Israeli army said.
"In response to the projectile fired at southern Israel...fighter jets struck a Hamas compound composed of two military structures," the army statement said.
There were no reports of casualties on either side.
It was the second exchange in 24 hours, after the air force hit a Hamas position in Gaza early Friday in response to a rocket being fired from the Palestinian enclave the night before.
Such rockets are usually fired not by Hamas, the Islamist group that controls the territory, but by fringe radical groups.
Israel holds Hamas, with which it has fought three wars since 2008, responsible for any fire coming from Gaza.

A sore back left Graham DeLaet unsure if he'd even be able to tee off at the PGA Championship. Instead, he recorded one of the best performances of his career.
DeLaet, of Weyburn, Sask., finished Sunday's final round tied for seventh at Quail Hollow golf course in Charlotte, N.C., It was his best result in one of golf's four majors and just four shots back of winner Justin Thomas.
DeLaet said he was competing despite suffering from an ongoing back injury that flares up a couple of times a year, but the 35-year-old rallied to shoot 68 and 69 over the tournament's final two rounds, the same weekend score as Thomas.
He said focusing on his health rather than his score actually helped him.
“When I was out there, I wasn't really thinking about where I was at on the leaderboard, I was just trying to get through. From a mental standpoint it was actually kind of beneficial,” he said Monday. “Physically obviously I would have liked to have been healthy, but I kept my mind in a pretty good spot.”
Although DeLaet was in one of the final groups Sunday at a major for the first time in his career, he felt as though he belonged.
“There was a weird calmness about me, even on Saturday night,” he said. “If I could shoot 5 or 6 under, which was possible, but difficult (on Sunday), I would have had a chance to win a major. Even knowing that, I felt good.”
Physically, DeLaet felt better thanks to the efforts of Dr. Craig Davies, a Canadian conditioning coach and trainer who is based out of Orlando and has been working with DeLaet since 2011.
Davies said they did some acupuncture, dry needling, cupping, muscle adjustments, soft-tissue work and applied a new product called a Luminas patch that uses electrons from natural anti-pain compounds, prior to Thursday.
“Truth of the matter is, all of what we did would have been for not if it wasn't for the fact that Graham has this playoff-hockey mentality where he can play through a lot of pain that a lot of players wouldn't be able to play through,” Davies said.
“And if they could play through it, they wouldn't have played at the level he could. It's a massive testament to Graham.”
DeLaet, who withdrew from the Barracuda Championship two weeks ago, said this season has been solid overall with six top-10 finishes.
Still, as younger countrymen Nick Taylor, Mackenzie Hughes, and Adam Hadwin have all captured PGA Tour victories in the last few seasons, DeLaet wants more.
“I wouldn't say I'm disappointed to not have a few more chances, but it's tough,” he said. “It's tough to get into that position and when you are, it's harder to play well and finish it off. Obviously, I've never done it yet,” he said.
“That's always the goal. It's been good, but I feel like that really, really high finish is what's missing on the year.”
DeLaet has been buoyed by the support of his wife, Ruby, and being a new dad. He said playing for his twins — daughter Lyla and son Roscoe, born in 2015 — is something that's always in the back of his mind.
“Ruby was watching (the PGA Championship) on TV and they knew it was me on the TV, which was cool, but I still don't think they quite get it,” DeLaet said. “A couple more years for them to understand what I do, but that's a motivator for sure.”
DeLaet will head to the family's home in Idaho this week to rest up prior to playing the FedEx Cup playoffs starting next week at The Northern Trust in New York.
He said the week at the PGA Championship wore him out physically and mentally, and he's eager for a break.
“It really took its toll on me,” he admitted. “But I hope this week will give me just enough to get back to where I need to be.”
At a news conference after the meetings, Tillerson defended Trump's attempts to "modernize" the NAFTA agreement, and to crack down on both legal and illegal immigration. He said the president wants to "clean up" the troubled U.S. immigration system and "lift the cloud of uncertainty" on immigrants living without proper documentation.
New Delhi: Police kept a hawk-eyed vigil on west Delhi's Khayala area which was gripped by tension after a 23-year-old man was stabbed to death by the family members of a woman with whom he was in a relationship.
Ankit Saxena, a professional photographer, was killed on Thursday night in the area. The woman's family opposed her relationship with Saxena as the two belonged to different communities.
Four persons, including the brother of the woman, were nabbed a few hours after Saxena was stabbed to death by them.
"Three accused — the mother, father and uncle of the woman — have been sent to judicial custody. Her minor brother has been sent to juvenile home," a senior police officer said.
The woman claimed threat to her life and was sent to Nari Niketan. The family of the deceased has been given security, police said.
Local residents claimed the killing was not a fallout of Saxena being in an interfaith relationship.
A friend of Saxena said "news reports suggesting a communal angle in the incident are wrong".
Delhi BJP's Manoj Tiwari who met the parents of the photographer said the incident should not be given a communal angle.
He demanded that Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal break his "silence" over the killing and announce a compensation of Rs 1 crore for the family.
PENNSYLVANIA'S most famous groundhog foresees no early end to winter.
Punxsutawney Phil's handlers announced on Friday the weather prognosticator saw his shadow.

Legend has it if the furry rodent casts a shadow on February 2, Groundhog Day , expect six more weeks of winter-like weather.
Phil's prediction is decided ahead of time by the group on Gobbler's Knob, a tiny hill just outside of Punxsutawney. That's about 100 kilometres northeast of Pittsburgh.

However, New York's most famous groundhog, Staten Island Chuck, left his burrow at 7:30am to find no trace of his shadow.
He was held underneath a spacious — and safe — glass enclosure and lifted into the space via a mechanical contraption called the “Chuck-a-vator.”
The safety measures were adapted after Mayor DeBlasio dropped Charlotte — a female groundhog standing in as Chuck — in 2014.
Records dating to 1887 show Phil predicting more winter 103 times while forecasting an early spring just 18 times.
However, Chuck has been right 80 per cent of the time, while Phil's accuracy is much lower at 40 per cent.

Despite the poor strike rate in getting it right, Pennsylvanians still woke up early and bundled up, bopping to music amid the camp and kitsch with the temperature around minus 12C.

Groundhog Day is probably best known in Australia and around the world thanks to the Bill Murray movie of the same name where he is forced to relive the same day over and over again.
A 31-year-old man was stabbed in his upper body at around 4 a.m. Monday inside the Windsor Ballrooms on Peel street.
According to Montreal police spokesperson Manuel Couture, the victim was stabbed with a sharp object after an altercation between a group of people.
The victim was transported to hospital and his condition is not yet known.
Police will question witnesses in hopes of identifying the suspect.
“There are a lot of different versions right now so we're trying to figure out exactly what happened, what caused the conflict,” Couture said.
QUETTA : In front of the Chief Minister's house, a handicapped woman, also a widow is waiting for her turn in a long queue to plead her case. She lost her husband in a bombing in the year 2012. While her eldest son was employed at the Bolan Medical Complex Hospital as a replacement for his deceased father, he has not received his pay for several months now.
The handicapped widow was among thousands of people waiting to meet the CM Balochistan regarding their issues.
These are just few of the many cases that are being brought up at the khulli kachehri that has been set up by Balochistan's newly elected chief minister Mir Abdul Quddus Bizenjo, in what he says is an attempt, to address concerns of the people of his province.
Many unemployed doctors and veterinary doctors were also seen standing in the queue to appeal to the CM for jobs.
CM Bizenjo stated that the doors of CM house will remain open until everyone's pleas and complaints have been duly addressed, adding that no one will be left out.

The trial involving Taylor Swift and Denver DJ David Mueller came to a close on Monday when the jury found Mueller guilty of assault and battery, and dismissed the charges of tortious interference against Swift, her mother Andrea, and a member of the singer's management team, Frank Bell.
Swift had accused Mueller of groping her during a meet and greet in 2013. He, in turn, sued the singer claiming that the accusation cost him his job.
The jury ordered Mueller to pay Swift a symbolic $1 in damages, per her lawsuit.
Both before and after the verdict, Hollywood took to social media to express its support for the singer.
Kesha, who has also experienced the glare of a public trial in her legal fight with producer Dr. Luke, expressed admiration for Swift's determination.
. @taylorswift13 i support you always, and especially right now and admire your strength and fearlessness. truth is always the answer. — kesha (@KeshaRose) August 14, 2017
TV host James Corden called Swift's post-verdict statement “brilliant.”
Amber Heard tweeted that she was “proud” of the singer.
Rachel Platten, of “Fight Song” fame, messaged “We got your back,” to Swift.
We got your back @taylorswift13. You're amazing & I'm sending love. — Rachel Platten (@RachelPlatten) August 11, 2017
Canadian singer Nelly Furtado related her own experiences with radio meet-and-greets.
Been in several meet n' greets where radio staff attempt to cross lines. Love @taylorswift13 for fighting 4 women's safety in the workplace. — Nelly Furtado (@NellyFurtado) August 11, 2017
“Girls” creator Lena Dunham described her longtime friend as “fierce,” noting that Swift's “example is powerful.”
Proud of @taylorswift13 for her fierce & cutting testimony & her refusal to settle for being treated like property. Her example is powerful. — Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) August 11, 2017
YouTube star Raphael Gomes declared “victory of every victim of sexual assault who's been too scared to speak up.”
CAMBRIDGE — Cameron Dearlove looks for people on the fringes.
He advocates for those who often can't be heard and tries to make them feel a part of the community.
The Cambridge resident has a proven track record when it comes to social justice. He has worked as an employment counsellor at The Working Centre, was co-ordinator at the Family Centre, assisting nonprofits, and most recently, led Bridges to Belonging Waterloo Region, an agency that assists people with disabilities.
On Monday, he takes on a new role.
Dearlove has been appointed executive director of the Cambridge Self-Help Food Bank.
"It's a gem of an organization," the 36-year-old father said Tuesday. "It meets an immediate need and it provides an incredible safety net for those who need it."
He said he knows he has big shoes to fill in replacing the Pat Singleton, who was the face of the food bank for more than two decades until her retirement.
"It's hard to imagine the organization without her here," said Dearlove, who will spend the first two weeks on the job with Singleton.
As the new leader, he plans to expand the reach of the food bank by introducing the agency to those who may not have heard of it.
He also hopes to increase the amount of healthy food and "not just whatever is available" for food bank clients.
FREETOWN - At least 312 people were killed and more than 2,000 left homeless on Monday when heavy flooding hit Sierra Leone's capital of Freetown, leaving morgues overflowing and residents desperately searching for loved ones.
An AFP journalist at the scene saw bodies being carried away and houses submerged in two areas of the city, where roads turned into churning rivers of mud and corpses were washed up on the streets.
Red Cross spokesman Patrick Massaquoi told AFP the death toll was 312 but could rise further as his team continued to survey disaster areas in Freetown and tally the number of dead.
Mohamed Sinneh, a morgue technician at Freetown's Connaught Hospital, said 180 bodies had been received so far at his facility alone, many of them children, leaving no space to lay what he described as the “overwhelming number of dead”. Many more bodies were taken to private morgues, Sinneh said.
Images obtained by AFP showed a ferocious churning of dark orange mud coursing down a steep street in the capital, while videos posted by local residents showed people waist and chest deep in water trying to traverse the road.
Fatmata Sesay, who lives on the hilltop area of Juba, said she, her three children and husband were awoken at 4:30 am by rain beating down on the mud house they occupy, which was by then submerged by water. She managed to escape by climbing onto the roof. “We have lost everything and we do not have a place to sleep,” she told AFP.
Local media reports said a section of a hill in the Regent area of the city had partially collapsed, exacerbating the disaster. Other images showed battered corpses piled on top of each other, as residents struggled to cope with the destruction.
Meanwhile disaster management official Candy Rogers said that “over 2,000 people are homeless,” hinting at the huge humanitarian effort that will be required to deal with the fallout of the flooding in one of Africa's poorest nations.
Freetown, an overcrowded coastal city of 1.2 million, is hit each year by flooding during several months of rain that destroys makeshift settlements and raises the risk of waterborne diseases such as cholera. Flooding in the capital in 2015 killed 10 people and left thousands homeless.
Sierra Leone was one of the west African nations hit by an outbreak of the Ebola virus in 2014 that left more than 4,000 people dead in the country, and it has struggled to revive its economy since the crisis.
About 60 percent of people in Sierra Leone live below the national poverty line, according to the United Nations Development Programme.
The Tigers quickly took the lead in the bottom of the sixth, loading the bases against Cam Bedrosian (1-1) on a single, a walk and a hit by pitch. Greyson Greiner struck out, but Iglesias lined a two-run single to center to put Detroit ahead 3-1. Dixon Machado grounded to short, but Andrelton Simmons' throw to the plate was too late to get JaCoby Jones.
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street indexes were higher on Monday with boosts from technology and energy sectors as oil prices rose while investors prepared for an expected U.S. Federal Reserve rate hike later in the week. FILE PHOTO: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, (NYSE) in New York, U.S., December 1, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermidThe equity market appeared to shrug off an explosion at one of New York's busiest commuter hubs early on Monday morning that officials called an attempted terrorist attack. The suspect wounded himself and three others. “There has been some relief the terrorist attack wasn't worse,” said Mark Heppenstall, CIO at Penn Mutual Asset Management Horsham, Pennsylvania. Traders, waiting for the Fed's two-day rate setting meeting to begin on Tuesday, see a 85 percent probability for a third rate hike this year, according to CME Group's Fedwatch tool. “The grind higher continues. The Fed is a virtual certainty to tighten this week but that is totally priced in by the market,” said Heppenstall. “Valuations are getting to the point where even good news on the economy might pose some additional risks to the market. There's the risk that good news for the economy may be bad news for markets because the Fed is at the cusp of a level of tightening that could dampen growth.” At 2:38 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 31.57 points, or 0.13 percent, to 24,360.73, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 6.14 points, or 0.23 percent, to 2,657.64 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 31.59 points, or 0.46 percent, to 6,871.67. Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with the biggest boost coming from the information technology sector with a 0.74 percent gain. The S&P energy .SPNY index was up 0.7 percent as oil prices rose after a North Sea pipeline shut for repairs and some investors focused on commodities following the explosion in New York. [O/R] Financial .SPSY, consumer staple .SPLRCS and industrial .SPLRCI stocks were the biggest losers. CenturyLink (CTL.N) was the biggest S&P 500 percentage gainer, rising about 9 percent after the telecom provider signed a 5-year contract with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Healthcare investors focused on makers of drugs for blood disorders after clinical data presentations at the annual American Society of Hematology four-day meeting in Atlanta. Shares of Bluebird Bio (BLUE.O) were last up 19 percent at $203.75 after hitting a record high of $222.03 following news of positive responses in an early stage myeloma study of its experimental gene-modifying immunotherapy drug co-developed with Celgene (CELG.O). Celgene's shares were up 1.97 percent. Interest in the surge in digital currency bitcoin and the opening of futures trading in the cryptocurrency continued to fuel bets on related stocks, many of which have risen sharply in the past three months. Shares of Marathon Patent (MARA.O) was up 27 percent while Xunlei (XNET.O) was up 18 percent. Riot Blockchain (RIOT.O) rose about 37 percent. Bitcoin futures soared in their U.S. debut on Sunday, which backers hope will encourage wider use and give legitimacy to cryptocurrency. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.13-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.06-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

OMAHA, Neb. (AP)  Warren Buffett's company nearly quadrupled its investment in Apple to over 57 million shares during the last three months of last year.
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. filed a quarterly update on its U.S. stock portfolio with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday. Besides the Apple move, Berkshire also revealed a new 8 million share stakes in Monsanto and added to its relatively new airline investments.
Berkshire, meanwhile, sold off a significant portion of its Wal-Mart investment and reduced its stake in the retailer to 1.4 million shares from nearly 13 million shares at the end of September.
Berkshire's Apple Inc. stake is now worth $7.7 billion, up from roughly $2 billion the previous quarter. That investment got attention when it was first disclosed last year because Buffett has always been reluctant to invest in technology companies.

Investors like to look at Berkshire's investments because of Buffett's remarkably successful track record, although the filing doesn't make clear who made all the investments. Berkshire officials don't generally comment on the filings and didn't respond to questions Tuesday.
Buffett handles the biggest investments in Berkshire's portfolio, such as Coca-Cola, Wells Fargo and IBM. He has said that investments of less than $1 billion are likely to be the work of Ted Weschler or Todd Combs, who each handle about $9 billion for Berkshire.
Buffett surprised many people last fall by disclosing new investments in American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Continental and Southwest because he had previously advised investors to stay away from the airline sector.
Berkshire added to all of its airline investments. At the end of 2016, Berkshire held 45.5 million shares of American, 60 million shares of Delta, 43.2 million shares of Southwest and nearly 29 million shares of United Continental.
Besides investments the Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire owns more than 90 subsidiaries, including insurance, utility and jewelry firms.
Pusha-T has doubled down on Drake with a ferocious and very personal new diss track called “The Story of Adidon” — which comes after Drake fired back at him on Friday night with one called “Duppy Freestyle” that was a response to the track “Infared” on Pusha-T's latest album “Daytona” which was released on Friday morning and was produced by Kanye West.
Along the way there were lyrical jabs about the controversy reinvigorating Pusha's career and a $100,000 invoice from Drake for “promotional assistance and career reviving,” as well as a parallel Twitter war between West's wife Kim Kardashian and his partner in the Donda's House charity, Rhymefest, in which neither Drake, Pusha nor West were directly involved. Got all that?
“The Story of Adidon” ups the ante, with a cover photo of Drake in blackface makeup and a hard lyrical jab about the biracial rapper being “always afraid he wasn't black enough.” Pusha responded to criticism about the photo by Tweeting, “Please stop referring to this picture as ‘artwork' …I'm not an internet baby, I don't edit images…this is a REAL picture…these are his truths, see for yourself,” with a link to photographer David Leyes' site. He also goes after Drake for a child he allegedly fathered as well as his producer Noah “40” Shebib's multiple sclerosis. While West has been relatively silent on social media for the past few days as he finishes the album he's scheduled to drop this Friday, his prominent role in “Daytona” and Pusha's career makes him a participant in the battle as well.
Please stop referring to this picture as “artwork”…I'm not an internet baby, I don't edit images…this is a REAL picture…these are his truths, see for yourself https://t.co/gd6vRS3HM8 pic.twitter.com/2el58HEZ8F — King Push (@PUSHA_T) May 30, 2018

Update: Broncos coach Vance Joseph said after practice that it appears Jared Crick may have been suffering from back spasms and the team is putting him through additional tests. That's good news as the injury could have been much worse. See our original post below.
Broncos defensive end Jared Crick was carted off the practice field with an apparent back injury on Saturday. The sixth-year defensive end will have an MRI, according to KUSA-TV's Mike Klis.
Crick (6-4, 285 pounds) entered the NFL with the Texans in 2012 and he signed with Denver during free agency last offseason. He's been starting across from Derek Wolfe in the team's 3-4 defense since last season.
Wolfe (ankle) is also injured but expects to be back in time for the team's season opener against the Chargers on Sept. 11. With both of their starting defensive ends banged up, the Broncos may want to consider bringing back Vance Walker, who remains a free agent after spending last season on the team's injured reserve list.
Second-year defensive lineman Adam Gotsis and free agent signee Zach Kerr are listed as the team's two backups at defensive end on the depth chart. The team also drafted DeMarcus Walker this year, but he's been practicing at outside linebacker with Shaq Barrett (hip) and Shane Ray (wrist) injured.
Coach Vance Joseph will update Crick's status after practice.
Royal Oaks Downtown Development Authority has agreed to pay millions of dollars towards the citys bond costs to build a new $58 million city center project.
The total project includes building a new city hall, police station, seven-story parking deck and a downtown park. A private company, Central Park Development Group, is set to build a six-story office building facing the park, but the DDA is making no contribution toward that development.
The city will do two bond issues to finance the project -- a $40 million bond for the new city buildings and an $18 million bond to fund the parking deck, said City Manager Don Johnson.
The DDAs contributions to the project will essentially cover the cost of developing the downtown park, roughly $5 million, and all the underground plumbing, gas and electrical lines to the new city buildings, Johnson said.

The DDA will contribute $737,000 annually for a term not to exceed 20 years toward the citys $40 million bond, he said.
The downtown authority is also agreeing to partially guarantee the revenue bonds for the new parking deck. The DDA would split the cost with the city of paying the debt service on the $18 million bond if for some reason the city auto parking fund failed to generate enough money to pay those costs, Johnson said.
This is a very significant contribution by the DDA, he said.
In return, the city will not charge the DDA $1 million it was supposed to pay for a city parking lot between 11 Mile and Second Street just west of Main Street. The DDA used the parking lot in a deal with Etkin Acquisitions LLC, of Southfield. The company is completing construction of a 75,000-square-foot office building at the site that has parking on the first level and four stories of offices above it.
Royal Oak is also forgiving a more than $200,000 debt service fee the DDA had on the cost of building the parking deck on South Lafayette.
I think its a fantastic deal for the city and it should be a good deal for the DDA, Johnson said.
The deal between the city and the DDA goes before the City Commission for approval Feb. 12.
The DDA previously pushed for the city to increase the size of the future $18 million parking deck from under 500 spaces to 581.
New office buildings in the downtown bring more revenue to the DDA in the form of what are called TIF taxes. The DDA captures any increases in tax assessments on businesses in the downtown district. The districts taxes from the Central Park Development Groups office building will go toward the bond payments the DDA makes on the upcoming downtown park and related costs.
But new office buildings are attractive for another reason as well, said Jay Dunstan, chairman of the DDA.
All these new office workers are going to be downtown during the day patronizing existing restaurants and retailers, he said. The number one complaint we hear from businesses is about how we bring in more foot traffic. I think there is going to be a substantial increase in foot traffic.
The downtown has seen increasing interest from developers in the past few years that want to build office space. The Etkin building, which is not quite finished, is already fully leased out, Dunstan said.
I expect there will be more demand for residential units in and outside the downtown, he said. People in the Etkin building are going to be buying houses and condos and going to businesses here.
A Hyatt hotel, along with a mixed-use building with residential units is expected to be finished later this year on Main Street north of 11 Mile Road. At the south end of Main near I-696, work will begin on a $40 million apartment complex this year by Singh Development, LLC of West Bloomfield. The four-acre site between South Main Street and Washington Avenue was vacant for decades until the DDA put that deal together last year.
Johnson predicted the civic center, hotel, new office buildings and apartment complex will bring a major economic boost to downtown Royal Oak.
Its going to be a game changer, he said.

'13? Brilliant': Words that fired hopes of a miracle in Thai cave rescue "How many of you?" asks the British voice loudly, a torchlight scanning the gaunt, hungry boys crowded on a muddy bank. "Thirteen?.... Brilliant" — a remarkable short exchange captured on video has electrified Thailand and paved the way for an astonishing rescue.

CHIANG RAI, Thailand: Rescue teams in northern Thailand were giving crash courses in swimming and diving on Wednesday as part of complex preparations to extract a, and hoping for a swift end to their harrowing 11-day ordeal.Divers, medics, counsellors and Thai navy SEALS were with the 12 schoolboys and a 25-year-old assistant coach, providing medicines and food while experts assessed conditions for getting them out safely, a task the government said"The water is very strong and space is narrow. Extracting the children takes a lot of people," Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan told reporters."Now we are teaching the children to swim and dive," he said, adding that if water levels fell and the flow weakened, they would be taken out quickly.The SEALS posted photographs on Facebook showing their members working in chest-deep water in the cave, adding that it was pumping water as "fast as possible" as it prepares to bring out the stranded group.About 120 million litres of water had been pumped out by late on Tuesday, or about 1.6 million every hour.It was unclear what the options were to get the "Wild Boar" team out of the Tham Luang caves in Chiang Rai province and how they would be steered through tight, fluid conditions and uncertain weather.Experts say divers have required three hours to reach the boys, located about 4 km (2.5 miles) from the mouth of the cave.A video released by the SEALS showed two rescuers seated on an elevated part of the cave besidewho appeared to be in good spirits, occasionally laughing.A torch is shone on each boy, who says hello and introduces himself with head bowed and palms pressed together in a traditional "wai" greeting.One wears what appears to be the red jersey of the England soccer team in Tuesday's World Cup second-round victory over Colombia. Another wears the blue shirt of English team Chelsea.The group was discovered by the SEALS and two British cave diving experts on Monday, having been incommunicado since June 23, when a post-practice outing went awry, prompting the high-profile search and rescue effort.The multinational operation has included divers from the Australian Federal Police , U.S. military personnel, British cave experts and teams from China, Japan, Laos and Myanmar.The Thai army has sent in 31 divers to support the navy's SEALS, a spokesman said.News that the team had survived sparked relief, celebrations and an outpouring of praise in a country transfixed by the drama and its almost blanket media coverage.Chiang Rai Governor Narongsak Osottanakorn said the authorities were keen to get the boys out and suggested that might have to happen in phases."All 13 don't have to come out at the same time," he told reporters. "Who is ready first can go first."Officials have dismissed as speculation reports that the boys could be trapped for up to four months, although supplies have been prepared for that period of time.There was much work to be done in preparing the boys for what could be a demanding task, and rescue teams should not be pressured to act faster, said a deputy government spokesman, Weerachon Sukondhapatipak, who was at the cave on Wednesday."Some of them can't swim, so therefore it will take time for them to adjust," he said."Officials would teach them how to move, how to dive, how to move their body under those circumstances."Somboon Sompiangjai, 38, said his son Peerapat, 16, was able to swim, adding that he was confident the SEALS' experience and professionalism would help get the boys home safely."I am not worried if the kids have to swim and dive," he told Reuters."I felt much better after seeing the clips with the children in good spirits, even though they were in there for 10 days."
The Land Transport Authority (LTA) said on Saturday that two trains and five themed buses have been decorated with auspicious motifs on the occasion of Chinese New Year in Singapore. The festive decorations on the trains, buses and other places of the country will be up until Mar 2.
The vehicles on the North-East and North-South East-West Lines were launched in collaboration with the country's public transport operators SMRT and SBS Transit, along with the Kreta Ayer-Kim Seng Citizen Consultative Committee.
LTA said that the North-East Line station platform at Outram Park MRT Station will also be decorated according to the theme of the upcoming Chinese New Year to be celebrated on Feb 16.
The authority told Channel NewsAsia that the bus services 80, 143, 147, 166 and 174, which travel through Chinatown and areas such as Toa Payoh, Sengkang, Jurong East and Clementi, will also "bring the festive cheer to the heartlands".
Dog motifs, peach blossoms that represent longevity, ingots representing wealth and fortune are all part of the festive decorations in Singapore. It also features traditional Chinese couplets expressing well wishes for the New Year.
The Singaporeans are quite excited to usher in the new year grandly as the Year of the Rooster will be ending, giving way to the Year of the Dog. The country's Chinatown has already hung lanterns, lights and decorations in honor of New Year. Several community-based programmes are also lined up for this time of the year as it will be a public holiday for Singaporeans.
Apart from the usual banners of Happy New Year and wishes of health and prosperity, Singapore has gone one step further to ensure its residents remain alert and safe.
Messages based on preparedness for danger and maintenance of unity are also being displayed in Chinatown. These unusual wishes have invited speculation among the people, who feel these statements are more apt for National Day celebrations, reports Shin Min Daily News.
The fourth entry in Adult Swim's new year-long singles series is from Speedy Ortiz's Sadie Dupuis' solo project Sad13, which releases its debut album last year. This new track is called “Sooo Bad,” and you can listen to it below.
Here's a note from Dupuis that accompanied the song's release:
Currently, there are 163 wildfires burning across the province, including a whopping 28 new ones that started up Saturday.
BC Wildfire Service confirms the province has surpassed the 1,000-fire mark. Since April 1st, there have been 1,003 reported fires, and suppression efforts have cost more than $285.2 million.
Looking at the forecast, Fire Information Officer Ryan Turcotte says Prince George and the Cariboo can expect scattered showers this week, but these will bring unstable conditions.
“We will see cooler temperatures to an extent, but we're also entering a pattern of gustier winds and more lightning risks, so it's a bit of a double-edged sword.”
There are over 4,016 people working on the BC blazes, 682 of whom are from out of province and 1,609 are contractors. There are 233 aircraft working as well.
Turcotte estimates the Elephant Hill wildfire is now 149,914 hectares. Significant winds and heavy smoke limited the use of air resources on this fire Saturday, which spread north to Green Lake and east to Deadman Valley.
The Hanceville / Riske Creek wildfire is currently 193,894 hectares. High winds led to extremely aggressive fire growth Saturday.
Five men who were rumoured to be child abductors according to a WhatsApp message were lynched to death by a mob in western Maharashtra on 1 July.
In an earlier report on 20 May, 14 people were reportedly killed on the basis of rumours which were circulated via social media channels such as WhatsApp. Reports of lynching triggering from fake news on WhatsApp have reportedly come from Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Assam, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha.
The government of India in its response to the lynchings has asked WhatsApp to fix the fake news problem and prevent its use for malafide purposes. The government made it clear that WhatsApp was in such a position that it could not evade accountability and responsibility.
Facebook-owned WhatsApp in its response wrote a letter to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology said that it was "horrified" at the lynchings. It further added that they have been testing ways to curb the problem of fake news.
Here is the complete text of WhatsApp's letter to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, in response to the situation.
Thank you for your letter dated July 2. Like the Government of India, we're horrified by these terrible acts of violence and wanted to respond quickly to the very important issues you have raised. We believe this is a challenge that requires government, civil society and technology companies to work together.
Our strategy has been twofold:
First, to give people the controls and information they need to stay safe; and
Second, to work proactively to prevent misuse on WhatsApp.
WhatsApp cares deeply about people's safety which is why we designed our app with security in mind from the get-go. For example, you can block anyone from messaging you with just one tap. And if someone who is not in your address book sends you a message, WhatsApp automatically asks if you want to block or report that user. We've also recently made a number of changes to group chats to prevent the spread of unwanted information, which we believe will address some of the specific issues you raise.
In Mid-May, we added new protections to prevent people from adding others back into groups which they had left — a form of misuse we think it is important to correct. And last week, we launched a new setting that enables administrators to decide who gets to send messages within individual groups. This will help reduce the spread of unwanted messages into important group conversations — as well as the forwarding of hoaxes and other content.
In addition, we have been testing a new label in India that highlights when a message has been forwarded versus composed by the sender. This could serve as an important signal for recipients to think twice before forwarding messages because it lets a user know if the content they received was written by the person they know or a potential rumour from someone else. We plan to launch this new feature soon.
Finally, just yesterday we announced a new project to work with leading academic experts in India to learn more about the spread of misinformation, which will help inform additional product improvements going forward — as well as help our efforts to block bad actors (see below) going forward.
Digital Literacy and Fact-checking
We are also working hard to educate people about how to stay safe online. For example, we regularly put out information that explains how to spot fake news and hoaxes — and we plan to run long-term public safety ad campaigns in India, given its importance to us at WhatsApp. As a starting point, we will soon publish new educational materials around misinformation and conduct our news literacy workshops.
This year, for the first time, we also started working with fact checking organizations to identify rumors and false news — and respond to them — using WhatsApp.
For example, during the recent Presidential election in Mexico, we worked closely with the news consortium Verificado. Users sent thousands of rumors to Verificado's WhatsApp account and in turn, were provided regular updates on what was accurate and what was false
In Brazil, we are now working with 24 news organizations on a similar program — the learnings from our experiences in both countries will help us fight fake news in India
Already in India, the fact-checking organization Boom Live is available on WhatsApp and has published numerous important reports on the source of the rumours that have contributed to the recent violence.
This kind of work gives everyone a better understanding of the problematic fake news circulating on WhatsApp, and how it relates to misinformation being shared on other platforms. In addition, it's a helpful resource right within WhatsApp where people can get answers about content they've been sent. It's why we're looking at how best to ramp up these efforts in India going forward.
Proactive Action to Tackle Abuse
As you know, WhatsApp retains limited information and is end-to-end encrypted. We use this technology to protect our user's privacy and security. While WhatsApp messages can be highly viral, the way people use the app is by nature still very private. Many people (nearly 25 percent in India) are not in a group; the majority of groups continue to be small (less than ten people); and nine in ten messages are still sent from just one person to another.
People are increasingly using WhatsApp to get advice from their doctor, do business or communicate with their bank — as well as to chat with family and friends. They want to know these messages are private and secure — and that no-one else is reading them. This focus on privacy brings many benefits, though as with all technology there are trade-offs. And for WhatsApp, that's the inability to see problematic content spreading through private conversations on our app.
That said, we do have the ability to prevent spam, which includes some of the misinformation that can create mistrust and potentially violence. Because we cannot see the content of messages being sent over WhatsApp we block messages based on user reports and by the manner in which they are sent. We use machine learning to identify accounts by sending a high volume of messages (faster than any human could) and we are constantly working to improve our ability to stop unwanted automated messages.
We also respond to valid law enforcement requests to help them investigate crimes. And soon, we will start an engagement program with law enforcement officials around India so they are familiar with our approach and how we can be helpful. We also want to share best practices for how WhatsApp is used by local police as a resource for their community. For example, the police in Hyderabad have created a WhatsApp account that anyone can message with rumors that concern them. And by working with community leaders to get them using our latest features (see above), they can help keep their communities informed about hoaxes circulating locally. As we have already seen, this can help save lives.
If you would like to talk further about the actions we are taking and our plans going forward, please let us know. We believe that false news, misinformation and the spread of hoaxes are issues best tackled collectively: by the government, civil society, and technology companies working together. With the right action, we can help improve everyone's safety by ensuring communities are better equipped to deal with malicious hoaxes and false information — while still enabling people to communicate reliably and privately across India.
Pyongyang announced plans to launch missiles toward Guam, a US territory in the Pacific. (Yonhap)
HAGATNA, Guam -- Guam's leader said Monday that "sometimes a bully can only be stopped with a punch in the nose", in a spirited defence of President Donald Trump's rhetoric against North Korea which has the island in its crosshairs.While Trump's critics accuse him of inflaming tensions with Pyongyang, Guam governor Eddie Calvo said he was grateful the US leader was taking a strong stance against North Korean threats against his Pacific homeland."Everyone who grew up in the schoolyard in elementary school, we understand a bully," Calvo told AFP."(North Korean leader) Kim Jong-Un is a bully with some very strong weapons... a bully has to be countered very strongly."Calvo, a Republican, said Trump was being unfairly criticised over his handling of the North Korea crisis, which escalated when Pyongyang announced plans to launch missiles toward Guam in a "crucial warning".He said North Korea had threatened Guam -- a US territory which hosts two large military bases and is home to more than 6,000 military personnel -- at least three times since 2013.He said previous presidents had also used strong words to warn off Pyongyang, pointing out Barack Obama said last year that "we could, obviously, destroy North Korea with our arsenals"."One president (Obama) said it one way, cool and calmly with a period... the other said fire and fury with an exclamation point, but it still leads to the same message," Calvo said.He rejected suggestions that Trump and the North Korean dictator were as bad as each other when it came to the sabre-rattling playing out in the western Pacific."Well there's only one guy that has vaporised into a red mist his uncle or a general because he fell asleep in a meeting with an anti-aircraft gun, that's Kim Jong-Un," he said."There's only one guy that's killed his brother with one of the most toxic nerve agents ever created, that's Kim Jong-Un."

The most exciting thing to be about this Jessica Jones story is oh my god, we're finally getting more Jessica Jones soon(ish)! It has been almost two years already, which is an eternity in TV time, and as Jessica is my favorite Defender, I have been not-so-patiently waiting for more (yes she is in The Defenders of course, but not enough).
Now on to the actual news: EW is reporting that Jessica Jones Season 1 villain Kilgrave (David Tennant) will be back in Season 2. Spoiler warning from here on out: we don't know what exactly Tennant's role as Kilgrave will be, though, since Jessica (Krysten Ritter) snapped his neck at the end of Season 1. I presume he'll be back in flashbacks, since one of the major keys to Jessica Jones' first season was the exploration of her PTSD in the aftermath of Kilgrave's torture of her, which obviously doesn't “disappear” just because she has gotten revenge on him.
Today, EW already revealed a photo of the pair from the set:
Isn't Tennant just hamming it up and looking deliciously diabolical as the evil Purple Man? I think that him haunting Jessica would be a good thing for the show to include, but to actually resurrect him in any way would be a huge misstep. The Purple Man (Kilgrave) is a major part of Jessica Jones' story in the comics, as he has immense and terrifying powers of mind control (like we saw in Season 1). But to see more of their history together as well as how he might still be in her mind now would add even more depth to what is Marvel's best single Netflix season to date. I accept no substitutes!
We'll bring you more news and updates on Jessica Jones Season 2 as we know it, but in the meantime, check out some of our recent articles on The Defenders:
ISLAMABAD - Chairman Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Imran Khan has said that he conveyed to the army chief in the meeting early this month that PTI will not let the next elections be rigged as, according to him, had happened in 2013.
Speaking in Geo News programme Capital Talk, Imran said that he reiterated in front of Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa that free and fair elections and not elections held for the sake of it are a cornerstone of democracy.
Expanding on his meeting with the army chief, Imran said that he requested a meeting mainly to discuss two issues, namely, Pak-Afghan border tensions and the merger of Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
He said that both issues were directly affecting KP and after the closure of the border by the army, he thought it was important to discuss the issue with the army chief.
Imran reiterated that Gen Bajwa had expressed his support for democracy in the meeting. “He ‘clearly' said that he supports democracy.”
The army chief said that as an institution the army supports free and fair elections, the PTI chief added.
When asked if he also discussed Gen (retd) Raheel Sharif's appointment as the chief of Saudi-led alliance, Imran said that he did and that many other issues came under discussion in the hour-long meeting.
Imran Khan on April 1 called on the army chief, an Inter-Services Public Relations statement had said. The PTI chief felicitated General Bajwa on his promotion and appointment and discussed various issues in the meeting, according to the statement.
Condemning the lynching incident in Mardan, in which university student Mashal Khan lost his life, Imran likened the case to the Army Public School, Peshawar massacre and said that it has created a consensus against such brutal incidents.
He said that all aspects of the case will be probed. “Those responsible will be punished in a way that people fear about doing any such thing.”
We will not spare anyone who is behind the incident,” the PTI chief said. Imran said that he will visit Mashal's parents tomorrow and apprise them of the details of the investigation.
Durban: The national team's captaincy has come his way quite early and in an unusual manner, but Aiden Markram looks all prepared to deal with the "good pressure" by taking along the seniors in the side.
In a shocking move, the 23-year-old batsman was named captain for the remaining five ODIs against India owing to Faf du Plessis' withdrawal due to a finger injury.
"It's a big honour. The selectors showing confidence in me to take over, it means quite a bit. It's a super humbling experience, but yes, we're going to need to do this for Faf, I believe," said Markram on the eve of the second ODI.
"I think it's something that you can't take for granted. I really enjoy captaining but it's an unexpected thing. Like I said it was a freak incident with Faf and this has all just happened so quickly," he said.
"I managed to sleep, yeah," he added, laughing.
"It's going to be an additional pressure to deal with but I believe it's a good pressure. You get good and bad sort of pressures, and for me its really a pressure that hopefully I can thrive on."
The pitch at Supersport Park looks an ODI batting beauty and the spinners will come into play again. Markram said that he might look to make some changes.
"Generally it's a good wicket at the SuperSport Park. We're going to look more in depth at it this afternoon and then tomorrow morning and then make a decision. The decision will be made completely on what will benefit our side, and not on how India play.
"I believe there are quality batsmen in our middle order and it's just about taking responsibility. Obviously we've had to adjust our game plans just a touch going into this game, but it wasn't addressing any sort of problem I don't think," he added, about facing the Indian wrist-spinners.
Talking about possible batting changes, the skipper said, "Hashim Amla has been so good at the top of the order for us. He just provides that calmness and hits good cricket shots when the field is up, so hes a massive asset up at the top for us. I don't think there is any need to adjust the batting line-up per se. I just think players need to develop some nice and strong game plans.
"I think it would make sense for myself to go up to three.
I've spent most of my career opening the batting. From No 3 we're not 100 per cent sure of the side just yet. That selection meeting still needs to take place.
"But yeah, it would make sense for me to go up to No 3. From there onward, there's plenty of experience in JP Duminy and David Miller. So we'll organise and go according to how the game dictates tomorrow," he added.
Du Plessis had ruled out the possibility of South Africa fielding two spinners (Tabraiz Shamsi with Imran Tahir).
When asked about his thoughts on the issue, Markram replied, "Even if we watch how Shamsi has been operating in training today and his form coming into the ODI series, hes been top drawer. And he really is putting his hand up for selection.
"Its a temptation of course, especially watching how their bowlers have bowled. But like you said, its different conditions in Durban to what it is in the Highveld. It's something to talk about for sure," added Markram.
The key for the young captain will be handling the pressure of a mighty opponent in India, as well as managing former captains and senior players on the field.
Markram said that he had taken enough tips from du Plessis and will be looking up to Amla for further support.
"Faf's sort of taken me under his wings since I've been involved in the environment. I'll keep sending messages on and off the field, asking for advice, asking for any hints. But at the end of the day, It's going to be my decision to make on the field though.
"Fortunately, there's plenty of experience within the squad and it won't be a decision made just by myself. Ill definitely consult the senior players, obviously for the better interest of the side as well," added the Titans cricketer.
"Yes it can be an intimidating thing (handling seniors). But the culture in the team is so good it allows for a young player like myself to go and engage with a guy like Hashim, whos a legend of the game. It makes it a lot easier for me, its not something I see as intimidating.
The most engrossing piece in this first section is Daniel Gordon's "Clementines" (2011), a tabletop still life with a charismatically funky sense of space. Gordon fills a crumpled paper basket with the fruit of his hands, scissors and internet searches. He sets these little orbs with patchwork photographic skins against a background that poses multiple-choice options for defining place. This glorious ode to the unsettled nature of two-dimensional representation is what Cezanne might have made, had he used Photoshop.
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia – Police were checking surveillance tapes Wednesday for clues about who may have assassinated the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un at an airport in Kuala Lumpur, a senior official said.
An autopsy will also be performed on the body of Kim Jong Nam, police said. Kim, 46, was targeted Monday in the shopping concourse at the airport and had not gone through immigration yet for his flight to Macau, said a senior government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the case involves sensitive diplomacy.
Kim, who died on the way to a hospital, told medical workers before he died that he had been attacked with a chemical spray, the official said.
Selangor police chief Abdul Samah Mat said police were searching for clues in the CCTV footage. The airport is in Selangor near Kuala Lumpur.

Kim Jong Nam was estranged from his younger brother, the North Korean leader. Although he had been tipped by some outsiders as a possible successor to his dictator father, others thought that was unlikely because he lived outside the country, including recently in Macau, Singapore and Malaysia.
He reportedly fell further out of favour when he was caught trying to enter Japan on a false passport in 2001, saying he wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland.
Multiple South Korean media reports, citing unidentified sources, said Kim Jong Nam was killed at the airport by two women believed to be North Korean agents. They fled in a taxi and were being sought by Malaysian police, the reports said.
A Malaysian police statement confirmed the death of a 46-year-old North Korean man whom it identified from his travel document as Kim Chol, born in Pyongyang on June 10, 1970. “Investigation is in progress and a post mortem examination request has been made to ascertain the cause of death,” the statement said.
Ken Gause, at the CNA think-tank in Washington who has studied North Korea's leadership for 30 years, said Kim Chol was a name that Kim Jong Nam has travelled under. He is believed to have been born May 10, 1971, although birthdays are always unclear for senior North Koreans, Gause said.

Mark Tokola, vice-president of the Korea Economic Institute in Washington and a former deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul, said it would be surprising if Kim Jong Nam was not killed on the orders of his brother, given that North Korean agents have reportedly tried to assassinate Kim Jong Nam in the past.
“It seems probable that the motivation for the murder was a continuing sense of paranoia on the part of Kim Jong-un,” Tokola wrote in a commentary Tuesday. Although there was scant evidence that Kim Jong Nam was plotting against the North Korean leader, he provided an alternative for North Koreans who would want to depose his brother.
The reported killing came as North Korea celebrated its latest missile launch, which foreign experts were analyzing for evidence of advancement in the country's missile capabilities. For the next several days, North Korea will be marking the birthday of its late leader Kim Jong Il, the brothers' father, though they have different mothers. The major holiday this Thursday is called the “Day of the Shining Star” and will be feted with figure skating and synchronized swimming exhibitions, fireworks and mass rallies.
Since taking power in late 2011, Kim Jong-un has executed or purged a slew of high-level government officials in what the South Korean government has described as a “reign of terror.” The most spectacular was the 2013 execution by anti-aircraft fire of his uncle, Jang Song Thaek, once considered the country's second-most-powerful man, for what the North alleged was treason.
Gause said Kim Jong Nam had been forthright that he did not have political ambitions, although he was publicly critical of the North Korean regime and his brother's legitimacy in the past.

Kim Jong Nam had been less outspoken since 2011, when North Korean assassins reportedly tried to shoot him in Macau, Gause said, though the details of the attempted killing are murky. South Korea also reportedly jailed a North Korean spy in 2012 who admitted to trying to organize a hit-and-run accident targeting Kim Jong Nam in China in 2010.
Despite the attempts on his life, Kim Jong Nam had reportedly travelled to North Korea since then, so it was assumed he was no longer under threat. Kim Jong Nam may have become more vulnerable as his defender in the North Korean hierarchy, Kim Kyong Hui – Kim Jong-un's aunt and the wife of his executed uncle, Jang Song Thaek – appears to have fallen from favour or died. She has not been seen in public for more than three years, Gause said.
Kim Jong Il had at least three sons with two women, as well as a daughter by a third. Kim Jong Nam was the eldest, followed by Kim Jong Chul, who is a few years older than Kim Jong-un and is known as a playboy who reportedly attended Eric Clapton concerts in London in 2015. It's unclear what positon he has in the North Korean government. A younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, was named a member of the Workers' Party of Korea's Central Committee during a North Korean party congress last May. She has a position in a propaganda and agitation department and is known as Kim Jong-un's gatekeeper, Gause said.
While the most likely explanation for the killing was that Kim Jong-un was removing a potential challenger to North Korean leadership within his own family, he could also be sending a warning to North Korean officials to demonstrate the reach of the regime. It follows the defection last year of a senior diplomat from the North Korean Embassy in London who has spoken of his despair at Kim's purges.

Karachi - In his message on 70th Independence Day of Pakistan, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah has said that the nation must remember the martyrs of armed and civil forces who are defending the country's borders and fighting against the terrorists. He was addressing a cake cutting ceremony held here at Karachi Press Club (KPC) on Monday in connection with the Independence Day.
Those who accompanied the chief minister included Information Minister Syed Nasir Shah, Culture Minister Syed Sardar Shah, PPP leader Qasim Siraj Soomro and KUJ members, Maqsood Yousfi, Hamidur Rehman and others.
He said that Pakistan was a beautiful country, which came into being due to the struggle and sacrifices of our elders. “Now we have to protect it from all the threats and conspiracies,” he emphasised. Murad saluted the civil and army forces fighting against terrorists, and condemned the recent Quetta blast in which personnel of armed forces and civilians had been killed. He expressed solidarity with the families of the victims.
The chief minister paid rich tributes to Quaide-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah under whose leadership Pakistan came into being. “The unity among Indian Muslims for achieving independence is historic and we again need similar unity against the terrorists," the CM said, and added, I am proud to say that our nation has rejected the terrorists." He assured the KPC office-bearers of resolution of all their issues, including release of grants and development of Hawkes Bay scheme.
He urged them to open the club's membership so that genuine journalists could become part of the club.
Earlier, Information Minister Syed Nasir Shah, while speaking on the occasion, said, “Our existence lies in the independence of our country.”
He recalled the sacrifices of elders who won independence with their struggle, unity and wisdom.
In the end, the chief minister cut the cake to celebrate 70th Independence Day of the country.
CM orders arrangements for cadet college student's education in Karachi
Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah has directed the education department to make arrangements for the education of Ahmed Mashori, the student of Cadet College Larkana, in Karachi and report to him.
He issued these directives just after meeting Mashori, who along with his father and young sisters, called on him here at the CM House on Monday to thank him for sending him abroad for the treatment of his fractured throat.
Mashori, who seemed to be quite healthy and confident, thanked the chief minister for bearing the expenses of his treatment abroad. He requested him that he wanted to continue his education, but in Karachi. The chief minister issued directives to the education department to make necessary arrangements for his Education.
Mashori's father told Murad that Girls' Primary School Mashori Sharif, district Larkana was closed for want of female teachers.
The CM issued directives to the minister for education then and there to make the school functional and report to him.
He urged Mashori, the young boy, to forget the past and start new life Almighty Allah had given to him.
The chief minister presented a bouquet of flowers to Ahmed and wished him best of luck.
ANKARA (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department on Wednesday denied media reports that a deal had been reached between the United States and Turkey on a three-step plan for withdrawing the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia from Syria's Manbij.

“We don't have any agreements yet with the government of Turkey,” department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement in Washington.
“We're continuing to have ongoing conversations regarding Syria and other issues of mutual concern,” she said, adding that American and Turkish officials had met in Ankara last week for talks on the issue.
Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency said on Wednesday Ankara and Washington had reached a technical agreement on the withdrawal plan, a move Turkey has long sought from the United States.
The report comes as differences over Syria policy and Washington's decision in December to move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem have strained ties between the NATO allies.
Turkey is outraged by U.S. support for the YPG militia, considering them a terrorist organisation. Ankara has threatened to push its offensive in northern Syria's Afrin region further east to Manbij.
Manbij is a potential flashpoint. The Syrian government, Kurdish militants, Syrian rebel groups, Turkey, and the United States all have a military presence in northern Syria.
Under the terms of the plan to be finalised during a visit by Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu to Washington on June 4, the YPG will withdraw from Manbij 30 days after the deal is signed, Anadolu said, quoting sources who attended meetings at which the decisions were made.
Turkish and U.S. military forces will start joint supervision in Manbij 45 days after the agreement is signed and a local administration will be formed 60 days after June 4, Anadolu said.
Earlier on Wednesday, Cavusoglu told broadcaster AHaber that a timetable for the Manbij plans could be set during talks with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington, and that it could be implemented before the end of the summer.
Cavusoglu was also quoted by media on his return flight from Germany saying that, if finalised, the plan for Manbij could be applied throughout northern Syria.
However, a local Manbij official later told Reuters that Cavusoglu's assertions that U.S. and Turkish forces would temporarily control the region were “premature” and lacked credibility.
Relations between Ankara and Washington have hit a low-point due to factors such as the sentencing this month in New York of a former Turkish state bank executive to 32 months in prison for taking part in an Iran sanctions-busting scheme, a case Turkey has called a political attack.
DEFENCE PROCUREMENT
Turkey has also caused unease in Washington with its decision to buy S-400 surface-to-air missiles from Russia and drew criticism over its detention of a U.S. Christian pastor, Andrew Brunson, on terrorism charges.
Brunson faces up to 35 years in prison on charges of links to the network Ankara blames for a 2016 coup attempt. The pastor denied the charges in a Turkish court this month.
A U.S. Senate committee last week passed its version of a $716 billion defence policy bill, including a measure to prevent Turkey from buying Lockheed Martin F-35 jets, citing Brunson and the Russian missile deal.
Cavusoglu, however, said that if the United States blocked Turkey from buying the jets, Ankara would go elsewhere to meet its needs, adding that it was unlikely Washington would be able to back out of the deal.
Turkey has plans to buy more than 100 of the F-35 jets and the Pentagon last year awarded Lockheed $3.7 billion in an interim payment for the production of 50 of the aircraft earmarked for non-U.S. customers, including Ankara.

Mo Salah produced one of the all-time great European performances to put Liverpool within touching distance of the Champions' League final.
But a unlikely, improbable comeback from Roma as they scored two late goals has left the Italians dreaming of another impossible result in the eternal city next week.
Eusebio Di Francesco's men know that the same stunning 3-0 win they miraculously earned against Barça in the previous round will put them through the final, despite being left out for the count on another amazing Champions' League night.
If Roma's fight-back took the gloss over what was until the last 10 minutes one of Liverpool finest-ever European nights, then it should not detract from Salah's masterpiece.
Not content with his one-man assault on the English goal-scoring records, the Egyptian King is not set about world domination after this stunning display posted notice to Messi and Ronaldo he is coming after them.

The forward took his season's tally to an astonishing 43 goals with two breath-taking first half finishes, and then he proved he is far more than a goal-mouth poacher, with an unselfish vision to gift goals for Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino after the break.
When Firmino added a fifth from a corner with a stunning header, it left hapless Roma out for the count on the Anfield turf, and Liverpool considering an eighth European Cup final.
But just as Reds fans were booking their flights to Kiev, events again conspired to leave Liverpool fearing the return leg on Rome next week, as Edin Dzeko pulled one back with a cool finish nine minutes from time.

And then referee Felix Brych – no stranger to controversy, gave another hugely debatable decision when he awarded a penalty for handball against James Milner with five minutes remaining.
It was harsh in the extreme with the ball seeming to strike the midfielder from close range, but sub Diego Perotti's finish from the spot gives Roma something to fight for in the second leg.
Salah though, will be confident of scoring again in Rome to finish the job, as his former team-mates looked fearful of his every move, after a world class display.

RYAN Sears opened his account for his hometown club as Newtown overcame a stubborn Holywell Town in the second round of the Nathaniel MG Cup on Tuesday.
A much changed Newtown side dominated from the start with Nick Rushton firing over before James Murphy tested Holywell goalkeeper Andy Hughes.
However the Wellmen grew into the game with Steve Lewis forcing a Jolyon Harries into a vital block while Sam Jones spurned a handful of openings.
Newtown finally celebrated a breakthrough on the hour with Harries' clever reverse pass falling for Sears to lash past Hughes.
Holywell were incensed after appeals for a penalty after Mark Winslade went down in the box under pressure from goalkeeper Jack Perry were denied by referee Kevin Parry.
The Robins doubled their lead with 13 minutes remaining with Joe Kenton and Rushton linking to release Ryan Kershaw who played Luke Boundford through to slot home.

Uber, the wildly convenient ride-sharing app that you used to use before you learned that it's a union-busting, regulator-ducking, poverty wage-paying monstrosity that can't stop its employees from sexually harassing one another, has wrapped up the Eric Holder-led independent investigation of its company culture, and the verdict is in: co-founder and CEO Travis Kalanick, the man known for pulling charming stunts like telling a bankrupt driver to “take responsibility for his own shit,” is taking an extended leave of absence from the company he founded. Kalanick explained in an email to employees that he is taking the time to mourn his mother, who died in a boat accident in May, but he added that he also intends to “reflect” and “work on himself” in the meantime. His return date: very much TBD.
The rest of the investigation's fallout is pretty standard stuff for a company grappling with a grotesquely sexist workplace environment—a separate inquiry from Holder's has apparently analyzed some 200+allegations of sex discrimination and workplace abuse, and more terminations are expected once the results of that review are announced. Today's all-hands staff meeting also sprinkled in an appropriate volume of reform-themed Silicon Valley technobabble for good measure:
Kalanick's departure, though, is the big story. When coupled with the resignation on Monday of Uber executive Emil Michael—last seen allegedly involved in the company's clandestine attempts to pin responsibility for an Uber driver's rape of a passenger in India on one of Uber's ride-sharing competitors—it appears that maybe, just maybe, the parties responsible for creating Uber's toxic culture might actually face some consequences for their actions. The way Kalanick's shares in the company are structured means that it would be very hard for the board to actually fire him, but his conspicuous absence from today's announcement and the unusually open-ended nature of his sabbatical together indicate that someone managed to convince him that the company would be better off without him, at least for the time being.
The question for a post-Travis Kalanick Uber is whether the company can replicate its early success without resorting to the ethically-dubious-at-best practices that enabled it to dominate the ride-sharing market in the first place. Was Uber great in spite of its willingness to cut corners, or because of it? If its engineers start to work more humane hours, and if the company begins cooperating with regulators instead of trying to steamroll them, and if the price of a ride suddenly includes costs associated with paying drivers a living wage, it's at least possible that Uber can't maintain the same pace of growth anymore and returns to adecidedly Earth-bound valuation. The company better hope that a lot more users take their inspiration fromSan Francisco graffiti-art projects and start using the app again, because what happens next will determine what Uber's future looks like—or, really, if it has one at all.

This arm balance still triggers my fear of flying, but it gently prepares your core for other high-flying moves
To be totally honest, Crow Pose is an arm balance that still triggers my fear of flying. Here is an exercise that gently prepares the core for this and other high-flying poses that even a landlubber like me can get down with.
1. Begin on your back with knees bent and both feet resting on the ground.
2. Using your hands, bring the knees close to the chest with big toes touching and knees separated as wide as your torso.
3. Curl your head, shoulders and upper back away from the earth and place your knees on the backs of your upper arms, as close to the armpits as possible. Reach your hands for the sky while simultaneously pressing the upper arm bones down into your kneecaps.
4. Be sure to hug your inner legs into your sides as you count five breaths.
A noted Greek philosopher, Gus Portokalos of “My Big Fat Greek Wedding,” delivered a memorable toast to his daughter and new son-in-law near the end of the movie. “Here tonight,” he said, “we have apple and orange. We all different but, in the end, we all fruit.”
The best marketing minds are like that – a marriage of seeming opposites that end up working together. Strategic marketers today must balance the right brain that controls creativity and intuition and the left brain that processes information logically and analytically.
That's because the profession is part art, as it's always been, and part science, thanks to the rise of Big Data, social media targeting and other technology for targeting and nurturing buyers.
Don't Drop Creativity
But there is increasing teeth-gnashing among marketers that the center of gravity has shifted too far to the left, with the methodical, mathematically-oriented aspects of the job getting too much focus at the expense of the core fun of marketing.
As L'Oréal Chief Marketing Officer Hugh Pile put it recently during a panel session of the British advertising group ISBA, “There's a lot of discussion of left-brain logical skills, about science and analytics, and we need that stuff because of the marketing technologies that are available to use in programmatic and analytics. But we need to counter that with right-brain skills: creativity and ideation.”
It's become a fact of life for many marketers that they're so bogged down in day-to-day tactical operations that they can't pay as much attention as they'd like to why they got into marketing in the first place – for the art of it. A combination of factors is responsible.
One is the obsession with data. “If it moves, measure it” has become the mantra at many organizations. Metrics-based approaches are being applied to everything, from the success of an individual email campaign to the validity of broad marketing programs.
Make no mistake: This is a healthy obsession. Valuable insights are gained from the data and make marketers smarter. But it tends to be time-consuming to gather, analyze and report on all of this data. And it's easy for over-reliance on data to distract a marketing organization from the human side of marketing.
Data Doesn't Stir Emotions
I like how Gartner analysts Jake Sorofman and Andrew Frank characterized the situation in a Harvard Business Review article a couple of years ago:
“Data can play a leading role in developing strategy and bringing precision to execution, but it does nothing – absolutely nothing – to stir motivation and create the desire that makes cash registers ring. Data is important, but it's content that makes an emotional connection. That's why we believe today's data-obsessed marketers are at risk of cultivating only half a brain. Marketing leaders must remember that true brand intelligence lives at the intersection of head and heart, where the emotional self meets the analytical self.”
Another factor weighing down many marketing departments is that, despite the technological advances available today, they continue to rely on old manual processes.
Take the work involved in doing a webinar, for example. It's a stream of activities: Getting people to register, promoting the event, reminding people about it, building a landing web page, following up with attendees as well as with those who didn't, etc. It can be a tedious, bandwidth-sapping process that drains time and energy from big-picture thinking.
Many marketers also still wrestle with the List Monster – the need to manage and maintain myriad lists, such as those containing email addresses for targeted campaigns. Despite technology that can automate these processes, a surprising number of marketing organizations still cling to manual, spreadsheet-intensive systems.
All of which gets to an interesting point about marketing technology, which sounds so left brain but actually encourages balance between the right and left brains in marketing. By automating a lot of the day-to-day processes that have become de rigueur for marketing in the digital era, marketing technology isn't so much about machines doing what marketers do as it is about them taking over what marketers don't want to do.
Technology holds the key to freeing marketers to be creative and strategic – in other words, to market.
I'll toast to that!

LONDON – In a shock announcement, Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday called for an early general election to be held June 8 to seek a strong mandate as she negotiates Britain's exit from the European Union.
Standing outside 10 Downing Street, May said she would ask the House of Commons on Wednesday to back her call for an election, three years before the next scheduled date in May 2020.
She said that since Britons voted to leave the EU in June, the country had come together, but politicians had not. She said the political divisions “risk our ability to make a success of Brexit.”

At present, May's governing Conservatives have 330 seats in the 650-seat House of Commons. May said that “our opponents believe that because the government's majority is so small, our resolve will weaken and that they can force us to change course” on leaving the EU.
“They are wrong,” she said. “They underestimate our determination to get the job done and I am not prepared to let them endanger the security of millions of working people across the country.”
Under Britain's Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, elections are held every five years, but the prime minister can call a snap election if two-thirds of lawmakers vote for it.
The leader of the main opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, has previously said he would back such a call.
VIDEO: Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May formally announced Article 50, triggering the Brexit process from the European Union, walking out on a 44-year relationship.
May took office in July after predecessor David Cameron stepped down following his failed attempt to get voters to back remaining in the EU. Since then she has ruled out calling an early election to get her own mandate. But she said Tuesday she had “reluctantly” changed her mind.
Polls give May's Conservatives a double-digit lead on Labour, which is divided under left-wing leader Corbyn.

Alberta Premier Rachel Notley will give a speech about the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion in the community where the Kinder Morgan project originates.
Notley will speak at the Sherwood Park & District Chamber of Commerce to reinforce the government's commitment to the project.
The $7.4-billion project would triple the capacity of the existing line from Strathcona County to Burnaby, to get more oil to overseas markets and fetch a better price.
The tension between Alberta and B.C. over the line remains high, as B.C. Premier John Horgan's government continues to try to block the already green-lit expansion, which Notley says “will be built.”
READ MORE: Alberta moves to cut energy shipments expected to hit more than B.C. fuel prices
The project was approved by the federal government in 2016 but has since faced court challenges and permit delays in B.C. Horgan's government says it still has concerns over the impact of the expansion on the potential for oil spills in its waterways and on its coastline.
READ MORE: Support for the Trans Mountain expansion grows amidst pipeline dispute
Horgan's opposition to Trans Mountain is rooted, in part, in the fact that his NDP government depends on the support of the Green Party, which opposes the project. This opposition is the main reason Kinder Morgan put the brakes on non-essential funding for the project earlier this month.
Kinder Morgan announced April 8 it was scaling back construction, citing obstruction by B.C. that put the financial viability of the pipeline in question. It gave a deadline of May 31 for a clear signal the project can get built.
READ MORE: Kinder Morgan CEO says Trans Mountain pipeline may be ‘untenable'
Earlier this month, Horgan and Notley met in Ottawa with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and Trudeau has said Ottawa will join talks with Alberta and Kinder Morgan to work out a financing arrangement to ensure the project gets built.

DENVER (Reuters) - Taylor Swift won her trial against a Colorado radio personality on Monday after a jury found that the former DJ assaulted and battered the pop star by groping her bare bottom, and awarded her the symbolic $1 in damages she had sought.
Swift cried and hugged her mother as the verdicts were read in U.S. District Court in Denver and mouthed an emphatic "thank you" to members of the jury as they left the courtroom.
The six-woman, two-man jury, which deliberated for less than four hours following a sensational week-long trial, also rejected claims by radio personality David Mueller that members of Swift's management team - her mother and a radio station liaison - got him fired from his "dream job" as a DJ by making false accusations.
"I acknowledge the privilege that I benefit from in life, in society and in my ability to shoulder the enormous cost of defending myself in a trial like this," the 27-year-old singer said in a statement released immediately following the verdicts.
"My hope is to help those whose voices should also be heard," Swift said, adding that she would make donations to organizations that help sexual assault victims defend themselves.
Mueller, 55, showed no reaction as the verdicts were read.

The DJ had initiated the litigation after he was fired from his job after the groping claim was reported to the radio station. In his lawsuit he called the groping accusations false, and he sued Swift, her mother, Andrea, and radio station liaison Frank Bell over his termination.
During closing statements in the case, Mueller's attorney, Gabriel McFarland, argued that his client was a respected industry veteran who would never have risked his $150,000-per-year radio job by grabbing a major celebrity's rear end.

But Swift was firm on the witness stand, saying that there was no question in her mind that Mueller had intentionally slipped his hand under her skirt to clutch her bare bottom. Her attorney, Douglas Baldridge, said during his closing remarks that Swift was seeking only $1 in damages because she had no desire to bankrupt Mueller, but only wanted to send a message.
"It means 'no means no' and it tells every woman they will decide what will be tolerated with their body," Baldridge said of the principle Swift was trying to defend.
U.S. District Judge William Martinez on Friday dismissed Mueller's accusation against Swift, saying there was no evidence that she had acted improperly. The judge left standing the entertainer's assault and battery countersuit against Mueller.
He also left intact a single claim by Mueller accusing Swift's mother and Bell of interfering with his contract and effectively ending his career at radio station KYGO-FM. The jury rejected that claim.
Before the trial, Martinez had tossed out Mueller's defamation-of-character claim against Swift, ruling that he had waited too long to file a lawsuit on those grounds.
Minister for Trade, Energy and Employment, Ian Douglas, has urged those who vend agricultural produce on the streets of the capital to return to the Roseau Market because it has reopened since the passage of Hurricane Maria.
He stated that street vending in Roseau is something that the government does not want to encourage because of the lack of proper sanitary facilities.
“So we want to as much as possible to encourage all of our vendors to really return to the Roseau market,” Douglas said last week.
He stated that he understands the situation immediately after Hurricane Maria when vendors wanted to ply their trade but now that the market is opened, they should go there.
“That is the purpose of the market and that is really where all of the conditions necessary required for proper fresh produce vending is and not on the side of the road where you have no pipe-borne water beside the road, no washroom facility … to meet the sanitary requirements needed for fresh produce vending that may exist at the Roseau Market,” he noted.
DEXIA announced last week the market has reopened but stated that half a million dollars are needed to get the facility working in normal conditions.
LAHORE - The Airport Security Force (ASF) arrested a passenger at Lahore airport and recovered ammunition from his possession on Monday.
An official at Allama Iqbal International Airport (AIIAP) said that the accused, Inam Ullah, an engineer by profession, was travelling for Istanbul.
During search process, 50 bullets of 9MM rifle were recovered from his baggage.
The accused is resident of Lahore and had come back from Istanbul few days ago.
He was handed over to local police for further action where an FIR has been registered against him under section 13/20/65 of PPC.
Inam, during preliminary investigation, told the police that he had carried the bullets unintentionally since he had come back from hunting and could not take out the same from his bag. He will be produced in court today.

PHOENIX — Catcher J.T. Realmuto lost his salary arbitration case against Miami and first baseman Justin Bour beat the Marlins to leave players with a 3-1 record this year.
Realmuto was given a $2.9 million salary Friday instead of his request for $3.5 million. The decision was made by arbitrators Andrew Strongin, Elizabeth Neumeier and Allen Ponak, who heard arguments Wednesday.
Bour was awarded $3.4 million instead of Miami's $3 million offer by James Oldham, Steven Wolf and Mark Burstein, who listened to arguments Thursday.
Realmuto may be traded as part of the team's payroll purge under new chief executive Derek Jeter. The Marlins already have dealt major league home run champion Giancarlo Stanton, Marcell Ozuna, Dee Gordon and Christian Yelich. Realmuto made $562,500 last year and was eligible for arbitration for the first time after hitting .278 with 17 homers and 65 RBIs.
Bour hit .289 with 25 homers and 83 RBIs last year, when he had a $552,500 salary.
Boston All-Star outfielder Mookie Betts and Arizona pitcher Shelby Miller won the first two cases of the year.
Houston closer Ken Giles had a hearing Thursday, and Toronto closer Roberto Osuna went before a panel on Friday. Both were eligible for arbitration for the first time.
As many as 25 players could go to hearings this year, which would be the most since 1987.
Osuna asked Wolf, Robert Herzog and James Darby for a raise from $552,400 to $5.8 million instead of the Blue Jays' $5.3 million offer. The 22-year-old right-hander was 3-4 with a 3.38 ERA and 39 saves last season, raising his three-year total to 95. But he also led the major leagues with 10 blown saves in 2017.
Giles asked Phillip LaPorte, Strongin and Sylvia Skratek for a raise from $555,100 to $4.6 million — $400,000 more than Houston's offer. He had 34 saves in 38 chances and went 1-3 with a 2.30 ERA last year for Houston. While the Astros won their first World Series, Giles had an 11.74 ERA in the post-season and 27.00 ERA in a pair of World Series appearances, when he allowed five runs in 1 2/3 innings.
Several Democratic members of California's congressional delegation said Tuesday they still don't have details about who in their districts was arrested in last week's immigration raids, and why they were targeted.
Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus were scheduled to meet Tuesday afternoon with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials to discuss the raids, but the meeting was abruptly canceled. And they're pretty unhappy about it.
Caucus Chairwoman Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-N.M.) said acting ICE Director Thomas Homan told her the meeting was canceled so Republicans could be invited. She said they are trying to reschedule for Thursday, but details have not been finalized.
When a reporter asked about an ICE official who said the meeting was canceled because it had grown so large it had to be bipartisan, Rep. Grace F. Napolitano (D-Norwalk) loudly exclaimed, "Bullshit!"
Lujan Grisham said the number of attendees did increase, but nothing requires a heavily attended meeting with a government agency to be bipartisan. A spokesman for ICE did not return a phone call Tuesday.
Last week, 680 immigrants were arrested nationally in sweeps the agency characterized as routine but immigrant advocacy groups say went beyond the norm by including people without a violent criminal history. Of the 161 arrests that occurred in the L.A. area, only 10 of those deported did not have a criminal conviction, ICE said.
Rep. Judy Chu (D-Monterey Park) said she isn't getting consistent answers from ICE officials in Los Angeles about who was swept up in the raids and why they were targeted, a frustration echoed by Rep. Nanette Barragán (D-San Pedro) and other members.
"My constituents are freaked out," Chu said. "We have serious questions, we want to know what is going on, and we want answers."
Barragán said ICE officials told her there were no instructions provided by the Department of Homeland Security about how to enforce the executive order President Trump signed that allowed almost any immigrant living in the U.S. illegally to be targeted for deportation. Other members said they were told ICE did get instructions.
Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-San Jose), a former immigration attorney, said members want to see what ICE told field offices about whom to arrest and how that differs from immigration policies under President Obama.
"There is tremendous concern across the country about what is going to happen next," she said. "This is a nation of laws, and we think the public should know what's in that memo."
Napolitano said ICE officials still won't tell her how many people were arrested in her district, or what crimes they committed. Local mayors and police departments told her ICE wasn't giving them details about the operation either, she said.

Abuja: Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari has charged the Super Eagles to call on the gallant Nigerian spirit at the World Cup in Russia, saying they carry the emotions of over 180 million Nigerians.
President Buhari met the team, who were led by sports minister Solomon Dalung and the president of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) Amaju Pinnick when he gave them a pep talk in Abuja on Wednesday.
Nigeria are making their sixth World Cup appearance in Russia and are drawn in a difficult first-round group with Argentina, Croatia and Iceland.
The best performance achieved by the country at the World Cup was reaching the Round of 16 in 1994, 1998 and 2014.
"You must know that you are not just going to a tournament, you are carrying the emotions, passions and feelings of over 180 million people," the President told the team.
"You are the youngest team at the World Cup, you are likely to be the most inexperienced, a fact that is not lost on your opponents. But you can use this to your advantage.
"You have the good support and blessings of all Nigerians, who will look up to you as long as the tournament lasts."
He continued: "Play fair and clean but demonstrate the gallant spirit Nigerians are known for.

ATLANTA -- Coca-Cola Co. and its bottling partners said they are continuing to make significant progress toward their North American refranchising plan, including multiple closings and definitive agreements signed in the fourth quarter of 2016 and early 2017. These agreements are part of a plan to refranchise all of Coca-Cola's U.S. bottling territories by the end of 2017. Financial terms were not disclosed.
The beverage giant said it has completed seven closings since it last provided an update. Coca-Cola Beverages Florida (Tampa) closed on territory in North Florida, including production facilities in Orlando and Jacksonville.
Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated (Charlotte, NC) closed on territory in Louisa, KY, and in Cincinnati and Dayton, OH, including a production facility in Cincinnati. It also closed on a second deal that involved territory in Fort Wayne, Lafayette, Anderson, Terre Haute and South Bend, IN.
Coca-Cola Bottling Co. United (Birmingham, AL) acquired a production facility in Montgomery, AL, and an equipment refurbishment center in Atlanta. Coca-Cola of Durango-Farmington (Durango, CO) closed on territory in Gallup, NM.
Great Lakes Coca-Cola Distribution LLC (Rosemont, IL) closed on territory in eastern Michigan, including a production facility in Detroit. Odom Corp. (Bellevue, WA) closed on territory in Hawaii, with a production facility in Honolulu.
Additionally, Arca Continental (Monterrey, Mexico) reached a definitive agreement with Coca-Cola for a large area of the Southwest United States, including Texas and parts of Oklahoma, New Mexico and Arkansas. This region also has nine production facilities. AC's operations in the United States will be called Coca-Cola Southwest Beverages. Coca-Cola will be a minority owner of AC Bebidas, which includes Coca-Cola Southwest Beverages, as well as AC's beverage operations elsewhere in Latin America.
Great Lakes Coca-Cola Distribution LLC (Park City, IL) reached a definitive agreement with Coca-Cola for territory in much of Michigan, including production facilities in Detroit and Grand Rapids. The company has already closed on a portion of this territory and one of the facilities.
Heartland Coca-Cola Bottling Co. (Kansas City, MO) signed a deal with Coca-Cola to acquire territory in parts of Illinois, Missouri, Kansas and Nebraska, including St. Louis and Kansas City.
The pact includes a production facility in Lenexa, KS. Finally, Swire Coca-Cola USA, a subsidiary of Swire Pacific Ltd.'s Beverages Division, reached definitive agreements for additional territory in the Pacific Northwest, including most of Washington, parts of Idaho and most of Oregon. These agreements include production facilities in Bellevue, WA, and Wilsonville, OR.
In addition, Pittsburgh-based ABARTA Inc. agreed to letters of intent to transfer the company's Cleveland territory to Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated and Buffalo, NY, territory to Bedford, NH-based Coca-Cola of Northern New England.
Coke began working with its bottling partners a decade ago on plans to develop a model that evolves the system to serve the changing customer and consumer landscape, with a focus on creating stronger system alignment. A critical step was the company's acquisition of the North American territories of Coca-Cola Enterprises in 2010, which led to the establishment of Coca-Cola Refreshments.
Since the closing of the transaction involving the North American territories of Coca-Cola Enterprises, Coca-Cola has accelerated the implementation of the new model by strategically addressing the bottling system, customer service, product supply and a common information technology platform.
Ultimately, the Coca-Cola system in North America will be comprised of economically aligned bottling partners that have the capability to serve major customers, coupled with the ability to maintain strong, local ties across diverse markets in the United States and Canada.
So far, the company has reached definitive agreements or signed letters of intent to refranchise bottling territories that account for approximately 65% of total U.S. bottler-delivered distribution volume, which equates to 71% of total Coca-Cola Refreshments volume. The company has also reached definitive agreements or signed letters of intent for 44 of the 51 cold-fill production facilities in the United States.
by Arun SANKAR India successfully put a record 104 satellites from a single rocket into orbit on Wednesday in the latest triumph for its famously frugal space programme.
Celebrations erupted among scientists at the southern spaceport of Sriharikota as the head of India's Space Research Organisation (ISRO) announced all the satellites had been ejected as planned.
"My hearty congratulations to the ISRO team for this success," the agency's director Kiran Kumar told those gathered in an observatory to track the progress of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV).
Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated the scientists for achieving the feat which smashes a record previously held by Russia.
"They have hit a century in space technology," Modi said at an election rally in northern Uttar Pradesh state.
The rocket took off at 9:28am (0358 GMT) and cruised at a speed of 27,000 kilometres (16,777 miles) per hour, ejecting all the 104 satellites into orbit in around 30 minutes, according to ISRO.
The rocket's main cargo was a 714 kilogram (1,574 pounds) satellite for Earth observation but it was also loaded with 103 smaller "nano satellites", weighing a combined 664 kilograms. The smallest weighed only 1.1 kilogram.
Nearly all of the nano satellites are from other countries, including Israel, Kazakhstan, Switzerland and 96 from the United States.
Eighty-eight of them are from Planet Inc - a San Francisco-based Earth imagery company - and weigh 4.5 kilogram each.
Only three satellites belonged to India.
Scientists sat transfixed as they watched the progress of the rocket on monitors until the last payload was ejected, and then began punching the air in triumph and hugging each other.
This was PSLV's 39th successful mission, known as India's space workhorse.
- World record -The launch means India now holds the record for launching the most satellites in one go, surpassing Russia which launched 39 satellites in a single mission in June 2014.
And it is another feather in the cap for ISRO which sent an unmanned rocket to orbit Mars in 2013 at a cost of just $73 million, compared with NASA's Maven Mars mission which had a $671 million price tag.
ISRO is also mulling the idea of missions to Jupiter and Venus.
The business of putting commercial satellites into space for a fee is growing as phone, Internet and other companies, as well as countries, seek greater and more high-tech communications.
India has carved out a reputation as a reliable low-cost option, relying in part on its famed skill of "jugaad" -- creating a cheap alternative solution.
Experts say much of its credibility stems from India's successful launch of the Mars orbiter, which gave it an edge over its rivals in the space race.
"India is proving to be a very viable option because of the cost and the reliability factor," said Ajay Lele, a senior fellow at the Delhi-based Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses.
"India has been doing these launches successfully and has established itself as a very reliable player."
Mathieu J Weiss, a liaison officer for France's CNES national space agency who is currently in India, said ISRO had pulled off a major feat.
"It's a great technical challenge to launch so many satellites at once into orbit on the right trajectory so that they don't make contact with each other," he told AFP.
Weiss said India had become a major player in the space race by making itself so competitive with its low costs and by working with private companies which are space specialists.
"India has become a space power in its own right in recent years," he added.
Last June, India set a national record after it successfully launched a rocket carrying 20 satellites, including 13 from the US.
The 50-year-old space agency plans to send four more rockets into space later this year ahead of its second lunar mission Chandrayaan-2 slated for 2018.
Modi has often hailed India's budget space technology, quipping in 2014 that a rocket that launched four foreign satellites into orbit had cost less to make than Hollywood film "Gravity". DM
Andersen said the men were named in a caption but the woman was not. “My curiosity nagged at me, not knowing who the woman in the photo was, or perhaps what she may have contributed to the conference,” she said.
It sent her an article on the subject. There, buried in dozens of pages of dense text, was a photograph of attendees at the 1971 International Conference on the Biology of Whales in Virginia, a gathering of some of the most prominent experts in marine biology. The 38 people pictured appeared to be mostly white and all men, except for one: a young Black woman wearing a bright headband, her face partly obscured by the man in front of her.
Candace Jean Andersen wanted to write a picture book about the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, so she asked the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for some information.
It began when an illustrator's investigation into the archives of marine legislation turned into a very different kind of historical deep dive.
Last week, hundreds of people were engaged in a search for a woman named Sheila.
How do you identify a person when all you have is half of a smiling face in a 47-year-old black-and-white photo?
After she posted the photo, hundreds of people replied with comments and suggestions.
The thread caught the attention of Margot Lee Shetterly, the author of the book Hidden Figures, which was made into a 2016 film about Black women who worked as mathematicians at NASA during the Space Race.
“Here's a working scientist, contributing alongside her colleagues, and she's not even given the professional courtesy of having her name recorded at a scientific conference,” Shetterly said Sunday. “The photo, with her brown face half obscured by the people around her, is a perfect metaphor for the larger issue of history's failure to record the work of women scientists, particularly women scientists of colour.”
Inspired by Andersen's post, amateur researchers began combing through historical records and unearthing the names of women who worked in the sciences during the 1970s.
Maybe, some suggested, the photo was of the oceanographer, professor and lawyer Matilene Spencer Berryman, who died in 2003? Or perhaps it was Suzanne Contos, who helped organize the conference in 1971? (It was neither. Berryman's age did not seem to match the photo, and Contos said it was not her.)
Then Dee Allen, the research program officer at the Marine Mammal Commission, saw the photograph on Twitter and contacted some of her mentors.
“I figured it was probably something I could track down pretty easily, and I have an appreciation for the history of the field,” Allen said. She contacted Don Wilson, the emeritus curator of mammals at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History.
Wilson remembered. He told Allen that the woman had worked as a museum technician, and her name was Sheila.
“Sheila was working at the museum in the division of mammals when I first started there in September 1971,” Wilson said, adding that she was “an excellent technician.”
Allen gave the information to Andersen, who began to look for Sheila on social media.
By March 12, she had found her. Andersen revealed that Sheila's original surname was Minor and posted snippets of their conversation, in which the woman said she had worked in several federal agencies for 35 years and “loved every moment of my career.”
The discovery was cheered by Andersen's Twitter followers, and by Shetterly, who said it was “critically important” to tell the stories of people like Sheila who have historically been under-represented, “as the leaky pipeline exists in the history of science and technology as well as in its present.”
On Sunday, Sheila said her full name is Sheila Minor Huff. She lives in Virginia and is a retired 71-year-old grandmother of five who belly-dances and volunteers at her church.

Day One of “Meeting International de Nice FFN Golden Tour Camille Muffat” is in the books. Perhaps the most noticeable thing about this year's Golden Tour kickoff meet is the absence of Hungary's Katinka Hosszu. In past years, the Iron Lady has entered every event, winning most of them. The Jean Bouin pool is, in fact, devoid of a large number of international swimmers this year. However, despite their reduced numbers, many of the foreign athletes graced the podiums on Friday night.
That said, it was France's Damien Joly who picked up the first pair of wins. He touched first (8:05.85) in the morning final of the 800 free, then again in the first men's event of the evening, the 1500 free (15:19.88). Hungary's David Verraszto scored the silver in the morning (8:09.82) but skipped the 1500 to focus on defending his title in the 400 IM, which he won in 4:14.48. That's exactly 2.10 seconds faster than he went last year, and ranks #4 in the world so far this season.
French distance star Lara Grangeon opened the women's events with a victory in the 1500 free in the morning session (16:49.22), then came in second to Jaz Carlin of Wales in the 800 free at night (8:45.77 to 8:51.84). A half hour later, Grangeon (4:45.86) was back on the podium, this time with a bronze medal in the 400 IM behind Fantine Lesaffre (4:43.32) and Serbia's Anja Crevar (4:44.58). Crevar and Lesaffre had finished second and third, respectively, in the 1500 free with 16:58.79 and 17:08.51.
Hometown favorite Charlotte Bonnet won the 50 back in 29.08, a big drop from her seed time of 30.57. Mélanie Henique edged Bonnet in the 50 fly, though, winning in 26.57, or .13 faster than she'd been to claim gold a year ago. Henique jumps up to the 11th-fastest in the world so far this season with her swim. France's Fanny Deberghes edged Italy's Sofia Tedeschi, 32.29 to 32.49, to win the 50 breast.
This weekend marks the return of Mehdy Metella, who after a very strong 2017 had to sit out the end of the season with a bad ankle sprain. On Friday night he won the 50 fly in 24.22 over emerging sprinter Maxime Grousset (24.38). There were no surprises in the 50 back, where Jérémy Stravius won with a resounding 25.41 over Paul-Gabriel Bedel (26.21) and Jordan Pothain (26.30), making him the 9th-fastest in the world this year. Lithuania's Giedrius Titenis drubbed the field in the 50 breast, stopping the clock at 28.04, nearly a half body-length ahead of France's Théo Bussière (28.43).

Are you happy with the way you swam this year? Do you think there is more to be squeezed from your swimming, but you aren't sure what the first step should be? Are you ready to throw down on your swimming goals in 2017?
Here are some questions to challenge you to capitalize on the success you've already had in the pool this year, while also encouraging you to open up and broaden your potential and performance next year:
What habits have I been holding onto that are slowing me down in the pool?
Very rarely do we find new ways to get in our own way. Our bad habits and hang ups are shockingly consistent. Our habits aren't generally a mystery to us (especially the bad ones), but because they are so, well, habitual, we have come to accept them as part of our identity, as part of our swimming, just the way it is.
SEE ALSO: Swimming Tips: The 7 Fundamentals of Fast Swimming
Can you think of a couple stinky habits that you have been lugging around in your swimming? Bad technique during warm up, pulling 6 times into the wall on kick sets, breathing to the same side for hours on end, and so on. Go a step beyond just thinking about them and write them down on a piece of paper to make it official.
What have I learned about myself this year that really works?
There is a mistaken assumption out there that success in the pool is based on an exact recipe. Do these sets, this many times, plus this specific dryland, and you will attain such-and-such times.
Everybody's path and journey is different.
There are things that you inevitably learned over the course of 2016 you can apply to your swimming next year. They don't all have to be things you learned in the pool either. A trick you picked up on helping you fall asleep faster. A morning routine that finally works for you. A pre-hab routine that has helped you stay injury-free.
What were these things? While you seek to find other little tactics and tricks that help you perform better, remember to continue to apply the stuff that is already working.
Is my lifestyle outside of the pool reflecting what I want to achieve in the water?
To show up to the pool and give a solid effort at the pool is one thing (and let's be honest here, “solid” is a fairly broad umbrella of a term), but to live your life outside of the pool in concurrence with your goals in the water is altogether another.
Does this mean that you should be thinking about your swimming every single second of the day? Of course not. But if you are sacrificing sleep because of poor time management, or eating poorly out of convenience, or not taking care of yourself than these things will reflect in your performance at the end of the season.
Take a look back over the past year and take stock of how your lifestyle matches up with your swimming goals, and see if there are any improvements you can make moving forward.
Who has got my back in the truest sense of the word?
Your support system is far more important than we give them credit for. That emotional support is invaluable when we are down, and they are the loudest voices in the stands when we are doing well. Through thick and thin, these people—whether family, friends, teammates, coaches—are our bedrock.
Make a point to spend more time with these people this year, err, next year, while also limiting the influence that those who don't have your long term success at heart.
What is the most effective thing you could do with an extra ten minutes of training per day?
If you had just ten minutes per day to use, what would you fill it with? What would be the most effective use of that time that would help you see greater success in the pool?
For some, it's staying ahead of the curve on keeping their shoulders injury-free. Others could use the time to really work on their starts. Or improve their feel of the water with sculling drills.
Just ten minutes a day doesn't sound like very much, which is excellent because it makes it approachable, easy to do (after all, what's ten minutes?), and also it forces you to really focus. You can't do it all, so if you can only do one extra thing, that one thing that would put a huge dent in your swimming goals, what would it be?
Over the course of an entire season that wee little ten minutes totals a whopping 3120 minutes. What could you do with 52 hours of training to swim faster next year?

Here is a round-up of all the latest product recalls from popular supermarkets which shoppers need to be aware of.
If you have bought any of these products you can return them to the store for a full refund.
They range from the humorous to the potentially poisonous.
The Food Standards Agency is releasing the following warnings:
Marks & Spencer
M&S has had to recall its ‘gluten free' scotch eggs because they contain gluten, reports the Nottingham Post.
Although the ingredient list on M&S's two-pack of Gluten Free Scotch Eggs do not include it, there is undeclared gluten in the product which poses a possible health risk for anyone with an allergy or intolerance to it.

The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is advising that customers return the product to the store from where it was bought for a full refund.
A spokesman for the FSA said: “Marks & Spencer is recalling two Gluten Free Scotch Eggs because they contain undeclared gluten which is not mentioned on the label.
“This means the product is a possible health risk for anyone with an allergy or intolerance to gluten.”
Morrisons
A supermarket has had to recall its honey and mustard dressing because it does not warn customers it contains MUSTARD, reports the Mirror .
Customers have been told to return Morrisons Eat Smart Honey & Mustard Dressing because it does not state on the label it has mustard and egg in the product.
Incorrect labelling poses a health risk to allergy suffers, the food watchdog say.
The supermarket giant was ordered to make the move by the Food Standards Agency because “the product poses a possible health risk for anyone with an allergy or intolerance” to these ingredients.
Morrisons is recalling the product from customers and has been advised to contact allergy support groups to tell their members about the recall.

The company has also issued a point-of-sale notice to its customers in their shops.
A spokesman from the FSA said: “Morrisons is recalling the product from customers and has been advised to contact relevant allergy support organisations, which will tell their members about the recall. The company has also issued a point-of-sale notice to its customers.
“This product contains egg and mustard making it a possible health risk for anyone with an allergy or intolerance to egg, and or an allergy to mustard.
“Sometimes there will be a problem with a food product that means it should not be sold.
“Then it might be ‘withdrawn' (taken off the shelves) or ‘recalled' (when customers are asked to return the product).
“Sometimes foods have to be withdrawn or recalled if there is a risk to consumers because the allergy labelling is missing or incorrect or if there is any other food allergy risk.
“When there is a food allergy risk, the FSA will issue an Allergy Alert.”
Spar
Food poisoning fears have led a range of meat products to be taken off sale at Spar stores.
Producer James Hall has issued a recall after tests found some pulled pork products could contain salmonella, and if eaten could lead to fever, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps if eaten.
The affected items are Spar brand BBQ Pulled Pork for 2, and the Woodland BBQ Pulled Pork for 2, dated best before January 25.
The Food Standards Agency says people should not eat them but return them for a refund.
A James Hall spokesman said: "Routine testing has identified the possible presence of Salmonella in a small number of packs of the above products.
"As a precautionary measure, we are asking all customers who have bought this product not to use it, and to return it to their nearest Spar store, where they will receive a full refund."

A spokesman said: "James Hall is recalling Spar BBQ Pulled Pork and Woodland BBQ Pulled Pork because the products may contain salmonella. Both products have been sold at SPAR stores.
"No other James Hall products are known to be affected.
"The products might be contaminated with salmonella. Symptoms caused by salmonella usually include fever, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps.
"If you have bought any of the above products, do not eat it. Instead, return it to the store from where it was bought for a full refund."
A female pedestrian was sent to hospital Tuesday afternoon after she was struck by a vehicle in north Edmonton.
The collision happened in the area of 118 Avenue and 97 Street just after 4 p.m.
Police said the woman was taken to hospital, although the extent of her injuries was not known.
It's not known if the woman was walking in a marked crosswalk.
Police remained on scene past 5 p.m., with officers controlling traffic.
NEW DELHI: After opposition parties once again stalled proceedings in the Lok Sabha yesterday, the TDP and YSR Congress have preemptively directed its MPs to be present in Parliament to ensure that the no-confidence motion against the Union government gets tabled today.TDP chief and Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu told party legislators to show up at full strength and be ready to counter allies of the ruling BJP should they attempt to create a logjam."We should not dilute our fight. Public interests are our priority. No compromise in the matter of our rights. There is a possibility that they let some other parties create din and adjourn the House sine die," Naidu told TDP MPs over teleconference, as reported by ANI.He also urged the MPs to capitalise on the support voiced by other parties by convincing them to move no-trust notices of their own."The support we're getting from other parties indicate the sympathy from all corners of the country for the state, for the injustice it is facing. The MPs should continue with the same spirit. You have support of 5 crore people of the state," Naidu said.YSR Congress has issued a whip to its members, stating that all should be present and fulfill the required number of members for the no-confidence motion. In the missive, party leader Y V Subba Reddy has asked MPs to stand up and vote in favour of the motion when it is taken up in the Lower House.Furthermore, lawmakers from both regional parties gave a miss to a luncheon hosted today by Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan after she adjourned House proceedings without taking up the motion. Noisy protests by members from various parties had prompted Mahajan to pronounce the adjournment."We boycotted the lunch as our notice of no-confidence motion is not being admitted. The Speaker adjourned the House which should not have happened," said YSR Congress leader Vijay Sai Reddy.Arch-rivals TDP and YSR Congress had moved no-confidence motions against the Modi government after it refused to grant special category status (SCS) to Andhra Pradesh. Both parties have been demanding special package for the state, an issue on which the TDP quit the ruling NDA alliance last week.Several opposition parties including the Congress, Trinamool Congress, Nationalist Congress Party, Samajwadi Party, the AIMIM and Rashtriya Janata Dal have expressed their support for the notices. A no-confidence motion notice must be supported by at least 50 MPs to be taken up in the House.Still, the BJP will remain unaffected as it has a comfortable majority in the Lok Sabha on its own. The current strength of the Lok Sabha is 539 (excluding the Speaker) and the ruling BJP has 275 members, more than the majority mark of 271, and enjoys the support of several allies.But due to a cycle of disruptions and adjournments, the last phase of the Budget session has been a complete washout. No substantive business could be transacted in the last 11 days except for the passage of the Finance Bill, 2018 and relevant appropriation bills in the Lok Sabha.
NEW DELHI - An Indian military helicopter ferrying kerosene cans burst into flames Friday near the border with China, killing seven troops, the army said.
The Russian-made Mi-17 V5 helicopter was carrying supplies to a border post in the mountainous district of Tawang near the border with Tibet when it caught fire at an altitude of 17,000 feet (5,200 metres).
Five Indian Air Force (IAF) crew members and two army personnel were killed in the accident, a spokesman told AFP. "A court of inquiry has been ordered to ascertain the cause of the accident," he said.
Tawang is in the northeast Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, which is also claimed by China.
It is a strategically important border district and came briefly under Chinese control during the 1962 war between the neighbours.
The Mi-17 V5, which is mainly used for military transport, is produced by Kazan Helicopters, a subsidiary of Russian Helicopters.
India's air force has a high rate of crashes owing to its ageing fleet. More than 170 pilots have lost their lives over the last three decades.
Most of the accidents involve Soviet-era MIG planes, earning them the sobriquet "flying coffins".
In July an IAF chopper crashed in the same state, killing three crew members and a soldier. That advanced light helicopter was on a rescue mission during devastating floods when it crashed due to inclement weather.
Last year, a Russian-built AN-32 military transport plane went missing over the Bay of Bengal with 29 people on board.
And in 2013, all 20 people on board an army helicopter were killed when it crashed in northern India.
India, the world's largest arms importer, has been trying to revamp its ageing and outdated military aircraft, with some of the fleet virtually on its last legs.
The country has been trying to develop its own warplanes but delays and technical shortcomings have marred progress.
Today US policy towards Russia is fractured between Trump, Congress - expert
2017-08-14 17:18 | www.trend.az | 0
Baku, Azerbaijan, Aug. 14
By Kamila Aliyeva – Trend:
The contextual and structural factors surrounding US-Russian relations today are more complex than ever before; moreover they are paramount in surmising whether the Tillerson-Lavrov meeting would deescalate tension between US and Russia, Ruchi Anand, Professor of International Relations at the American Graduate School in Paris, told Trend.
“Historically, US and USSR were in a cold war that defined the landscape of a bipolar international relation. At the time, US foreign policy was unified, despite internal differences and divisions of power,” she said.
Expert noted that today situation is different as “internally, US policy towards Russia is fractured between the Trump administration and the rest of the US policy-making establishment, more specifically the Congress.”
This dangerous confrontation makes Kremlin view the former as a potential partner, with the capacity of ushering in improved US-Russia relations, while the latter as deemed opponents, according to Anand.
She recalled that US President Trump recently, and grudgingly, signed in to the law what he considers a ‘flawed' bill, which imposes sanctions on Russia for its interference in the 2016 Presidential elections.
“This bill cannot be unilaterally lifted by the President who views it as ‘limiting the executive flexibility' to strike good deals with other countries. The way the players on this chessboard are placed presents more chances of mutual disappointment and a possible escalation of the US (Trump-Congress)-Russia drama,” she said.
The hypothetical scenario of improved US-Russian relations is interesting to speculate on, but is quite far from reality, according to the expert.
“Unless the Trump administration and Congress see ‘eye-to-eye' on the definition of national interest for the United States, their in-house disagreements on crucial players like Russia, as well as amelioration of the critical situations in the Middle East is at best, an illusion, at worst a quagmire,” she said.
“In case relations are improved between US and Russia, which is still in my opinion in the realm of the unachievable, the two powers could work together to exert their collective power and common agendas to lend greater stability to the manner in which the politics are played out,” Anand noted.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson held a meeting in Manila on Aug. 6. It was the first meeting between the officials, since US imposed a new set of sanctions against Russia on Aug. 2. Both sides vowed for continuation of dialogue in order to improve ties between the two countries.
IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Monday said though digitisation has brought in exposure to a majority of the people, it has also exposed them to cyberthreats and vulnerabilities.
"As part of its Digital India initiatives, the government has introduced a lot of its services online. Although this has made services very accessible to the citizens, it has also exposed them to the threats and vulnerabilities which are an inherent part of cyberspace," the minister said.
He was speaking at the inauguration of the "NIC-CERT", a setup of National Informatics Centre.
He mentioned that in the recent past there has been an exponential growth in cyberattacks leading to concerns of data theft which led to the government drafting the Data Protection Act.
"As internet with its ever-expanding canvas of opportunities is touching the life's of people, it necessitates the requirement to upscale the existing security infrastructure," he added.
The NIC-CERT has been setup with the objective of creating a comprehensive framework that integrates world class security components and inbuilt threat intelligence for detection, prevention and incident response.
Using the tools the team will correlate events that would help in generating a canvas of the attack surface and identify the vulnerabilities and possible exploits. The gathered intelligence assimilated with the knowledge of the open web would give the CERT the ability prevent and predict attacks, Prasad said.
The 68-year-old Ng Ser Miang, who is a member of International Olympic Committee (IOC) and who worked for the inaugural of 2010 Youth Olympic Games, has now been appointed as the honorary chairman of Kukkiwon aka World Taekwondo Headquarters (WTH).
According to reports, Miang said that it is his honour to become a vital part of Kukkiwon and he believes that taekwondo is more than just a martial art and a sport.
He also mentioned that since 2000, this sport has been recognized as an Olympic sport but there is a lot of scope for development.
Miang said that since he has now taken a huge responsibility, he will try to use international appointments to support the sport in Singapore.
Kukkiwon or WTH also regulates Korea's taekwondo governing body, which is in charge of various aspects such as training, grading, including research and innovation.
Among all Singaporean taekwondo veterans, Miang is one of the most respected and experienced sports personalities. From 1991 to 2002, he was the chairman of national sports agency called Sport Singapore, commonly known as Singapore Sports Council.
Along with taekwondo, he opted for sailing and was a former Singapore sailor who won a silver medal at the 1969 South-east Asia Peninsular Games, now known as SEA Games.
According to the taekwondo veteran Miang, his friendship with Kukkiwon's late founder Kim Un Yong actually triggered his interest in this sport. While taking about Yong, who established the foundation in 1972, Miang said that he knew the former IOC vice-president since 1991. He also expressed that because of Yong, he learnt about taekwondo and helped to support national Sports Association.
While commenting on Miang's new engagement with Kukkiwon, Milan Kwee, the president of Singapore Taekwondo Federation said that he is delighted and honoured to see a Singaporean to chair a high position in WTH.
Kwee, who has been re-elected in 2017 for another term as a member of the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC), said that Miang is a humble person and is liked by many sports personalities.
Harvey Weinstein has elected not to testify to a grand jury convened by the Manhattan District Attorney's office, his attorney announced Wednesday.
Weinstein was charged in a criminal complaint on Friday with two counts of rape and one count of a criminal sexual act. He is free on a $1 million bail, and restricted from traveling outside New York and Connecticut. A grand jury is convening to determine whether to issue an indictment on the same allegations. Weinstein's decision not to testify is not a surprise, as it would be unusual to offer his version of events at this stage of the proceedings.
Weinstein's attorney, Benjamin Brafman, did offer a glimpse of his defense, saying that one of the cases is 14 years old and the second involves a victim with whom he had a consensual relationship. In the statement, Brafman also objected to being denied access to “critical information about this case” that would have aided in his defense before the grand jury.
“Not having access to these materials is particularly troubling in this case, where one of the unsupported allegations is more than 14 years old and the rape allegation involves a woman with whom Mr. Weinstein shared a 10-year consensual sexual relationship that continued for years after the alleged incident in 2013,” Brafman said.
Weinstein is accused of forcing Lucia Evans to perform oral sex on him at his Tribeca office in 2004. The second case involves a woman who has not been identified by prosecutors, who alleges that Weinstein raped her in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013.
In the statement, Brafman acknowledged that an indictment is “inevitable,” but blamed District Attorney Cy Vance for bowing to political pressure.
“Mr. Weinstein's attorneys noted that regardless of how compelling Mr. Weinstein's personal testimony might be, an indictment was inevitable due to the unfair political pressure being placed on Cy Vance to secure a conviction of Mr. Weinstein,” Brafman said.
ITALY-Boffins eat your hearts out: the world record holder for the number of university degrees is a cheery but truculent 70-year old Italian. Luciano Baietti lives in the town of Velletri in the Alban Hills near Rome and spends his days pottering around his small house and garden.
But at every morning at 3am he pulls out his textbooks and starts studying.
He now holds 15 bachelors or masters degrees from universities across Italy, and is already embarking on his 16th.
“Thanks to books, I feel free, dammit,” he tells AFP. “After all, the words share the same root,” he says, referring to the Italian words libro (book) and libero (free).
The certificates proving his prowess hang on the walls of his study, framing a portrait of the 19th century French essayist, Louis-Francois Bertin, whom he cites as an influence.
“He was a man of culture and knowledge,” said Baietti, a former headmaster of a secondary school, who made it into the Guinness Book of Records in 2002 with his eighth degree, that time in motor skills.
At that point he already had degrees in sociology, literature, law, political science and philosophy, most from Rome's prestigious La Sapienza University, one of the oldest in the world. Since then he's added seven others to his list, including one in criminology, a distance-learning one in military strategies from Turin, and the latest in tourism from an online university in Naples, which he was awarded at the start of this month.
“Each time I set myself a new challenge, to see how far my body and my brain can go,” says Baietti, who started life as a sports teacher.
His long-suffering wife, some 30 years his junior, describes Baietti affectionately as “a real character” who is known throughout their town.
He got most of the qualifications under his belt while also doing his day job and volunteering with Italy's Red Cross.
This ageing eternal student's first degree was in physical education in 1972 - and he fell instantly in love with the academic world.
“As well as the sporting events, there were modules in theory which I liked, and which gave me a taste for studying,” he says.
- ‘I surprised myself' -
The most challenging and unusual degree so far has been the military strategies one: “It was co-organised by the defence ministry and Turin University and dealt with sensitive subjects related to national security”.
“We had to attend the exams in uniform,” he recalls, showing off the regimental garb hanging in his wardrobe.
His masters in criminology, which saw him interview prisoners, also had a lasting impact.
“Listening to them, I sometimes surprised myself; I'd be convinced by their arguments, and would wonder about what was right or wrong - before realising that I had gone off course.”
Baietti is back on course, and already preparing to start the next degree, this time in food science.
Once again, he'll be pouring over his books by the light of his desk lamp as outside the world sleeps on.
“At that time the brain is more open to assimilating knowledge, and it also allows me to keep a normal family life,” he says with a grin.
Shillong: A moderate intensity quake measuring 4.7 on the Richter Scale on Monday shook Meghalaya but there was no report of any casualty.
Officials at the Regional Seismological Centre here said the epicentre was at a depth of 60 km in remote East Garo Hills district.
The quake, that lasted for a few seconds, occurred at around 9.05 am.
Meghalaya and the seven other north eastern states fall in Zone 5 of the country's earthquake zoning map.
According to the zoning map, Zone 5 is associated with the highest level of seismicity.
A thief stole the bike of a cycle training instructor while he worked with schoolchildren in Hartlepool yesterday.
According to Hartlepool Borough Council, the instructor left his bike against the wall of a house in Stephen Street while he spoke to Year 6 pupils from the town's Sacred Heart RC Primary School.
It was part of the children's on-road Bikeability cycle training.
While the instructor was explaining to the children about how to overtake a parked car, a man came out of a house, jumped on the bike and rode off before he could be challenged, says the council.
The theft happened at 10.20am yesterday and has been reported to the police.
A spokesman for Hartlepool Borough Council said: "We are shocked that someone would stoop so low and be so brazen as to take a bike belonging to an instructor while he was working close by with children with the aim of making them safer.
“We would appeal to anyone with information about the theft or the whereabouts of the bike – a dark grey Focus 18-speed hybrid mountain bike – to contact the police on 101, quoting the reference number CVP-17-103202.”
DUP Newry & Armagh Assemblyman William Irwin MLA has met with Department officials in Dundonald House this week to raise a number of issues affecting farmers across the province.
Issues covered at the meeting included the significant delay in processing FBIS applications and the hot topic of Bovine TB.
Mr Irwin described the meeting as ‘useful and timely' and thanked the Departmental Permanent Secretary and his colleagues for taking the time to discuss a range of important issues affecting agriculture at this time.
He added: “I used this important opportunity to discuss the concerns farmers have brought to me on the Farm Business Improvement Scheme and in particular the significant delays on applications, some of which have been in the system in excess of ten months with applicants still unaware if they will be successful.
“I impressed on the officials the fact that farmers who find themselves in this position are frustrated and rightly so, after spending considerable sums of money in getting planning permissions and paying for the services of consultants to help complete the applications. I expressed my concerns that only 20 approvals have been issued to date out of 150 applications that made it through to the assessment stage.
“Officials took on board my concerns and accepted that the process has been slower than anticipated but assured me that every effort is being made to issue as many approvals as possible in the next few weeks. I made the point to the officials that lessons must be learned from Tranche 1 and not repeated if and when Tranche 2 is rolled out,” he added.
“I also had the opportunity to discuss the issue of Bovine TB and the need for a much more proactive approach to drive down incidence rates. TB incidence rates are at almost 10%, the highest level for some years. We also look at other regions whereby wildlife carriers have been effectively controlled and this has resulted in continued downward trends. It is clear when we look at statistics here in Northern Ireland the very obvious rising trend in incidence rates requires a more robust approach and wildlife carriers should be one of the main focuses,” he added.

A Chicago toddler was shot and killed on Tuesday in what police suspect was a “gang hit” on a man in a vehicle with her, just a few days after two young girls were shot in the head. It markets the latest spasm of violence in a city struggling to contain such attacks.
Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said police suspect the man, a well-known gang member with an extensive criminal history, was the target of the shooting that also left a woman wounded.
No other details were released and he said no arrests had been made.
Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel issued an emotional plea on Twitter to his state's legislature in Springfield for gun control laws and stricter sentencing.
“Every parent regardless of where they live, should be able to take their child for a walk to the park or a ride in the car,” he said. “These are the normal rites of passage of childhood.”
“Springfield owes it to the residents of this city to finally pass meaningful gun control and sentencing legislation to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and keep repeat violent offenders off the streets.”

In January, U.S. President Donald Trump issued a warning over Twitter saying that if “Chicago doesn't fix the horrible carnage going on” he would “send in the Feds!”
Story continues below If Chicago doesn't fix the horrible "carnage" going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017
Over the weekend, two girls ages 11 and 12 were shot in the head by gunmen who were aiming at someone else in an area of the city known for heavy gang activity. The Cook County medical examiner's office says Takiya Holmes, 11, died early Tuesday at Comer Children's Hospital. The 12-year-old was in critical condition on Monday, but police have not updated her condition since.

The shootings highlight the street gang violence that police say was largely responsible for 762 homicides last year – nearly 300 more than occurred in 2015 – and more than 3,500 shooting incidents. That violence has continued this year, with January ending with 51 homicides, the highest total since January 1999 when there were 55.
Those kinds of numbers help explain why Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner's office said he will announce on Wednesday in his budget speech a push to fund 200 more state police cadets to patrol Chicago-area expressways. In 2016, there were 51 shootings on those roadways, compared to 37 in 2015. State police have said that the gun violence in the city is spilling onto the expressways.
WATCH: Trump hopes to open dialogue with Chicago mayor after tweet
It is unclear how Illinois can find the money to pay for the new state troopers in the midst of a budget crisis. Rauner's office would not elaborate.
The violence on the expressways also prompted the Chicago Crime Commission to ask that state and federal officials find the money to purchase a high-tech “expressway video surveillance system.”

“An expressway video surveillance system would be designed to assist law enforcement in identifying and apprehending those responsible for the epidemic of shootings occurring on area expressways,” J.R. Davis, the chairman and president of the commission, said in a statement.

LAHORE, Jul 04 (APP):Pakistan Muslim League-N president Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday appeared before
the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in Saaf Pani Company and Punjab Power Development Company corruption scams.
The PML-N president was questioned related to the scandal for one and a half hours at NAB Lahore office.
The NAB had summoned Shehbaz Sharif on July 5, to clear his position regarding allegations of misuse
of authority during his tenure and corruption charges.
Owing to personal engagements, Shehbaz Sharif had requested the NAB to appear a day earlier, on July 4.
Advocates say Nova Scotia is now one of the most difficult provinces in the country in which to access an abortion.
Darrah Teitel, public affairs officer for Action Canada for Sexual Health and Rights, said the “extremely grim” situation may be unconstitutional.
It is the only province that requires a referral for a surgical abortion, and there are lengthy wait times for the time-sensitive procedure and no provincial coverage for medical abortions using pills.
Lianne Yoshida, medical co-director of the termination of pregnancy unit at the QEII Health Sciences Centre in Halifax, said it is recognized as a problem.
READ MORE: Ontario women to get free access to abortion drug Mifegymiso
She said she doesn't believe politics are behind the barriers, so much as that it is “the way it's always been,” and officials are working on it.
Nova Scotia once had the region's least restrictive abortion access, but both New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island have changed their policies in the last three years.
Some women interviewed for this story said they were referred for an abortion by a family doctor without delay, but others describe having to “jump through hoops” to get a referral. Wait times tended to be four to six weeks, a delay they described as “agonizing” and “cruel.”
One woman told The Canadian Press she had four appointments with her family doctor before she obtained a referral for an abortion. Her doctor quizzed her on her knowledge of the fetus and sent her to a psychologist before finally agreeing to refer her.
Another woman, Melanie Mackenzie, said it took her two months to obtain an abortion when she got pregnant five years ago.
Mackenzie was told there was a waiting period, and was sent for a battery of tests including blood work and an ultrasound before obtaining an abortion at nearly 12 weeks pregnant.
“It was the worst two months of my life,” she said.
“The whole thing felt like a punishment.”

Mackenzie recalled the nurse congratulating her on the pregnancy in front of other patients.
“I never regretted my decision to have an abortion,” she said. “But it felt like that waiting period and all those tests were to shame me, to make me feel like an irresponsible slut, to punish me. It felt like it was a price I had to pay to obtain an abortion in a country where my right to choose is legally protected.”
In 2014, New Brunswick lifted the so-called two-doctor rule requiring two physicians to certify an abortion as medically necessary.
Abortions became available in P.E.I. for the first time earlier this year. Women on the Island can call a toll-free number to make an appointment without the need for a referral.
Teitel said the Nova Scotia rule requiring a physician's referral is at odds with the Supreme Court's 1988 R v. Morgentaler decision. Evidence presented during the trial showed that the unnecessary wait times involved in physician referrals were creating unsafe conditions for women, Teitel said.
“These delays are still being forced on women in Nova Scotia, and there is no earthly reason why abortions cannot be granted upon self-referral, as in the rest of the country,” she said.
Nova Scotia does not appear to keep statistics on how long it takes women to obtain an abortion after a referral.
The QEII – where more than 85 per cent of the province's abortions are performed – will only book appointments for women who are at least eight weeks pregnant.
Meanwhile, a new method has emerged that would give Nova Scotia women another option in early pregnancy. Mifegymiso, an alternative to surgical abortion, is an abortion pill that can be used to terminate a pregnancy of up to 49 days.
WATCH: Sexual health advocates push for ‘abortion pill' coverage by Nova Scotia government
Advocates say the two-step process using the drugs mifepristone and misoprosto could increase access, provide women with more choices and shorten wait times.
The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada says 171 physicians and pharmacists in Nova Scotia have either registered for or taken a training course on Mifegymiso.
Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick have said they would provide some coverage for the drug. A Health Department spokeswoman said the Nova Scotia government is looking at coverage for Mifegymiso, but a decision has not yet been made.
Meanwhile, it's unclear why women in Nova Scotia must obtain a referral.
Health spokeswoman Sarah Levy MacLeod confirmed that a referral and an ultrasound are required before an abortion can be booked, but she referred questions on the policy to the Nova Scotia Health Authority.
The health authority referred questions to the co-director of the termination of pregnancy unit – the same doctor, Lianne Yoshida, who called the need for a referral a barrier to access that needs to be addressed.
Eighties icon and Soft Cell singer Marc Almond will be performing in Scunthorpe for the first time on Monday (October 9).
Marc, who is best known for covers such as Tainted Love and Something's Gotten Hold of My Heart, is an internationally acclaimed artist with a career spanning four decades.
He found fame in the early 1980s as one half of the pioneering synth-pop duo Soft Cell and has sold over 30 million records worldwide.
It is safe to say the boy from Southport is hugely revered and continues to influence and shape a generation of musicians.
His latest album, Shadows And Reflections, was released last month. It features luscious orchestral arrangements of torch songs and 60s orchestral pop, as well as two new original compositions.
Award-winning trio to perform in North Lincolnshire tonight
The album includes songs written or recorded by artists such as Burt Bacharach, The Action, The Yardbirds, Bobby Darin, Julie Driscoll, Billy Fury and the Young Rascals.
Marc will perform with a full orchestra playing songs from Shadows And Reflections, as well as other known and lesser known gems from the period, when he appears on stage at the Baths on Monday.
Speaking ahead of the show, Marc said: "It is my first time in Scunthorpe. The tour will feature a big ensemble of musicians and orchestra. It will be a real musical journey."
Speaking about his new album, Marc said: "My audience may not be familiar with a lot of these songs so I had to bear that in mind. Whereas if you're an aficionado and you know how brilliant they are, you'll see I've not reinvented them an awful lot because I thought the arrangements are so good in the first place.
"These songs just need to be put out there again so people can hear them. Me singing them introduces them to a different audience and brings them out into the light.
"How Can I Be Sure (a track on the new album) is one of those special compositions that when people hear it, they know it from somewhere but it won't be a song that is sung everywhere.
"It's a very modern song in that it addresses questions about life that are pertinent today. Yes, there's a feeling of nostalgia to it but songs have to tell a story and have got to feel relevant, fresh and different sounding.
"One thing I really wanted to do with the album was to pay homage to the arrangements of songs from that time. I always loved the way they blended pop and classical with a slight psychedelia."
Marc Almond's deep affection for expertly arranged 1960s pop has been prevalent throughout his career and has served him well.
His versions of Jacky, The Days Of Pearly Spencer, Tainted Love, Something's Gotten Hold Of My Heart, and What! have become much treasured recordings from an artist who can take an old song and bring it new life with impeccable style.
This year cements the 60th birthday year for the singer and comes after the great success of the top 10 album Hits And Pieces, which was followed by a sold-out spring tour including a triumphant show at London's Roundhouse.
The show starts at 6.30pm. Tickets are priced between £29.50 and £60 and are available from the venue, by calling 0844 854 2776 or visiting bathshall.co.uk

While the smashing success of Deadpool no doubt made the executives at 20th Century Fox less wary about greenlighing an R-rated Wolverine movie, that doesn't mean the decision to move forward with Logan was easy. Of course the studio wanted another Wolverine sequel, especially if Hugh Jackman planned on hanging up the claws for good, but Jackman and director James Mangold wanted to do something really different for this final outing. Mangold earned the goodwill of the fans with The Wolverine, a Samurai-centric take on the character that showed despite X-Men Origins: Wolverine, it was possible to make a really good standalone Wolverine movie. And while that film bucked trends of its own—specifically the “hero must save the entire planet” plot that has been done to death in superhero movies at this point—it was still an action-packed Wolverine adventure.
For Logan, however, Mangold and Jackman wanted to go full Western, which means a lot more contemplation. And according to 20th Century Fox Film chairman Stacey Snider (via Variety), that made some executives very nervous:
“Inside, there was real consternation about the intensity of the tone of the film. It's more of an elegy about life and death. The paradigm for it was a Western, and my colleagues were up in arms. It's not a wise-cracking cigar-chomping mutton-sporting Wolverine, and the debate internally became, isn't that freakin' boring? Isn't it exciting to imagine Wolverine as a real guy and he's world-weary and he doesn't want to fight anymore until a little girl needs him?”
Indeed, for all the concern over the limiting R-rating and fourth-wall-breaking of Deadpool, there was likely little worry that the film would be boring. But while “an elegy about life and death” may be cause for concern for a studio bankrolling a superhero pic, that only makes the film that much more alluring to discerning viewers. There have now been nine X-Men movies, counting Deadpool, all of which involve spectacle and set pieces and some variation of one-liners + action. For Wolverine's final outing, why would you want to stick to formula? Why not break the mold? I mean, Christopher Nolan tried it and it only resulted in one of the most iconic trilogies in movie history.
Ultimately Fox trusted Mangold and Jackman with a sizable budget, and thus far Logan looks like it could be something really, really special. At the very least we can rest assured we're not in for an X-Men: Apocalypse redux.

Central Michigan guard Presley Hudson, right, goes up to shoot against Ohio State guard Linnae Harper during the first half of a second-round game in the NCAA womens college basketball tournament in Columbus, Ohio, Monday. Paul Vernon  The Associated Press
COLUMBUS, Ohio >> Presley Hudson scored 28 points and No. 11 seed Central Michigan stunned No. 3 Ohio State 95-78 on Monday night to earn the schools first ever trip to the Sweet 16.
Cassie Breen threw the ball high in the air as the clock wound down and the joyous Central Michigan players jumped, screamed and hugged as they celebrated the biggest win in school history.
The Chippewas had won their first tournament game ever in Saturdays first-round upset of No. 6 Louisiana State. With the upset of Ohio State, they advance to face No. 2 Oregon in Spokane, Washington, on Saturday.
Central Michigan (30-4) out-rebounded and out-hustled Ohio State, played taut defense, hit a season-high 14 3-pointers and kept the Buckeyes at bay late in the game.

The Chippewas got plenty of help in the upset from the unusually error-prone Buckeyes, who got behind in the first half and then were run over by momentum and couldnt climb back in. Central Michigan led by as much as 23 points in the second half as Ohio State struggled to put together a run that would shift the tide.
All-American guard Kelsey Mitchell led Ohio State (28-7) with 28 points but hit just 11 of her 29 shots from the floor. Mitchell ended her storied career as the second-leading scorer in NCAA history, but it was wasted as the Buckeyes were denied their third straight trip to the Sweet 16. Mitchell passed Jackie Stiles and finished with 3,402 points.
Breen had 22 points, and Tinara Moore added 20 points and 10 rebounds in Central Michigans balanced attack.
Ohio State seniors Mitchell, Stephanie Mavunga, Linnae Harper and Asia Doss will move on, leaving coach Kevin McGuff with a rebuilding job. The players talked about making the most of their last NCAA run together, but they were run over by the Mid-American Conference champions on Monday.
Mavunga had 16 points and 15 rebounds, and Harper added 14 points.
Mitchell finished her career with a 3-pointer in an NCAA record 92 straight games.
BIG PICTURE
Central Michigan: The aggressive and balanced MAC team blows by the Buckeyes and then keeps up the pressure in the second half to extend their best ever tournament run. The Chippewas were joined in the Sweet 16 by fellow MAC school Buffalo, which knocked off No. 3 seed Florida State.
Ohio State: Mitchell gets her game going a little too late and her teammates look discombobulated for much of the evening. The Buckeyes hurt themselves as much as Central Michigan dominated them.
UP NEXT
Central Michigan moves on to play Oregon next Saturday in Spokane, Washington.
Those who are interested in the struggle for creation of Pakistan under inspiring leadership of Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah and the leaders who made major and minor contributions from political and other platforms to turn concept presented by great thinker and poet Allama Muhammad Iqbal will be familiar with the names of historically important old Urdu newspaper Zamindar and its fiery and outspoken editor Maulana Zafar Ali Khan.
Punjab University preserves old files of Zamindar and its College of Information Technology has taken a commendable step forward by launching the digital archives of the old newspaper of the first half of the 20th century. These archives, for all those interested, are available at zamindar.pucit.edu.pk to open it to go through It's historically quite important pages.
According to PUCIT Principal Dr Syed Mansoor Sarwar, that the PUCIT had launched its Digial Archives Project in 2013 initially with the idea to digitize a few historically important files and issues of Zamindar. He said that the college undertook the task of digitizing editions of this historical newspaper which are available with the Punjab University, currently its digital editions are available from October 1921 to April 1926 with the exception of those which were even missing in the university archives also.
He said that the PUCIT has also digitized the paper editions of another old daily Inqilab and intends to this project so far missing editions of Zamindar and Inqilab as well add to the library the digital versions of the prominent English newspaper Civil and Military Gazette which was among others edited by Rudyard Kipling and whose plaque was there on its building on the Mall where now Panorama Shopping Centre exists as the old building has been demolished.
It is also appreciable to hear from him that the college also plans to work with the Punjab Public Library, oldest and largest in the provincial metropolis, to digitise and preserve the paper archives of the various other newspapers of historically importance which had since ceased publications for decades together and make these e-papers available to the researchers as well as members of general public who may be interested in scanning though the old newspapers which were quite prominent and popular during their times.
It is pertinent to mention here that Maulana Sirajuddin Ahmed, the father of Baba-e-Sahafat Maulana Zafar Ali Khan, had launched Zamindar as a weekly magazine from Lahore way back in January 1903. Initially, it was intended to discuss the issues of the farmers and landowners. Maulana Sirajuddin Ahmed moved the weekly magazine from Lahore to Karamabad after a couple of months of its publication in June 1903. After the death of his father in 1909, Maulana Zafar Ali Khan resumed publication of of the newspaper again from Lahore on May 1,1911. Zamindar eventually became a daily Urdu newspaper of immense historical importance due to fiery writings prose and poetry of Maulana Zafar Ali Khan to Muslims of undivided India particularly for its publication of anti- British rulers and pro-Muslims news and editorial despite being closed down number of times. Maulana Zafar Ali Khan died on November 27, 1956 and his son Akhtar Ali Khan continued its publication .After he was imprisoned and sentenced to 14 years in jail, Zamindar ceased publication forever.
Plaque of Zamindar was seen at a double storey building on road from Railway Station to Laxmi Chowk for many years afterwards and then it also disappeared into the annals of history.
Talk on Muhammad Ali Jinnah

On the occasion, Dr Martin Lau shared his research outcomes regarding the legal developments in the early decade and said in the early days of Independence, Pakistan lagged behind India in terms of Constitutional development being a newly-born country on the map of the world, M.A. Jinnah wanted democracy, unity and social justice in newly-established Pakistan as in the understanding og Jinah , there was something progressive in Islam as compared to Hinduism, in 1943 Muslim League had started using the term “Hindu Raj” and Jinnah feared that an independent India under the domination of Hindus will turn the Muslims into a perpetual minority, therefore, he focused on the separate homeland for the Muslims of the majority areas of Hindustan, had there been an opportunity for Jinnah to live more, the unanswered questions to the Constitution would have been settled, Jinnah was of the view that sovereign States should be named Hindustan and Pakistan but to his utter surprise Hindustan was named India by the colonial rulers despite his reservations.
The talk was followed by a question-answer session. Dr Martin Wilhelm Lau is regarded as a household name in the field of South Asia, after completing his undergraduate studies in South Asian History from the University of Heidelberg, Germany, he had joined LUMS.

Exhibition artworks at NCA
An exhibition of art works titled “Drone Vision :Warfare, Surveillance and Protesr” by three artists was held at the Zahoorul Akhlaq Gallery of the premier art institution National College of Arts (NCA).
Sometime in the early 2000s, the Conan O'Brien show presented from Toronto. There in the audience was a man shouting. The camera panned to him. The man was wearing a jacket that lit up. It read ‘Flyerman.'Known to Torontonions by this sobriquet was Mark Vincent Vistorino, who spent most of his life chasing the limelight.Vistorino became somewhat of a fixture on the Toronto concert scene as he, sometimes aggressively, handed out flyers promoting his photography business. At other times, he entertained people with his sharp remarks and occasional off-colour jokes.So intense and unique was his persona that two Toronto filmmakers, Jason Tan and Jeff Stephenson made a documentary about Vistorino, which premiered at the 2003 Toronto International Film Festival.Vistorino died on Nov. 15, 2016, on his way to Prague. He was 57.

Sports facilities are in high demand in greater Edmonton, and a group in St. Albert is hoping its twist on the conventional recreational centre can help ease the burden on taxpayers, while opening up the ice to more young athletes.
After a year of meetings with stakeholders and politicians, Active Communities Alberta is unveiling its plan for a new rec centre to the public.
“Ultimately, we found a creative solution that reduces the burden on taxpayers and adds incremental facilities to the area,” Active Communities Alberta president Matt Bachewich said.

In Edmonton, most sports facilities are municipally run, but Active Communities Alberta is a non-profit organization.
“Non-profits are able to access a lot more funding streams than your typical city. Non-profits are able to access grants donations from the public, corporate donations, gaming funds,” Bachewich said.

The organization's research indicated St. Albert was one of the most under-served areas when it comes to sports facilities, especially ice rinks.
“We certainly will incorporate twin ice sheets. We will incorporate gymnasium space and community rooms and community programming,” Bachewich said.

The group has yet to announce an exact location for a facility, but they want to position it in north or northwest St. Albert, along Ray Gibbons Drive so there's easy access for teams from Edmonton.
“We support it because it will provide another two rinks in St. Albert. We currently have five,” St. Albert Minor Hockey Association president Gill Hermanns said.
Hermanns said young hockey players in St. Albert are regularly forced to skate elsewhere.
“My biggest fear when we do that is the kids having to travel in winter to Onoway, Callihoo, Legal, when they shouldn't have to.”

Gymnastics groups and ringette clubs are also on board, and the area's MLA thinks they won't be alone.
“If they can make it work here, I think it's certainly helpful. Takes some off the stress of the taxpayers,” Spruce Grove – St. Albert MLA Trevor Horne said.
The room here is full of local sport coaches and volunteers, as well as politicians. Everyone united in the need for more facilities. pic.twitter.com/gAIXmVjOXG — Sarah Kraus Global (@SarahNKraus) October 6, 2017
The estimated cost would be between $35 million and $45 million.
“The ultimate goal would be to have this facility open in late 2019 or sometime in 2020,” Bachewich said.

Nizhniy Novgorod, Russia: Luis Suarez is confident Uruguay can nullify the threat from France's teenage sensation Kylian Mbappe, as they prepare for their World Cup quarter-final clash that will take place on Friday.
Talking to reporters at the South American team's Bor training camp near Nizhny Novgorod, where Friday's last-eight match takes place, Suarez said he had faith in the defence, which has conceded just one goal in the tournament so far.
"Everybody knows he's (Mbappe) a really good player, but I think we have a really good defence to control him," said the Barcelona striker.
Mbappe, 19, was the star in France's thrilling 4-3 victory over Argentina.
The Paris Saint-Germain youngster scored twice and his pace and skill also forced a penalty from which France scored their first goal.
Suarez said there were more threats from France than just Mbappe, picking out Antoine Griezmann, who he said had a "brilliant left foot".
Mbappe and Griezmann have been singled out by Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez as the main threats to the South Americans but he suggested they would not get the same space afforded to them by the Argentine team.
Suarez was less convinced by recent claims that Griezmann was half-Uruguayan because he plays with Diego Godin and Jose Gimenez at Atletico Madrid, drinks mate tea and even turned up at the airport wearing a Uruguay shirt to greet his teammates when they qualified for Russia.
"Antoine, no matter how much he says that he's half-Uruguayan, is French and does not know what the Uruguayan feeling is," said Suarez.
"He does not know the dedication and effort that Uruguayans make from boys to be able to succeed in football with so few people."
The Barcelona star added that the team would have to "wait and see" if his striking partner Edinson Cavani, who picked up a calf muscle injury in Uruguay's 2-1 win over Portugal last-16, will be ready for Friday's match.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Wednesday denied reports of intercepted phone calls between Russian intelligence officials and members of Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The New York Times said that the Russians made contact with Paul Manafort, who briefly served as Trump's campaign chairman. Current and former U.S. officials interviewed by the newspaper declined to identify other Trump associates contacted by the Russians.
Speaking to reporters in Moscow, Peskov, spokesman for President Vladimir Putin, pointed to the anonymity of the sources, saying that the reports "are not based on any facts, do not point to actual facts."
The report comes a day after U.S. National Security Advisor Michael Flynn resigned following reports he misled Vice President Mike Pence and other officials about his contacts with Russia.
Asked about the allegations, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Wednesday they "prove once against there is a major internal, political game, you can call it bargaining, in the United States."
Russian lawmakers were more direct in trying to defend Trump.
"This is not about information but about a high-precision information bomb," Alexei Pushkov, chairman of the Federation Council's information committee, tweeted. "The goal is to blow up the Trump administration."
There was a time when the Golden Globes nominations were taken seriously only as potential Oscar indicators.
If the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. decided to give a corny, crowd-pleasing musical like “The Greatest Showman” more nominations than a culturally relevant satire like “Get Out,” or ignore female directors in the middle of the #MeToo moment, it would be seen as just another quirky misstep by a group known more for taking selfies with stars than its taste-making abilities.
But not this year. After two years of #OscarsSoWhite, and as prominent men step down amid sexual misconduct allegations from all levels of the entertainment industry, nomination slates are being parsed not just for the names but inclusion and cultural messaging.
Including the Globes. With a sheen of credibility that has come — deserved or not — in recent years, the choices of HFPA's 89 voters are now dissected a bit more seriously. And when this year's were announced on Monday, critics on social media found some of the HFPA's choices baffling.
The exclusion of Jordan Peele and Greta Gerwig from the director category sparked the loudest reaction, both from social and mainstream media, especially since one of the slots was occupied by Ridley Scott.
Globes voters may have indeed loved Scott's thriller “All the Money in the World” and the fact that Scott managed to replace Kevin Spacey with Christopher Plummer in his already finished movie and still made his Christmas release date. Or perhaps they loved the fact that they are the only voting group to see the movie.
But if the group is merely saluting the effort Scott made in excising Spacey following multiple allegations of sexual misconduct against the actor, then it came at the expense of Gerwig, an awards season front-runner for the lovely “Lady Bird,” the rare movie love story centered on a mother and daughter.
The decision also could have come at the expense of Dee Rees, director of the acclaimed “Mudbound,” a nuanced social drama about prejudice in the Mississippi Delta, or Patty Jenkins, whose dazzling “Wonder Woman” upended the superhero genre in several important ways.
“It seems like they keep pushing the finish line for women,” said Melissa Silverstein, founder and publisher of Women and Hollywood, an advocacy website for gender equity in the film industry.
“You see women like Greta Gerwig and Dee Rees and Patty Jenkins winning a lot of awards, but then the momentum dies. And that's discouraging because there are a lot of opportunities this year for women to be seen in a different way.”
“Every year, I think, 'Hey, where's this woman or that woman?' But I do think the work is being acknowledged,” Gerwig told The Times. “Collectively, it's hard to feel anything but thrilled. Hopefully, all of these women who've done this great work will usher in the next generation of women doing great work and holding positions of power. It means so much to see women taking charge and shifting the conversation.”
No film moved the conversation this year more than Peele's unsettling directorial debut “Get Out,” which examined racial divisions in America. The film was nominated for best picture in the comedy/musical category and lead Daniel Kaluuya earned an acting nod. But Peele himself was ignored as a director and writer, despite having already won several honors this awards season.
Universal's decision to submit the movie to the Globes as a comedy caused a fair share of backlash; Peele himself addressed the controversy, calling the movie a “documentary” in a tweet and then later saying the Globes' comedy designation diminished the film's subject matter. “What the movie is about is not funny,” Peele said, which may not have helped his case with HFPA.

On the television side, Globes voters seemed a bit more in tune with the moment, nominating two comedies created by women — Amy Sherman-Palladino's “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” and Frankie Shaw's “SMILF”— and a disparate host of female-driven series, from “The Crown” to “The Handmaid's Tale.” Pamela Adlon, who many feared would be damaged by the fall of her friend, mentor and executive producer Louis C.K., got a nod in the comedy acting category while “Transparent,” its fate still unclear after harassment allegations against star Jeffrey Tambor, was shut out from all categories for the first time since its premiere.
Still, the most notable thing about the nominations may be the seriousness with which they are now discussed. For years, the HFPA fought to position the Globes as a general forecast for the Oscars, with a few more offbeats, and at times genuinely strange, choices thrown in (ahem, “The Tourist”). The show is still seen as a chance for Hollywood to cut loose a bit. Even if obvious inebriation is not as ubiquitous as it once was, the Globes are still nowhere near as stuffy as the Oscars, mainly because no one ever took the ceremony as seriously as the Oscars.
But as film and television have increasingly become a well-lit window onto larger conversations, not even the Globes can escape the expectations of a world changed by falling stars and hashtag culture.
“I think it's an amazing time to have a movie out and be in this place,” Gerwig said.

Manchester: Jose Mourinho admitted the Premier League title race is all but over after Manchester City delivered a hammer blow to Manchester United's challenge with a 2-1 win on Sunday.
City moved 11 points clear of second-placed United as Nicolas Otamendi's second-half strike gave the visitors a record-equalling 14th successive Premier League victory.
United boss Mourinho felt Pep Guardiola's side rode their luck at Old Trafford, with Ander Herrera booked for diving after a tackle by Otamendi that the hosts claimed was worthy of a penalty.
But he conceded his old rival Guardiola is highly likely to lead City to the title.
Asked if the race was over, Mourinho said: "Probably, yes.
"I'm pretty sure everyone is going to fight for points and try and reduce the distance, but the advantage is a very good one.
"Manchester City are a very good team and they are protected by the luck, and the gods of football are behind them.
"They are lucky, they have decisions in their favour."
Mourinho was furious with referee Michael Oliver's decision not to award a penalty for the Otamendi challenge on Herrera.
"My first reaction is I feel sorry for Michael Oliver because he had a very good match but unfortunately he made an important mistake," he said.
"The result was made with a big penalty not given. That would have been 2-2 with 20 minutes to go. It was a crucial mistake."
Mourinho was equally unhappy with the sloppy United defending that gifted City their goals.
"They scored two goals which were quite unbelievable to concede. Two bad goals," he said.
"We did enough to win the game? It depends on your perspective. They had more of the ball and apparently more control because they kept the ball more than us."
New Delhi: Competition Commission today imposed a Rs 87 crore penalty on Hyundai Motor India for unfair business ways with respect to discounts for passenger cars. The automaker said it would challenge the ruling.
Besides, the company has been directed to cease and desist from such anti-competitive practices.
In a 44-page order, the regulator said the company's anti-competitive conduct include putting in place arrangements that resulted in resale price maintenance by way of monitoring of maximum permissible discount level. This was done through discount control and penalty mechanisms for non-compliance of the discount scheme, it added.
"Such conduct pertains to and emanates out of sale of motor vehicles. Hence, for the purposes of determining the relevant turnover for this infringement, revenue from
sale of motor vehicles alone has to be taken into account," CCI noted.
In a statement, the company said, "we are really surprised with this order".
"We are studying the order in detail and will take necessary course of action to challenge the order at appropriate level to protect the interest of our customers and channel partners by abiding (with) all the laws of land," it added.
It was alleged that the company has a discount control mechanism whereby dealers are permitted only to provide a maximum permissible discount and not beyond the recommended range.
The watchdog has slapped a fine of Rs 87 crore on the carmaker. The penalty amount translates to 0.3 percent of the company's average relevant turnover in the last three financial years from 2013-14.
Among others, CCI said the company contravened competition law through arrangements which resulted into resale price maintenance and by mandating its dealers to use
"recommended lubricants/ oils and penalising them for use of non-recommended lubricants and oils".
According to the watchdog, the arrangements perpetuated by the company caused hindrance in the distribution of goods and provision of services in relation to new cars.
It also resulted in creation of "barriers" to the new entrants, the order said.
"The level of discount was determined by the OP (Hyundai Motor India) for each model and variant of the passenger cars and the OP had also appointed a mystery shopping agency to collect data from dealers for such monitoring and reporting to the OP," it added.
Further, the regulator noted the practice followed by the company to get the lubricants supplied by IOCL and Shell only and at pre-fixed price resulting in price discrimination is not accruing any benefit to the dealers as well as the consumers of the cars.
"The practice and arrangements followed by the OP also result into creation of barriers to the new entrants in the market with regard to the supply and marketing of lubricants for use in the cars manufactured by the OP," CCI said.
As per the regulator, that Hyundai Motor India mandates its dealers to use particular oil and lubricants and penalises its dealers where non-recommended oils are used, amounts to 'tie-in arrangement' in contravention of provisions of the Competition Act.
Following two separate complaints, the regulator had ordered a detailed by its investigation arm DG (Director General) in 2014.
The complaints were filed by Delhi-based Fx Enterprise Solutions India and Kerala-based St. Antony's Cars.
Beijing: China on Thursday said India and Pakistan will have to play by the rules of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) by not bringing their bilateral dispute to the forum.
Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Kong Xuanyou said "hostility" between India and Pakistan in the SCO will not be good for the group.
"In the charter of SCO, there is a clause that hostility in the bilateral relations should not be brought to the organisation," Kong said.
"I believe those countries will abide by the charter of this organisation."
"This organisation has its own rules and procedures. We hope that these rules are abided by all member states," Kong added.
He was talking to Indian journalists on the sidelines of an SCO event where national flags of India and Pakistan were hoisted after the two countries were admitted to the group last week in Astana, Kazakhstan.
China is worried that bilateral disputes between India and Pakistan could affect the forum.
However, a senior Pakistani diplomat earlier said the SCO was not a forum to settle bilateral disputes.
The envoys of India and Pakistan Vijay Gokhale and Masood Khalid respectively were present on the occasion at the SCO Secretariat.
Addressing the event, Gokhale said: "Now as a full member of SCO, we look forward to further deepening these relations for mutual benefit."
"We would also like to deepen our cooperation in our joint fight against terrorism."
(Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Merck & Co beat analysts' estimate for quarterly profit on Friday, driven by higher demand for its blockbuster Keytruda cancer immunotherapy.
Sales of Keytruda, which works by taking the brakes off the immune system, nearly tripled to $1.30 billion in the fourth quarter, compared with consensus estimate of $1.25 billion, according to Barclays.
Merck's net loss attributable widened to $872 million, or 32 cents per share, in the quarter, from $594 million, or 22 cents per share, a year earlier.
The company said it took a provisional charge of $2.6 billion related to the new U.S. tax law. The charge was offset by a 56 percent drop in R&D expenses.
The decline in R&D expenses in the latest reported quarter was driven primarily by lower in-process research and development impairment charges, the company said.
Excluding items, Merck earned 98 cents per share, beating analysts' average estimate of 94 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Revenue rose to $10.43 billion from $10.12 billion.
Merck forecast 2018 adjusted profit in the range of $4.08-$4.23 per share.
Analysts on average were expecting $4.11 per share.

2017 has been a banner year for horror movies and TV shows. Things started off in a big way for writer-director Jordan Peele‘s Get Out, a solid and unique entry in this much-maligned genre that, earlier today, earned itself two Golden Globe nominations. We also saw new installments in horror movie franchises like Annabelle: Creation, Alien: Covenant, Rings, Cult of Chucky, and Jigsaw, plus remakes like Flatliners, along with brand-new takes on terror in Happy Death Day and It Comes at Night. Some of these were better than others, of course.
And then there were the Stephen King adaptations, a sub-category all its own this year. The King of Horror saw adaptations of The Mist (briefly) hit the small screen while the I-can't-believe-this-worked-so-well feature take on Gerald's Game landed on Netflix. Of course, the biggest horror hit of the year was Andres Muschietti‘s adaptation IT, which kicked off the fall in a big, scary way. Now, The New York Times and filmmaker Floria Sigismondi are recapturing the horror-loving spirit of 2017 with a series of short films starring an A-list of celebrity stars.
We have a few of the Horror Show films gathered here but only about half of what the NY Times has to offer. Here's a look at the other short films on display:
Andy Serkis: The Demented Clown
Cynthia Nixon: The Ghost Bride
Daniela Vega: The Vampire
Brooklynn Prince: The Demon Child
Daniel Kaluuya: The Psycho Killer
Head on over to the New York Times' Great Performers page for more, or check out a sample of their horror shorts below:

Come 2018, London police will have a new review protocol for sexual assault investigations.
The service announced Monday it will be one of four police departments across the province to begin implementing the Philadelphia Model along with Ottawa, Peterborough, and Timmins. Stratford and Kingston have already started similar pilot projects.
Officials say the model is a collaborative review process that allows outside experts to review sexual assault files to ensure the investigation was thorough and properly classified.
RELATED: Proposed changes to sexual assault law not enough, says head of London Abused Women's Centre
“We are looking forward to implementing this model as we believe it is one more way to continue to develop best practices and evidenced-based, trauma-informed investigations to provide an improved response and more support for victims of sexual violence,” Chief John Pare said in the statement Monday. “We are very pleased to be part of this pilot project.”
“We support having a review model that will enable outside, expert review to ensure cases are properly and thoroughly investigated and will provide oversight and accountability,” Pare said.

Jane McGregor is the director of community programs at Anova, which provides emergency and short-term shelter and support for abused women and their children, and also chairs the London Case Review Advisory committee. She said the group is hopeful the new review protocol will help identify trends and gaps so barriers can be addressed.
“The Advisory Committee is very excited and reassured about this collaborative opportunity and the commitment from the London police,” McGregor said.
“Our goal is to create a system where all survivors who choose to report feel supported.”
Officials say they expect to complete selection of members for the review committee by mid-January and the first reviews will be done early in the new year.
The Okanagan Boys & Girls Club downtown Kelowna youth centre saw a visit from the Coast Capital Savings ‘Helping Heroes' Wednesday.
Employees dressed up as superheroes and handed out backpacks filled with personal items.
The acts of goodwill began earlier in the day at a local grocery store where some people had their groceries paid for by the crew.
“We've been serving coffee. We did some grocery shopping for people, helped them bag the groceries, paid for the groceries,” Bonnie Kilistoff with Coast Capital Savings said.
The downtown Kelowna youth centre staff said the teens are grateful for the support they saw Wednesday from Coast Capital.
“A lot of these kids are struggling with homelessness or mental health issues and because of that have barriers to basic needs,” Philly Putlitz from the youth centre said. “It's a pretty big deal. I think for them to see the community come out and support them reminds them that it's not just us: their support network is a lot bigger.”
Coast Capital Savings opened their first Okanagan branch in Kelowna in November of 2016.
Kilistoff said giving back the community is an important part of their business model.
Sholay's Radha to Shashi in English Vinglish, Indian cinema has largely denied its women the right of choice
She would leave us with things to think about at the end of each lesson. That particular afternoon after a discussion about the animal poetry of Ted Hughes or the dry wit in Oscar Wilde (I can't remember which now), we drifted — as was our custom — towards music, films, books and other such things. As the steaming cups of coffee appeared on the table before us, signalling the official start of fun hour, she looked around and smiled: “So why did Jai have to die in the end?” We looked up, mouths stuffed with cookie. “You know, in Sholay,” she prompted. “Because they had sworn to be friends till their last breath?” someone said. “You know, they also sang that song early on…”. “And they knew Gabbar was a formidable enemy,” another pitched in. “So the chances of making it out alive were always thin. Right?”
“Yes, but what about Radha?”
Indian cinema and the fates it has traditionally decided for its women raise a lot of questions. Looking back at Sholay and the eye-opening discussion from that afternoon, I have often wondered since then: so what if Jai had really survived? Would the film have gone as far as to show Jai and Radha carving out a new future for themselves like Veeru and Basanti? Would Radha, a widowed daughter-in-law of a “respectable” family, have extracted herself from her circumstances to start a new life with an ex-con? How would Thakur and the rest of the village have reacted to that? Most importantly, how would the audience going to watch the film in 1975 have taken it? Wasn't it just easier then to kill Jai off? The hint of a distant and doggedly platonic “something” with a strapping young man for Radha was probably anyway still pushing the boundaries. Anything more would certainly have been unacceptable. Jai's death was the solution to a lot of unnecessary problems.
A couple of months ago, I watched Alankrita Shrivastava's Lipstick Under My Burkha. In it, Shireen (Konkona Sen Sharma) is a resourceful and lively young woman who works as a salesperson, is popular with her colleagues and employer, and thanks to her spirited nature, is soon able to clinch a promotion. She is also a married mother-of-three who is regularly abused, cheated on and humiliated at home. She is forced to keep her job a secret and must undergo abortions every now and then. She has no delusions about where she stands in her husband's life and wonders sadly as she sits with the film's three other protagonists at the end of the film why she has not been able to earn her husband's love in all her years with him. As the film leaves us with the four women dreaming of freedom from their own respective shackles, the question that pops into my mind is whether a film as rebellious and forthright as Lipstick comes through for its characters in the end. Does Shireen ultimately leave her monster of a husband and take up that full-time job and most importantly, choose happiness for herself? Or do society and all its countless warnings about single, divorced women get to her?
But then there is Secret Superstar's Najma (Meher Vij) who does go through with it in the end. In fact, in a film where things work out fairly predictably for its characters, Najma's decision to sign the papers as opposed to the husband's sudden and miraculous realisation of the pain he has caused her is a pleasantly surprising plot resolution. But then, the sheer scale of domestic abuse endured by Najma in the course of the film coupled with the complete absence of a single human quality in the husband makes it clear early on that escape from him is the only way forward. Meher Vij at the 2018 Breakouts Roundtable spoke of how disturbed playing Najma left her. In the film, Najma's daughter Insia (Zaira Wasim) understands her plight and is desperate to help her get a divorce. She wants it as much as she wants to become a singing star so that in the end when Najma takes her stand which coincides with Insia's recognition as a singer, it is success in its truest sense for her. But do things have to get as bad as that before a woman's demand for divorce, freedom and happiness is accepted and understood by the audience?
So many Indian films have hinted at the possibility of new freedom, hope, love and happiness for female characters stuck in desperate, unhappy situations — but stopped short of an all-out breaking away from those binding circumstances. They have been offered glimpses of a better tomorrow, but one which has always been palpably out of their reach. There is English Vinglish's Shashi (the late Sridevi) who after years of humiliation at the hands of her husband finds acceptance, support and encouragement in the dreamy Laurent. There might even be the prospect of a romance between the two which Shashi vehemently denies and probably even suppresses. In the end she decides to remain with her husband whom, she assures us, she still loves and who, we hope, will be a better husband to her from here on. In the enormously successful and decidedly mainstream Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam too, Nandini (Aishwarya Rai) must accept her new husband because the likelihood of a return to her ex-lover is no longer deemed acceptable. Even in Mr and Mrs Iyer the married Brahmin woman must give up hopes of being with the Muslim man she falls in love with in the course of the difficult journey that the film charts for her.
Film is a reflection of the society it is born out of. And much like society itself, Indian cinema — commercial or otherwise — has largely denied its women the right of choice.

July is peak season for getting sick from swimming in a freshwater lake or pond, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Center study. Florida Department of Health's Alvina Chu says avoiding swimming in contaminated water is the easiest way to prevent illness.
“One tip for avoiding illnesses or preventing illnesses relating to untreated recreational water if there's been a recent rain or if the water is discolored, foamy, or scummy. Or also if there are advisories posted.”
Chu says the only fatal waterborne illness is caused by an amoeba called naegleria fowleri that infects a swimmer when contaminated water gets up their nose.

Qatar's Ministry of Defence said on Wednesday the country signed a deal to buy F-15 fighter jets from the United States for $12 billion. The deal was completed despite the Gulf country being criticized recently by US President Donald Trump for supporting terrorism.
Bloomberg News reported the deal was for 36 jets.
"Secretary of Defence Jim Mattis met on Wednesday with Qatari Minister of State for Defence Affairs Khalid al-Attiyah to discuss concluding steps in finalising the Foreign Military Sales purchase of US-manufactured F-15 fighter aircraft by the State of Qatar," Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Roger Cabiness told CNN.
"The $12 billion sale will give Qatar a state of the art capability and increase security cooperation and interoperability between the US and Qatar."
"The secretary and the minister also discussed mutual security interests, including the current status of operations against Islamic State, and the importance of de-escalating tensions so all partners in the Gulf region can focus on next steps in meeting common goals," Cabiness added.
The announcement comes after a week three Gulf countries — Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates — along with Egypt moved to cut off diplomatic ties with Qatar, host to the one of the Pentagon's largest military bases in the Middle East, after claiming that Doha funds terrorist groups.
More Arab and Muslim-majority African countries later joined the diplomatic blockade, even as several powers have called for resolving the crisis.
In November, the United States approved possible sale of up to 72 F-15QA aircraft to Qatar for $21.1 billion. Boeing is the prime contractor on the fighter jet sale to the Middle East nation.
Boeing declined to comment. Trump on Friday accused Qatar of being a "high-level" sponsor of terrorism, potentially hindering the US Department of State's efforts to ease heightening tensions and a blockade of the Gulf nation by Arab states and others.
With inputs from agencies
Uber Technologies Inc said on Monday that it had appealed regulations that have barred it from accepting cash fares in the Mexican state of Puebla, in a new challenge to clampdowns on the ride-hailing service in Latin America.
Uber stopped accepting cash payments in the Mexico City-adjacent state on Friday, responding to demands from state authorities, and filed an appeal to a federal judge against the regulation the same day.
But the company said cash fares are crucial to reach Mexican consumers who do not have credit cards.
“To continue being a transportation option for people who pay in cash and to maintain the earnings of driver-partners, the company has decided to take, as a last resort, the corresponding legal actions and request an appeal,” Uber said in a statement on Monday.
Authorities from Mexico to Brazil have tried to rein in Uber's use of cash payments, in Brazil because of concerns that cash makes drivers targets of crime, and in Mexico because of worries that allowing cash puts Uber in direct competition with traditional taxis.
In Puebla, specifically, lawmakers responded to the murders of two female college students who had used ride-hailing services with new rules in October aimed at improving companies' vetting of drivers.
The rules specify that the companies should use “electronic payments,” but Uber continued offering users in the state the option to pay in cash after the law went into effect on 7 Nov.
Uber maintains that the language in the law does not expressly ban cash payments.
A spokesman for Puebla's Secretary of Infrastructure, Mobility and Transport did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In addition, Uber is appealing a provision in the law that holds the company and other ride-hailing companies directly responsible for what happens during trips, saying it violates its right to “due process.”
Uber has said authorities should conduct investigations to determine responsibility on a case by case basis.
Uber is also appealing a provision in the law that requires the company to give authorities access to the platform, citing privacy concerns for riders and drivers. The company will continue to cooperate with criminal investigations, a spokesman said.
Uber faces curbs on its activity in other Mexican states. Last month, legislators in Quintana Roo, the southeastern state that includes Cancun, said they were also considering a proposal that would bar drivers from accepting cash and set minimum value and age criteria for the cars used for trips.

Dr. Avery Nathens was in his office at Toronto's Sunnybrook Hospital on Monday when he heard the words “Code Orange” called out over the loudspeakers.
As the medical director of Trauma Services, he went downstairs and got to work co-ordinating emergency response for incoming victims who were struck by a van near Yonge and Finch.
Code Orange – the code for a mass casualty event – is something that hospitals prepare for. And once they hear the words, they start making the hospital ready for patients' arrival.

“We created capacity in the emergency department in our trauma bay so we can have room to accept these patients,” said Nathens. “We put the operating room on hold, to make sure the operating room was available as needed, and we made sure there were sufficient numbers of doctors and nurses to meet the demands of the patients.”
As patients arrived, they were triaged according to the severity of their injuries. “Do they need to go to the trauma bay where the sickest patients were? Can they go to a lower level of care in the ED to be sorted out slightly differently?”
READ MORE: These are the victims of the Toronto van attack
Several patients needed surgery immediately and thanks to preparation, there was room. Nathens also worked to make sure that the hospital's doctors and nurses were able to focus on their patients.
“I wanted the docs and nurses to do what they needed to do and not worry about anything externally,” he said.
Sunnybrook took in 10 patients after the attack on Monday. Eight remain in intensive care as of Tuesday afternoon. Two could not be saved.
Marathon session
It can be a tough job. In 2013, Dr. David King had just finished running the Boston Marathon. He was in a taxi on his way home when he started getting text messages from his friends. “I got a bunch of messages from friends asking if I was OK. I didn't understand what that meant,” he said.
He eventually got the impression that there was some kind of fire, so the trauma surgeon decided to go in to work at Massachusetts General Hospital.
“I arrived just as the first wave of patients were arriving. Within about 30 seconds of walking in the door, I was taking one of the first patients to the operating room.”
He knew instantly that it wasn't just a fire. His military experience had taught him to recognize injuries caused by improvised explosive devices. “It looked like a scene that I was very familiar with from my military service,” he said.
He and his team worked for days, treating 46 people from the Boston Marathon bombings, which ultimately injured more than 200 people and killed three.
READ MORE: Toronto van attack suspect charged with 10 counts of 1st-degree murder, 13 of attempted murder
“In a mass casualty situation, you're basically doing the same thing you do during your daily routine except with what we call degrees of abbreviation,” he said. So that means triaging differently, pursuing surgery more aggressively, and in some cases skipping some tests or steps that you might normally do with the luxury of time and resources.
If you have six patients in front of you but only have room for one in the operating room, “You're trying to decide who's sickest, who's going to die first.”
Hospital staff “do what is required,” he said, and don't have any time to think about the events that lead to all these patients in their emergency room. “I think it was probably two days before I or anybody else on the trauma team was able to sit down and watch the news and start understanding what happened.”
Once that realization hits, he said, health-care workers might require support like psychological or religious counselling, because everyone processes these events differently.
“Just because people do this as their daily job, we see and treat trauma patients, doesn't mean that they will necessarily respond the same way to a mass casualty incident like this.”
It can “shake people to their core,” he said.
“An incident like this creates more injuries than just the visual, physical ones.”

Advance planning
Hospitals are constantly working on their emergency plans, said Dr. Andrew Willmore, medical director of emergency management at the Ottawa Hospital.
“We don't have the luxury of closing our doors,” he said.
The tricky part is balancing the hospital's normal responsibilities – taking care of ordinary patients – with creating the capacity to handle a disaster.
When his hospital is notified about a potential mass casualty situation, they sound a Code Orange, he said. Staff can then visit an “Emergency Code Station,” which are peppered throughout the hospital, to find out what they should do.
Every station contains colour-coded folders for each code, he said, that spell out the staff's specific responsibilities in that situation so they're reminded of what to do. Hospital management ensures that there are enough people, supplies, drugs, blood and space for doctors to do their jobs without interruption, said Willmore.
“A disaster in a community is not necessarily a disaster in a hospital,” he said. Planning makes sure that it doesn't become one.

London: Mohammad Amir has had some of the greatest and undoubtedly the worst days of his career in England — sometimes during the very same match.
But fresh from helping bowl Pakistan to a crushing nine-wicket win over England in the first Test at Lord's, the left-arm paceman hopes he can enjoy the "best memory" with a series win in the second and final Test at Headingley, starting Friday.
Amir, who burst on the world scene as a teenager, got his name on the Lord's honours board with a six-wicket haul against England in 2010.
But in the same game at the 'home of cricket', Amir was caught up in a spot-fixing scandal, which led to a jail sentence and a five-year ban.
That same season, Amir took three wickets for 20 runs in 11 overs at Headingley during a sensational bowling display as an Australia side featuring Ricky Ponting, Michael Clarke, Michael Hussey and Steven Smith were dismissed for just 88 in the first innings of the second 'neutral' Test.
The match, which Pakistan eventually won by three wickets, saw Amir stake a claim to 'The Ball of the 21st Century' when an all-but-unplayable delivery that pitched on the middle-and-leg stump of Mitchell Johnson seamed away late to clip the top of the left-hander's off-stump.
Amir, who helped Essex win the English County Championship last season when he also starred in Pakistan's outstanding one-day Champions Trophy final victory over arch-rivals India at The Oval, has rarely hit those Headingley heights in Test cricket since his return to the international stage two years ago.
Amir, however, took five wickets — including four for 36 in the second innings — as Pakistan outclassed England in all areas to win inside four days at Lord's on Sunday.
"It's a big achievement winning in Test cricket in England against England at home," Amir said on Wednesday.
"If we win the series I think it will be the best memory of my life," the swing bowler added.
'Block out the noise'
Pakistan will be forced into a change, with Fakhar Zaman set to replace Babar Azam after the latter suffered a broken arm facing all-rounder Ben Stokes at Lord's.
England have recalled opener Keaton Jennings in place of the dropped Mark Stoneman, who managed just 13 runs in total at Lord's.
"You will only get judged on the amount of runs you score," said Jennings, one of Alastair Cook's 12 opening partners in the six years since Andrew Strauss's retirement.
England made a late addition to their squad, with uncapped left-arm seamer Sam Curran called up Wednesday after Stokes suffered a hamstring strain.
Regardless of Stokes's fitness, England may recall all-rounder Chris Woakes, if only to bolster their fallible batting, in place of fast bowler Mark Wood.
Despite their lamentable Lord's showing, James Anderson insisted England could bounce back by squaring the series at the Yorkshire, home ground of captain Joe Root.
The team received a barrage of criticism after Lord's but Anderson, England's all-time leading Test wicket-taker, said: "The outside noise is always there, and it's a bit louder when you perform badly.
"We'll try to block out the noise — from whoever is shouting out," he added, suggesting a "bit of a luck" may be all England need to improve on a run of six defeats in their last eight Tests.
If England is seeking inspiration, they could look to the Headingley example of the West Indies.
Last year, the tourists suffered a humiliating innings and 209-run defeat by England in the first Test at Edgbaston, only to enjoy a five-wicket victory in the second Test as Shai Hope became the first batsman to score hundreds in both innings of a first-class match at Headingley.
England, though, might settle for one century by any member of their faltering top order, let alone two, right now.
Don't expect any great things from this Trojan team this year so long as Tee Martin remains the offensive coordinator and is setting the game plan and calling plays. It is an embarrassment to think that someone who was a starting quarterback for a championship team has such an inept and ineffective approach to not only the running game, but even more importantly to a creative and dynamic passing game. He manages the game as if he is not there and is not watching what is actually happening on the field.
USC's defeat to Washington State was not to a better team ... it was to a better-coached team.

There is no rule against sending in a linebacker or safety when the opposing quarterback is picking you apart.
Really, you are allowed to blitz in the second half of an important game. Winning teams do lots of it.

If anyone needs an example of a contest where two opposing sides played not to lose, Washington State 30, USC 27 is it. The Cougars just happened to be better at it than the mighty Trojans. When your defense plays like your offense and your offense plays like your defense, bad things can happen.
It's getting to the point where USC looks like UCLA. Time to retool this band of underachievers.

And the Bruins
In an article on Sept. 30, Jim Mora stated, “Great competitors and really good teams, they respond in these situations.” He was referring to the Bruins' two-game losing streak. One could also state that great competitors and really good teams are NOT ranked 102 in rushing offense, 119 in time of possession, tied for 113 in turnover margin, 113 in punt returns, and 123 in penalty yards per game.
Wonder what would happen if you asked him (or his father) about getting to the playoffs.

Analyze this
So reader Jerry Hiller thinks Troy Aikman was a bad choice to analyze the pro prospects of Josh Rosen and Sam Darnold, because his Bruin teams lost twice to USC. Never mind his three Super bowl rings and 15-year career as the top TV analyst, who meets with, dissects and breaks down NFL quarterback play every week.
Darnold proved last week that with a weak offensive line, he can be just as average as the UCLA walk-on forced to play behind a decimated offensive line last year. He has much less zip on his ball than Rosen, despite a nice scrambling ability that's wonderful for college quarterbacks.
At the same time, how much longer do we have to listen to homerKeyshawn Johnson on ESPN radio every day, as if knows it all about college football? Despite stabbing the fake sword into the Coliseum turf for his last game vs. UCLA, he was also 0-2 vs. the Bruins.

Almost half of my life has passed since the Dodgers last won the World Series in 1988. Few of the current Dodgers were a alive way back then. Traveling to away games during that span the Dodgers have flown more than twice as far as Aldrin, Collins and Armstrong did on Apollo 11. The Soviet Union was still a country. It was 10 years before Staples Center was built. It has been long enough, eh?

The non-playoffs
It's always amazing to me when I see former Angels playing for other teams; they often seem so much more confident, relaxed and successful. When they played for the Angels they seemed rather tentative and unsure. Jeff Mathis and Ervin Santana are the most recent examples. Mike Napoli was another glaring example. It looks like it is not fun to play for the scowling Mike Scioscia; consider how Joe Madden builds confidence in his players and makes the game fun.

Mike Scioscia is a nice guy, but selecting him as the best manager in California is a bad joke. Shouldn't one at least pretend to look at overall records? If Arte Moreno weren't so tight with a buck, Scioscia would have been gone years ago.

Sam Farmer details the downward spiral the L.A. Chargers franchise is in, but can anyone be surprised? Owner Dean Spanos failed in getting a new stadium approved in fan-friendly San Diego, then made every marketing mistake possible in his relocation to L.A. Remember his first preposterous plan, to partner with the Raiders on a stadium project to be built on a toxic landfill dump? The StubHub Center experiment has proved that the Chargers cannot even sell 27,000 seats for home games.
LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - A group of hedge funds have stepped up bets against a string of Italian banks, taking a contrary stance against a sector and broader market on the rise ahead of an election which could yet rattle investors.
The negative stance, shown in positioning data filed with the regulator, is at odds with business morale - at a decade high as a slow economic recovery gathers pace - as well as debt markets, where there is no sign of sovereign stress ahead of the March 4 vote.
Italian banking stocks .FTIT8300 - a proxy for the health of the wider Italian economy, have risen 11 percent so far this year to push the country's FTSE MIB .FTMIB index up 6.5 percent, outperforming most European peers.
By contrast, European banks .SX7P have risen just 3.8 percent over the same period.
While Italy's market gains have been helped by growing confidence over the country's economic recovery, thanks in part to the European Central Bank's loose monetary policy, banks would be firmly in the firing line if the market suddenly considers the positivity overdone, such as around the election.
At the moment, the anti-establishment Five-Star Movement is the most popular single party in opinion polls, ahead of the ruling party PD. A center-right alliance of smaller parties is seen winning most seats in parliament though, but probably not enough to govern, pointing to a coalition.
“It's a paradox,” said Carlo Franchini, head of institutional clients at Italy's Banca Ifigest, about the relatively sanguine market reaction so far.
“People simply haven't realized there are elections ahead. The problem is the immense liquidity,” he added, referring to how easy money policies have inflated bond prices in the heavily indebted euro zone country.
So-called ‘short' bets on lenders including UniCredit (CRDI.MI), BPER Banca (EMII.MI) and Credito Valtellinese (PCVI.MI) have all risen since the end of last year, data from the Italian regulator's website showed.
The hedge fund trade involves borrowing a stock from a long-term holder such as a pension scheme and selling it into the market in an expectation that the price will fall before you buy it back and return it, pocketing the difference as profit.
U.S. hedge fund Bridgewater Associates is leading the charge with the largest number of bets in the sector, including against Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP.MI), UniCredit and Finecobank (FBK.MI), among others.
Other funds to add to their short positions recently include London-based firms Marshall Wace, Lansdowne Partners, Oceanwood Capital Management and Caius Capital, the data showed, as did computer-driven investors AQR Capital Management, Oxford Asset Management and GSA Capital, which follow market trends.
All of the funds involved in shorting Italian banks either declined to comment or were not immediately available to comment when contacted by Reuters.
BULLS
Not everyone agrees, however, particularly as the Italian banking system begins to tackle its large pile of non-performing loans, freeing up cash to lend to companies and boost economic growth.
Investors also see potential for the fragmented Italian banking system to consolidate and cut costs.
A spokesman at one London-based fund told Reuters his firm was “rather positive” on Italian banks. “We think they are very cheap and they have addressed their issues.”
Jerry del Missier, who runs hedge fund and private equity firm Copper Street Capital, said he had a more nuanced view on the Italian banks.
“There are clearly capital challenges at a number of institutions but good progress was made in the last year in cleaning up the sector. Some of this has been reflected in the market already, but we believe there are still attractive valuations across the capital structure of several banks.”
Six hedge funds owned stakes in UniCredit, betting the share price would rise, according to Thomson Reuters data, while three held such positive bets in BPER Banca and three in Credito Valtellinese.
The International Monetary Fund estimates the Italian economy grew 1.6 percent in 2017, the strongest rate since 2010. The economy is set to grow 1.5 percent in 2018, lagging average growth of 2.2 percent across the whole euro zone.
The stock market was helped in 2017 by 11 billion euros of investment from a government-backed scheme to promote public ownership of small and mid cap companies. Another 9 billion euros investment is expected in 2018, according to estimates from brokerage Equita.
Wiring is a convenient way to send money to relatives or loved ones, but it can also be fertile ground for scammers.
Just a few months back, Western Union made big news by agreeing with the federal government to pay back nearly $600 million to anyone who fell victim to a scam that used Western Union between Jan. 1, 2004 through Jan. 19, 2017.
If you feel like you were a victim, you can fill out an online complaint with the Federal Trade Commission.
“There is a claim process through the (Federal Trade Commission) website and victims have to provide certain information, and part of that information is their social security number, and I know that as a victim of identity theft or fraud, sometimes that's a touchy subject for some people to give up again,” said Jason Kama, director of marketing for the Hawaii Better Business Bureau. “I think it's reassuring to see a company like Western Union step forward and try to right a wrong like this especially in a way that they can.”
You must submit a claim by Feb. 12, 2018.
Some of the cases to look out for that are eligible for refunding:
Online or internet scams – you did not receive the items you tried to buy online
Lottery or prize promotion scams – you were told you won a lottery or sweepstakes, but never got the prize
Emergency or grandparent scams – you sent money to someone pretending to be a relative or friend in urgent need of money
Advance-fee loan scams – you paid upfront fees, but did not get the promised loans
Online dating or romance scams – you sent money to someone who created a fake profile on a dating or social networking website.
“Whenever you wire money or send money or send a gift card or anything like that, make sure you know the recipient. Know the company you are dealing with so that you can make good choices,” Kama advised.
When considering wiring someone money, think before jumping in.
“As soon as someone requests you to wire funds instead of some other form, it puts up the red flag that hey, this might be something that I need to pay more attention to instead of just jumping onto it,” Kama said.

FORT WAYNE, Ind. (WOWO): A Fort Wayne man is accusing his son's 8th-grade Spanish teacher of pushing a political agenda on students.
In a WOWO Exclusive, Todd Hein tells us his son was shamed, bullied, and given an extra assignment by his teacher, Sarah Ford, at Blackhawk Middle School, after he cited Fox News as his source for an assignment.
“She decided to walk up to him and in front of everybody, told him Fox News is fake news, it's full of lies… and gave him a new assignment, to look up any of the ‘many lies' Donald Trump has told as President of the United States, and do a full page report on that,” Hein says.
Hein says he doesn't care what the teacher's political views are, as long as they're not forced upon students:
“They don't need to listen to that in a Spanish class, of all things. I mean there's no other word to describe it. She bullied our son over Fox News.”
He adds he had a 36-minute meeting with the school's principal in which Ford admitted to the allegations. However, the district tells Hein they've finished their investigation into the matter, but won't say what their ruling is:
“They said she'd be the only person who knew the outcome unless she was terminated, then it would be presented to the board and it would become a public record,” Hein says.
We reached out to FWCS spokeswoman Krista Stockman for comment. She provided the following statement:
“Fort Wayne Community Schools does not condone the kind of behavior detailed by this parent. When we were notified, we immediately investigated and took appropriate action. Because this is a personnel matter, I cannot provide details of the outcome of the investigation.”

BRUSSELS – The European Union's parliament is set to approve a landmark trade deal with Canada, with the bloc's executive extolling the pact as a sign of international co-operation at a time when many political forces, including U.S. President Donald Trump‘s administration, are trying to halt globalization.
Hundreds of protesters were outside the EU parliament building in Strasbourg, France, arguing Tuesday that instead of growth and jobs, such a deal will erode the bloc's environmental, labour and consumer standards.
EU trade chief Cecilia Malmstrom tried to assuage concerns that the deal uniting the markets of 500 million Europeans with 35 million Canadians would cut into the independence of EU decision-making. She said it “will not change food safety standards or any other EU requirements, only the EU institutions can do that.”
READ MORE: CETA: Trade committee approves Canada-EU trade deal
The vote for a major trade agreement comes at a time when populist parties in Europe and Trump in the U.S. have been looking increasingly inwards, thwarting a trade deal with Pacific countries and floating the idea of tariffs on imports.
The vote also comes a day before Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is scheduled to arrive in Europe to push the merits of free trade in the face of increasingly hostile, populist opposition.
Trudeau is to deliver a pro-trade message in an address to the EU Parliament in Strasbourg on Thursday – a first for a Canadian leader – and to top business leaders a day later in Germany.

International Trade Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne was already in Strasbourg ahead of the vote.
“With President Trump in the White House we see a clear change in U.S. policy,” said liberal ALDE legislator Marietje Schaake. “Leadership for open economies and societies must come from us in Europe.”

“We cannot imagine a better partner than Canada, the most European country outside the union,” she said.
Three of the four major groups in parliament are backing the deal – the EPP Christian Democrats, the ECR Conservatives and the ALDE liberals.
Trade between the EU and Canada amounts to more than 60 billion euros (US$63 billion) a year, and the EU expects the so-called CETA deal to boost this by 20 per cent by removing almost all tariffs.
Outside the legislature, the concerns were palpable among demonstrators.
“What will happen is more and more deregulation, less social protection for citizens, for small companies, for independent workers,” said Maika Fernandes, who had travelled from Alicante, southern Spain. “No one will be able to compete with the multinationals. It will be a financial Europe that will favour only big multinationals.”
Ratification of CETA by the European Parliament will pave the way for 90 per cent of it to come into force once Canada's Parliament follows suit in the coming months.

OVERLAND, MO – The Missouri Department of Natural Resources blames a computer glitch for slowing down emissions inspections throughout the St. Louis Region since Monday.
A spokesperson for the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, Connie Patterson, said the state switched the vehicle inspection system over to its new vendor, a California based company called Worldwide Environmental Products, on Monday. That's when many inspection stations had trouble completing the tests and had to turn customers away. In turn, people couldn't get the necessary documentation to register their vehicles.
Mechanics like Nathan Mersch at Hill Brothers Automotive in Overland, say it's been bad for business. They normally do 8 inspections per day, but haven't been able to do any.
“We're stuck between a rock and a hard place we need the work but it ain't there,” said Nathan Mersch.
The state pushed Worldwide Environmental Products to fix the problem. Patterson said by Wednesday evening, about 250 stations were still impacted. That's down from a total of 850 in the St. Louis region earlier in the week.
“Our goal is to get this fixed as quickly as possible,” Patterson said. “We are taking immediate action to solve this. We asked vender to get more people on the ground and on the phones, we are full-court press to get this resolved.”
To find a testing station that's up and running you can call the Missouri Department of Natural Resources at 314--416-2115 or 1-800-361-4827.
Lucknow: Claiming compliance with a Supreme Court order, BSP supremo Mayawati vacated a government house in Lucknow, but is holding on to a second sprawling bungalow which her party says is a memorial to their founder Kanshi Ram.
Her personal secretary on Wednesday said she has vacated the bungalow on 6, Lal Bahadur Shastri Marg which was allotted to her as the former chief minister.
His press release said the bungalow was vacated on Tuesday “in compliance with the orders of the Supreme Court.”
The Supreme Court had on 7 May said former chief ministers of Uttar Pradesh cannot retain government accommodation after demitting office.
Following the order, the Uttar Pradesh government on 17 May issued notices to ND Tiwari, Mulayam Singh Yadav, Kalyan Singh, Mayawati, Rajnath Singh and Akhilesh Yadav to vacate the bungalows.
The BSP, however, appears to suggest that the notice Mayawati got is for the wrong bungalow.
The Bahujan Samaj Party said recently that the Uttar Pradesh government notice asked Mayawati to vacate 13A, Mall Avenue, and not the bungalow on Lal Bahadur Shastri Marg which they claim was actually allotted to her as a former chief minister.
Last week, a BSP delegation met Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, claiming that the Mall Avenue bungalow had been converted into a Kanshi Ram memorial in 2011, and Mayawati occupied only two rooms in it.
On 21 May, after it had received the vacation notice, the BSP also installed a board at that bungalow, terming it 'Shri Kanshi Ram Ji Yadgar Vishram Sthal'.
Mayawati's aide said the State Estates Officer was informed in writing that the Lal Bahadur Shastri Marg bungalow had been vacated.
But he refused to receive a copy of the letter, according to the press release.
The party then sent the letter and the keys of the bungalow through Speed Post, "which have been duly received” by his office today, it said.
But the estate department had recently said that as per their knowledge, the Mall Avenue bungalow was allotted to Mayawati in her capacity as a former chief minister.
Among the former chief ministers, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Rajasthan Governor Kalyan Singh have indicated their willingness to vacate the official bungalows.
But the others have expressed reluctance to give them up.
ND Tiwari's wife Ujjwala has sought more time, pleading that her husband was in the "last stages" of his life.
Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav and his son Akhilesh Yadav have written to the estate department seeking two more years at their official residences and have moved the apex court on this.
Music continues to circulate in a world of conflict, which, like music, also comes and goes in waves.
American rapper and songwriter Kendrick Lamar recently became the new winner of a Pulitzer Prize. The winner of the 2017 prize was Du Yun's “Angel's Bone.” Lamar's popular track, “DNA.” undoubtedly took this award for its simply intricate unraveling of the inner workings of his mind and body. Lamar uses his talents to weave simple words into meaningful and deep phrases about the makeup of himself that millions have grown to resonate with. While he's proud of these things, it isn't all “ambition and flow.” Even the “dark, evil, and rot” inside of him makes him who he is and that is something he is proud of. This is something that more people today should take away in today's world. He has shown that it is okay to have negative things that form you, but they do not define you any more or less than the positive things do.
Another track from “DAMN.” By Kendrick Lamar that deserves attention is “LOYALTY.” This track, featuring Rihanna, preaches the values of hard work and sacrifice of time. Song-enhancing Rhianna uses her similarly demanding voice and tone to grab the listener and ask, “Where does your loyalty lie?” Rap is difficult for some to enjoy, but Lamar entices the listener of his music with a story that cannot go unfinished.
Every year thousands of people from near and far come together in interesting, artistic, slightly questionable garb to enjoy another year of music and art at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. The festival lasted, this year, from April 13 to the 22, and featured many artists varying in style and genre. One of these artists was the ever popular, ever powerful Beyoncé. She blew away the crowd of admirers with not only a change in wardrobe but also with musical changes and a show that proves the title “Beychella” an accurate alternate naming of the festival. Beyoncé's other shows have put up a good fight, but her performance at Coachella was the one to beat– and who is a better competitor than Beyoncé herself? Including a reunion of Destiny's Child, she was joined on stage by her husband Jay-Z, and she sang many other hits which fans reacted strongly to.
Another rap artist, Eminem, returned to the scene after a long time of being gone under the radar. His performance at the 2018 Coachella Festival drew back the curtains that many have unknowingly shut on him and demanded the attention of the audience with an exciting comeback. Many say that Eminem was the wrong choice of a closer of the last weekend of the festival, but it is all about variance and different styles of art and music, so the decision can be justified with a different perspective.
Noticing the differing styles in music today and appreciating them in comparison to the equally-appreciated music of the past is important in understanding all styles. Every song, every artist, every concert or festival has something to take away from it, and looking for that thing is the part that is the most exciting about the entire experience.

Brooklyn, Mich. — The racing will be different this year, at Michigan International Speedway.
Brad Keselowski's race last week at Pocono is evidence of how and why.
Keselowski, fifth in points in the NASCAR Cup Series as he fights for a second championship, played the sort of seemingly radical pit strategy the 2017 season is establishing as standard, with a new set of race rules.
There are now two stages of racing before the end of the full race. Points are awarded in each.
At MIS for the FireKeepers Casino 400, Stage 1 ends at lap 60, Stage 2 on lap 120 and the race and the final stage on the big, speedy, two-mile oval is on lap 200.
Drivers and teams compete hard for points awarded for the two stages. Towards the front of the field especially, they now routinely drive the ends of both initial stages as hard as the end of the race.
At MIS, what many consider the fastest track in NASCAR, driving it hard means one thing: Speed.
And, because all of what is essentially a so-called competition caution at the end of the first two segments, two planned pits stops provide new options and opportunities.
“Well, it's absolutely changed your strategy and the way you call the race, for sure,” said Travis Geisler, the NASCAR competition director for Team Penske.
“If you look at Pocono and the way that played out: I mean, no one could really figure out where or what the strategy was going to be until everything shook out at the end,” Geisler said.
“It jumbles up the field, at times, in a way that nothing else has in the past.”
The two planned pit stops impact fuel and tire strategy, allow adjusting the “set-up” of the chassis for aerodynamics and handling, adding significantly to race strategy and the possibility a slower car can beat a faster one.
“It's been definitely strategy coming into play a lot I'd say through the race,” said Cole Pearn, crew chief for the Cup series leader, Martin Truex Jr.
“It's definitely made it more interesting, more events to pay attention to, for sure.”
It is mostly why 14 races into the season, only three “fastest cars” have been first to the checkered flag.
At Pocono, Kyle Busch clearly drove the fastest car.
But Keselowski, his crew chief of eight years, Paul Wolfe, and his team of just as long, Team Penske, were earnest in their search for something different.
When they found it and executed their strategy nearly to perfection, it was noted.
“When you've got a car that dominant, the only way to beat it is to go opposite,” said Larry McReynolds, an analyst for Fox Sports.
Keselowski and the team starting going the opposite of Busch, pitting around lap 12 of 160.
In another NASCAR season, that would likely signal significant difficulties with the car or maybe the tires.
This season, it was a matter of taking a chance, hoping to make a chance.
After getting two tires and an air pressure adjustment in the pits, Wolfe's strategy of pitting early in the fuel window of the first two stages emerged.
As each of the first two stages ended, Keselowski was not among those who peeled off to pit early, realizing they could not win the stage. That planned run to the pits, usually by cars about 15 seconds behind the leader who are unlikely to finish in the top-10, is new to NASCAR this season.
The first 10 finishers in a stage earn 10 points to one point, from first place to 10th, respectively. In addition, the stage winner gets a bonus point to use in the post-season.
“The value of the stage points changes for every competitor out there,” said Steve Letarte, an NBC Sports analyst and former crew chief.
“A lot of it has to do with the tires, the tire fall-off.
“But it really comes down to the timing of the caution, the length of the track, if you lose a lap, if you pit or don't pit under green, those things all make a huge difference,” Letarte said.
Keselowski's strategy at Pocono and its impact on tire and fuel use allowed him to cut through the field from the start of the third stage.
He picked up 12 positions in 22 laps.
Eight laps later, he led the field for the first time all day, 30 laps before the checkered flag.
“I think they know the only way they can beat Kyle Busch is you have to do something different,” McReynolds said. “So I think there's a method to their madness, here.”
But having led for 10 laps, with Busch on a different pit strategy now catching him from behind and no yellow flying, Keselowski pitted with 20 laps remaining.
All seemed lost.
But the caution that would have worked perfectly for him worked OK when it finally came one lap later. Instead of pitting from the lead, Keselowski restarted second to Busch, who stayed out on older tires to maintain track position.
The strategy was right.
The execution? Wanting.
On the restart, not only did Keselowski, on fresher tires, fall back from Busch, he also fell into the clutches of other cars with fresh tires, too.
He finished fifth.
“I just didn't get enough go on the restart, which was a bummer,” he said. “I don't know, I feel like I probably could have won it if I had just gotten that launch.
“Kyle got a great launch.”
It is all a lot for fans to keep an eye on, and some fans have complained it takes a few races to learn the new scoring system.
“The primary goal,” said Scott Miller, senior vice-president for competition for NASCAR, “was to create more incentive and more action, in what is otherwise can be a long event.
“We've seen a lot of action around the ends of those stages all of the way in the top 15, with all those team having a chance at some points in the stage,” Miller said. “It's action all of the way back through the field
“There was a lot of industry collaboration on getting it with the broadcasters and the tracks and the teams and the presidents and the drivers,” Miller said. “So there was a lot of buy-in, initially, and some skepticism, with all of us.
“But we've been extremely happy with how it's worked out.”
The feedback from drivers, teams, broadcasters and fans is positive enough, Miller said, that fans hoping the sport will settle in and stick to the same rules for a while, if only for the sake of familiarity, will not be disappointed.
“It was heightened at Pocono, for sure,” Miller said.
“I think stage racing is here to stay.”

It's been 25 years since Los Angeles went up in flames following the acquittal of four LAPD officers in the beating of unarmed black motorist Rodney King.
Now the L.A. riots are the subject of at least five documentaries that will air on cable and network television throughout the month.
In commemorating the anniversary of this critical chapter in L.A.'s history, each film takes a different angle in exploring the six-day uprising that took 55 lives, injured thousands and cost at least a billion dollars in damages.
Through new interviews, old news footage and camcorder-shot videos, filmmakers examine the circumstances before, during and after the citywide riots. The stories they tell resonate today and show us how far America has — and hasn't — come since April 29, 1992.
Here is a look at three of the documentaries airing in the next week.
“L.A. Burning: The Riots 25 Years Later” (A&E, premieres Tuesday, April 18, 9 p.m.)
Director John Singleton, already Oscar-nominated for “Boyz n the Hood” when the riots occurred, is an executive producer, and in front of the camera as well, for this two-hour film directed by One9 and Erik Parker. (The pair previously collaborated on the documentary “Nas: Time Is Illmatic.”)
It naturally enough bookends the riots with recent clips from what feels like an epidemic of brutal, sometimes fatal encounters between black citizens and police officers too rarely held to account. But its strength is that it keeps its account first-person and personal, listening to participants, victims, close observers and others overtaken in the action, most filmed on the streets where it happened, and in some cases happened to them.
One9 and Parker give individual human context to their interlocking history. This is a serious, pointedly handsome work — Frank Larson was the director of photography — that balances crisp, quiet new footage with fuzzy, chaotic old. And if there are perhaps too many shots of subjects staring thoughtfully into the middle distance or darkly into the lens, the effect of their being filmed dignifies each speaker. You can decide for yourself whom to respect — here and there self-reflection shades into self-justification. The directors allow you that room.
“Burn ... Burn!” (Showtime, premieres Friday, April 21, 9 p.m.)
The full title of this 90-minute film is unprintable, but documentarian Sacha Jenkins (“Fresh Dressed”) focuses on the history of the LAPD and its relationship with the black and brown communities of Los Angeles.
Dating back to the deadly 1962 raid on a Nation of Islam mosque, “Burn” covers the rise of militarized law enforcement tactics by Police Chief William Parker, the '65 Watts riots, the street gangs of 1970s and '80s South Central, crack cocaine and Parker's protégé, Chief Daryl Gates, who was at the helm during the '92 riots.
Through a series of interviews with historians, civil rights leaders, citizens and former and present-day law enforcement (including current LAPD Chief Charlie Beck), the Showtime film paints a picture of a city divided — where whites were protected and blacks were kept away from the whites.
There were few opportunities for blacks who'd come to L.A. from the South in the '50s, explain expert voices such as gang historian Alex Alonso and civil rights attorney Connie Rice. Forty years of discrimination, a high unemployment rate and brutal police tactics created the volatile cocktail that led to the '92 riots.
Others interviewed here include rapper Dee Barnes, retired LAPD officers who worked the Watts riots, a former Black Panther and residents of South L.A. who were at Florence and Normandie when the intersection became one of the earliest flashpoints. (“We were sick and tired of being sick and tired, and we weren't going to take it any more,” said one man of why Angelenos began burning, beating and looting.)
The film opens and closes with cellphone video of the 2015 shooting of an unarmed homeless man on skid row by LAPD. It makes the point that the more things change, the more they stay the same. “In the last four years,” says Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors, “we have had some of the most officer-involved shootings that have resulted in deaths in Los Angeles.”
“The Lost Tapes: L.A. Riots” (Smithsonian Channel, premieres Sunday, April 23, 8 p.m.)
Learned reflection gives history context but sometimes at the expense of immediacy; perspective is enlightening but can also be deadening, draining the life out of history.
This 60-minute film — part of a series that also includes episodes on Pearl Harbor, the Son of Sam murders and the Patty Hearst kidnapping — tells its story almost entirely through archival news reports, home video and photographs.
Some clips inevitably also appear in “L.A. Burning” and other riot-themed documentaries; but some, including LAPD-shot video footage, fire department dispatch chatter and listener calls to the Compton-based KJLH Radio, which give breadth to community concern, are exclusive to this film.
“The Lost Tapes” puts you in the heated moment, takes you along on a developing story purposely told without the benefit of hindsight; it is all reaction and little reflection, but no less complex a narrative for all that. Its only defect is a soundtrack/sound design that goes too readily to the tropes of reality television to create tension. “Lost Tapes” doesn't need that help.

Amanda Simpson had three children.
Four-year-old Drake, six-year-old Caydence, and Odin, 8.
All three were killed inside their home earlier this month in what police say was a shooting carried out by 39-year-old Justin Painter, their father and Simpson's ex-husband.
Painter also killed the 29-year-old mother's boyfriend, Seth Richardson. And then himself.
The shooting took place May 16 in Ponder, an area outside Dallas with a population of roughly 2,000.
Simpson was shot and injured, but that was no accident. She told HuffPost in an interview at Painter wanted her alive.

“Seth's dead. The kids are dead,” Simpson recalled Painter saying. “And you're going to have to live with it.”
Simpson also spoke out in a Facebook Live video earlier this month from her bed in a hospital in near Denton.
WATCH: Breaking the cycle of domestic violence
In the video, Simpson expressed anger with the judge in her divorce suit, whom she said ignored her warning about her husband.
“Because I don't know if anybody knows, but Justin tried to commit suicide a year ago. And I made it very clear to the judge that he was mentally unstable,” she said. “And they didn't listen, so now I don't have my babies.”
“You guys know they were my everything, my purpose to breathe.”
After the divorce, Painter had hoped for reconciliation “and I told him I couldn't. He didn't like it. He didn't like it,” Simpson said. She was planning a life with Richardson, and “Justin couldn't accept that,” she said.
Judge Nancy Berger, who heard the case, released a statement on Simpson's video denying her claims.
“The parties chose to amicably settle and finalize their divorce dispute through a mediated settlement agreement with an attorney/mediator,” the statement, reported by the Denton-Record Chronicle read.

Berger added neither Simpson nor Painter brought up mental health issues during the divorce, which was finalized in March.
Simpson said in the Facebook video that she is now facing the impossible challenge of moving on — somehow.

“They want me to sleep,” she said of her doctors and nurses at the hospital. “I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, you guys don't want to know what I see.”
“Every time I close my eyes, I see my babies. I see them dead.”
Simpson says she eventually plans to move back to Virginia, but for now, is grappling with planning and paying for funerals.
Domestic violence in U.S.
Domestic violence, or intimate partner violence, involves abuse from a current or former partner.
According to the American Psychological Association, at least one in three women in the U.S. have experienced “rape, physical violence and/or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime.”
About 74 per cent of murder-suicides in the country involve an intimate partner, and overwhelmingly, the women are the ones killed.

New Delhi: The Congress on Friday approached the Election Commission alleging violation of the model code of conduct by the ruling BJP in Madhya Pradesh ahead of bypolls in the Mungaoli and Kolaras Assembly constituencies.
"Today we approached the Election Commission to demand a fair election in Kolaras and the Mungaoli Assembly seats," Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia told the media in New Delhi.
He alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was indulging in "unfair practices" and violating the model code of conduct.
"The BJP is taking many steps that violate the model code of conduct (MCC)," said Scindia, the MP from the state's Guna, demanding strict measures by the Election Commission.
He said that the Congress delegation has apprised the poll panel about BJP leaders making announcements which were in direct violation of the model code.
"The Chief Election Commissioner (OP Rawat) has ensured us that they will take a look into the matter and act accordingly."
In its petition, the party demanded transfer of four officials for various complaints against them.
It said the BJP has violated the model code of conduct by"organising "Mere Deendayal Competition". It also accused a minister of the BJP government of announcing scheme to provide agricultural loans to defaulting farmers in one of the constituencies going to the polls.
The party demanded cases against persons violating the MCC and abusing government machinery.
Byelection in the two constituencies is scheduled to be held 24 February. The bypolls were necessitated due to death of Congress MLAs Mahendra Singh Kalukheda (Mungaoli) and Ram Singh Yadav (Kolaras).
God,
After much drama, the result may be straightforward. The presidential election will pit the incumbent against the head of one of Egypt's smaller parties.
The candidate, who registered at the last minute, is also on record as one of the incumbent's strongest supporters.
Some say he is there for show. He says he is there to win, but also in support of Egypt's democratic development.
Without him, the election would be referendum.
So God, develop.
May these elections spur conversation on government policy.
May they spur growth of all allied parties.
May they give options to forces inclined toward a boycott.
May they give voice to the people in endorsement or change.
Some say the result has been predetermined. With you, God, it has, and make clear the path.
Allow these elections to move Egypt straightforward. Dramatic or not, guide her to peace.
Amen.

Kushner Cos. pulls request for tax break in New Jersey city
By BERNARD CONDON
, AP Business Writer
(AP) — The real estate firm owned by the family of Jared Kushner has withdrawn a request for a big tax break for one its buildings in Jersey City, New Jersey, the latest setback for the company in the area.
The Kushner Cos. sent a letter withdrawing its application for a 30-year break from city taxes for a planned two-tower project in the struggling Journal Square section of the city, Jersey City spokeswoman Jennifer Morrill said Wednesday. Opponents of the tax breaks marched downtown earlier this year and the city's mayor recently came out against the Kushner request.
Jared Kushner was CEO of the family company before stepping down to become a senior adviser to his father-in-law, President Donald Trump.
Kushner Cos. spokesman James Yolles said the company is committed to the "much-needed investment" in that area of the city.
The loss of the tax break is the latest blow for the company in a city where it is major real estate developer.
The 79-story building — One Journal Square — gained attention last month after Jared Kushner's sister, Nicole Kushner Meyer, mentioned her brother in a presentation in Beijing where she had hoped to attract Chinese investors in the building. Marketing material noted the "celebrity status" of her family.
Government ethics experts blasted the family for what they said was an attempt to profit off Jared Kushner's position in Washington, and the Kushner Cos. canceled upcoming investor presentations in the country.
The company said Meyer wasn't trying to use her White House ties to attract investors.
The Kushner family is seeking 300 wealthy Chinese to invest a total of $150 million in One Journal Square. The family was trying to raise money through the EB-5 visa program that grants temporary U.S. residency to wealthy foreigners in exchange for investments of at least $500,000 in certain U.S. projects
The company also is in danger of losing another tax break for the building. The shared office space firm WeWork recently pulled out as anchor tenant. That has put in doubt a state break tied to WeWork.
Another project is off, too. The Kushner Cos. once considered bidding to develop a 95-acre industrial site along the Hackensack River in the city for housing, called Bayfront. Last month, it was revealed the family had withdrawn from those plans last year.
The Kusnher Cos. has said politics had nothing to do with its decision to withdraw from Bayfront, and that "economics of the deal" drove the move.
As for One Journal Square, company spokesman Yolles said the project will provide 4,000 construction jobs and $180 million in tax revenue for the city over 30 years.
Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop, a Democrat, is running for re-election this fall, and tax breaks to developers have become a major issue.
Unlike neighboring Hoboken, Jersey City has granted dozens of tax breaks in recent years. Fulop had campaigned to reform the practice, but critics say he has done little.
Another Kushner property in the city overlooking the Hudson River got a five-year tax break soon after Fulop was elected mayor. That 50-story building has licensed the Trump name and is called Trump Bay Street. The building was also partly financed with EB-5 visa money from abroad.
The Kushner family owns or manages 20,000 apartments, 13 million square feet of office space and industrial properties in several states, including New York, New Jersey, Maryland and Illinois.
Hamilton: A brutal spell from Neil Wagner, including three wickets and a broken arm, led New Zealand to a comprehensive victory over the Windies in Hamilton on Tuesday.
The tourists, set a target of 444, folded to be nine for 203 at tea on day four with Sunil Ambris retired hurt and unable to continue batting.
The 240-run victory saw a dominant New Zealand wrap up the series 2-0 after winning the first Test by an innings.
The hostile Wagner accounted for most of the damage in the second innings in Hamilton with his short-ball barrage targeting the body.
Ambris was taken to hospital after a vicious blow to the forearm.
He tried to struggle on and reached five before trudging from the field.
It ended a tough Test baptism for Ambris who was twice dismissed in his first three innings by treading on his stumps.
Shai Hope, on 23, also required on-field medical attention after being on the forearm by a rising Wagner delivery.
When play resumed he attempted an ambitious hook at another short delivery and was caught by Colin de Grandhomme at long leg.
Shane Dowrich lasted two balls after Ambris left when he fended a Wagner bouncer to Henry Nicholls at short leg.
Roston Chase and Raymon Reifer manufactured a solid 78-run partnership until midway between the lunch and tea breaks when Chase, on 64, went in similar fashion to Hope, pulling a Wagner bouncer to the safe hands of de Grandhomme.
Reifer was out soon after for 29, edging a good ball from Tim Southee to give Williamson his second smart catch at gully, before Mitchell Santner cleaned up the last two wickets.
When the Windies resumed the day at 30 for two they needed opener and captain Kraigg Brathwaite to knuckle down for a long innings.
But he was gone in the sixth over for 20, caught at gully off Trent Boult, giving the left-armer his 200th Test wicket.
The series now moves to three one-day internationals and three Twenty20s with the tourists to be reinforced with the inclusion of Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels for all six matches while Andre Fletcher, Sunil Narine and Kieron Pollard will play the Twenty20s.

SEATTLE, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla Inc, has said little about how he plans to turn his prototype electric truck into reality.
But Reuters has learned that Tesla is collaborating with Anheuser-Busch, PepsiCo and United Parcel Service Inc to build on-site charging terminals at their facilities as part of the automaker's efforts to roll out the vehicle next year.
Details of the partnerships, which have not been disclosed previously, are still being hammered out, but include design and engineering from Tesla, the companies said. They declined to disclose what portion of the building costs, if any, Tesla would pay, or whether Tesla would be compensated for its work.
The firms are among nine major corporations that have placed pre-orders for Tesla's truck, dubbed the Semi.
With questions swirling over whether Tesla can make good on its aggressive timetable, news of the collaboration is a sign that corporate customers are taking the effort seriously, and that Tesla is working to solve one of the biggest impediments: keeping the big-rigs powered.
Companies that spoke with Reuters said the first step is to install charging equipment on their own premises. The Semis would be limited to routes that would get them back to home base before the batteries are spent, the firms said.
PepsiCo, which has reserved 100 Tesla trucks, said it may eventually explore sharing facilities and costs with other companies. The food conglomerate has held multiple meetings with Tesla to discuss the recharging effort, said PepsiCo executive Mike O‘Connell.
“We have a lot of in-house capability around energy and engineering ... and certainly Tesla brings their expertise to the table on energy and charging,” said O‘Connell, senior director of supply chain for Frito-Lay North America, PepsiCo's snack-food unit.
Separately, in a high-tech twist on the traditional truck stop, Tesla is moving ahead with plans for its own stations to sell electricity to truckers who pull up for a charge, according to customers and transportation industry executives who have discussed the matter with the Silicon Valley automaker.
Tesla already operates more than 1,100 “supercharger” stations globally for drivers of its passenger cars. Musk has spoken publicly of doing something similar for its heavy-duty trucks by installing a network of solar-powered “megachargers” that could juice up a Semi battery in 30 minutes.
But just how quickly Tesla could build a robust network of electric filling stations for commercial truckers is not clear. The company is already stretched thin and burning cash. Tesla has struggled to ramp up production of its new Model 3 sedan, which has been plagued by delays. Some analysts and trucking executives doubt that Tesla can deliver the Semi in 2019, much less a vast charging infrastructure to support it.
A Tesla spokeswoman confirmed that the Fremont, California-based company is working closely with large customers to build Semi charging stations. She declined to comment further on the arrangements or Tesla's plans for its own truck-charging terminals.
Anheuser-Busch is evaluating installing its own charging equipment for its 40 Tesla Semis at large breweries and other key locations, according to James Sembrot, senior director of supply chain for the St. Louis-based beer maker.
“What was important to us was to make a big investment in this cutting-edge technology and secure our place in line,” Sembrot said.
UPS, too, expects to work closely with Tesla on building on-site charging stations, according to Scott Phillippi, global engineering director for the parcel delivery behemoth. The Atlanta-based company pre-ordered 125 Semis in December.
Grocery chain Loblaw Companies Ltd will likely use solar power to juice charging stations for the 25 Semis that it has pre-ordered from Tesla, according to spokeswoman Catherine Thomas. She said Loblaw was considering Tesla as well as “a few other companies” for technology and design.
None of the companies would disclose cost estimates for building their own charging infrastructure.
U.S. transit agencies that operate electric buses provide some clues. A “fast charger” terminal serving six electric buses would cost $249,000, according to a 2016 report from the California Air Resources Board.
But analysts and automotive industry executives said the price tag for commercial truck facilities could easily reach into the millions of dollars, depending on factors such as the number of big-rigs to be recharged, the energy source for the electricity and existing energy infrastructure in a given area.
AUTOMAKER OR ENERGY SUPPLIER?
Tesla in November unveiled its prototype Semi with the aim of upending the trucking industry. At a splashy event in Hawthorne, California, Musk said the sleek, battery-powered cab could achieve up to 500 miles on a single charge, and be faster, cleaner and cheaper to operate than conventional diesels.
Base prices range from $150,000 to $200,000, according to Tesla's website, compared to $120,000 for a typical diesel. Companies including Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Sysco Corp plunked down deposits, getting plenty of public relations mileage in the process.
But Tesla's most obvious potential customers - major U.S. trucking firms - have not jumped on board.
Werner Enterprises Inc, YRC Worldwide Inc, Daseke Inc and Old Dominion Freight Line are among the transport companies holding off pre-orders of the Tesla for now, citing doubts about the Semi's promised recharge time, range, price and payload capabilities.
Derek Leathers, chief executive of Werner, said he is not among the “naysayer crowd” that doubts Tesla's ability to produce a viable electric truck.
“I think it'll happen, I just think their timeline is extremely aggressive,” Leathers said.
Still, a dearth of publicly available charging infrastructure makes electrics impractical for long-haul trucking in the United States and elsewhere.
That is something Tesla's Musk has sought to address with his plans for solar-powered “megacharger” stations. But he has provided few specifics. At the November Semi unveiling, Musk said “we're guaranteeing” 7 cents per-kilowatt-hour price for electricity at the facilities.
That is at the low end of cost figures cited by the U.S. government. Solar power for commercial use costs 9-12 cents per kilowatt hour, or 6-8 cents with a federal subsidy, according to a 2017 report from the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
Customers and industry executives said Tesla intends to buy cheap excess solar power off the U.S. energy grid, store it in enormous battery banks, then profit from selling it to drivers of Semis.
But that strategy carries risks, experts said.
“It's a departure from being a vehicle manufacturer to being an energy supplier,” said Darren Gosbee, vice president of engineering at Navistar International Corp, which is working to launch an electric medium-duty truck by late 2019.
Ian Wright, a Tesla co-founder who now runs his own company making electric powertrains for industrial trucks, is skeptical that truck charging stations can be a big moneymaker for Tesla.
He estimated the capital costs for batteries alone would be $15 million for a single station.
“I am not seeing any profit in the energy brokering for Tesla,” said Wright, whose Wrightspeed powertrain venture is based in Alameda, California.
London police have charged two individuals nearly a week after a gas bar hold-up in north London.
Officers say that about 7:30 a.m. on April 15, a man entered the store at 1845 Adelaide St. N., and demanded cash from a female employee. Police say the man made threats to shoot the employee, before fleeing the scene in a vehicle with an undisclosed amount of money and property.
The employee wasn't hurt in the incident.

Investigators discovered the vehicle used during the robbery had been stolen earlier from a Mount Pleasant Avenue address. The accused were arrested on April 21.
A 26-year-old London man is charged with disguise with intent, driving while disqualified, robbery with violence or threats, and three theft-related charges.
A 30-year-old London woman is charged with two theft-related charges, and possession of a controlled substance.
Amplify Christian Music Festival has released the newest act in the lineup for the festival, which is scheduled for Aug.17 and 18 at Holland Chapel Baptist Church in Benton, and the Saline County Fairgrounds.
Organizers announced Tauren Wells, whose songs include “Hills and Valleys,” has been added to the festival.
According to Matt Brumley, co-director of the event with Josh Turner, Amplify has become one of the largest two-day Christian music festivals in the country in its seven years of exsistence.
The headline act for Aug. 17 will be Kari Jobe, who sings “I Am Not Alone.” She will go onstage between 8:30 and 9 p.m.
Casting Crowns will headline Aug. 18. The group performs songs such as “Who Am I,” “East to West” and “Voice of Truth.”
Other acts scheduled are We Are Messengers, Plumb, 7enenth Time Down, Stars Go Dim, Cody Carnes and Summerhill.
Popular Christian hip-hop artist Flame will perform and serve as emcee for both nights of the festival.
The Stunt Dudes will perform skate and bike acrobatics.
Brumley said the event is rooted in community unity, though it has spread out beyond the community. Based on last year's event registration, there were people in attendance from 17 states and Canada. Organizers counted 62,508 registries, though Brumley cautioned that people registered per day.
While the event and parking are free, Brumley said people do need to register to allow organizers to have an idea of how many people will attend so they can ensure there are enough restrooms and food options.
Brumley said visitors should bring money if they plan to purchase anything from the merchandise or food vendors or buy tickets for the rides available for children.
Brumley said the festival is also a great time to bring families together.
Turner said, in addition to the rides, there will also be bounce houses where children can play for free. He said organizers plan to set up a small-scale fair during the fest.
There will be multiple activities during the event and radio stations on hand.
Turner said the mission and vision of the festival is first and foremost to share the gospel of Jesus Christ and share his love and break barriers to the church.
In order to equip attendees to share their faith, the fest is hosting “Sharing Your Faith with Jason Curry” for free at 10 a.m. at the River Center on Aug. 18.
Curry is a youth pastor at The Church at Rock Creek. Brumley said he teaches on practical ways to share faith.
He added that the fest could not occur without all its partners, including Everett Buick GMC, BR McGinty, Ferguson's Furniture, Rock City Staging LLC, Eagle Electric, Custom Advertising, Riggs Cat, Blu Stream Media, Ferguson Builder, ACDI and Fence Masters.
Amplify will also sponsor with The Call of Saline and Perry counties to support its mission of supporting and training foster and adoptive parents in Saline County. The Call will get some time on stage to share its mission and Amplify donates funds to the organization each year.
Live Life to the Max will have a booth sharing information about Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome/ Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infections.
The organizers plan to present the gospel each night of the festival.
Along with its partners, Amplify is in need of volunteers to help pull off the two-day event.
Brumley said 350 volunteers are needed to do everything from sell shirts to parking to help build the stage. Volunteers can sign up at the Amplify website.
Brumley said Amplify will soon open sales for VIP experiences that include an artist meet-and-greet, shirt, Amplify bag and goodie bag. The organizers are still working on the details, but should announce further information soon.
Brumley said Amplify will update new information on its Facebook page now through the festival.
To volunteer, register to attend or learn more about the event, visit www.amplifyfest.org.
TAMPA, Fla. (AP) - A Florida man has been sentenced to six years and five months in prison for accidentally shooting a gun while taking a selfie in a strip club restroom.
The U.S. Attorney's Office in Tampa announced 34-year-old Rorn Sorn's sentencing Monday. The Asian Pride Gang member pleaded guilty in April to possessing a firearm as a convicted felon.
Court documents say Sorn was at Club Lust in St. Petersburg in December when his gun discharged. The bullet went through the mirror and into the adjacent women's restroom. No injuries were reported.
A security guard approached Sorn as he was leaving, and Sorn reportedly told the guard that it was an accident and that he "was just trying to take a selfie." Police responded, and officers found a handgun, ammunition and drugs on Sorn.
Sorn has prior felony convictions for burglary and attempted first-degree murder.

Even though he may be in a slump, Aaron Judge still proves he can hit the ball far as he cranks a few home runs during batting practice. (0:41)
One of the most coveted signatures in all sports has signed on the dotted line.
After a heavy courtship by memorabilia companies, New York Yankees slugger Aaron Judge has signed an exclusive autograph deal with Fanatics.
Terms were not disclosed, but Judge's agent, David Matranga, said that it was a long-term deal.
"We've been really selective on what deals we wanted to do, but after the All-Star break it seemed the right time to do this one," said Judge, whose only other endorsements are with Rawlings and Under Armour.
Yankees slugger Aaron Judge has signed an exclusive autograph deal with Fanatics. Fanatics
During the first week of July, one of Judge's signed rookie cards sold for $14,655 on eBay. Two weeks ago, the jersey that Judge wore for his MLB debut was sold by Steiner Sports for a sum of $160,644. Judge hit his first home run in his debut.
On its website, Fanatics is selling 8-by-10-inch photos with Judge's signature for $350. A signed Yankees hat is $400, a signed batting helmet is $500, a signed bat is $600 and a signed replica jersey is $650.
"As a kid growing up in California, I collected autographs," Judge said at a Fanatics private signing on Sunday. "I got [Giants shortstop] Rich Aurilia and Barry Bonds and actually got Willie Mays a couple times."
Judge, who won the All-Star Home Run Derby said that growing up, he used to perfect his signature in classroom notebooks while in school, dreaming of the day he would someday sign.
While Judge hasn't said anything publicly, sources said he was not happy with the way his game-used jerseys were put up for bid without his having any knowledge of it. The jersey Judge wore on Mother's Day, which was also Derek Jeter's number retirement, is to be auctioned off next week by Heritage Auctions. Steiner has the right to get some of Judge's jerseys through its memorabilia deal with the Yankees.
Judge's batting gloves, bats and shoes are his property, but his jerseys are property of the team. The deal with Fanatics doesn't include rights to his game-used memorabilia.
Since the All-Star break, Judge has hit .164 and struck in 30 consecutive games. He ranks second in Major League Baseball in home runs (35), seven behind the Miami Marlins' Giancarlo Stanton.

Gwyneth Paltrow has won an Oscar for her lead role in “Shakespeare in Love,” created an online juggernaut in her lifestyle website Goop, and now she's ascended up an Idaho mountain to accept the Sun Valley Film Festival Vision Award.
“I've never taken a gondola to accept an award before,” joked Paltrow, standing amidst a crowd of friends, industry insiders and SVFF director Candice Pate, who presented Paltrow with the honor during a celebratory dinner Saturday held at the Roundhouse, an historic après-ski restaurant perched midway up Ketchum's Bald Mountain.
“I have to be in the office every day and I anticipate it being that way for a while,” said Paltrow of balancing the dichotomous aspects of her wildly successful two-pronged career — that of actress and business mogul. “I don't do a lot of acting right now, so when I do I look for what's going to have the best ROI in terms of time and impact. It's fun to do something like ‘The Avengers.' I get to go to Atlanta for two days, see my friends, do a scene with Robert [Downey Jr.], come home. I just agreed to do my fiance's [Brad Falchuk] new TV show (“Politician”) and it'll be two days per episode. I can't do more than that. So, it's like a puzzle to try to put it together. I look for things that will be fun and or I'll learn something.”
With this year's fest having a decidedly female empowerment feel — Kate Bosworth was this year's recipient of the fest's Pioneer Award; “Outside In” writer-director Lynn Shelton was the co-recipient of its High Scribe Award, along with Duplass — Paltrow shared her own perspective on making it as a actress in Hollywood.
“I think the way to become really good at something is to be sort of myopic about it,” said Paltrow. “And if you have one big passion, my recommendation would be to put everything behind that and do the Malcolm Gladwell 10,000 hours and get really, really good at it. And if then you decide to evolve into something else, well thank God as women we are now living in a time where we have license to do that, to try our hand at directing — those doors are open to us now.”
Paltrow, who also took part in one of the fest's signature Coffee Talks, spoke candidly about the struggles experienced as a full-time working mom with responsibilities and commitments oft stretching her in various different directions.
“My first pointer for being a working mom is — and not that I follow this all the time, but I strive to — to be proud of your work. I want to set an example of someone that is proud of what she is doing so that the time spent away from our children is emboldening us and building us up as women. I want to make sure that we're bringing home something as mothers to our kids. And on the practical side, I really try to limit my time on the phone and on the laptop after work — to just put things away. I try to do one thing at a time and that's sort of my philosophy. I don't always achieve it, but I try.”
SVFF executive director Teddy Grennan, SVFF Screenwriters Lab creator Emily Granville and actors, filmmakers and musicians such as Oliver Stone; Andrew Bird; Dree Hemingway; Jay Duplass (who hosted the Screenwriters Lab); and Academy Award-nominated producers Kevin Walsh (“Manchester by the Sea”) and Jim Burke (“The Descendants”) were also on hand for the festive high-altitude fete, considered a highlight of the five-day fest.
Other notables of this year's fest included Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, who was honored with SVFF's Rising Star Award for his breakthrough roles in Baz Luhrmann's “The Get Down” and the Oscar-nominated “The Greatest Showman,” and writer-director Michael Polish, who screened his film “Nona,” which Bosworth executive produced.

UNA Professor Honored with Nation's Highest Geography Teaching Award Newly Appointed Attorney General Steve Marshall Takes Oath of Office, Addresses Public » Effects of Drought Continue to Plague Trees across State Trees are dying. The question is, why? Although the rainfall during December and January relieved much of the drought and related wildfire issues in Alabama, the harmful effects and complications associated with drought continue to plague the state's forestlands. While exact economic impacts are unknown at this time, the losses may be significant according to forestry professionals with the Alabama Forestry Commission (AFC).
“Some trees typically die immediately following an extended period of drought such as we experienced last fall, particularly smaller seedlings and saplings,” said AFC Forester/Forest Health Coordinator Dana Stone. “The most damaging results, however, may take longer to emerge,” she continued. “Drought-stressed trees can be weakened, causing them to be more susceptible to insects and diseases. These symptoms of long-term injury are just now appearing, especially in our state's pine forests.”
Forest landowners began reporting the decline of hardwood trees as a direct result of the drought as early as late summer. Recently, calls to the agency have increased regarding pine trees. Pines of various ages and sizes are dying, from seedlings to mature trees. Most of the affected pines have brown needles and pitch tubes, indicating bark beetle infestation. AFC foresters have inspected numerous spots, and the trees appear to be dying from a range of pests, including Southern pine beetle, Ips engraver beetle, and black turpentine beetle, or a combination of all three. In some instances, the deodar weevil was also present in beetle-infested pines. These insects generally infect the pines with associated fungi causing the trees to die more quickly.
“The Alabama Forestry Commission continues to conduct aerial surveys to assess beetle activity across the state,” said Interim State Forester Gary Cole, “but landowners need to understand the seriousness of this situation. To ensure the overall health of their forest stand, they should monitor their property for signs of damage and contact their local AFC office or registered forester for management recommendations before taking any action.”
The Alabama Forestry Commission is the state agency charged with protecting and sustaining Alabama's forest resources using professionally applied stewardship principals and education, ensuring that the state's forests contribute to abundant timber and wildlife, clean air and water, and a healthy economy.

Hublot's Classic Fusion Tourbillon for Berluti Blends The Best Of Two Worlds
Swiss luxury watchmaker Hublot and Berluti, the Parisian house that manufactures bespoke footwear and menswear, have revealed a new chapter in the unique partnership that links these two renowned brands, with the introduction of two new exclusive timepieces.
Motivated by the same values, excellence, distinction and innovation, the designers from Hublot and Berluti came up with the Hublot Classic Fusion Tourbillon Berluti Scritto King Gold and the Hublot Classic Fusion Tourbillon Scritto All Black watches, both of them set to be produced in a very limited run of just 20 pieces.
Hublot's iconic Classic Fusion Tourbillon watch has been re-imagined to fuse the fine shoemaking of Berluti and the fine watchmaking of Hublot into one exquisite package.
These watches display either an 18kt King gold or black ceramic 45 mm case, with double sapphire crystals and the ability to handle 30-meter deep waters. In terms of power, the Swiss manual-wind Hublot in-house caliber HUB6016, with 25 jewels, 21,600 vph and a power reserve of 5 days, will allow you to count the seconds until the next social event or any major celebration in your life.
Furthermore, the dial comes in brown or black Berluti patinated Venezia leather, featuring a Scritto décor with embossed indeces, the Hublot logo, as well as polished 18kt red gold-plated or black hands. A black rubber and brown or a black Berluti patinated Venezia leather strap with Scritto decor finishes off the design, with trivial details such as purchase costs completely out of sight and out of mind.
Paris: Switzerland and Serbia, missing the accumulated Grand Slam power of Roger Federer, Stan Wawrinka and Novak Djokovic, slumped to defeat in the Davis Cup first round on Saturday, allowing Kazakhstan and the United States to reach the quarter-finals.
The Swiss have now fallen in the first round every year since their only title triumph in 2014, which was inspired by 20-time major winner Federer and three-time Grand Slam champion Wawrinka.
But with recently-crowned Australian Open champion Federer and injury-hit Wawrinka not making the trip to Astana, the Kazakhs made the most of their opportunity.
Timur Khabibulin and Aleksandr Nedovyesov sealed the key point by seeing off Marc-Andrea Huesler and Luca Margaroli 6-4, 6-4, 3-6, 6-7 (5), 6-3 in the doubles for a 3-0 lead.
Serbia, the 2010 champions but without Djokovic, were also defeated as Ryan Harrison and Steve Johnson downed Nikola Milojevic and Miljan Zekic 6-7 (3), 6-2, 7-5, 6-4 for a 3-0 advantage on the clay courts in Nis.
Djokovic, the 12-time major winner and former World No 1, was absent after undergoing surgery to cure a long-standing right elbow injury.
The United States, who have been champions 32 times, were 2-0 up overnight after singles wins for Sam Querrey and John Isner.
Harrison, with a world ranking of 19 in doubles, teamed with Johnson against the rookie pair of unranked Zekic and the world 307 Milojevic and set up a quarter-final against Belgium or Hungary.
Belgium, the runners-up in 2017, are 2-1 ahead of Hungary in Liege.
The win was sweet revenge for the United States who had lost to Serbia in the 2010 and 2013 competition.
"We feel good about our team and our depth. We're excited," said Harrison.
Sunday special
The remaining six first-round ties will be decided on Sunday.
Defending champions France are 2-1 up on the Netherlands in Albertville after Nicolas Mahut and Pierre-Hugues Herbert defeated Robin Haase and Jean-Julien Rojer 7-6 (6), 6-3, 6-7 (3), 7-6 (2).
"It was by far their best match in the Davis Cup," said France skipper Yannick Noah.
The winners will face either Japan or Italy for a place in the semi-finals.
Italy has the edge over Japan in their tie in Morioka after veterans Simone Bolelli and Fabio Fognini beat New Zealand-born Ben McLachlan and Yasutaka Uchiyama 7-5, 6-7 (4), 7-6 (3) 7-5.
Japan, without talisman Kei Nishikori, are looking to reach the quarter-finals for only the second time while Italy were champions back in 1976.
Five-time champions Spain, without World No 1 Rafael Nadal, are 2-1 up on Great Britain on clay in Marbella after Pablo Carreno Busta and Feliciano Lopez defeated Jamie Murray and Dominic Inglot 6-4, 6-4, 7-6 (4).
Britain are missing Andy Murray, who is recovering from hip surgery.
The winners of that tie will face either Australia, the 28-time champions, or Germany who are 2-1 ahead in their tie in Brisbane.
Tim Puetz and Jan-Lennard Struff beat John Peers and Matthew Ebden 6-4, 6-7 (1), 6-2, 6-7 (4), 6-4 in the doubles on Saturday.
Alexander Zverev, the World No 5, can secure the winning point on Sunday if he beats the enigmatic Nick Kyrgios in the first of the reverse singles.
In Osijek, meanwhile, world number three in singles and Australian Open runner-up Marin Cilic teamed with Ivan Dodig in a thrilling comeback to see off Daniel Nestor and Vasek Pospisil 2-6, 3-6, 6-4, 7-5, 6-2 as Croatia lead Canada 2-1.
"It was incredibly tough," said a relieved Cilic.
The winners of that tie will face Kazakhstan in the last eight.
KNOXVILLE, TENN. -
A Tennessee woman's video of her tearful son recounting being bullied at middle school has prompted a wave of support from athletes and entertainers.
Kimberly Jones said in a Facebook post Friday she had just picked up her son, Keaton, from school because he was too afraid to go to lunch.
In the video, Keaton said other students call him ugly, make fun of his nose and tell him he has no friends. He said milk was poured on him and ham was put down his clothes.
“Just out of curiosity, why do they bully?” Keaton said. “What's the point of it? Why do they find joy in taking innocent people and find a way to be mean to them? It's not OK.
“People that are different don't need to be criticized about it. It's not their fault. If you are made fun of, just don't let it bother you.”
The video had more than 18 million views as of Sunday, and a crowdsourcing page for Keaton's future education had raised more than $29,000.
“We all know how it feels to want to belong,” Jones said in her post, “but only a select few knows how it really feels not to belong anywhere.”
On Twitter, Tennessee Titans tight end Delanie Walker invited the Jones family to an upcoming game, while University of Tennessee wide receiver Tyler Byrd said he and several teammates plan to visit Keaton at school.
Country music star Kelsea Ballerini tweeted that the next time she comes home to her native Knoxville, she wants to be with Keaton to witness the bullies apologize.
Retired race car driver Dale Earnhardt Jr. said on Twitter he wants Keaton to “add me to your long list of friends,” and Snoop Dogg said on Instagram that Keaton “has a friend for life” and that “love is the only way to beat hate.”
Two property developers were nabbed yesterday for alleged illegal connection of water at the Waterfall City development in Midrand, north of Johannesburg.
The two allegedly colluded with a City of Johannesburg official to steal millions of litres of water that was used at the development.
The duo will be charged with theft, while the official was charged with fraud and corruption.
Their arrest was confirmed by Lucky Sindane, the spokesperson for the city's Group Forensic and Investigative Services Unit (GFIS).
He said that through their preliminary investigations it has been found that 90% of water meters in Waterfall City have been obtained illegally including those of a well known mall and auditing firm.
Sindane said the theft of water by developers cost the city up to R8 billion in recent years.
He said they were able to recover R408 million over the last four months.
“When developers want to construct they are supposed to apply for bulk water meters. These can cost between R100 000 and R140 000 each. Ninety percent of the buildings that have been constructed here (Waterfall City) have never applied for these,” he said.
Sindane said that the investigations had begun three weeks ago in collaboration with operation ‘Buya Mthetho' led by Johannesburg Metro Police Department.
“More arrests are expected as investigations continue. We are still going to be doing audits on all the businesses in Waterfall City,” Sindane said.
Waterfall City was not immediately available for comment.
Wizards, pies, hedgehogs and new genderless characters will all be arriving on your iPhone and iPad soon, thanks to an upcoming update to iOS 11.
Emoji have been a very bizarre — if not somewhat predictable — evolution in how we communicate, but the standard is always evolving. Though Unicode showed off the 2017 list back in March, today we have our first look at the designs Apple will be putting onto iOS, macOS and watchOS in future updates.
This is just a partial look; we'll be able to see the “hundreds of new emoji” when Apple seeds a beta of iOS 11.1 to developers and public beta users next week. These include new options like “Woman with Headscarf,” “Bearded Person” and “Sandwich.”
You can take a look at some of the new emoji below, including what could likely be the cutest emoji ever and the most deeply unsettling.
Grit is a common word used to describe Garcia, not only because as she pitched with a brace as soon as she was physically able to, but because of the way she pitches. She attacks every hitter by pounding the strike zone, which has already helped UCLA (56-5) achieve its most wins since 2001 (62). In the midst of the worst title drought in program history, she wants to end UCLA's streak of seven championship-less seasons as well as her own lifelong streak. And she wants to make her mother cry again, once more in a good way.
After weeks of escalating criticism, Assembly Republican Leader Chad Mayes still doesn't have any regrets over bucking his party to support California's cap-and-trade program on climate change.
There's just one thing Mayes would have done differently: He wishes he had attended the ceremony on San Francisco's Treasure Island where Gov. Jerry Brown signed the legislation.
“The perception was, ‘He didn't go because he was getting heat.' That's not how I operate,” Mayes said, explaining his absence as a scheduling conflict. “When you do the right thing, it's a good idea to stand by that.”
Whether he did the right thing is a question that has engulfed California's struggling Republican Party.
For Mayes and his allies, voting for the global warming legislation was a bid to show voters that Republicans are serious about tackling an issue important to Californians. The final law prevented more stringent regulations by extending the cap-and-trade program, which requires companies to buy permits to emit greenhouse gases.
But for conservative critics, the entire episode was a betrayal of party principles and a tactical blunder. In their eyes, Mayes did nothing more than help liberals increase costs for California businesses and then take a victory lap. They accuse him of providing political cover to Democrats in the state Capitol while ignoring the wishes of his caucus, the majority of which opposed the legislation.
Perhaps worst of all, they said, a grinning Mayes posed for chummy photos with Brown and top Democratic lawmakers after the vote. Shawn Steel, one of California's two representatives on the Republican National Committee, called it “repugnant.”
“What Chad has done is given us a big fat skunk on our plate, and he's really hurt the party,” Steel said.

Jerry Brown, Senate leader Kevin León and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon after the cap-and-trade vote. On the left is Republican Assemblyman Rocky Chavez, who also voted for the legislation.
The dispute has led to the rare spectacle of top state Republican officials openly campaigning to oust a member of their party from a leadership position. County chairs, local committees and powerful donor groups have called on him to step down — including the GOP leaders of his home county of San Bernardino — and the state party's board of directors is expected to vote on the issue Friday.
At a weekend tea party gathering in Fresno, the party's most conservative activists called for Mayes to be challenged by another Republican in the 2018 election.
Tim Donnelly, a conservative former assemblyman who unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2014, called on tea party members to take Mayes down.
“I think every single Republican in the state of California should make it their business to make phone calls for whomever is going to primary Chad Mayes if he doesn't resign his seat,” Donnelly said Friday night.
Mayes can be removed from his leadership post, which he has held for two years, only by a vote of his 25-member caucus. That could happen when lawmakers return from their summer recess on Aug. 21. He faces an internal challenge from Assemblyman Jay Obernolte (R-Big Bear) — and maybe others.
Jim Brulte, the party's state chairman who held the same leadership post when he served in the Assembly and Senate, gave Mayes some advice: Once these challenges gain steam, they're hard to stop. Mayes confirmed the conversation; Brulte declined to comment.
Obernolte and Mayes met Friday to talk about caucus leadership, according to sources with knowledge of the conversation, and Mayes left the meeting planning to remain in his position.
The acrimony over cap and trade has also complicated routine negotiations over extending a routine fundraising agreement between the state party and legislative Republicans, threatening an important tool for filling campaign coffers for next year's races.

Although Mayes has been the focus of criticism, some of the seven other Republicans who voted for the legislation have been under fire as well. Right-wing activists entered the district office of Assemblyman Marc Steinorth (R-Rancho Cucamonga) and didn't leave until the California Highway Patrol arrived. Assemblyman Devon Mathis (R-Visalia), who drew attention for his emotional speech before the vote explaining his support for cap and trade, faced angry comments from constituents during a town hall meeting last month.
The internal disputes could cast last month's vote to extend cap and trade in a much different light. The bipartisan deal had been hailed by supporters as opening a new chapter in California's environmental leadership, one that could enjoy broader support than in the past. Former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the rare Republican who has championed the fight against global warming, said his party had “moved forward in a big step.”
But the harsh criticisms could force lawmakers back into their partisan foxholes when it comes to climate change.
It's a familiar cycle for California's beleaguered Republicans. Trapped in a shrinking legislative and electoral minority, their only shots at relevance have come through working with Democrats. That often leads to recriminations when Republicans cross-party lines to support proposals that don't fit conservative orthodoxy.
“There is historically a tension between being relevant as the minority party, and achieving success on the margins — as opposed to being 100% doctrinaire,” said Rob Stutzman, a former Schwarzenegger advisor.
The bitterness in the Capitol deepened last week when Assemblywoman Melissa Melendez (R-Lake Elsinore), who stepped down as Mayes' deputy caucus leader last month to protest his handling of cap and trade, was booted out of her third-floor office. With one day's notice, she was moved into a cramped fifth-floor space known as “the doghouse,” a common landing ground for lawmakers who run afoul of their leaders.
The new and refreshed Hyundai i20 is all set to make its debut at the Auto Expo 2018 and it will reportedly feature a new automatic gearbox. The current (outgoing) version of the i20 with its 1.4 litre engine was introduced back in September 2016, but was reportedly not a hit amongst the Indian audience due to its high price of Rs 9.15 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi).
According to AutoCarIndia, the new i20 is coming with a 1.2 litre Kappa engine mated with a continuously variable transmission (CVT), which gives the car an advantage of a ‘small car' tax rate of 12.5 percent in comparison to the outgoing i20, which had a duty of 24 percent.
This tax cut has allowed Hyundai to include the automatic gearbox, which is reportedly an increasing trend in the Indian auto market, while keeping the car competitively priced with the Baleno CVT.
The Hyundai i20 is also going to be more fuel efficient with the new facelift, says the report. Also, the two-part grille of the current i20 will reportedly be replaced by a single-piece 'Cascade' grille, which was seen on the latest Verna.
Other changes, as claimed by the report, include tweaked bumpers and headlights, the upward movement of the number plate to the bootlid, and new alloy wheels design.
Auto Expo 2018 is being held in Delhi-NCR from 9 - 14 February.

This year hasn't been great for the electric car startup Faraday Future. Financial issues have caused all sorts of problems, forcing FF to scale back production plans and even abandon the billion-dollar Nevada factory it was building. Recently, news broke that things are looking even worse: Another founding executive has resigned.
The Verge reports that Tom Wessner, FF's head of supply chain management, submitted his resignation yesterday. Back in August, Alan Cherry, the company's head of human resources, chose to leave the startup. That makes Wessner the second founding executive to resign this year. Other than cofounders Nick Sampson, Tony Nie, and Jia Yueting, that means the only remaining founding executives are Dag Reckhorn, the head of manufacturing, and Richard Kim, the head of design. FF has also lost quite a few other important employees, including several who worked directly on the company's first production car, the FF91.
“The US employees that remain either don't (yet) have an offer elsewhere, are title bump hungry (interesting how suddenly there's allot of “Sr.” level everyone) or delusional – or a combination of all three,” one former employee told The Verge. “Morale is tanked. No one is in the office ever. They keep bringing in investors, but no one invests,” the former employee added. “[The] company is a sinking ship,” they said.
As dire as that description sounds, it's no wonder that The Verge also reports that FF is exploring the possibility of partnering with or selling itself to a more established automaker.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's opposition Labour Party supports keeping the closest possible trading ties with the European Union after Brexit and will lobby Prime Minister Theresa May to stick to that, the party's Brexit policy chief Keir Starmer said on Sunday.
British Labour Party politician, Keir Starmer, Shadow Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, speaks during an interview outside BBC television studios in London, September 3, 2017. REUTERS/Mary Turner
Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, Starmer said: “What are the benefits of the single market and the customs union? They are no tariffs and they are alignment of regulations and standards and that means that for goods and services we can trade successfully in the future. That's what we want.”
“The way we've put it is that we would start with viable options, staying in a customs union and a single market variant which means full participation in the single market.”
SUKKAR - Opposition Leader in National Assembly Syed Khurshid Shah Monday said that PML-N had not allowed abolishing Articles 62 and 63 to entrap Asif Ali Zardari in Memogate scandal, therefore, these clauses would not be abolished now. How and why these clauses will be abolished, we will see it in new mandate”, he said this while talking to media men in a ceremony in connection with Independence Day.
No political party hatched conspiracy against Mian Sahib then the protest rally was staged against whom, he questioned. Nawaz Sharif rally was against the institutions, he added.
When Gilani was disqualified then Mian sahib said he should go home immediately, he said adding this is settlement of human being rather than of animals.
Nawaz Sharif should tell us what he had said the then was right or what he is saying at present is right, he said adding a man who was elected as prime minister for three terms had been disqualified by the judiciary. He should now remember past. Nawaz Sharif and Shahbaz Sharif had big hand when judiciary had disqualified Benazir Bhutto and Asif Ali Zarari. They played role in getting Benazir and Asif Ali Zardari disqualified, he stated. He should remember that time and should not cry that why he had been ousted, he added.
The PML-N revolution is in fact “Save Nawaz” revolution, he remarked. The provinces are free to enact their own law in the matter of anti corruption following passage of 18th amendment, he held. Therefore, we abolished NAB law in Sindh but this does not mean we are opposed to constitution, he added.
Kendra Newman was sipping her morning coffee, listening to the birds in the trees, and admiring the freshly mowed lawn behind her red brick row house when the pop of gunfire rang out -- slow and deliberate at first, then all at once.
"It was rapid and kept going and going and going," she said. "It was clear that something was terribly wrong."
Fearing it may be gunfire, Newman, 35, shooed her two dogs inside and ducked for cover while her fiancé punched 911 into his cellphone. Within minutes, blaring police sirens resounded throughout the sleepy neighborhood of Del Ray in Alexandria, Va.
A fierce firefight had broken out at the popular local park located at the end of narrow alleyway behind the couple's shared home -- less than a block away.
"This did not sound like a simple shooting," said Scott, her fiance who wasn't willing to disclose his last name. "It sounded like a war zone."
The gunfire startled local business owner John Patrick, 40, out of sleep. He sat up, but laid back down, dismissing the sounds as yet another construction project in the neighborhood. Then he overheard the squad cars amassing on the street outside his front yard.
"It was confusing," Patrick said. "I couldn't figure out what was going on."
He walked out his front door into the summer heat to see the baseball field across from his home bustling with uniformed officers. As he got closer, peering through the back chain link fence that ringed the field, he saw a throng of people crowded around a body laying on a stretcher.
A helicopter slowly emerged in the distance as a dot in the clear blue sky and descended on the vast outfield, kicking up a cloud of dirt and grass.
"It was strange thing to see," Patrick said. "This is a tight-knit, everyone-knows-everyone kind of place. You wouldn't think this sort of thing could happen here."
In addition to the baseball field, the leafy park has a tennis court, dog park, and a children's area complete with a jungle gym, a swing set and two sets of slides. It is surrounded by quaint town homes with well manicured front lawns.
The alleged shooter is said to have staged his attack in the park's small butterfly garden, before taking several steps toward the fenced off dugout on the third base side. He then took aim and hit Scalise who was allegedly on second base.
Marion MacLean, a 68-year-old retired high school English teacher who lives next door to Patrick, believed the attack was carried out by someone who methodically planned it out.
"This is a really busy park, people are here all the time, but that was rather early for people to be out there," she said. "Whomever carried out the attack must have known they were out there at that time."
Lakers advisor Magic Johnson directly lobbied to be the face of the team's front office and to be in charge of basketball operations, as his national media tour continued with a day of appearances on ESPN, with which he is still contracted for appearances.
Johnson was asked Tuesday if he wants to be the Lakers' president of basketball operations, and if he would then have the proper time to dedicate to that job.
“Yes, I do want it,” Johnson said. “If I took it on, I would definitely give 150%. Because I have other people to run my businesses.”
Johnson spoke during the day, before the Lakers lost to the Sacramento Kings, 97-96, at Staples Center.
Johnson has declined interview requests from local media, but he has done more than one interview nationally in which he said he wants the final say on the Lakers' basketball decisions. He has also said he wants to work alongside Jim Buss, and has sometimes said both during the same interview.
Nevertheless, the Lakers maintain that Johnson's role was clearly defined in their initial press release — he is an advisor to Jeanie Buss and any other department that seeks his consultation.
The Lakers do not have a president of basketball operations. Jeanie Buss is the team president, governor and a co-owner, since her father, Jerry Buss, died in 2013. She and her brother Jim are two of six siblings who each own 11% of the team. Jim Buss is the team's top basketball executive as executive vice president of basketball operations.
Jeanie Buss hired Johnson at a particularly pivotal time in her leadership. Her brother told The Times in 2014 that he planned to step down if the Lakers were not in contention for a Western Conference championship within three or four years.

When he said that, the Lakers were finishing a 27-55 season. They went 21-61 the next year and a franchise-low 17-65 last season.
As governor, Jeanie Buss has the power to remove him from his current role and has said in the past she will uphold her brother's timeline. Earlier this season, she declined to reiterate that perspective.
“I think that in my job, what my job is to make sure that I ensure the success of the franchise going forward,” she said in October. “We have to, as we define success, there's no reason to speculate on what will happen this season. We have to see what happens and evaluate at the end of the season.”
The Lakers started the season a surprising 10-10 but have struggled since. After Tuesday's loss to the Kings, they are 19-38.
Hiring Johnson seemed to signal trouble for Jim Buss.
Johnson has been openly critical of Buss in the past on Twitter and in several interviews. The pair have not yet met to discuss their relationship, but Johnson said during an ESPN show that that would happen next week in a meeting that would also include Lakers General Manager Mitch Kupchak.
Kupchak, who is typically available to reporters before home games, declined to speak about Johnson's advisory role.
“From here on out it has to be one message,” Johnson said on “First Take.” “One team, one voice. If it doesn't come to that, the losing continues. I can't step in between Jim and Jeanie. That's their thing. Jeanie's gotta handle that.”
Stephen A. Smith, a host of the show, asked Johnson if he planned to make clear to Jeanie and Jim Buss that he wants to be the one voice of the organization.
“I will put that on the table, yes,” Johnson said. “I don't know what comes after that.”
Johnson added that if confusion remained about the Lakers' power structure for much longer, he would leave the organization again.
His pitch for being the voice of the Lakers' front office included a declaration that his first call would be to Kobe Bryant to get him involved in the organization again. He also said that though the Lakers have struggled to attract free agents in the past, his presence would change that.
“If Magic Johnson is in that seat, guys are gonna want to come play,” Johnson said. “Because I know business. I know how to win.”
As the plot thickened 2,500 miles away, Lakers Coach Luke Walton endured another set of questions about Johnson's latest declarations both during shoot-around and before the Lakers played the Kings.
What did Walton think about Johnson's wanting to involve Bryant?
Walton said he's spoken to Bryant for advice since becoming the Lakers coach, but hasn't thought much about the former player's involvement beyond that.
“I'm focused on coaching these guys and where we're at, and then when the time comes, Magic and I will sit down and talk,” Walton said. “People send me articles, but most of the time and effort is focused here. When someone sends me something, I'll look at it.”
Coaching is one department in which Johnson has repeatedly said he would not meddle. He tried coaching once, and didn't like it.
Very little else seems certain about his new role.

At the Dubai Motor Show last month, W Motors showed off its Fenyr SuperSport concept, promising the production version was coming soon. A few days ago, it released the video below, showing off the Fenyr SuperSport in production form. Well, at least in production CGI form.
W Motors also held a private reveal party that it documented on its Instagram page. As you can see, the design of the SuperSport is about as subtle as a brick to the face. If you want an attention-grabbing supercar, this might be the perfect car for you.
The brand-new @wmotors Fenyr SuperSport was unveiled in its production trim tonight at the new W Motors Gallery in Dubai ???? A post shared by W Motors Official Account (@wmotors) on Nov 29, 2017 at 7:40am PST
Out back, the SuperSport gets even more aggressive styling. You can see a little bit of Acura NSX in there, but compared to the SuperSport, the NSX is dull and practically invisible.
The brand-new @wmotors Fenyr SuperSport, what are you thoughts on the second creation signed by our team? ???? #WMotors #Fenyr #SuperSport A post shared by W Motors Official Account (@wmotors) on Nov 29, 2017 at 7:43am PST
Under the hood is a Porsche-sourced 4.0-liter flat-six that RUF tuned to make a tire-roasting 900 hp and 885 lb-ft of torque. Paired with a dual-clutch transmission, W Motors claims it can hit 60 mph in 2.7 seconds and has a top speed of 249 mph. To keep the weight down to only 2,645 pounds, the Fenyr SuperSport has a tubular aluminum chassis and a carbon-composite body. When it comes time to stop, there are 16.5-inch carbon-ceramic brakes with six-piston calipers.
Welcome to the new wolf in the family ???? #WMotors #Fenyr #SuperSport A post shared by W Motors Official Account (@wmotors) on Nov 29, 2017 at 8:15am PST
With a starting price of $1.9 million, the Fenyr SuperSport won't be cheap, but only 25 will be built, so there won't be many to go around. Then again, compared to W Motors' previous car, the Lykan HyperSport, this is the affordable, mass-production model. Only seven Lykans were ever built, each with a starting price around $3.4 million.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's consumer inflation is expected to have picked up in July after easing for three straight months, with food prices back on the rise, but is expected to remain well below the central bank's target.
The consumer price index, the main policy target of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), likely rose 1.87 percent in July from a year earlier, according to a Reuters poll of economists, compared with an increase of 1.54 percent in June.
The wholesale price index likely rose 1.3 percent in July, after four months of easing. In June, WPI rose 0.9 percent.
The wholesale price data will be released around 0630 GMT on Monday, followed by consumer prices around 1200 GMT.
Bountiful monsoon rains this year are expected to lead to another bumper harvest, further dampening food prices, which contribute near 50 percent of the consumer price index.
Retail food prices had contracted for two months through June from a year earlier.
RBI UNDER PRESSURE
Disinflationary pressures allowed the RBI to cut its main policy rate early this month by 25 basis points to 6 percent, the lowest since November 2010.

It was the first easing by an Asian central bank this year. But the RBI retained its "neutral stance" and warned inflation could pick up again.
The RBI expects retail inflation could accelerate to 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent in October-December..
The government called on Friday for more rate cuts as it flagged risks to economic growth and budget targets.

In his mid-year economic survey, Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian said there were downside risks to the official growth forecast of 6.75-7.5 percent for the fiscal year to March 2018.
India's industrial output unexpectedly contracted 0.1 percent in June from a year earlier, data showed on Friday.
The launch of a national Goods and Services Tax (GST) in July has caused chaos on the ground as complex rules have left companies confused on how to price their products.
Combined factory and service sector activity slumped in July to the lowest since March 2009, according to one private survey, though analysts believe the disruptions from the new tax will start to moderate soon and longer-term it will boost domestic trade.
Economists still expect the RBI could cut policy rates by 25-50 basis points this year.
In his report, Subramanian said there was a considerable scope for monetary easing as the inflation was undergoing a "structural shift."
An overbridge collapsed at a railway station in Mumbai's suburban Andheri area on Tuesday morning, halting local train services and throwing normal life out of gear. A day later, the city's newspapers were scathing in their coverage of the incident, with the civic administration and state government coming in for particular criticism.
Railway Minister Piyush Goyal, addressing the media later in the day, announced that over the next six months, a joint safety audit would be conducted by the railways, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Mumbai, whereby 445 road overbridges, foot overbridges and bridges over pipelines in the city would be analysed.
But while the government is planning another safety audit, the previous one had given a clean chit to the Andheri bridge. This was reported by The Times of India in a report titled 'Andheri over-bridge is safe, said audit report of Nov 2017'. The report quoted a former railway board official as saying corrosion in the steel structure in the pedestrian portion may have weakened it, leading to the collapse.
"If there is corrosion of 3 millimetres in steel with a 5 millimetre gauge, the strength is substantially reduced," the official said. "The BMC is also to be blamed as it is quick to attend potholes on the road portion but neglects any damage to the surface on the pedestrian portion. Even if one tile is missing, water seeps into the bridge structure and corrodes steel."
"The passing of heavy cables could also have caused tension to this portion of the bridge," a Western Railway official was quoted as saying in the report, while another official said, "The bridge is designed to carry 1,000 passengers, so it is not possible the portion will give way because of cables."
Indeed, social media users had also highlighted the poor state of the bridge. Twitter used Vishal Tandel took to Twitter to highlight the cracks on the Andheri ROB as far back as September 2017.

What's more, the Western Railways had even noticed this and responded to it by asking the divisional railway manager to respond to Tandel's tweet.
Meanwhile, the blame game between the BMC and the railways has also begun, the publication reported. In an article titled 'BMC passes the buck, says rlys to blame', The Times of India quoted Mumbai mayor Vishwanath Mahadeshwar as saying the civic body was not responsible for the incident, while additional municipal commissioner Vijay Singhal pointing out that repair and construction on railway premises are undertaken by railways. "We only pay the funds for maintenance," he said.
He also added that since 2015-16, they had given Central Railway Rs 93 crore and Western Railway Rs 11 crore for reconstruction and maintenance of all road-over bridges.
Motorman Chandrashekhar Sawant came in for special praise after he applied the emergency brakes on a Churchgate-bound train barely 55 metres away from the spot where the accident occurred. He was paid a Rs 5 lakh compensation for his quick thinking. The Indian Express covered the news in an article titled 'Union railway minister Piyush Goyal Rs 5 lakh award for motorman'.
"There was a difference of hardly four minutes between the train that had passed before and mine. At 7.30 am, I was driving at a speed of 50 kmph. A part of my train could have been under the debris. By God's grace, I applied brakes and averted a disaster… As soon as I applied the brakes, I alerted my guard, station master and the control room," he was quoted as saying.
In all the doom and gloom, however, there was a tiny silver lining. At least for students in city schools and colleges who got the day off. And university students who couldn't give their exams because they were stranded have been given the option of re-exams, a report on Mumbai Mirror said. "Six theory and three practical exams were scheduled for Tuesday. The University of Mumbai (MU) said the exams continued as per schedule, but for students who were stranded, a new timetable will be announced soon," it said.
With inputs from PTI
Though you haven't seen him in net much for the Detroit Red Wings this season, Petr Mrazek is a key player in the immediate future of the organization. His impact could either accelerate the rebuilding process or set the Red Wings back, depending on what they do with the netminder.
Detroit's crease has belonged to veteran goalie Jimmy Howard through the first third of the 2017-18 season. Mrazek has only started seven games this year and replaced Howard in three others, producing subpar numbers (3.72 GAA, .888 SV%). Mrazek really only had two quality outings under his belt – a shutout of the Edmonton Oilers and an overtime loss to the Washington Capitals. On the other hand, his start against the Montreal Canadiens may have been the worst of his career.
He's also a restricted free agent at season's end.
With the Red Wings already possessing a number of bad contracts, they have a difficult decision to make regarding Mrazek, once the franchise's goalie of the future.
Mrazek's Current Contract
Looking back to the summer of 2016, Mrazek had just come off of a breakthrough campaign where he seized the Red Wings' number-one goaltender job. And though he struggled down the stretch, Detroit ultimately gave Mrazek the final three starts of their first-round loss to the Tampa Bay Lightning.
When it came time to negotiate Mrazek's next contract that summer, the netminder and his representation held firm on their beliefs that Mrazek should be paid like a budding star. The evidence, for the most part, pointed that way. So after intense negotiations, the two sides arrived at a two-year, $8 million contract the morning before Mrazek's scheduled arbitration meeting.
The ball was then in Mrazek's court, as the anointed starting goalie, to make good on Detroit's investment in him.
Red Wings & Mrazek's Decline
Since the start of the 2016-17 season, the Red Wings have looked like a different team than the once-dominant franchise we're used to seeing. Subpar team defense and a lack of scoring certainly contributed to that. Mrazek's play also hasn't helped.
Though he has had some flashes of brilliance, Mrazek's numbers and play have definitely declined. Over the past 60 games, Mrazek has only won 20 contests. Again, defense and scoring woes can be blamed, but the netminder's goaltending issues persist. He has trouble seeing through screens, loses his angles easily, and gives up far too many rebounds for a less-than-optimal defense to manage. These are deficiencies that date back to the 2015-16 season.
However, there is still time to recover.
Finishing Strong
As we've seen with Howard and Chris Osgood in the past, goaltenders can alter their game to maximize their strengths and resolve their weaknesses. Howard, in particular, has really emphasized improving his skating over the past few seasons and found a new, better way to approach games mentally. It's been clear that these adjustments have worked, with Howard producing All-Star-like numbers over the past two seasons.
Mrazek can do the same. He has the raw ability to be a fantastic goaltender in the NHL. His strong lateral movement, lightning-quick reflexes, and never-give-up attitude are indications of that. It's up to Mrazek and goaltending coach Jeff Salajko to round out those rough edges through the rest of the 2017-18 campaign. If he can do that and continue his progress over the summer, Mrazek will have turned his young career around.
So what do Ken Holland and the Red Wings do?
Next Step for the Red Wings & Mrazek
First of all, there's no chance the Red Wings decide to non-tender Mrazek. No general manager would let an NHL asset—in this case, one with greater potential—walk away from team control with nothing in return other than added cap space.
Making $4.15 million in salary this year ($4-million cap hit), Mrazek will likely want a raise this summer. Who wouldn't? But considering Mrazek's play and the fact that Andrei Vasilevskiy, Matt Murray, John Gibson, and Martin Jones have lower cap hits than his present contract, a raise will be hard to come by. Nevertheless, it will be discussed before or once the Red Wings and their goaltender reach arbitration.
On Holland's side, the Red Wings really won't have much cap space to work with this summer after Anthony Mantha, Dylan Larkin, and Andreas Athanasiou are re-signed. Detroit's GM will also have to consider that Howard's contract and $5 million-plus cap hit come off the books at the end of next season. And considering that Howard will be 35 then, there's a good chance Detroit will want to either move on or reduce his role.
If Holland decides that he can't afford Mrazek's demands, he could look to trade the goaltender to a goalie-needy team this season or around the 2018 NHL Draft. Moving Mrazek for prospects and/or picks would assist the rebuilding process and the free agent market is somewhat deep if you're looking for a backup goalie.
Trading Mrazek does come with drawbacks though. The Czech netminder is a prime candidate for a bounce-back season in the right environment. He's a talented goalie that another coach could mold into a true starter. A Mrazek resurgence with another team would make Holland and the Red Wings organization look bad for giving up on a young, quality player at a point when his value is at the lowest of lows. Plus, relying on an aging Howard and a free-agent backup, with no NHL-ready prospect on the horizon, is not an ideal approach.
Final Word
Operating in the last year of his contract, Holland must decide whether to make adjustments while under contract or leave that for the summer, when someone else could be calling the shots. Of course, this all becomes null and void if Mrazek gets on a roll and reclaims the starting job. So until the Red Wings and Holland make a decision, Mrazek controls his own fate.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Thieves have broken into the offices of South Africa's Competition Commission, making off with laptop computers, the watchdog said on Saturday. It is the latest in a series of high-profile burglaries targeting law enforcement bodies.
"There has been a security breach at the offices of the Competition Commission. Two laptops were stolen on Tuesday from the division responsible for investigations into cartel conduct," head of communications Sipho Ngwema said in a statement.
The break-in came a few weeks after thieves stole two laptops from the state prosecutors' offices.
The Competition Commission is responsible for investigating issues including cartel conduct and mergers and acquisitions, before bringing them to the Competition Tribunal for adjudication.
The case has been transferred to South Africa's elite Hawks police unit for further investigation, Ngwema said.
"The Commission has taken the necessary measures and safeguards to enhance security," he added.
Reuters could not immediately contact the Hawks for comment.
In July, burglars stole hard drives and other computer equipment from the Hawks. In March, 15 computers containing information on South Africa's judges and court officials were stolen from the administrative offices of the Chief Justice.

Samsung Electronics announced Thursday that it has begun mass production of 64-layer, 256-Gigabit V-NAND flash memory chips and will apply the cutting-edge chips to the company's whole lineup of storage solutions for servers, PCs and mobile applications.Samsung had been producing the latest V-NAND chips for a limited number of customers since January, but the company had not made it public in order to gauge real demand accurately and first secure its production capacity.To gain a competitive edge in the memory market, Samsung intends to expand production of the fourth-generation V-NAND chips to above 50 percent of its monthly NAND production by the end of the year, the company said.The South Korean tech titan is set to start operating a newly built semiconductor plant in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, in late June, and the plant is highly expected to be a production hub for the 64-layer V-NAND chips, according to industry sources.The Samsung 64-layer 3-bit 256 Gb V-NAND features a data transfer speed of 1 gigabits per second, which is the fastest among currently available NAND flash memory. The new 64-layer V-NAND provides more than a 30 percent productivity gain compared to the 48-layer 256Gb V-NAND that preceded it.“We will keep developing next-generation V-NAND products in sync with the global IT industry so that we can contribute to the timeliest launches of new systems and services, in bringing a higher level of satisfaction to consumers,” said Kye Hyun-kyung, executive vice president of the flash product and technology team at Samsung Electronics.By Song Su-hyun (song@heraldcorp.com)
It rained buckets on Saturday at the Edge of the World Music Festival, but by nightfall the Tlell sky was clear enough to see a few shooting stars above all the ones rocking out on stage.

CHAZ Davies tasted glory with a podium finish in the 11th round of the World Superbike Championship (WSBK) at Magny Cours last weekend.
Victory in race two in France represented the Aruba.it's Racing - Ducati team its eighth overall win of the season.
Meanwhile victory ensured the Presteigne star kept alive his bid to claim second place in the overall championship with two rounds remaining.
Davies endured a frustrating start to the weekend and despite racing to second place on race one his challenge would be undermined by electrical, braking and acceleration issues culminating in a disappointing 10th place finish.
However Davies hit back in race two to claim the 27th win of his career.
Davies set the pace from the start, establishing a five second gap on his closest challenger to cross the line with full points and bring his tally for the campaign to 327 points to remain in third overall
The Aruba.it's Racing - Ducati team will resume action at Jerez de la Frontera in Spain in the penultimate round of the championship on October 20-22.
Davies said: “Sunday's race was the best way to put behind us a couple of tough races. I woke up feeling really motivated and I think it showed in the opening laps, as I was making passes and got to the front pretty quickly from 11th position.
“It wasn't an easy race though. The rain was on and off throughout, and it was hard to tell where the wet patches could be. It was a matter of pushing hard but not too much, just enough to keep the gap in check, and that's what we did.
“Now we're looking forward to the last two races, the hunt for second position in the championship is still open and we can be fast both in Jerez and Qatar.”
As the days get warmer, the risk of fire is also increasing in the province – currently, most of Nova Scotia is under burn restrictions, but one meteorologist says it doesn't mean it can be predicted just yet.
READ MORE: Warmer summer 2017 forecast means higher risk of forest fires in Canada
Mike Flannigan, a meteorologist and professor in the University of Alberta's Renewable Resources Department told The Canadian Press that if the forecast is right, we're in for a warmer than normal summer, which will “probably” mean more fires.
But Ian Folkins, an atmospheric scientist at Dalhousie University, believes it's too soon to make the same prediction for Nova Scotia.
“One reason is it's a bit too early for the seasonal forecast for the summer to really have much accuracy for our area at this point,” Folkins said in an interview with Global News. “And the other reason is we don't have as many forest fires in Nova Scotia, typically, as the West do. Our rain is more reliable than in parts of the West.”
Folkins said that predicting the summer's weather in Nova Scotia is “rolling dice at this point.”
Under current burn restrictions, burning is allowed between 7 p.m. and 8 a.m. the following day.

The federal government has made money available to help dozens of California counties recover from a series of deadly storms that triggered floods, mudslides and avalanches statewide last month.
From Jan. 3 to 12, the state was pounded by a series of storms that buried the Sierra Nevada in snow and inundated low-lying towns along the Sacramento and Russian rivers. Several people died in weather-related incidents while a number of hillsides collapsed and closed off mountain passes.
Ultimately, 34 counties and the Hoopa Valley tribe sought federal assistance, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said. On Tuesday, the agency announced that up to 75% of the recovery costs could be covered by federal funds with additional assistance potentially available to prevent further damage.
More rain clouds are on the horizon.
A series of rainstorms are expected to arrive in the Sacramento Valley late Wednesday that could drop up to three inches of rain in the valley and eight inches in the mountains by the end of the week, the National Weather Service said.
The Sacramento River, which reached flood stage last week following a recent storm, is again expected to exceed its capacity on Thursday, according to the California Nevada River Forecast Center. Recreational activities along the river have been prohibited and the Shasta County Sheriff's Office was closed Tuesday and Wednesday due to flooding.
Another storm is lined up for Monday, forecasters say.
California is experiencing one of its wettest years on record with more than a month left in its traditional rainy season. The months of rain, preceded by more than five years of dry conditions, have pulled Northern California out of drought conditions and made a dent in Southern California's drought.

Jose Mourinho rules out move for striker in January; says losing Zlatan Ibrahimovic would be a ‘disaster'
Mourinho is happy with his current crop of players.
by rohitgeorge News 02 Jan 2017, 15:56 IST
Ibrahimovic has been in sensational form recently
What's the story?
Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho has said that he has no plans to sign a new striker in the ongoing January transfer window, and also stated that any serious injury to talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic would be a ‘disaster' for the club.
Mourinho was quoted as saying by the Daily Mail, “I know we've a lot of competitions to play but where is the striker to come here with that quality to play for United? Where is that striker, where is the club who can let him come? That's not something for the January market; it's probably something for the summer.”
In case you didn't know...
Traditionally the January transfer window has been predominantly used by struggling teams in a bid to reverse their fortunes. This also implies that the best players aren't always available at the beginning of the year; which also explains the reluctance on the part of the bigger teams to spend their resources during the ongoing window.
The lack of quality players available in the ongoing transfer market, as compared to the summer window is the main reason why Mourinho is not interested in signing anyone at the moment.
Good performances from Manchester United so far this season, haven't always ensured favourable results, with the team dropping points from winning positions on more than one occasion.
Also read: "Listen to me, not your agent," Mourinho tells sparkling Martial
However, things have been looking a whole lot better for them of late with a run of five wins in their last five Premier Leagues games ensuring Mourinho's men head into 2017 with renewed optimism.
Ibrahimovic acknowledged the fact that United are heading in the right direction and hopes that they can carry on their winning momentum for as long as possible. “Hopefully, we can continue with this winning streak. We are all going in the same direction where we want to win, but you need to win the games and work hard and that's what we are doing.”
The heart of the matter
Zlatan Ibrahimovic has been in fine form for United since his summer move from PSG and is currently the side's top scorer with 12 goals, and three assists to go with it.
Not only has he hit the ground running at the age of 35 in the Premier League, the big Swede has also claimed to have sprinkled some of his magic on Henrikh Mkhitaryan.
The Armenian struggled to find a place in Mourinho's starting line-up in the early stages of the season, but has been on a resurgent run of late and most notably, marked United's Boxing Day victory over Sunderland with a stunning scorpion kick goal.
Now, Zlatan has cheekily suggested that Mkhitaryan's memorable goal was a product of watching him! Zlatan told ESPN, “You know when you have a good student, you always learn, that's exactly what I have in Mickey, He has been a good example, learning from Ibra-cadabra, so I'm happy for him.”
The pair has formed a formidable partnership since their summer moves to Old Trafford and was once again in the thick of things as United marked Sir Alex Ferguson's 75th birthday on Saturday, with a trademark comeback win over Middlesbrough at Old Trafford.
What next?
Although Zlatan has been in red hot form of late, Mourinho will most likely give his talisman a break sooner rather than later, given that he has never experienced such a clutter of fixtures before.
Having started all of the festive fixtures, so far, it'll be interesting to see whether or not Ibrahimovic is in the playing eleven for tonight's visit to West Ham United. Further, even if the Swede does start the game, he will most probably be rested for Saturday's FA Cup encounter at home to Reading.
Sportskeeda's take
Ibrahimovic had many doubters following his summer move to Manchester United, however, he has managed to silence his detractors with some splendid performances. More importantly, the 35-year-old's contributions have been indispensable to United's resurgent run of late.
In fact, the Swede's performance in front of goal is one of the main reasons why United are still in with a chance of a top-four finish. Therefore, it is not surprising that Jose Mourinho fears losing his No. 9 to injury.
As far as Mourinho's January transfer plans are concerned, his unwillingness to sign players is perfectly justified given that he has the likes of Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford as cover for Ibrahimovic, should the Swede pick up an injury.
But perhaps most importantly, Mourinho seems to have discovered his best starting line-up of which Zlatan is a vital cog; and given that the Red Devils are in the midst of a winning streak, there is no need to ring the changes.
Thank you thank you @cyndilauper and all of your band and all of your team and everyone who was a part of making tonight's Home For The Holidays #truecolorsfund benefit show happen. What an absolutely surreal and fun experience! Also thank you @the_citylion for filming this footage!

Color is looking to add a new test to its line of genetic testing, this time focusing on hereditary factors that may affect a person's chance for being prone to cardiovascular complications like arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy.
Called the heart health test, Color's new test looks to isolate the genes that can be partially responsible for heart-related conditions that may have a hereditary component. Color says the test analyzes 30 genes that contribute to the structure and rhythm of a healthy heart to determine if there may be any hereditary factors that could lead to heart complications down the line. VP of clinical operations Scott Topper acknowledged that hereditary factors certainly aren't the only factors that might play into cardiovascular complications like arrhythmia, but there has been enough research to show that the potential hereditary genetic components that lead to those conditions is impactful enough to warrant building a test for those markers.
“Some of these conditions are relatively rare, and for most of them we expect the actual incidence to be about 1 in 200,” Topper said. “But what that means is, if we handle 1,000 people this week, we expect 5 of them to be affected by this. For those 5, the consequences of it going undetected, can be as extreme as sudden death. While thought they're rare, they incredibly impactful. It's not a 100% predictive — For BRCA for example, we know that a woman who has a BRCA mutation has about an 80% chance of getting breast cancer in their lifetime and getting again and again. It's not 100%, but it's a profound enough likelihood that many people decide to take action.”
Color looks to target genes that the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics identified as high-impact and actionable. The end product is to see, if there is a mutation in one of those genes, there may be a possibility that the person is at higher risk for cardiovascular problems like cardiomyopathy or arrhythmia. There isn't full penetrance — just like there isn't in the BRCA test — so it's more of a ‘heads up, go get it checked out just in case' situation.
Color, previously Color Genomics, is one of a few well-funded genetic testing startups that aim to make it easier for consumers to get tested for potential complications down the line where they can take some preventative steps. In the case of this test, the goal is to flag any potential risk and then have them follow up with clinicians to determine if there are any lifestyle changes that need to happen. Consumers take a swab of saliva and send off the test — either for a few hundred bucks, or through a program that some employers are putting in place. Color raised $80 million in a financing round in August last year.
The latter part of that, employers getting into issuing these tests for their employees, is going to be increasingly important for Color. Catching diseases early helps reduce the overall cost to employers before more problems occur. While Color has largely focused on the cancer space with tests for detecting genes that are associated with higher risk of breast cancer, it started branching into tests for potential cardiovascular problems like Hypercholesterolemia. That test, launched in August last year, costs $249 for a direct purchase for a consumer.
To be sure, the average customer is giving up their genetic data in order to get tested for these potential hereditary conditions, a password that you'll (probably) never be able to change. As more and more of these tests become available, there's a good chance it'll attract a new segment of customers — those that are looking to head off complications based on what's happened to family members, or even those who are just curious about whether or not they have risk. Topper said many at Color come from a tech-native background from companies like Google, Twitter, and Dropbox, and it's something that's perpetually top-of-mind. (Though, to be sure, it's a very tall order.)
“We've put a good deal of effort on the back-end informatics side to make sure our systems are very developed and robust,” Topper said. “It's not something that comes easy, I think a lot of health companies back into this and realize after the fact that there's a substantial computer engineering aspect to being able to do this responsibly”
There is still a lot of activity in this space, including at the actual financing level. 23andMe, another genetic testing startup, raised $250 million in new financing last year. And as the research matures, it's always possible that other companies may want to branch into a similar area — finding spots that might represent some risk for heart conditions. Topper said the company still expects to continue to look for examples where the condition affects a lot of people and that some portion is driven by genetics, and that a lot of players in the space is generally going to be a good thing simply because it will help further the progress on that front.
“We are living in good times for genetics, primarily because of a number of really important consensus-driven efforts around looking at the clinical validity and clinical utility of genetic information,” he said. “None of this happens in a silo. Being able to both move the field forward in terms of making information available and gleaning knowledge, as well as being a good citizen in a space that's moving quickly, are both very important to us. I feel like there's a cultural change in terms of where genetics fits into our society. As long as other companies are doing it responsibly, it's also good.”

On Tuesday, Jan. 10, from 5-7 p.m. the Ronceverte Public Library will offer an Embroidery Class teaching the basics of “Chicken Scratches.”
Although the class itself is free, there will be a fee of $10 for materials used in the class. The fee includes an embroidery hoop, two needles, two skeins of coordinating embroidery thread, and a 10” piece of gingham.
The class will introduce participants to a beautiful and easy way to add something special to their home or to give as a gift. This type of embroidery may also be referred to as cross stitch on gingham and depression lace. Chicken Scratch embroidery has been around a very long time. According to the website, Needle & Thread, “There are extant examples of embroidery on gingham from as early as the 1800s. Although it was made more widely popular during the first half of the 1900s, especially during The Great Depression, because it was an inexpensive and simple way to decorate gingham fabric.” (www.needlenthread.com/2014/04/chicken-scratch-gingham-embroidery-index.html)
The library will be offering a Chicken Scratch Embroidery Part 2 for those participants who wish to continue learning.
Call the Ronceverte Public Library for more information at 304-647-7400 or stop by the library at 120 Main Street W., Ronceverte, during regular library hours. Sign-up can be done by phone or in person.
MONDAY, March 19, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- For some people, dieting is easier with emotional support.
In fact, research done at the University of Pennsylvania concluded that participating in diet programs focused on behavior modification may be more effective than going it alone when the sessions provide information, support and the accountability of weigh-ins. Other research found that this is true even for people who think that they prefer one-on-one help or no help at all.
Weight-loss success often depends on changing habits, like gaining control over emotional eating and recognizing other cues that prompt you to reach for food. These behavior-modification changes are typically taught in group sessions at weight-loss programs. These changes may be even more important for weight loss than the specifics of any diet.
One study found concrete proof: After about a year, dieters in a popular group program lost more weight than solo dieters. For some, it was more than 10 percent of their starting weight, which, from a health perspective, is a meaningful amount.
Even with travel and registration fees, a program can be cost effective, though with some legwork, you might be able to find some with a very affordable or no sign-up cost.
Support groups are offered in medical centers, workplaces, your local Y and commercial weight-loss centers. Look for programs that provide regular weigh-ins for accountability; diet and exercise advice; motivation; and group support. Other bells and whistles might be round-the-clock online advice and even group video sessions you can participate in from home.
You might also want a group leader with a degree in nutrition or psychology, because of the additional expertise in understanding why people eat and how to change habits.
If you're unsure how to start your search or how to choose one program over another, ask your health care provider for guidance.

When Lincoln showed off the new Navigator concept, we were impressed by both the look and the luxurious interior. But looking at the huge gullwing doors and retractable steps, we had to wonder how much would change by the time the new Navigator went into production. After our First Drive, however, we came away so impressed we went so far as to call the 2018 Lincoln Navigator “a serious contender for class leader.” The question then became whether or not it would sell. As it turns out, the answer is yes.
CNBC reports that since the new Navigator went on sale last November, Lincoln has actually struggled to keep up with demand. Granted, U.S. sales have yet to top 1,500 per month, but full-size luxury SUVs sell in pretty limited numbers across the board. Plus, Navigator sales were up a whopping 97.5 percent year-over-year last month, jumping from 652 to 1,288.
“We could have sold a lot more in January if we had had them,” said Mark LaNeve, Lincoln's head of marketing and sales.
When you break it down by trim level, Navigator sales actually look even more impressive. Base versions start at $73,250, but 84 percent of buyers choose either the Reserve or Black Label trim. The former costs $82,400, while the latter will run you $94,900 before options. That means that not only are Navigator sales up, most of those sales were loaded or nearly loaded models.
The Cadillac Escalade is currently the segment's top seller, but as analyst Rebecca Lindland told CNBC, Cadillac had better watch out. “The previous Navigator was fine, but it was nothing like this. This is a really gorgeous truck,” she said. “Cadillac had owned that spot for years, and now Ford has come in and is a fierce competitor.”
From the sound of things, if Lincoln can find a way to increase production, the Navigator might do more than steal Escalade sales. In a few years, it might even be in a position to knock the Escalade off its sales throne.

A 70-year-old man was killed Sunday afternoon after he was struck by a boat propeller while swimming in Newport Beach, officials said.
A group of friends, including the man, had taken the boat about a half-mile from the harbor when some entered the water, said Orange County Sheriff's Sgt. Neil Hove.
Lt. Steve Gil told the Orange County Register that someone backed the boat toward the man to help him get back in more quickly when he was struck.
Passengers pulled the man, who was not identified, back into the boat before returning to the harbor.
Some attempted to perform CPR, Gil told the paper.
Paramedics with the Orange County Fire Authority responded to the harbor, where they pronounced the man dead, Hove said.
Police did not cite or arrest anyone, he added. The investigation is ongoing.

Pupils in Eilean Siar who gained National 5 qualifications in fourth year of school are higher than the national average.
Of exams sat 85.98 per cent achieved National 5 in Eilean Siar whereas the national pass rate was 79.5 per cent.
Percentage passes at Higher are in line with the national pass rate. 77.75 per cent in Eilean Siar achieved an A-C pass, compared with 77 per cent nationally.
Overall, there is a slight decrease in the numbers and passes in the senior phase (S4-S6), largely due to increasing numbers who opt for vocational qualifications.
Results show that, at S4 National 5 there were 977 presentations and 85.98 per cent A-C passes in 2017, compared with 1156 presentations and 89.45 per cent passes in 2016.
At S5/6 Higher level (SCQF level 6) there were 944 presentations and 77.75 per cent passes in 2017, compared with 957 presentations and 81.09 per cent passes in 2016.
Advanced Higher (SCQF level 6) results show an increase in the number of presentations, from 92 in 2016 to 101 in 2017. Percentage passes indicate a slight decline from 77.17 per cent in 2016 to 76.24 per cent in 2017.
Across the authority, at all levels, there were 3,096 presentations and 2,583 awards in 2017, representing an 83.43 per cent pass rate, compared with 3,266 presentations, 2,846 awards and a percentage pass rate of 87.14 in 2016.
Officers in the department are currently analysing each school's data to identify areas of under performance which may have contributed to the overall decline.
Figures do not include attainment in vocational courses. National data published in March 2017, indicates that 31.2 per cent of learners in Eilean Siar achieved one or more vocational qualifications at SCQF level 5 or above, representing the highest level in Scotland.
Results will be reported to the Education and Children's Services Committee in September.
The authority said it appreciated the hard work of teaching staff and pupils and would also like to thank administrative staff in schools for their diligence in processing SQA data.

With new rainstorms approaching, the Oroville Dam's two crippled spillways will be put to their biggest test ever. Officials have been frantically trying to repair the emergency spillway, which they feared on Sunday would collapse.

Community leaders running a Hartlepool foodbank operation say they are in desperate need of more supplies due to “significant demand”.
More than 100 people are believed to have used the Family Kitchen at St Aidan's Church in the town.
Thursday morning from 9.30am is the best time to drop stuff off, but the parish office is open between 6pm and 7pm on a Tuesday and I will take stuff in then. Kathrine Batty
The project, while helping to feed those in need of a meal such as the homeless, is open to anyone feeling lonely or in need of some company.
In addition to serving up soup, the gathering offers sandwiches, cake and other sweet treats, hot drinks and juice, with visitors welcome to take home a bag of food.
But the foodbank is now running low on stock and organisers are hoping that kind-hearted town people will come forward to donate items.
Councillor Dave Hunter, who is involved with the project, said: “We always give out food bags to people who come but we are running very low on things at the minute.
“We have significant demand right now and there were well over 100 people there last week.
“We need toiletries, food and even the most basic things in life that we tend to take for granted such as toilet paper.
“Every thing that is donated helps people.”
Church administrator Kathrine Batty said: “We get stock in on Thursday morning and by Thursday evening, it's pretty much all gone.
“Thursday morning from 9.30am is the best time to drop stuff off, but the parish office is open between 6pm and 7pm on a Tuesday and I will take stuff in then. We'd rather not have people popping in and out while services are going on.
“We will take anything but clothes - we had to stop because we had nowhere to store them.
“Greggs and Sainsbury's give us fresh items, so what we really need are tins and dry food, things that will keep.
“We also need toiletries - especially men's toiletries. People tend just to give us women's, but it's men's we need, and things like nappies and sanitary towels.”
As well as the foodbank, St Aidan's also runs a weekly lunch club for the homeless and those in need.
Set up last September by mum Charlotte Randall-Pape and firefighter Mark Shrubb, with the backing of church curate Reverend Gemma Sampson, The Family Kitchen is open to anyone in need of company.
In addition to serving up soup, the gathering offers sandwiches, cake and other treats, hot drinks and juice, with visitors welcome to take home a bag of food.
It runs from 11am each Thursday. To volunteer email: revdgemma@gmail.com.
Feb 2 (Reuters) - METROVACESA IPO BOOKRUNNER:
* ‍ SAYS BOOKS ARE COVERED, PRICE GUIDANCE TO FOLLOW​ Further company coverage:
The latest addition to the Nordstrom roster looks nothing like a department store and more like an exclusive boutique crossed with a hipster coffee and juice bar.
At Nordstrom Local, a 3,000-square-foot, ivy-covered shop on Melrose Place in the Beverly Grove neighborhood, customers can meet with a personal stylist, have clothing tailored, get a manicure and sip a beverage laced with caffeine or alcohol.
Just don't try to browse the racks. Because there aren't any.
Shea Jensen, Nordstorm's senior vice president for customer experience, said the new shop, which is much smaller than the chain's average 140,000-square-foot store, is an experiment emphasizing pampered service and convenience.
“What we are trying to do is bring together the best of our most popular services to a place that is very easy for our customers to access as they are shopping with Nordstrom,” she said.
“Time is a precious commodity and we know that our customers appreciate speed and convenience,” Jensen said. “With Nordstrom Local we are trying to create more accessibility and opportunities.”

Nordstrom's test concept comes as traditional retailers are being battered by the growing popularity of shopping online and at discount mass merchants, which has eroded mall traffic and hurt profit margins.
Wall Street has been chronically disappointed by recent financial reports from the likes of Nordstrom Inc., Macy's Inc., J.C. Penney Co. and other mall merchants.
Some retailers have resorted to bankruptcy protection, including Toys R Us Inc., Payless ShoeSource Inc. and Gymboree Corp. Others have gone out of business, such as Bebe Stores Inc. and Sport Chalet.
Nordstrom, which primarily is found at malls with more expensive stores, has held up better than many other retailers, and members of the Nordstrom family who run the Seattle company have been trying to raise money to take it private. The company operates 121 traditional Nordstrom stores in the U.S. and Canada, 224 Nordstrom Rack discount stores, two Jeffrey boutiques and two clearance stores.
On the same day that Nordstrom Local opened its doors, the company kicked off an opening celebration for its Westfield Century City mall Nordstrom, which was relocated from the Westside Pavilion. Nordstrom is billing the 154,000-square-foot department store as “an updated shopping experience, including new store design concepts and services.”
Time is a precious commodity and we know that our customers appreciate speed and convenience. — Shea Jensen, Nordstrom senior vice president

Retail experts say Nordstrom may be on to something by offering a different, more intimate approach at Nordstrom Local. The retailer is borrowing a page from several trendy e-commerce sites that have opened bricks-and-mortar storefronts as showrooms to try on clothing or to connect with their fan base.
“There's a new term for this, which we call ‘retail-tainment,'” said Lisa Haddock, who teaches marketing, brand management and consumer behavior at San Diego State University and the San Diego campus of the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising.
It's designed to be “a fun, unique, personalized experience,” Haddock said. “A customer can have a glass of wine. She can have her nails done. She can relax. You have to have that kind of interaction to engage the customer and reach them on an emotional level.”
Nordstrom Local is designed around a one-stop shopping approach, Jensen said. Customers who have bought items online can pick up their purchases in the store, make sure they fit and get them altered if they don't.
It's also designed to accommodate Nordstrom's Trunk Club, a personalized service offering designer clothing to customers. Space outside has also been made to accommodate curbside pickups.

Stylists meet with clients near dressing rooms with living room-style furniture for family and friends. Some of the spaces can be made even more private by drawing curtains, like fashion emergency rooms.
Although Nordstrom Local lacks the deep inventory of a traditional store, there is a bar stocked with wine, beer, coffee and pressed juice. The Nail Bar offers an array of manicure services, including nail art.
Cory Goldstein, a marriage and family therapist, decided to drop in and get her nails done.
“This whole place is just so cool, one-stop shopping for the millennial in me,” Goldstein, 30, said.
“I think I definitely will be coming back here to buy clothing in the future,” she said. “It can be anticlimactic to shop online and get a delivery at home without the benefit of having someone's opinion of how it looks on you.”

Homemaker Jennifer Golfman sat down with a personal stylist for an initial consultation, saying she has had trouble buying clothes online and then having to return them for various reasons.
“As a mom with two young children, as much as I love shopping, I have no time. I have been shopping online a lot and it's hard when you don't know how it's going to look and how it's going to fit,” Golfman said.
Stephanie Chu, a 20-year-old USC accounting student, said she dropped by for some juice after hearing about the store.
“You can stop in and try a bunch of things on that you have seen online without all of the mall crowds,” Chu said. “I don't want the hassle of having to walk through a bunch of stores and a bunch of people.”

Ahead of Tuesday night's tilt against the Arizona Coyotes, the Edmonton Oilers were still comfortably sitting in a playoff spot as the team sits in third place in the NHL's Pacific Division.
Being in a playoff race is certainly a change for the hockey team that hasn't made it to an NHL postseason since 2006. But despite the Oilers' fortunes changing, GM Peter Chiarelli says the team's roster is unlikely to ahead of the NHL's March 1 trade deadline.

“I really don't want to delve into that market,” Chiarelli told reporters Tuesday, referring to the possibility of trading young players and prospects for older, pending unrestricted free agents who could help a team out in a playoff run. “I think there are areas that we can tinker with – I think the team deserves it based on that they're in the (playoff) conversation.”
Team captain Connor McDavid appeared to be delighted with the approach the Oilers' GM is taking.
“I think it's a real positive,” he said. “I think everyone can feel safe and can find comfort in the GM and management staff believing in us and I think the guys in the room can definitely feel good about that.”
“If we make the playoffs, I'd be ecstatic because it really helps the development of these players to see what a playoff series or two is like,” Chiarelli said of his young squad while reiterating he doesn't plan to sacrifice the team's promising youngsters for an extended playoff run. “I'm not really going to mortgage it heavy this year… from a planning perspective, it doesn't make sense.”
One area the team has dabbled with in an attempt to improve in the past year is in their backup goaltender position. In July, the team signed Jonas Gustavsson to a one-year deal but he has since been sent to the team's AHL affiliate. In January, the team recalled Laurent Brossoit from the minors to take Gustavsson's place.
Brossoit has one win in three games with the Oilers while sporting a respectable 2.80 goals against average and a .919 save percentage. While there are still questions about the position, Chiarelli suggested he is happy to stand pat.
“I haven't given up on L.B. and the coaching staff and I have talked and he's going to get a chance.”
The Oilers could use more secondary scoring as it has relied heavily on McDavid and linemate Leon Draisaitl. However, Chiarelli wouldn't single out players who are underperforming Tuesday.
READ MORE: Edmonton Oilers' Draisaitl helps drive team's success
“We put pucks on net, we don't really get those garbage goals off of rebound,” the GM said while adding the team does “over-pass at times.”
The last time the Oilers took a faceoff in a playoff game was in 2006 during the Stanley Cup finals.
“I don't think we're quite ready to contend for the (Stanley) Cup,” Chiarelli said, adding the future is impossible to predict as the Oilers' 2005-2006 season demonstrated.

“Overall, if you were to ask me at the beginning of the year if we were here at this point, I'd be happy,” he added.

MIRPURKHAS - Farmers Organisation Council (FOC) Sindh has criticised what it called deliberately keeping the representatives of farmers' organisations out of a high- level meeting of Sindh Irrigation and Drainage Authority (SIDA).
The meeting had been held on Monday, and was presided over Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah.
FOC Sindh met here on Tuesday under its Chairman Javed Ahmed Junejo. The meeting was also attended by Malik Imran, Liaqat Kaim Khani, Rahim Shar, Abdus Salam, Imamuddin Maher, Muhammad Khan Marri, Gul Siddique Pathan and others. FOC members termed it a deep conspiracy against the farmers, discussed the situation and took some important decisions. They alleged that farmers' bodies of Nara canal area water board, left bank and Ghotki area water board were not invited to the SIDA meeting deliberately. Speaking on the occasion, Javed Ahmed Junejo said that farmers' organisations had played key role in the formation of SIDA, but SIDA still preferred to bypass them. He alleged that representatives of farmers were not invited to the meeting because SIDA want to constitute a fake committee. The meeting demanded the CM to immediately disband the committee of SIDA and give an opportunity to the farmers to expose the corruption of concerned officers.
The participants also expressed deep concern over delay in the lining work of West Jamrao Canal and gross irregularities in lining work of Digri Shakh.
They lamented that the growers were being destroyed by not releasing the water into canals.
Yangon: Myanmar police say they have arrested a mentally ill man who confessed to tossing a petrol bomb into the Yangon compound of de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi this week.
Suu Kyi was not home when the crude bomb landed inside the gate of her lakeside villa on Thursday, causing little damage other than a fire that burned a water pipe.
But the incident unnerved supporters of the Nobel laureate, who championed Myanmar's democratic transition but has suffered a fallout with the international community over her failure to condemn army abuses against Rohingya Muslims.
Using photos taken by a witness of the attack, officers arrested Win Naing, 48, in the early hours of Friday, according to a report posted on Yangon police's official
Facebook page.
"He confessed that he took a bottle filled with petrol...and threw it into the compound," the report said, adding that Win Naing does a security job for a construction
company.
Police said they believe Win Naing has "mental health problems" but will continue to take legal action against him.
He told officers that he was motivated to throw the bomb because he had been "cursed by magic", the police report said.
Suu Kyi has not commented on the incident, which took place almost exactly one year after the assassination of one of her top legal advisors Ko Ni.
Ko Ni, one of few Muslims to hold a prominent government position in mainly Buddhist Myanmar, was shot in the head as he waited outside Yangon airport while holding his grandson.
The murder horrified the Muslim community and the ruling party in particular in a country where political assassinations are rare.
The Grammy Museum and Grammy Foundation today announced that the two organizations are merging in an effort to become, as a statement says, “the leading educational institution dedicated to broadening the historical and cultural significance of music.” The Grammy Museum Foundation will highlight both organizations' initiatives in preservation, education, exhibitions, and public programming.
Scott Goldman, previously vice president of the Foundation and MusiCares, has been appointed executive director of the newly expanded museum. Bob Santelli, the museum's original and previous executive director, will transition into the newly created position of founding executive director, and will focus on market expansion and business strategy and development.
The move was approved earlier this year by The Recording Academy and AEG, under which the Museum was developed as a joint partnership in 2008, as well as by the respective Boards of each organization.
“Both the Grammy Museum and Grammy Foundation have done such truly remarkable work as individual organizations that we started to think about what we could achieve together,” Neil Portnow, President/CEO of The Recording Academy, said in a statement. “This integration will allow us to combine our resources and the expertise of our dedicated staffs to increase the impact of our shared vision: to cultivate a greater understanding of the history and cultural significance of music, inspire its appreciation, and advance its future.”
“We are all very proud of the incredible work that the Grammy Museum and the Grammy Foundation have done to advance the role of music in our culture,” said AEG president/CEO Dan Beckerman. “By joining together, they will have an even greater ability to create innovative exhibits and programs that tell important stories and engage new audiences. We would like to thank Bob Santelli and his team for their hard work over the past 10 years in making the Grammy Museum a world-class institution and we welcome Scott Goldman to the Museum as it begins this important new chapter in its history.”
In addition, the Museum's deputy executive director, Rita George, has been promoted to chief operating officer. Wayne Zahner will serve as chief financial officer and Michael Sticka will serve as controller for the Grammy Museum Foundation.
According to press release, in the past year the Grammy Foundation has provided 20 grants, totaling $300,000, to facilitate a wide range of research, archiving, and preservation projects. Since 2010, the Foundation has awarded more than $1,000,000 in cash grants to more than 600 schools around the country. Since opening, the Museum has curated more than 60 exhibits and hosted more than 650 public programs, including artist interviews, live performances, film screenings, lectures, and continuing education classes.

| ALEXANDRIA, Va.
ALEXANDRIA, Va. A gunman opened fire on Wednesday on Republican U.S. lawmakers practicing near Washington for a charity baseball game, wounding senior Republican leader Steve Scalise and several others before being fatally shot by police.The shooter fired repeatedly with a rifle at the baseball field in Alexandria, Virginia, before being wounded in a gunfight with Capitol Hill police who were at the scene, lawmakers said.Scalise, No. 3 in the House of Representatives Republican leadership, was shot in the hip. He was tended to by fellow lawmakers including Brad Wenstrup, an Ohio congressman who is a physician, before being transported to a hospital.Also wounded were one current congressional staffer and one former staffer. Two Capitol Hill police officers were hospitalized after the incident but it was not clear if both were wounded by gunfire.The gunman, identified by a senior U.S. official as James Hodgkinson from the St. Louis suburb of Belleville, Illinois, died of his injuries. Media reports said Hodgkinson, 66, owned a home inspection business.His social media presence indicated he was strongly opposed to Republicans, including President Donald Trump. Police and the FBI said it was too early to determine a motive in the shooting or whether the attack was an attempted political assassination.Trump announced the gunman's death and called Scalise, a 51-year-old Louisiana congressman, a good friend. Speaking at the White House, Trump said Scalise was "badly injured" but in stable condition and would recover. "He's a patriot and he's a fighter. He will recover from this assault," Trump said.Trump, who has been in office since January, also called for unity at a time of sharp political divides in America, saying, "We are strongest when we are unified and when we work together for the common good."
Hodgkinson had raged against Trump on social media and was a member of many anti-Republican groups on Facebook including "The Road to Hell Is Paved With Republicans," "Terminate The Republican Party," and "Donald Trump is not my President," a search of what appeared to be his profile showed.Some 25 to 30 Republican members of the House and Senate had gathered for an early morning practice a day before the annual charity congressional baseball game pitting Republicans against Democrats, said Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama. The game is scheduled to be played at Nationals Park, home of the Washington Nationals Major League baseball team.Two lawmakers who were at the scene, Representatives Ron DeSantis and Jeff Duncan, indicated there might have been a political motive in the attack.Duncan said that as he left the field the man who would later open fire approached him in the parking lot. "He asked me who was practicing this morning, Republicans or Democrats, and I said. 'That's the Republicans practicing," Duncan told reporters.DeSantis gave a similar account.
Brooks said the shooter said nothing during the rampage.The shooting took place at Eugene Simpson Stadium Park in the Del Ray neighborhood of Alexandria, which is across the Potomac River from Washington. 'HEROISM' OF POLICE
Brooks told CNN that during batting practice he heard a "bam" and then a quick succession of shots and saw the gunman shooting through the holes in a chain link fence.When Scalise was shot he went down on the infield between first and second base, then dragged himself into the grassy outfield as the incident unfolded, leaving a trail of blood, Brooks said.
Two Capitol police officers who were at the scene to provide security for the lawmakers engaged the gunman with pistols, Brooks said, adding both the officers were wounded."But for the Capitol police and the heroism they showed, it could very well have been a large-scale massacre. All we would have had would have been baseball bats versus a rifle. Those aren't good odds," Brooks said.Brooks estimated that there were 50 to 100 shots fired.The shooting was certain to raise again the contentious issue of gun violence in the United States.At a news conference near the scene of the shooting, Virginia's Democratic governor, Terry McAuliffe, urged gun control measures. "This is not what today is about, but there are too many guns on the street," McAuliffe said, citing a statistic that 93 Americans are killed with guns daily.Scalise has been a strong opponent of gun control measures and has earned an "A+" rating from the National Rifle Association - the influential lobby for expanding gun ownership rights. He has co-sponsored legislation to weaken gun control laws in the District of Columbia.Wednesday's incident was the first shooting of a member of the U.S. Congress since January 2011, when Democratic Representative Gabby Giffords was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt at a gathering of her constituents in Tucson, Arizona.She survived, but six people were killed. Giffords resigned from Congress and became an activist for gun restrictions.

LONDON (Reuters) - English Premier League clubs are set to discuss whether to shut the transfer window before the start of the 2018-19 season when they meet next month, British media have reported.
Representatives from the 20 ­top-flight clubs are due to attend ­a shareholders meeting on September 7 with the majority pushing for a new, earlier, transfer deadline to be introduced.
Talks are expected to take place between all the clubs about whether to change the end of the window, which currently closes on Aug. 31 nearly three weeks after the first game.
It will be proposed that the ­transfer deadline is brought forward to the week before the start of the 2018-19 Premier League season, The Daily Telegraph reported on its website.
British media said the majority of Premier League clubs favour an earlier window closure, with the approval of at least 14 of the 20 required for a new rule to be introduced.
Clubs from other European leagues, including Spain and Italy, would be allowed to sign players from England in line with their own domestic deadlines but transfers between Premier League clubs would not be allowed once the season starts.
Swansea City manager Paul Clement, who has left Gylfi Sigurdsson out of the squad having been unsettled by repeated bids from Everton, spoke about the window after Saturday's draw at Southampton in their opening game.
"It would be a better situation if the window closed before the start of the season and then people know that they have got their group for the first game - they are available, they aren't available," Clement told a news conference.
"I know there are talks about changing that for the future and my opinion is that it should be changed. Before the first game you should know who you have got and who you haven't got.
"At our managers' meeting at the Premier League ... we spoke about it. The majority of clubs are in favour, but maybe all have to be for it to go through."
The January transfer window would be unaffected.

LAHORE - The Lahore High Court yesterday ordered three sessions judges to seal three sugar mills owned by Sharif family if these were still functioning in violation of the Supreme Court's order.
A bench headed by Chief Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah passed the order with directions to local police to accompany the judges and ensure the implementation of the order regarding sealing the mills.
The Supreme Court had on Feb 9 barred the mills from operating and remanded the case to the LHC for execution of the order on petition moved by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf's leader Jahangir Khan Tareen.
Barrister Aitzaz Ahsan, the counsel of Jahangir Khan Tareen, appeared in the court and argued that three sugar mills including Chaudhry Sugar Mills Ltd. Rahim Yar Khan, Ittefaq Sugar Mills Bahawalpur, and Haseeb Waqas Sugar Mills Muzaffargarh were still operating despite that the SC had ordered them to stop functioning. It was violation of the court's orders, the counsel said.
At his plea, the bench directed D&SJs of Rahim yar Khan, Bahawalpur and Multan to seal the mills as per the SC orders which was to take effect from Feb 12. The bench also directed the DPOs and RPOs of the concerned areas to accompany the judges for execution of the SC orders. The bench observed that the proceedings of the case would be regularly from Feb 20.
The petitioner had alleged that the Sharif family wanted to establish new mills under the garb of shifting their old mills which was illegal and banned under the relevant policy.
Tom Daley worried his sexuality would stop young people getting involved in diving.
The 24-year-old diver revealed in December 2013 he was in a relationship with another man and his "biggest concern" at the time was a potential negative impact it could have had on his sport.
He admitted: "My biggest concern when I came out was: what would the parents of young divers think? Would they discourage their kids from diving because a high-profile athlete like me was gay? I was so worried."
Shortly after coming out, Tom opted out of competing in Russia because he thought it would be "risky and unsafe" and he's always regretted his decision.
Speaking to ShortList's first-ever Pride issue, he said: "I skipped a competition in Russia in 2014. It was in the wake of my coming out. I thought it was too risky and unsafe. Then, when everyone got back, I really kicked myself for not going. I'd let other people rule by fear, and it weighed really heavily on me."
And even now, Tom - who, along with husband Dustin Lance Black, welcomed son Robert into the world last week via a surrogate - admitted it can still be "scary" competing in certain parts of the world.
He said: "It can be scary going to countries that aren't accepting of LGBTQ+ people. I've competed in the Middle East, Russia, and parts of the Commonwealth, where being gay is punishable.
"I feel extremely lucky being able to compete as I am without worrying about ramifications."
But the sportsman refuses to hide away his sexuality because he wants to set a good example.
He explained: "Small actions have a huge impact. I'm conscious of my platform, so at the World Diving Series in Russia this year I wore a rainbow pin with 'Pride' on it. I wanted people to see it and know I was proud, and that they could feel proud, too."

QUETTA - Balochistan lawmakers on Monday strongly deplored lynching of Mashal Khan, a student of Abdul Wali Khan University Mardan (AWKU), and demanded a strong penalty for the offenders so that no one could even think to commit such offence in future.
The Balochistan Assembly met with Speaker Ms Raheela Hamid Khan Durrani in chair. The Pakhtunkhwa Mili Awami Party (PkMAP) Minister for Education Abdur Rehim Ziaratwal, referring to the lynching incident that took place in AWKU, said it sent a negative message to the whole world.
He urged upon the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government to bring the perpetrators of incident to justice so that such carnage could not be repeated in future.
Nasrullah Zehri, MPA PkMAP, termed the murder of Mashal Khan based on barbarism and savagery. He said allegations of blasphemy leveled against Mashal Khan had no relevance with him. The lawmaker welcomed the notices of premier and Supreme Court into the matter.
Engineer Zmrak Khan, the legislator of Awami National Party (ANP)said all videos available on social media demonstrated that the writ of state was challenged in the incident. He added that neither Islam nor our tribal norms permited such incident.
Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) lawmaker, Sardar Abdul Rehman Kethran, declared Mashal Khan a ‘martyr' who had been killed in cold-blood.
He said no sensible person could watch this lynching video. He flayed the ruling government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa whose leader talked of reforms. Kethran lamented that he had n words to describe and condemn the incident.
Another JUI-F MPA Mufti Gulab Khan Kakar strongly denounced the Mardan incident in harsh words. He added those persons who killed Mashal used the name of Islam and Shariah, but Shariah had no space for such things.
Ubaidullah Jan Babat, PkMAP lawmaker and Adviser to CM for Forests and Livestock, condemning the incident said that the lynching of AWKU student did not happen unexpectedly, but there was well-organised plan behind it.
Presenting the reference of Mashal's interview, that was telecast some seven days before, Ubaidullah Jan said Mashal Khan was demanding reduction in varsity fees and appointment of vice chancellor in AWKU.
He feared that whoever involved in the matter must be brought to justice because reports were circulating that the children of influential persons were providing safe passage.
The National Party (NP) Minister for S&GAD Nawab Muhammad Khan Shahwani also censured the lynching and termed it very dangerous if the powerful groups started procedure of ‘accountability'. He demanded death penalties for the involved.
Other lawmakers also talked on the barbaric incident and demanded harsh punishment for persons involved.
Later on, Speaker Hamid Khan Durrani in his ruling said the lawmakers had expressed deep concern on the killing of Mashal Khan in Abdul Wali Khan University. He said the members expressed views on taking law into hands, extremism and incorrect usage of social media. Speaker added no one can be permitted to violate the rule of law and also declared the inaccurate usage of social media.

Trump branding started with Freud, Letter, June 12
The issue of branding is something to be gravely concerned about. Thanks to critical thinkers like Naomi Klein we can now see more clearly how this contagious issue really does affect all of us.
Letter writer Dr. Mark Leith has done excellent research into the gloomy history of what is euphemistically known as advertising or public relations and he has dug deeply into the roots of the evil of human manipulation for the profit of big business.
But how can we become more aware of the brands that are sold to us, and thus become critical viewers of what we see?
A 51-year-old hunter was knocked unconscious after a dead Canada goose fell from the sky and hit him near the Miles River in Maryland.
Robert Meilhammer was struck by the goose after it was shot by someone in his hunting party early Thursday evening, the Washington Post reported.
He was airlifted to a shock trauma unit in Baltimore with a severe head injury.
READ MORE: German man killed by wild boar he was hunting
Meilhammer was lucky that he was not hunting alone, officials told CBS Baltimore, as his hunting companions were able to get him to a nearby road and seek help.
“These birds weigh anywhere from 10 to probably 14 pounds. They can have a wingspan of up to six feet,” Candy Thomson, public information officer for Maryland Natural Resources Police, told CBS. “So, if they're 35 yards up in the air, and they're falling 60 feet and they hit you in the head, it's going to definitely cause severe damage.”
Meilhammer was said to be in stable condition and recovering in the trauma unit as of Friday night.

Toronto FC's Michael Bradley said Monday that winning the Major League Soccer Cup was the team's “dream” and “obsession” and bringing the Cup to Toronto was why “every single one of us is here.”
MUMBAI — Australia skipper Steve Smith believes a Test series victory over an all-conquering India side on their home soil could provide the kind of memories that would inspire the country's cricketers for generations to come.
Top-ranked India are on a brilliant run, unbeaten in 19 Tests over a 16-month period with South Africa, New Zealand, England and Bangladesh all vanquished at home, while trips to Sri Lanka and West Indies also culminated in victories.
By contrast, Smith's side were thrashed 3-0 in Sri Lanka and lost the first two Tests of a three-match home series against South Africa before wholesale changes led to a consolation win in Adelaide and the new charges went on to sweep aside Pakistan.
Smith believes Australia have learned from those defeats and are now a much improved side.
“You probably learn more from losing games than you do from winning, so I guess the last year has been a bit of a rollercoaster ride in regards to results,” Smith told reporters in Mumbai on Tuesday, a week ahead of the first Test.
“I think this team has come a long way,” he added as he looked forward to the four-match series. Obviously, this is going to be a very difficult tour and I am excited by that challenge. All of the guys are really excited about what's to come in the next six weeks. It's a great challenge to play here in India.
“We know that if we can pull something off and win a series here, we will look back in 10-20 years and it will be some of the best times of our lives. It's a great occasion to play here in India.”
The Australia captain was confident he had the attack to trouble an Indian batting line-up spearheaded by an in-form home skipper Virat Kohli and his bowlers had worked on game plans to succeed on slow, turning wickets.
“I am confident, I think we have got a good mix of bowlers,” Smith said.
“It's important here to make sure you are bowling consistent areas and letting the wicket do the work, and getting the natural variation out of the wickets.
“I think reverse-swing is going to be incredibly important in this series as well. Our two big quicks — Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc — are very good reverse-swing bowlers.
“They relish the challenge of playing against the best players in the world, and India have some incredibly good batters. So they are excited by the challenges of playing here as well.”
The world's second-ranked team have had a training camp in Dubai to prepare for the tour and Australia will also play a three-day practice match against an India A side from Thursday, before they head to Pune for the opening Test from Feb. 23.
Smith said he also needed to maintain a fine balance between attack and defense to find success in India.
“It's about knowing the right periods and timing the periods right when to sort of take the foot off the pedal and to really go hard,” the 27-year-old said.
“I think I have learned a little bit of that in Sri Lanka.”
India unchanged for first two Australia Tests
India have kept faith with the 16-man squad that cruised to victory in the one-off test against Bangladesh for the first two matches of the home series against Australia starting next week.
The world's top-ranked Test side are unbeaten in their last 19 contests and completed a comprehensive 208-run win against their South Asian neighbors on Monday in an ideal warm-up for the four matches to come against Australia.
Fast bowler Mohammed Shami, who missed the last two Tests of the recent five-match series against England with a leg injury, was not considered fit enough for selection to the side named on Tuesday.
Batsman Rohit Sharma, who injured his thigh during the one-day international series against New Zealand in October, only recently resumed training after undergoing surgery in England and was also deemed short of match fitness.
Uncapped left-arm wrist-spinner Kuldeep Yadav replaced injured leg-spinner Amit Mishra in the squad for the Bangladesh Test and he retained his place for the first two Tests against the second-ranked Australians.
Mishra hurt his knee while fielding during India's Twenty20 win over England in Bengaluru on Feb. 1. Pune will make its debut as a Test venue for the series-opener from Feb. 23, before the sides move on to Bengaluru and two more new Test venues in Ranchi and Dharamsala.
Squad: Virat Kohli (captain), Murali Vijay, Lokesh Rahul, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane, Wriddhiman Saha (wicketkeeper), Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Ishant Sharma, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Umesh Yadav, Karun Nair, Jayant Yadav, Kuldeep Yadav, Abhinav Mukund, Hardik Pandya.

GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP)  The University of Florida says it has confirmed Oct. 19 for a speaking event featuring white nationalist Richard Spencer.
UF released a statement Thursday making the previously tentative date official.
The university has repeatedly stated that it will not be affiliated with the event in any way, but as a public institution, UF is legally obligated to allow the expression of many viewpoints by external groups, such as Spencer's National Policy Institute.
The school is charging event costs of about $10,000 for rent and security.

UF previously denied the group's request to hold an event Sept. 12, citing recent violence at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. UF President W. Kent Fuchs said at the time that the First Amendment doesn't require risking a threat of violence to students.

(Adds Previ plans for its stock portfolio)
By Aluisio Alves
RIO DE JANEIRO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Brazilian pension fund Caixa de Previdencia dos Funcionarios do Banco do Brasil, known as Previ, is planning to add healthcare, education and payment processing companies' stocks to its portfolio, Chief Executive Officer Geitiro Genso said on Friday.
The fund, Brazil's largest, is trying to diversify its stocks portfolio and may participate in initial public offerings of Brazilian companies, said Genso in an interview on the sidelines of a pension fund conference.
Around half of the fund's assets are stocks, mostly large stakes in a few companies, such as Vale SA, Banco do Brasil SA and food processor BRF SA.
The fund is looking to add smaller stakes in public companies and gradually reduce its largest stakes, Genso said. Last December, Previ acquired shares of state-owned oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA's fuel distributor, Petrobras Distribuidora SA, when it floated on the local exchange.
Shareholders in power holding company Neoenergia SA , which include Previ, were sticking to plans to list it after it canceled its IPO in December because the shareholders considered its pricing too low, said Genso.
“We will try to list Neoenergia in a better moment,” he said. (Writing by Tatiana Bautzer, editing by G Crosse and Rosalba O‘Brien)
April the Giraffe, who in a few short months became a global media sensation, gave birth to a baby boy on Saturday — drawing a mammoth audience on YouTube to rank among the most-viewed live events ever on the video service.
On Saturday, April 15, the Animal Adventure Park's “Giraffe Cam” channel scored its biggest day, with more than 14 million live views.
A peak of more than 1.2 million people watched April give birth live on Saturday, April 15, at 9:55 a.m. ET on Saturday. That makes it one of the top five most-watched moments for a live event ever on YouTube. However, it was nowhere close to the most-viewed live-streaming event in YouTube's history: That's the Red Bull Stratos space jump by skydiver Felix Baumgartner in October 2012, which more than 8 million people watched live concurrently on YouTube.
Animal Adventure, an educational animal park in Harpursville, N.Y., launched the live-streaming channel for April the Giraffe on Feb. 10, 2017. According to Google, it has rapidly become the second-most live-viewed channel in the history of YouTube, behind only Riot Games' “League of Legends” eSports channel, which launched in 2012.
To date, April's live YouTube channel has received more than 232 million live views and racked up 7.6 billion minutes of live watch-time total. The average time watched has been about 30 minutes across an average of 3.5 million views per day.
YouTube released a chart showing the spike in traffic for April's live birth on Saturday:
In addition, Animal Adventure Park became the fifth-fastest channel to 200 million views, hitting the mark in just 54 days (behind the likes of Lady Gaga and Zayn). It's one of only seven channels to eclipse 100 million live views so far and the fastest to-do so of any channel, YouTube said.
The pregnant giraffe has become a pop-culture phenom, and videos fans have posted to YouTube have been watched over 48.7 million times so far, according to the video platform provider. Those have included a parody of the live-stream by a pregnant woman, a day-by-day analysis of pregnancy signs, baby showers for April, and people anxiously awaiting the big event.
Britain's financial watchdog has launched a sweeping crackdown on high-cost credit as part of efforts to protect vulnerable consumers.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is proposing reforms to bank overdraft charges, rent-to-own operators, door-step lending and catalogue credit and store cards.
FCA chief executive Andrew Bailey said: "High-cost credit is used by over three million consumers in the UK, some of who are the most vulnerable in society.
"Today we have proposed a significant package of reforms to ensure they are better protected, including the possibility of a cap on rent-to-own lending.
"The proposals will benefit overdraft and high-cost credit users, rebalancing in the favour of the customer."
The FCA estimates that banks raked in an estimated £2.3billion in revenue from overdraft charges in 2016, arguing that the system needs "fundamental reform".
The watchdog is considering a number of measures to make it easier for customers to manage their accounts, including mobile alerts warning of potential overdraft charges and stopping the inclusion of overdrafts in the term "available funds".
This is on top of requiring online tools to make the cost of overdrafts clearer, introducing mechanisms to assess the eligibility for overdrafts and making it clear whether overdrafts are credit or borrowing.
Mr Bailey added: "Our immediate proposed changes will make overdraft costs more transparent and prevent people unintentionally dipping in to an overdraft in the first place.
"However, we believe more fundamental change is needed in the way banks charge customers for overdrafts.
"Given the size of the market our work here will be completed as part of our wider review into retail banking."
The FCA believes that these measures alone will save customers up to £140million a year.
Beyond that, the FCA will consider more radical options to ban fixed fees and end the distinctions around unarranged overdraft prices.
The rent-to-own sector has also come under scrutiny from the watchdog, which found that costs for 400,000 customers who rely on the sector can be exceptionally high.
It cited examples of people having paid over £1,500 for an electric cooker which could be bought on the high street for less than £300.
The FCA is now considering imposing a cap on rent-to-own merchants.
In the home-collected credit market, the watchdog is introducing new requirements to raise standards in "disclosure and sales practices".
They will prevent home-collected credit firms from offering new loans or refinancing during home visits without the customer "specifically requesting this".
In catalogue credit and store cards, the FCA will ask firms to "do more" to help customers avoid persistent debt.

Nargis Fakhri cast opposite Sanjay Dutt in upcoming action thriller titled Torbaaz
Nargis Fakhri, whose last film was Banjo with Riteish Deshmukh in 2016, has another exciting project in her hands. Mumbai Mirror reports that the actress has grabbed a film opposite none other than Sanjay Dutt.
Fakhri will share the screen with Sanjay Dutt in an upcoming action thriller titled Torbaaz. The story revolves around child bombers in Afghanistan and is expected to be made on a lavish scale.
Sanjay Dutt will play a retired Army office in the movie, while Nargis has been signed to portray the character of his friend's wife, who assists him on a secret mission.
“Nargis is playing the parallel lead and has already begun taking language classes in LA for Pushto and Dari, both of which she will be using extensively,” reveals Rahul Mittra, who is the co-producer of Torbaaz with Wave Cinemas' Raju Chadha.
The same report from Mumbai Mirror claims that the first shoot schedule in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyztan. To be directed by Girish Malik, Torbaaz might hit the theatres in the second half of 2018.
Meanwhile, many reports suggest that Sanjay Dutt has been signed for Ashutosh Gowariker's next periodical drama alongside Arjun Kapoor. Sanjay Dutt's last film (touted to be his comeback after being released from Yerwada Jail) Bhoomi, opposite Aditi Rao Hydari and directed by Omung Kumar, didn't perform well at the box office.
GENEVA, Feb 2 (Reuters) - An estimated 90 migrants are feared to have drowned off the coast of Libya after a smuggler's boat capsised early on Friday, leaving three known survivors and 10 bodies washed up on shore, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said.
Survivors told aid workers that most of the migrants on board were Pakistanis, who form a growing group heading to Italy, IOM spokeswoman Olivia Headon, speaking from Tunis, told a Geneva news briefing.
“They have given an estimate of 90 who drowned during the capsise, but we still have to verify the exact number of people who lost their lives during the tragedy,” she said. (Reporting by Stephanie Nebehay; Editing by Peter Graff)
In a new video, YouTuber Danilo Vicari highlights the great interplay between Slash and Duff McKagan on ‘Sweet Child O' Mine'.
If you've ever focused on McKagan's bass in the song, you'll notice how melodic it is. Turns out it holds up incredible well as the guitar lead.
Duff McKagan can't speak highly enough of what the song meant to the band's initial success.
“And then on Aerosmith tour, ‘Sweet Child O' Mine' single came out…It went from 3 to 30, to 300, to 3,000, to everybody coming to see us, all in like a couple of weeks.We had that new, breaking band stigma. So people were really excited. Aerosmith is Aerosmith, you just don't compare with them. But we had that fresh shiny vibe, and everybody had to see us.That we a really interesting time, going from asking people for change so you can make a phone call… We still didn't have any money, but everybody knew who we were suddenly.You're going to grocery store when you got back to LA and we're on the cover of Rolling Stone. But you don't change at all. You're like ‘Whoah, I gotta buy some copies for sure.' People were looking at you in the store and pointing. ‘There's that guy!' It was so weird!”
Check out the song with bass and guitar parts switched:

Robert Ritchie could be the next celebrity to dip his toe into politics. Never heard the name? You probably know him better by his musical moniker, Kid Rock.
Yes, the “Bawitdaba” rocker is being eyed as a potential candidate in Michigan's 2018 senate race. According to RollCall, Michigan GOP members floated Ritchie's name during a party convention held last weekend.
Ritchie, who's described himself as a “libertarian, was a staunch supporter of Donald Trump during his 2016 presidential run. He appeared at several campaign events and even sold pro-Trump merchandise.
Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat, has held the senate seat since 2000. However, in the wake of Trump's surprise victory in the state, Republicans are feeling more confident that they can flip the seat.
WWE Live Event Results: Oakland (13/02/17)
The first Smackdown live event in the 'Wyatt Era'..
@MejorELguy by EL Mejor Report 15 Feb 2017, 05:57 IST
Ambrose defended the Intercontinental Championship in a fatal 4-way match
The first live event of the blue brand following the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view was held in Oakland, California on Monday. The show featured a total of seven matches, including two title defenses. In the main event of the night, John Cena teamed up with Luke Harper to take on the team of Randy Orton and the brand new WWE Champion, Bray Wyatt.
The results of the event have been provided below:
#1 American Alpha(c) vs. The Usos vs. Breezango vs. Rhyno and Heath Slater [Fatal 4-way match for the Smackdown Tag team Championship]
The current Smackdown Tag Champions received a decent reaction from the fans in attendance and there were pops for Slater and Rhyno as well. The match was exciting that the Alphas dominated.
Result: American Alpha retained the Smackdown Tag team Championship over Breezango, The Usos and Heath Slater and Rhyno
#2 Apollo Crews vs. Curt Hawkins
Just another typical Hawkins match lasting simply a few minutes. Apollo Crews dominated Hawkins since the bell rang and delivered the spin-out powerbomb to pick up the victory.
Result: Apollo Crews defeated Curt Hawkins
#3 Mojo Rawley vs. Konnor (with Viktor)
This match was unexpectedly enjoyable. Although there were a few interference attempts from Viktor to aid his tag-team partner, Rawley delivered the tilt-a-whirl powerslam on Konnor and got the win.
Result: Mojo Rawley defeated Konnor
The New York Knicks and Joakim Noah have mutually agreed that he will not be back with the club until further notice. Noah left the team last week after a dispute with coach Jeff Hornacek. He's already missed a pair of games this week. The veteran center hasn't reclaimed a rotation spot after missing the start of the season while serving the remainder of a 20-game suspension. That suspension began last season for violating terms of the anti-drug agreement. The Knicks could try to find a trade for him before next Thursday's deadline. However, a deal will be difficult because he has two more seasons remaining on the $72-million contract he signed in the summer of 2016.
Researchers at Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, have synthesised a new compound that can be used to develop sensors for detecting picric acid, which is a major component of explosives.
The new compound, called beta-dicyanovinyl substituted porphyrinogen, has been found to be capable of detecting picric acid at even as low a level as 1.12 parts per million. The colour of the substance changed from reddish-pink to purple as per concentration of picric acid. The substance can be reused any number of times, according to Dr Muniappan Sankar, leader of the research team.
The same substance can also be used to detect cyanide and fluoride ions even when they are hidden within a mixture of other anions by unique colour changes. The simultaneous and independent ‘naked-eye' detection of picric acid, cyanide and fluoride ions is the added advantage of the new chemo sensor.
Like picric acid, cyanide and fluoride ions can also be detected at very low concentrations, at micromolar or ppm levels. The minimum dose for fluoride is 13 micromolar and for cyanide 8.4 micromolar. Here also the detection is through change in colour.
Though cyanides are highly toxic, they also find use in a wide range of industrial processes from electroplating, metallurgy and heap leaching of gold ore to steel manufacturing and as raw material for synthetic fibers, resins and herbicides. “Release of cyanide ions into the environment due to its increased usage in industrial applications raises the risk for accidental or intentional release as a toxic contaminant. Both biological and environmental aspects necessitate development of selective cyanide-receptors,” explained Dr Sankar.
Similarly, fluoride-containing compounds such as sodium fluoride or sodium monofluorophosphate are used in topical and systemic fluoride therapy for preventing tooth decay, besides various products associated with oral hygiene. But soluble fluoride salts, of which sodium fluoride is the most common, are toxic, and have resulted in both accidental and self-inflicted deaths from acute poisoning.
Dr. Sankar conducted the study in collaboration with colleague, Mandeep K. Chahal. They have published a report of their work in Royal Society of Chemistry's journal Dalton Transactions.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya on Friday defied a court order to lift a ban on three private television stations and briefly detained an opposition politician, deepening a crisis sparked by a disputed presidential election.
The media crackdown, criticised by the United Nations, the United States and former colonial power Britain, could set up a showdown between the judiciary and the executive next week.
On Tuesday, opposition leader Raila Odinga symbolically inaugurated himself as president in a direct challenge to President Uhuru Kenyatta. The government responded by shutting down three television channels planning to stream the event.
On Thursday, activist Okiya Omtatah won a court order saying the channels should be reopened. But when he tried to serve it to Kenya's communications authority on Friday, they refused to receive it. Other officials given the order ignored it.
If the government continues to defy the courts, it could spark a confrontation with a newly-confident judiciary, said Murithi Mutiga, senior analyst with International Crisis Group.
The Supreme Court infuriated Kenyatta last year when it found irregularities in the August presidential election and annulled his victory.
The court ordered a re-run. Odinga boycotted the repeat poll in October, saying the process was rigged, and Kenyatta won with 98 percent of the vote. This time, legal challenges were thrown out.
TEST OF THE CONSTITUTION
“Next week will be a litmus test for the constitution,” said Mutiga. “If the government does not comply with a court order that is so clear, it will raise questions as to the wider rule of law.”
Omtatah, the activist, said men in dark suits who said they were police but refused to provide identification had detained a courier he sent to deliver the judgment to Kenya's communications authority.
“They released him at 10 with a stern warning not to come back,” he told Reuters by phone “I have come here myself, but I am being been denied access.”
He pasted the order on the gate of the authority, but the men tore it down, he said.

The court order was also published in Friday's edition of the Standard newspaper, one of Kenya's largest dailies. Omtatah said he had also delivered it to the internal security minister, attorney general and information minister.
“I am insisting on delivering this order,” he said.
Omtatah said he would return to court on Monday. Government officials refused to comment on whether they would appeal.
The office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva said it was concerned at the government's “attempts to interfere with the rights to freedom of expression”.
OPPOSITION LEADER DETAINED
Also on Friday, firebrand opposition politician Miguna Miguna was detained in a dawn raid on his Nairobi home and later released on bail of 50,000 Kenyan shillings ($500), his lawyer Nelson Havi told Reuters.
Miguna stood beside Odinga at Tuesday's rally and declared himself the “general” of Odinga's National Resistance Movement, which authorities designated a “criminal group” this week because of its stated intent to establish a parallel government.
On Thursday another opposition leader who attended Tuesday's rally was arrested. He was also released on bail.
The arrests and broadcast bans have shocked Kenyans used to the freewheeling media and irreverent political culture that have taken root since the end of decades of autocratic rule in 2002.
The crackdown has focused attention on government censorship and away from the opposition's failure to release a promised statement outlining its next move.
Western diplomats say Odinga's inauguration event has caused splits within his own alliance and alienated the diplomatic community.
“So you inaugurate yourself - then what?” asked one. “It's a dead end - where do you go from there?”

West Indies named uncapped batting pair Vishaul Singh and Shimron Hetmeyer and recalled Kieran Powell to face Pakistan in the first Test starting on Friday.
The 13-man squad for the first in the three-match series at Sabina Park in Kingston is captained by Jason Holder.
Three players missing were Marlon Samuels, Darren Bravo and Leon Johnson who toured the United Arab Emirates last year for three Tests against Pakistan.
For Powell this marks a return to the Test stage for the first time since 2014.
He figured in the West Indies' one day international series against England in March and Pakistan this month.
West Indies chairman of selectors Courtney Browne said: “We have a young Test squad, which was admirably led by Jason Holder during the last series and, though there are some noticeable absentees, we believe that the players will give a good account of themselves especially in their own backyard.”
West Indies squad:
Jason Holder (capt)
Devendra Bishoo
Jermaine Blackwood
Kraigg Brathwaite
Roston Chase
Miguel Cummins
Shane Dowrich
Shannon Gabriel
Shimron Hetmyer
Shai Hope
Alzarri Joseph
Kieran Powell
Vishaul Singh
Match schedule:
1st Test: April 21-25 - West Indies v Pakistan at Sabina Park, Kingston
2nd Test: April 30-May 4: West Indies v Pakistan at Kensington Oval, Bridgetown
3rd Test: May 10-14: West Indies v Pakistan at Windsor Park, Roseau
(WTNH) — The legislative session begins Wednesday, and there is plenty for legislators to talk about, but one thing is going to dominate any discussion, and that is the deficit.
A couple of weeks ago, Governor Malloy‘s office announced the deficit for the current fiscal year was around $42 million. That's actually good news. It was a lot higher.
The bad news is the projected deficit for the next budget, the one that starts in just six months, is up to around $1.3 billion; so they're going to be talking about how to make more money.
One way is an old way, highway tolls.
A deadly crash 34 years ago made the state get rid of tolls. Today's electronic systems mean no more booths. Lawmakers have talked about tolls at the borders, congestion pricing on the most crowded highways, and a tax based on how many miles you drive.
They will also talk about a third casino.
A big gambling and entertainment complex is under construction in Springfield, Massachusetts. The tribes that run Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun want to work together to build a competing casino just north of Hartford to keep that gambling money in Connecticut.
Marijuana could help the lawmakers with the budget. No, not smoking it to feel better, but legalizing it and taxing it. Maine and Massachusetts became the first New England states to vote to legalize recreational marijuana. Taxing legal pot would bring in millions.
Money in education will also be on the agenda. A judge ruled in September that the state's system of distributing education funding is unconstitutional and gave the state 180 days to change it. That was around 120 days ago.
And remember, all this will be going on in a legislature with a new look. Democrats in the House of Representatives have a smaller majority, and the Senate is now equal parts republican and democrat. Democratic Lieutenant Governor Nancy Wyman will break any tie votes.
Have your say
Paramedics had personal belongings stolen when an ambulance was broken into during a call-out to an emergency in Leeds.
Ambulance chiefs tonight condemned the incident, which happened on St Luke's Green in Beeston, as “appalling”.
One of the vehicle's windows was also smashed and its central console ripped out while crew members were treating a patient.
The ambulance had to be taken off the road for repairs following the incident, which took place on Sunday evening.
John McSorley, Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust's divisional commander for West Yorkshire, said: “We are saddened and disappointed by this act of vandalism.
“The vehicle had to be made unavailable to respond to life-threatening emergencies whilst the repairs were carried out.
“Our dedicated staff work extremely hard to deliver the best service possible and for them to have their personal belongings stolen is appalling.”
A spokesman for West Yorkshire Police said an investigation was under way and issued an appeal for witnesses.
Anyone with information is asked to ring Leeds District Police on 101, quoting log reference 13180046694, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.

How do I get an IRA distribution from my bank?
Dear Tax Talk,
I'm going nuts trying to find out how to get the necessary deduction made from an IRA. One bank does it automatically at the end of the year, but the other one doesn't -- I have two. There is more information than I could ever use all over the web about when to start, how to figure out how much to deduct, etc. Just nothing about how to go about getting it done (no forms or where to get them). How do I take my IRA distribution? Thanks for your consideration.
-- Barbara Carlina Teteris/Getty Images RATE SEARCH: Make CDs part of your retirement portfolio. Shop for high-yield CDs on Bankrate.com. Dear Barbara,
This is really a very basic question but a crucial one for anyone who is new to the process of taking money from a retirement account. The answer is that you need to contact your IRA "trustee," which in your case is the bank where you have your IRA. The bank will have the form you need. However, you will need to tell the bank how much in tax you want withheld on your IRA distribution. As far as calculating the amount of tax to withhold, you have not mentioned anything about your age or other income received, so I can only give you some general information to help you stay on track with the IRS. Generally, traditional IRAs allow you to make tax deductible contributions to your account, where the money grows tax-free until you take a distribution. This is a great incentive for retirement planning, as it couples the tax deferral on the contribution along with the tax-free growth of the account. You are allowed to take money out of your traditional IRA whenever you want. However, the IRS wants you to keep the money in the account until you are at least 59 1/2 or you could be subject to an additional 10 percent tax on the withdrawal unless you meet certain exceptions. The IRS is very patient, but there is a time when you have to pay the piper, or in this case Uncle Sam. Generally, you have to take out a "required minimum distribution," or RMD, by April 1 of the year following the year in which you reach age 70 1/2. This is known as the required beginning date. What happens if you don't take an IRA distribution? If the distribution is not made or not calculated correctly, you may have to pay a 50 percent excise tax on the amount not distributed as required. The RMD is calculated by taking your year-end balance of the previous year and dividing it by the applicable distribution period or your life expectancy as shown in the tables in IRS Publication 590-B, Distributions from Individual Retirement Arrangements.

Ed Sheeran planning a 'lo-fi' record inspired by Bruce Springsteen
Ed Sheeran says he plans to work on a "lo-fi" record inspired by rock star Bruce Springsteen, which he believes would be his "lowest-selling, but most loved" one.
The 26-year-old artiste said he heard Springsteen only recently when he listened to the EP of 'Nebraska'.
"Im weak-minded at times, and feel very vulnerable and insecure... My plan is a lo-fi album that will be my lowest- selling, but most loved... I only heard Springsteen recently.
"I was with Kit (Harington) from Game of Thrones. We had a night out in New York, got back to his hotel to drink more, and he played 'Atlantic City'. Then, when I heard Nebraska," Sheeran told The Times. The 'Shape of You' hitmaker earlier said he would collaborate with rapper Drake on one of his songs.

Even sadder is the betrayal by former friends who see Washington, not as a place to represent the people, but as a place to pad their pocketbooks. Some corporate interests have been turned off by the congressman's unwillingness to look the other way on corporate giveaways and crony capitalism. In fact, his is now being challenged in the primary election by a lobbyist who represented sober living homes.
Natalie Portman. Emma Watson. Taylor Swift. Sexually explicit videos featuring these and a number of other female celebrities have surfaced online in recent days, foreshadowing what could be Hollywood's next big sex-tape nightmare.
Only this time, the videos in question haven't been stolen by hackers, or commissioned by porn studios, starring barely-lookalikes. Instead, these new clips have been made with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) technology capable of swapping the faces of porn stars with those of famous actresses and other celebrities.
These so-called Deepfakes — a combination of ‘fake' and ‘deep learning' — first started popping up online in December, when a Reddit user began to post explicit videos seemingly featuring celebrities online. The user in question told Motherboard at the time that he was using images found by Google image search as well as stock photos and YouTube videos to “train” AI algorithms, and essentially give them an idea of how a celebrity's face would look like in any given moment.

Then, he applied that knowledge to the task of swapping out the face of a porn star in an explicit video with that of the celebrity in question. The results are clips that are more often than not convincing enough to look like hardcore porn featuring Hollywood's biggest stars.
In January, the phenomenon took an unexpected turn when another Reddit user published an app that lets anyone without much technical knowledge produce their own Deepfake videos. The app has been downloaded more than 100,000 times since its release, according to its creator — and new clips are being uploaded by the dozens.
In fact, Deepfakes have gotten so much attention that the Gif hosting platform Gfycat began to remove the clips this week, deeming them objectionable. Most of the clip producers simply switched to other video hosting platforms. Reddit, which is being used to exchange links to these clips, has yet to comment on the phenomenon.
Meanwhile, even some of the users seeking out these clips on Reddit are starting to have second thoughts about the technology. Some seem to hold some hopes out that there may be a silver lining for Hollywood stars. “This is a blessing in disguise for all the celebs” who've seen their private pictures and videos leaked, argued one user who calls himself AnyNamesLeftAnymore. “Now if you have (an explicit) video with your boyfriend that gets leaked? You have infinite plausible deniability.”
But others fear that the repercussions of this technology could go far beyond sex and celebrities. “Imagine not being able to hold politicians accountable with video anymore because it could be fake,” said Reddit user ThatPickelGuy.
“This is turning into an episode of ‘Black Mirror',” wrote a user who goes by the name CapntainIceberg. Reddit user hammerthefish agreed: “Nothing is real anymore.”

The Mitre Corporation has given network administrators something to chew on, in the form of a simulator that lets them build networks in space.
Mitre is a not-for-profit organisation that administers some of the United States' Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, public-private partnerships that conduct research for the US government. MITRE's Technology Transfer Office releases some of the resulting work into the public domain, such as this 1.7GB Ubuntu .ISO that bundles the Common Open Research Emulator with version 3.5.0 of the Interplanetary Overlay Network and the Disruption Tolerant Networking Development Kit
That collection of code offers three challenges:
Hooking up to a satellite that moves in and out of radio range and therefore drops off the network from time to time;
A Martian scenario in which you're asked to connect three ground stations, a rover, and an orbiter;
An Earth-observing satellite scenario with multiple ground stations.
The .ISO's availability was pointed out by the InterPlanetary Networking Special Interest Group, which aims to extend the internet beyond Earth. Doing so presents lots of challenges, among them latency, nodes like satellites that change routes and lots of radiation.
The organisation's announcement post explains the scenarios mentioned above in a little more detail and offers log-on credentials for the simulator. If you play with it, let us know how you go! ®
Being the brightest one in a sky full of stars is a tough task. How does a story stand out among several hundred titles in a program that rolls out over 25 days with audiences from all walks of life who have endless choices?
At the 43rd Seattle International Film Festival (May 18–June 11, 2017), America's largest cinema event both in length and number of works screened, trying to be memorable can be an overwhelming conundrum. Considering the extensive list of top-notch narrative features and documentaries viewed by the crowds, the Audience Awards—in this case known as the Golden Space Needle Awards in honor of the city's landmark—take on a significantly more prestigious connotation. Especially when a single film wins the two top prizes awarded by moviegoers.
Enamored with its sharp gallows humor and clever twisty plot, SIFF attendants voted Rodrigo Grande's At the End of the Tunnel as the Best Film of the festival and also named him Best Director. The love for this dark cop thriller was aplenty. Grande's third feature (after Historias Breves 2 and Gangs from Rosario), his most ambitious to date, centers on a disabled man who realizes a group of criminals is building a tunnel under his house in order to carry out a lucrative heist. Myriad odd characters and high-stakes situations ensue.
Based on his previous experience, Grande initially believed it would be easier to continue making smaller films that did not require a budget for more technically intricate set pieces. “I thought I would find more interested producers in the comedy genre because, in general, for comedies you don't have to built complex sets. In a comedy what's complicated is maintaining a consistent tone,” the director explained during a festival panel devoted to Iberoamerican artists and moderated by programmer Hebe Tabachnik. Rather than canning this idea, he embraced the aesthetic risk it posed. At the End of the Tunnel is an Argentine-Spanish co-production, a partnership that meant more resources but also more responsibility to deliver a financially viable product.
“I always need to be writing or developing something, otherwise I'd go crazy. I was going through a time in my life that made me feel as isolated as the character. There are parallels between what I felt and the movie,” said Grande. His sincerity regarding personal woes might have sealed the deal in the love affair between him and Seattle's audience. A drunken Q&A session following one his film's screenings turned into one of the most memorable moments at the festival and what many on social media called the best post-film conversation they have ever seen. Grande got on stage and invited fellow director Jose Maria Cabral, one of Cabral's relatives, and myself to serve as interpreters to convey his answers more clearly in English. Quickly the conventional inquiries were ditched for a two-hander confessional in which Grande and Cabral dished out on their recent romantic failures. As the tragicomedy unfurled, the affair was received with warmth and laughter by those who had just enjoyed the intense film. Spontaneity won that night.
Woodpeckers, Cabral's film, was the first-ever Dominican feature to premiere at Sundance, and it made its way to the Pacific Northwest via SIFF. During the discussion with the other Latin American directors, the director shared anecdotes about the one-of-a-kind production inside an overcrowded prison with real inmates on camera. In his quest for authenticity, Cabral had to forge relationship within the correctional facilities so that the shooting could go as smoothly as it possibly could under those conditions. “It was like going into a city [made up of] people that have committed crimes. I thought, ‘How am I going to convince 8,000 prisoners that I'm here to make a movie, that I want them to be part of the movie, and that I want them to act?'”
Police inside the jail couldn't guarantee his safety, so a significant leap of faith was vital to pull of Cabral's unorthodox filmmaking feat. A seasoned creator who crafted his first feature at 19, and got it theatrically distributed at home, Cabral was fascinated by the sign language people behind bars in two major Dominican prisons designed, a language of love– the title of his film comes from the Spanish-language term used to describe this communication practice.
Having its U.S. premiere at SIFF, Everardo Gonzale' Devil's Freedom is a solemn nonfiction portrait of the drug war in Mexico. Always conscious of the magnitude of the subject at hand, the documentarian use his time on the panel to speak about the ethical challenges and concerns brought about by the delicate nature of what he was capturing. The film includes multiple interviews with families that lost someone to the cartels or the federal police that aides them, as well as first-hand accounts from sicarios, or hired killers, about the atrocious murderers they have committed. One of the most harrowing moments in the film comes when a teenage boy describes killing for the first time, and the repercussions this had on his humanity.
Gonzales hides his subjects' faces with identical, otherworldly masks. “I used a mask in order to block all the expressions in their faces, and in order to make them all equal. In a way I was putting victims and perpetrators in the same place,” he explained. That very decision was source of internal conflict, because in order to follow the security protocols he had devised, he had to conceal the victims' names and faces. They must remain in the shadows, yet the masks allow everyone in front of the camera to speak freely, even those who have blood on their hands. Devil's Freedom was awarded a Special Jury Mention from the festival's Iberoamerican competition jury.
Slightly lighter, Chilean first-time director Jorge Riquelme Serrano's Chameleon enjoyed its North American premiere to audiences whom you might describe as “captive” in a double entendre about the film's premise. The film, which was entirely shot in three days (following three months of rehearsal), dives into the mind of a young psychopath who walks into the home of an affluent lesbian couple with malevolent intentions.
“The amount of material we had to build the film was very limited. Many key scenes were shot only once. That was the biggest challenge,” said Serrano, about the production model that only afforded them 72 hours for principal photography. Using a beachfront home as its only location and revolving around just three characters representing the Chile's social strata, Chameleon is an effective chamber piece that constantly demolishes expectations and shines for its precise execution. Gastón Salgado's calibrated performance as the shifting intruder is a key piece in the overall potency of the storytelling. Among other noteworthy distinctions, the film was the first of its size to be crowdfunded in the South American country, and, on a fun note, its psychological gruesome themes propelled a handful of SIFF audience members to run away. Those who stayed had endless questions for the director.
Other notable Iberoamerican films include Emiliano Torres' The Winter, winner of the top award in the region's competition; controversial Cuban drama Santa & Andres by Carlos Lechuga, and Sebastian Rotstein Terror 5, a segmented horror film in the style of Argentine hit Wild Tales. Packing the enormity of the world in a month-long parade of images, sounds, and subtitles, SIFF continues to be a prime launching pad for international cinema in the United States, and in spite of its massive size on all fronts, it runs like a well-oiled, four-decades-old machine.

Rawalpindi
The work to construct the Rs 24 million modern pedestrian underpass on Murree Road at Shamsabad started here on Friday. According to Rawalpindi Development Authority official, the citizens particularly aged, women and children were facing problem in crossing one of the busiest roads in the city, Murree Road, near Gulshan Dadan Khan's Jamia Masjid.
It would be an eight feet wide underpass to facilitate the pedestrians and the contractor has been directed to complete the project within three months.—APP
PanARMENIAN.Net - Virtual reality is still a pretty crappy facsimile of The Matrix, but scientists are trying their best to fix that. At the CHI'17 conference in Denver, a team of researchers from the Hasso-Plattner-Institut in Potsdam showed off a haptic system that can simulate walls or heavy objects via electrical muscle stimulation, Engadget said. "We were really interested in trying to explore one of the hardest things to recreate in terms of physical sensation, which is a wall," says co-author Pedro Lopes.
The researchers hooked subjects up with a medical-grade eight-channel muscle simulator (EMS) installed in a backpack. That's controlled over USB by a VR simulator that works with Samsung GearVR, hand-mounted trackers and a motion capture system. "The major potential here is that this is something you can have with very little hardware," Lopes explains.
They attached electrodes to users' forearms and biceps, which automatically apply a mild electrical shock when they touch or lift a virtual object. That tenses the activated muscle, repulsing the users hand and making them feel they're pushing against a wall or picking up a heavy cube.
It took the team a while to create a realistic simulation. At first, they applied a current to the users' muscle proportional to their force, "just strongly enough to prevent it passing through [a wall]," the team wrote. However, one participant said that it "felt like a magnet pulling the hand backwards," in a not-very-realistic way.
Eventually, they arrived at two different simulators. In the first, they cut off the EMS intensity at a certain limit. That allowed users to penetrate simulated objects by about 10cm, a good simulation for foam or other soft things. In the second case, they used a short EMS pulse that actually propelled the user's hand backwards, never allowing them to push through the wall or other object. (The shocks aren't intense enough to hurt users, by the way.)
The technology isn't exactly new, as it has been used for physical therapy and exercise stimulation for years (think of those janky ab stimulators). There are even some companies trying to develop it for entertainment purposes, like the team behind the Teslasuit, which also uses electric muscle simulation. However, Lopes thinks it should be very low profile tech that can even be integrated into regular textiles. "There's a need for physicality in VR," he told Fast Co. "The next step is bigger force, more physical sensations."
The understudy is ready for a leading role. That was evident last season when Chargers rookie tight end Hunter Henry, a second-round pick out of Arkansas in 2016, caught 36 passes for 478 yards and eight touchdowns and was an effective blocker in the running game.
The star is not ready to yield the spotlight. Antonio Gates, who turns 37 on Sunday, is back for his 15th NFL season, needing one scoring catch to break Tony Gonzalez's record of 111 touchdown receptions for a tight end, and he showed little slippage while catching 53 passes for 548 yards and seven touchdowns last season.
So what gives?
Nothing if you're the Chargers, who stand to benefit by having Gates, a probable Hall of Famer, and Henry, one of football's best young tight ends, share the position when the team moves to Los Angeles this season.
“We can both contribute a lot together,” Henry, 22, said after Wednesday's practice, part of a three-day mandatory minicamp that ends Thursday. “I'm ready to take on a bigger role, I'm confident in my abilities, but he's proved himself for 14 years; I've proved it for one. I'm trying to get to that level. I'm trying to learn from him every single day.”
The 6-foot-5, 250-pound Henry described as “unbelievable” the experience of serving an NFL apprenticeship under Gates, who has caught 897 passes for 11,192 yards during his distinguished career.
“He's gonna go down as one of the greatest tight ends to ever play football,” Henry said. “He's an awesome guy — easy to learn from, easy to watch, easy to pick things up from.”
On the field, Henry watches how Gates reads defenses and sets up routes for later in games, how he positions his hands and feet on certain blocks, and how he's able to “slow the game down.”
Off the field, Henry is learning how to “treat your body as a business,” how to prevent injuries by taking ice baths, stretching and warming up properly and how to mentally prepare for each work day.
“It's a physical game,” said Henry, who tied Tampa Bay's Cameron Brate for most touchdowns for a tight end in 2016. “You have to be ready to go each and every Sunday.”
Gates stresses the importance of maintaining focus and not thinking success as a rookie will guarantee success as a sophomore.
“You see so many players come in and have one or two big years, and then they lose focus,” Gates said. “I personally think you should treat every year like your first, because when you come into something, you're not established. You have to prove to everyone, ‘This is what I can do. This is who I am.'
“Sometimes, when guys have success — and I don't see this in him, because he's a very level-headed kid, a very hard worker — but I've seen guys lose their focus. It's something I continue to talk to my kids about. Do what you know is right, and what got you to that level.”
First-year Chargers coach Anthony Lynn has “no doubt Henry can be a No. 1,” but Gates and Henry are more of a 1 and 1A in the eyes of offensive coordinator Ken Whisenhunt. The Chargers run plenty of two-tight-end packages and can base playing-time decisions on which tight end better fits a particular defense.
“It worked pretty good last year — both of them were productive, and we're going to try to utilize both this season,” Whisenhunt said. “It's good to see Antonio out here. He's looking good. But we're not going to ignore the fact that Hunter is really coming along as a young tight end in the league.
“I'm sure there will be times when both are on the field, and there will be other plays where we're trying to work them in. When you've got guys like that, it's a good problem to have when you're trying to balance all those things.”
Nuts and Bolts
Lynn had stern words for the Chargers after Tuesday's practice, which the coach described as “sluggish” and filled with mistakes and fouls. He was much more pleased with Wednesday's effort. “The energy was back, the defense had a really good day,” Lynn said. “The offense made some plays, but the defense was on top of it. Guys were stripping the ball out, running to the ball and getting pass breakups.” ... During the red-zone portion of Wednesday's practice, 35-year-old quarterback Philip Rivers, who is not known for his mobility, ran a read-option play. “I think it's always fun to do those kinds of things in OTAs,” Whisenhunt said. “You'll probably see less of that in-season, but you never know. If he's feeling frisky one day, we may take a shot at it.” … Chargers owner Dean Spanos attended Wednesday's practice.

KAZAN, Russia — Four years after Brazil's humiliation at its home World Cup, Thiago Silva is back to his best in Russia, a country where his then-burgeoning career was almost tragically cut short years ago.
The 33-year-old Brazil centre back — who is nicknamed "O Monstro" for his exceptional physical abilities — is probably playing in his final World Cup, and he has been enjoying a perfect tournament so far.
While forward Neymar attracted negative comments for his antics on the field, Silva has been irreproachable. The captain arguably has been the best centre back of the tournament, alongside Uruguay captain Diego Godin.
Like Uruguay, Brazil has conceded only one goal in Russia so far, from a set piece in its opening 1-1 draw with Switzerland . And the Selecao's rivals have managed only five shots on target in their four matches against the five-time champions.
Silva has been playing a key role in helping Brazil achieve those impressive statistics, anchoring the defence with authority and class. During the 2-0 win against Mexico that guaranteed Brazil advanced to the quarterfinals for the seventh consecutive time, Silva was decisive both in the air and on the ground, blocked several shots and made two clearances.
"It's a huge joy to be doing an excellent cup and to be growing with every game," Silva said. "I'm happy about my performance, and the performance of the team."
Happiness and joy have been hard to come by during some stretches of Silva's career.
The native of Rio de Janeiro went through hard times after Brazil's 7-1 loss to Germany at the last World Cup. Silva did not play in that game because he was suspended, but he was harshly criticized and branded a cry baby for his emotional outbursts as he was pictured in tears before a penalty shootout against Chile in the round of 16.
After the tournament, he was stripped of the team's captaincy by new coach Dunga, then left off the regular roster after the 2015 Copa America. He returned from exile in September 2016 for World Cup qualifiers after being called up by Dunga's successor, Tite.
Those professional ups and downs are nothing compared to the ordeal Silva went through back in 2005, when he spent about six months in a Moscow hospital after he contracted tuberculosis. Regarded at the time as one of the world's most promising defenders, Silva had been sent on loan from Porto to Dynamo Moscow alongside several teammates.
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is not auditing how its partner KPMG cracks down on illegal use of Microsoft software in India, the companies said in a joint statement on Tuesday.

The denial comes after a prior claim made by an executive of the U.S. technology giant following a client complaint in March.
Microsoft runs a global “software asset management” (SAM) programme under which it partners with global consultants such as KPMG in India. Under that programme, KPMG seeks permission from business owners to check for the use of unlicensed software.
Reuters reported earlier this month that Microsoft had begun probing KPMG's work in India after a member of India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, Vinit Goenka, complained to both companies that a KPMG employee had “barged in” to his Mumbai recruitment firm without an appointment to check its software last month.
Following the incident, a senior Microsoft India executive, Rajiv Sodhi, wrote to Goenka and apologised, saying Microsoft was “getting an assessment agency to carry out an audit of the process delivery at KPMG to identify and correct gaps, if any,” according to an e-mail reviewed by Reuters.
Microsoft and KPMG, who had earlier declined to comment on the probe, on Tuesday denied there was such an audit, and said allegations made against the programme's implementation were “incorrect”.
“Microsoft and KPMG strongly refute any suggestion that Microsoft is auditing KPMG, or either company has engaged in any wrong doing,” the companies said in the statement sent to Reuters.
A spokeswoman for Microsoft in India clarified on Tuesday that the company was only examining conduct around the recent incident and was not carrying out a broad probe into KPMG's other anti-piracy work for Microsoft.
POLICE COMPLAINT
Microsoft declined to comment on why Sodhi previously told Goenka there was an audit being carried out. It also declined to comment on whether it hired an assessment agency to do such an audit, citing employee and customer confidentiality concerns.
“When a customer complains to us about a process issue they may have experienced, Microsoft and KPMG take the concern seriously and address appropriately through process review and gap assessment, if any,” the companies said in the joint statement.
Sodhi did not respond to a request for comment.
Told about the statement from Microsoft and KPMG, Goenka said the companies should be addressing the issues he raised.
“Why would he (Sodhi) apologise if they had not done any mistake?” said Goenka, who advises government committees on IT initiatives and filed a police complaint after the incident.
India is one of Microsoft's biggest markets in Asia, but over half of all software installed on computers in the country is unlicensed, advocacy group Business Software Alliance said in 2016.
Goenka said his firm, Ratein Infotech, used genuine software. Last month, he received a letter from Microsoft saying his company needed help in “interpreting licensing policies of Microsoft”, according to emails seen by Reuters.
The issue escalated when a KPMG employee, identified only as Srijesh, entered Ratein's office on March 15. Microsoft and KPMG apologised to Goenka and Srijesh wrote an e-mail resigning, the emails showed.
“The resignation of the KPMG employee was involuntary and hence KPMG has not accepted the resignation,” the companies said in their statement, without elaborating.
Srijesh could not be reached for comment.
Carras graduates from DePauw
Kharissa Carras, of Midland, along with 472 classmates, became the 179th graduating class of DePauw University. The undergraduates were awarded their degrees during the program that took place in Holton Memorial Quadrangle on May 20. Carras was awarded a bachelor of arts in biology.
“Everyone supports renewable energy,” said Matthew Benson, spokesman for the utility-funded opposition initiative. “The question is whether we are going to have an Arizona plan that is created and implemented by Arizona leaders and officials, or whether we're going to have a plan crammed down our throats by a political activist from California.”
Second periods. They can make or break teams if they are not careful. Teams often talk about their focus on starting out or finishing games strong. You don't often hear teams emphasizing pushing the pace in the middle frame.
Case in point: through the first 50 games of the season, second periods have not been a huge highlight for the Columbus Blue Jackets. Though they have a combined 590 shots in the middle 20 minutes – by far the most of any period – they only have 42 goals to show for their efforts. That's a seven percent shooting percentage. There are only five teams in the entire league with fewer second-period goals, and all five are not in playoff positions.
On the other hand, the Blue Jackets have surrendered 55 second-period goals – a minus-14 goal differential. In the past six weeks, the Blue Jackets surrendered four goals in the second period to the Vancouver Canucks (Jan. 12), Tampa Bay Lightning (Dec. 31) and Edmonton Oilers (Dec. 12). They also gave up three goals in the second period to the Ottawa Senators (Dec. 29) and Vegas Golden Knights (Jan. 23).
The Blue Jackets players and staff know this terrible trend needs to turn around, fast.
“It's a mental thing…we have to figure it out,” Blue Jackets forward Brandon Dubinsky said after a forgetful second-period performance against the Minnesota Wild on Jan. 30. “We know how to play and now, we have all of our personnel back. There are no excuses. We know what we need to do and we have the team to do it. We have to figure it out.”
So, what are some of the things the Blue Jackets can do to resolve this?
“We need to have the same level of effort [all game],” Dubinsky said. “Don't try to do too much or something that's not your job. Just focus on your job and do it to the best you can.
“It comes down to work ethic, too,” Dubinsky added. “We've been getting outworked there [in the second period]. We kind of go ‘oh crap, we have to get going again.' We start getting dominated there… but we shouldn't be looking for wake-up calls in the middle of the game. This team knows how to play hard and we're going to expect that out of each other moving forward.”
Blue Jackets captain and forward Nick Foligno knows second periods have hurt his team all season. It is something the team needs to resolve — fast.
“We can't have so many ebbs and flows in a game,” Foligno said. “There are already enough [ebbs and flows] to begin with, so that can't come from us. That's what I don't like.”
Foligno took used the Jan. 30 game as an example of the troubling trend they have shown all season.
“You look at our effort in that first period and we were dominating,” Foligno said. “Then, the second period hits and our effort goes away. [The Wild] come right back and start dictating play, and it takes us awhile to get the momentum back again. That seems to be our biggest problem right now as a team and that's to me, that's mental. That's a standard we have to get to and understand and realize that when we play like that, we're a very good hockey team. When we don't, we allow teams to hang around and get back into it. If we keep this up, we'll be tooth-and-nailing it all the way to the playoffs.”
As Foligno said, when the Blue Jackets lose control of the middle frame, they often lose control of the entire game and cannot recover. That's a major problem that brings back flashes of the 2015-16 season.
The second-period slowdown is part of a bigger Blue Jackets issue — their inability to score. While goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky holds down the fort, for the most part, he receives little to no support from the skaters. Only the Ottawa Senators, Arizona Coyotes and Buffalo Sabres have fewer goals this season than the Blue Jackets, and they are the three worst teams in the standings.
The Blue Jackets have also failed to score more than two goals in regulation in 11 of their last 12 games, and the one time they did, they lost 6-3 to the Golden Knights. Actually, the Blue Jackets have not won a game in regulation by scoring more than two goals since the team's 4-2 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs on Dec. 20. Not good.
It all comes back to the second period. When the Blue Jackets fail to produce, or reduce the number of goals scored against them, for at least a full third or more of the game, it leads to big problems that cause them to fall in the standings. The Blue Jackets need to get out of their sleepy second-period mentality and find ways to score. Their playoff hopes to depend on it.

Mumbai: The makers of Salman Khan's Tubelight are hopeful that the movie gets a release in Pakistan, where the Bollywood superstar enjoys huge popularity.
According to the buzz in film circuits, Tubelight -- set in the backdrop of the India-China war of 1962 - might not release around Eid in Pakistan.
Amar Butala, Chief Operating Officer, Salman Khan Films, and co-producer of Tubelight, said in a statement, "Salman has a huge following in Pakistan, which has only grown with the positive messaging on Bajrangi Bhaijaan. We hope to release Tubelight in Pakistan as well, and our efforts continue in that direction, but we respect the law of the land and judiciary if they decide otherwise."
According to sources in Pakistan, the distributor for the film is still to be finalised. "Until yesterday, the distributor in our territory had not been finalised. We already have two major Pakistani films, as well as Pirates of the Caribbean, Transformers and The Mummy announced.
"There are limited screens and most of them have committed for Eid programming. It's totally untrue that Tubelight is banned in Pakistan. In fact, it remains a much awaited film," Satish Anand, a key distributor of Indian films in Pakistan, told IANS over social media.
The two local movies scheduled for an Eid release in Pakistan are Yalgaar and Shor Sharaba.
Even Pakistan's Central Board of Film Censors chief Mobasher Hasan told IANS, "It's the distributor's choice to import any foreign film."
But is there scope for Tubelight in Pakistan after Eid?
"Yes, if it clears the censor," Anand said, adding, "Mind you, it will be available online, and cable all the same." His hint was towards the "huge problem" of piracy that Indian films continue to face across the border.
But efforts from the side of the producer to take Tubelight to Pakistan are still on. Butala added, "Salman Khan Films is committed to taking Tubelight to markets across the globe with our overseas distributors Yash Raj Films."
Tubelight, directed by Kabir Khan, dwells on the 1962 border conflict between India and China. Salman features in the movie with brother Sohail. The film, releasing later this month, also features a song by Pakistani singer Rahat Fateh Ali Khan.
CEO: Canada's Zenith to start drilling operation in Azerbaijan in 2018 (exclusive)
2017-04-18 09:48 | www.trend.az | 1
Baku, Azerbaijan, April 12
By Leman Zeynalova – Trend:
The drilling operation of Canada's Zenith Energy Ltd at Azerbaijani oil fields will start in 2018, the company's CEO Andrea Cattaneo told Trend.
Azerbaijan's Muradkhanli, Jafarli and Zardab oil fields are controlled and operated by Zenith Aran, Zenith Energy's wholly owned subsidiary in the Country.
"We have been operating in Azerbaijan only a little more than six months. We are fulfilling all of our commitments to develop this activity in the country," he said. "The company will bring one of the biggest rigs from China for onshore drilling activities here. We will have this rig before the end of 2017 and will start the drilling operation in 2018."
Zenith Energy believes that with drilling of a variety of new wells and related activities such as seismic exploration and technology development, the Muradkhanli field, which is the biggest onshore oilfield in Azerbaijan, will prove very profitable.
"We are creating an overseas team that brings innovative ideas from abroad, as well as technologies from Canada. We are therefore confident to show the results achieved by our input of technological development in the next two or three years," he added.
Cattaneo noted that the Company's operation in Azerbaijan's oil production arena has only just begun and will include some innovation.
"We made the first workover in the last 45 days, which hasn't been finished yet. The results of the first operation will be announced in few days," he added.
The CEO recalled that the company has two teams carrying out the workover operation at Azerbaijani oil fields.
"We will gradually accelerate our workover activities and carry out a systematic number of workover operations that will achieve a significant increase in oil production. We are also in an important phase in our negotiations to acquire a new drilling rig from China. This will be a game changer in many ways and allow the Company to achieve more sizeable and immediate increases in oil production" added Cattaneo.
Regarding the future activities of Zenith Energy in Azerbaijan, the CEO noted that the Company's ambition is to expand the scope of its presence in the Country.
"If there is an opportunity, we will be very happy to expand our activities in Azerbaijan. But first, we have to demonstrate to Azerbaijan's state oil company SOCAR the success of our methods," he said. "We are very pleased and privileged in our cooperation with SOCAR and its support is very valuable to us."
Zenith Energy is very optimistic about the outcome of its activity in Azerbaijan in terms of gaining profit, according to Cattaneo.
Regarding the impact of oil price fluctuations on the company's activities, the CEO said that Zenith Energy has a reputation to be a low-cost operator.
"So, we are always profitable. Even when the oil prices are lower, our profit is guaranteed. This allows us to look with serenity to the future of our activity despite the oil price fluctuations," he said. "I personally think that oil prices will increase in the next 2-3 years because of the lack of investments around the globe in oil and gas exploration and development."
Speaking about staff, Cattaneo said that Zenith Aran currently employs 210 people and only a few of them (top technicians) are foreigners.
"We aim to attract young people from Azerbaijan to our company and allow them to grow and contribute to the Company's expansion in parallel with their professional development. We are very pleased to be in Azerbaijan. It is a very pleasant place to stay. Baku is a very lovely city. There is a very good climate, very good security at night and during the day" added Cattaneo.
Azerbaijan's state oil company SOCAR and Zenith Aran Oil Company signed a Rehabilitation, Exploration, Development and Production Sharing Agreement (REDPSA) in March 2016 for a block that includes the Muradkhanli, Jafarli and Zardab oilfields. These fields cover an area of 642.2 square kilometers. Production under the Zenith banner began August 11, 2016.
Zenith holds an 80 percent participating interest in the three fields within the contract area – Muradkhanli, Jafarli and Zardab – while a SOCAR Oil affiliate company (fully owned by SOCAR) retains the remaining 20 percent. The duration of the agreement is 25 years, with a potential extension of 5 additional years.

Jim Mora watched the play and had an identical reaction to that of his son, the UCLA football coach by the same name.
They both saw Bruins safety Adarius Pickett dip his upper body toward Stanford tight end Dalton Schultz's midsection as Pickett approached to make a tackle.
A moment before impact, Schultz dropped his shoulder and head to protect himself. Pickett then struck him helmet to helmet, resulting in a targeting penalty and Pickett's ejection.
Father, like son, didn't see any culpability on the part of the defender.
“He told me the other day, he said, ‘If I was to put together a clinic tape on how to tackle, Adarius Pickett's would be one of the ones I showed. It was a perfect tackle,' ” the younger Mora said of his father, a former NFL coach. “And it was a perfect tackle.”
College football installed the targeting rule for safety reasons in 2008, hoping to eliminate what is considered forcible contact to the head or neck. But its application during games — and the stiff accompanying punishment — continue to trouble some coaches and players.
Pickett was ejected during the first quarter of UCLA's loss to Stanford, with the Bruins allowing 55 points in his absence. Players who are ejected for targeting in the second half of a game must sit out the first half of their team's next game.
“You [only] get so many opportunities to play the game of football,” Pickett said, “and getting kicked out of the game, especially like that, early, that hurts.”
There are other gripes with the targeting rule. Washington State coach Mike Leach called it “micromanaging, for lack of a better word,” citing too many variables and inconsistent enforcement. Stanford coach David Shaw echoed a sentiment shared by Mora and Pickett: that there should be different levels of targeting penalties corresponding with the severity of the infraction.
“If the offensive player lowers his helmet, hey, great, put the onus on the defensive player and let's have the 15-yard penalty,” Shaw said. “But let's leave him in the game because it's obvious that he's trying not to hit the guy in the helmet, it just happened incidentally.”
David Coleman, the Pac-12 Conference's director of officials, said varying levels of targeting penalties was a topic that he expected the NCAA's rules committee to discuss after this season. Since the issue involves player safety, any rule change could be implemented for the 2018 season.
I see it is changing behavior ... players are being taught and coached to understand that they can make a play without using their head. — Dave Coleman, Pac-12 Conference director of officials, on targeting rules

This is the second season that replay officials have been allowed to initiate targeting penalties that are not called on the field. Replay officials are also responsible for confirming or overturning targeting calls made during a play.
Coleman said he believes the targeting rule is having its intended effect of making the game safer. The NCAA rule book prohibits both forcible contact with the crown of the helmet and forcible contact to the head or neck of a defenseless player.
“I see that it is changing behavior, and that's what it's all about,” Coleman said, “that players are being taught and coached to understand that they can make a play without using their head.”
UCLA has been called for four of the nine targeting penalties upheld against Pac-12 teams this season, according to qwikref.com, an online repository for tracking officials' calls. Four other targeting penalties against Pac-12 teams were waved off after being reviewed by replay officials.
With the season less than half over, the Pac-12 is on pace to surpass its 16 targeting calls that were upheld in 2016.
Coleman said he didn't view the potential increase as troubling.
“It's not a cause for concern per se,” he said. “It is an area of focus in terms of the fact that we really want to do everything we can to call these fouls when they take place.”
UCLA's Mora disputed two of the targeting calls that went against his team, including the play involving Pickett and one in which linebacker Josh Woods appeared to be turning his body at the last moment in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid helmet-to-helmet contact with a Hawaii receiver.
The Bruins also were involved with a non-call that the Pac-12 later acknowledged should have been ruled targeting against a Hawaii player for helmet-to-helmet contact that popped UCLA linebacker Kenny Young's helmet off his head before he hit the ground. Young sustained head trauma that sidelined him for the rest of the game as well as the Bruins' next game against Memphis.
USC is among the Pac-12 teams that have avoided a targeting penalty through the season's first five games. Trojans coach Clay Helton credited the team's practice methods.
“Our kids have done a good job of, one, I think being trained to protect themselves as well as others,” Helton said. “Anything to be able to help the safety of our game, I think, is important.”
Remembering to apply the proper techniques in the midst of a game can be difficult. When UCLA defensive lineman Osa Odighizuwa closed in on Memphis quarterback Riley Ferguson last month, he slammed his helmet into Ferguson's neck area before pushing him to the ground. Odighizuwa was called for targeting and ejected.
Odighizuwa said the Bruins have practiced proper tackling techniques in an effort to make them instinctive.
“The more we drill it, the more natural it will become,” Odighizuwa said, “and you won't really have to think about it as much and I think that's what's going to help a lot, making it a natural thing to aim lower. That's kind of the point of the rule.”
Pickett learned that sometimes the aiming and contact points can be different, leading to ejections for what otherwise would have been routine football plays.
“We have to accelerate the movement toward a resolution,” UCLA's Mora said, “because we are hurting young men's ability to go out and play in games that are important to their future.”

Sentencing arguments are set to take place Wednesday in the corruption case for former Montreal mayor Michael Applebaum.
Applebaum was found guilty on eight corruption related charges in January.
READ MORE: Former Montreal mayor Michael Applebaum found guilty of corruption, breach of trust
The charges stem from crimes that occurred in two separate deals between 2007 and 2010 when Applebaum was mayor of Côte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Montreal's largest borough.
Applebaum's former chief of staff Hugo Tremblay was a key witness in the trial and the only one who could directly implicate Applebaum to the crimes.
Defence lawyer Pierre Teasdale told the trial in November that the Crown's evidence was weak and depended on witnesses who testified against Applebaum to save their own skin.
The Crown alleged Applebaum accepted cash through a former aide in return for favours given to local real-estate developers and engineering firms.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India is not in talks with the government to conduct open market purchases of government bonds, a source familiar with the central bank's thinking said, denying a media report that the central bank might consider such steps to boost the debt market.
Financial news provider Newsrise cited a senior finance ministry official as saying that the RBI might buy bonds through open market operations and in secondary markets to support New Delhi's borrowing programme.
But a source familiar with the RBI's thinking said there were no current talks with the government about bond purchases.
The source also said no decision had been taken to increase the foreign investment limit in debt. NewsRise had separately reported the government and the RBI were in talks to raise the limit for foreign investment in sovereign debt, citing an interview with Economic Affairs Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg.
Bonds fell, sending yields higher, after the Reuters report, in a day of whipsaw trading.
The benchmark 10-year bond yield had earlier risen as much as 8 basis points to 7.60 percent, before falling to as low as 7.49 percent after the NewsRise reports. The yield was last trading at 7.55 percent.
A finance ministry official declined to comment.
The rupee also trimmed its gains to trade at 64.05/06 to the dollar after touching a high of 63.72 earlier in the day.
Bond investors are on edge ahead of the Reserve Bank of India's policy review on Feb. 6-7 amid worries about whether the central bank would become more hawkish on inflation after the 2018/19 budget presented on Thursday raised spending for agriculture and lifted minimum support prices for crops.
India's bond market has slumped in recent months, with bond yields having risen as much as 117 points since the end of June due to concerns about rising inflation, tightening liquidity and worries about the government's fiscal deficit.
Investors now fear sentiment could weaken even further after India on Thursday widened its fiscal deficit target for the year starting in April to 3.3 percent of gross domestic product from its previously mentioned projection of 3.0 percent.
The falls and a budget that disappointed are leading to hopes the RBI or the government could take steps to support markets, especially as state-run lenders, the biggest bond investors, have significantly pared debt purchases because of likely hefty mark-to-market losses in their portfolios.
Any move towards bond purchases would be especially welcome after recent comments from Deputy Governor Viral Acharya warning about the potential losses being suffered by state-run banks in government debt, which markets interpreted as signalling to state banks to pare bond holdings.
A foreign bank trader said that if the central banks buy debt, it would be “great news” for markets.

Indian cricket added another feather to its cap on Saturday as the U-19 team led by Prithvi Shaw defeated Australia by eight wickets in Mount Maunganui to clinch the World Cup. The Indian bowlers did a fantastic job to start with in the final, restricting the Aussies to a modest 216, before Manjot Kalra put the rival bowlers to the sword.
The stylish left-handed opener cracked an unbeaten 101 off 102 balls — an innings studded with eight fours and three sixes. The Australian attack lacked venom and a catch was grassed too. In the end India romped home with plenty to spare. The win on Saturday capped a tremendous campaign for the Indians, which saw them breeze through one match after another. Australia (twice), Papua New Guinea, Zimbabwe, Bangladesh and Pakistan all fell by the wayside, as Rahul Dravid's proteges rode roughshhod over all opposition.
This win put some balm on the heartbreak two years back when the India colts went down meekly to the West Indies in the final. India is now the only country to win the U-19 World Cup four times (2000, 2008, 2012 and 2018). They were the runners-up in 2006 and 2016. As was expected, Twitterati went on the overdrive, celebrating India's triumph to their heart's content. Here is a collection of tweets:

Snapchat is on track to hold the biggest-ever initial public offering of stock for a Los Angeles company, yet none of the region's major start-up investors stand to profit.
Of the nearly $3 billion that Snap Inc. has raised from investors for technology and hiring ahead of next month's expected IPO, almost none of it has come from Los Angeles financiers.
The county's leading venture capital firms — the investors that technology entrepreneurs often turn to for money and advice — knew the photo-messaging app had become a hit among teenagers. But for a variety of reasons, they passed on financially supporting the company.
Between Snapchat's founding at Stanford University in the spring of 2011 and its rise to the global stage in 2013, Los Angeles firms had a short window to get a sizable piece of the company.
At Upfront Ventures, the largest start-up investor based in Los Angeles, associate James Bailey urged managing partner Mark Suster to take a meeting with Snapchat. But Suster dismissed the app as tool for sexting and furthering marital infidelity.
CrossCut Ventures and Clearstone Venture Partners didn't have enough free cash to make a bet on Snapchat. For many firms including Baroda Ventures, CT Ventures and Rustic Canyon Partners, a chat app with no business plan in sight didn't fit the profile of a company they'd back.
“We did not see the real revenue potential back then,” CT's Alex Suh said.
The missed opportunities don't amount to a damning indictment of the region's ability to spot world-changing start-ups. If anything, they illustrate how much of an anomaly Snapchat maker Snap Inc. is by technology industry standards.
But the lack of local representation means that hundreds of millions of dollars in possible investment profits, as early shareholders now become free to sell their holdings, will instead flow through Silicon Valley, bolstering the region's booming start-up scene.
“You'd have to be an idiot to say I'm not bummed, but we're very positive on the emergence of Snapchat,” Suster said.
Stanford University fraternity brothers Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy began working while students there on what would become one of the world's most used photo-and-video-sharing apps.
The university has long bred start-ups and connected students to the tech industry. Spiegel and Murphy took advantage. One of Spiegel's classes introduced him to top industry leaders, including Alphabet's Eric Schmidt. And Murphy worked at a San Francisco start-up during the early days of Snapchat.
In 2013, the pair planted corporate headquarters in Los Angeles, where Spiegel grew up and saw potential for Snapchat to benefit from its cultural diversity and Hollywood connections. But their acquaintances and roots remained in the San Francisco Bay Area, said William Quigley, a managing partner at Clearstone.
The ties included the company's first funding — a nearly $500,000 check from Silicon Valley shop Lightspeed Venture Partners that valued Snapchat at about $4 million. Lightspeed partner Barry Eggers had heard that the app was taking off in Southern California high schools (Spiegel's young cousin in Orange County had been among early promoters).
Eggers shared the tip with his colleague Jeremy Liew, who tried repeatedly to get in touch with Spiegel before sending a Facebook message and getting a quick reply. Spiegel responded in part because Liew's profile picture with President Obama made him seem legitimate. Needing cash to expand the company to keep up with huge usage growth, Spiegel accepted Lightspeed's investment.
As part of the IPO, Lightspeed could generate a 5,000-fold return on its initial investment. A 20-times return is enough to be considered a success.
Snapchat wanted more money at the end of 2012, and Liew and other Bay Area connections had already made the start-up the talk of the town despite its base in Los Angeles.
“They had the luxury of picking who they wanted to work with,” said Peter Lee, managing partner at Baroda Ventures.
Spiegel also held a “a relatively dim view of Los Angeles venture capitalists' ability to understand the opportunity and advise on tactical choices,” said Bailey, now managing partner of Velos Partners. “Right or wrong, he felt they were out of touch on social and mobile platforms.”
Silicon Valley venture capital firms held stronger reputations, longer track records and deeper pockets, now with several $1-billion funds compared to L.A.'s none.
“Los Angeles firms couldn't compete in that realm,” Lee said.
CrossCut Ventures was managing about $5 million, a pittance compared with the $425-million fund of Benchmark, Snap's eventual investor in its early 2013 financing. CrossCut was telling potential investors in its fund that there would be a big company in Los Angeles someday, not realizing it would be the one already down the street, managing partner Rick Smith said. But he's among those who say Snap is an aberration because of its move from Stanford, the timing and its unique service.
Clearstone's Quigley knew that the Snapchat investment would be expensive and didn't try to get a meeting with the company.

At Upfront, Bailey saw his two brothers — one of whom was in Spiegel's Stanford fraternity — open the app 15 times a day during vacation. Bailey told Suster of the rabid usage and Snapchat's key differences from Facebook.
But Suster felt troubled about backing a company associated with sexting, since the self-destructing messaging app first gained attention as a way to more securely send nude photos. In the back of his mind was a pitch he'd recently heard from TigerText, a disappearing text-messaging app he said was named after golfer Tiger Woods, whose philandering had been documented in raunchy texts.
Though people still use Snapchat for those reasons, the company added photo editing and entertainment features that turned the app into much more than a sexting service.
“I thought Snapchat was picture-based TigerText,” Suster said. “I wrote it off and didn't take it seriously. But I don't feel too badly about it. It was just a wrong judgment call.”
Snap declined to comment for this story.
Other Los Angeles investors passed because their aversion to “a moonshot mentality” encourages safer investments, said David Siemer, managing partner at Santa Monica investment group Wavemaker Partners.
“You will miss a Snapchat but you will also miss a whole bunch of zeroes," he said, referring to exciting start-ups that flame out and don't produce profits for investors. “It would be very unlikely that we invested in a company that needs $100 million to get to one penny of revenue.”
Silicon Valley funds with more cash to spend and powerful industry relationships can afford a different mentality.
KITCHENER — Police have released images of two men they want to speak to in connection with a break and enter at a Kitchener house in which credit cards were stolen and used shortly after at a convenience store.
Waterloo Regional Police said the house on Homewood Avenue was broken into on March 8.
Several items were stolen, including credit cards that were used at a convenience store.
The homeowners were sleeping inside at the time.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Ahmedabad on Tuesday and undertake a sea-plane journey from the Sabarmati river on the last day of campaigning for the Gujarat Assembly elections. Modi will travel to Dharoi Dam in Mehsana district by the seaplane, the first-ever flight by such a craft in the country. His return journey would also be by the same seaplane.
He will land at the Sabarmati river at 9.30 am, and will then go to the Dharoi dam and offer prayers at the Ambaji temple.
Tomorrow at 9:30 AM I will travel from Sabarmati River in Ahmedabad to Dharoi Dam via seaplane. After that will offer prayers to Maa Amba at Ambaji. With air, roads & rail connectivity, our Government is making efforts for harnessing waterways. All this is for 125 crore Indians!
— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) December 11, 2017
Modi's plans of using a seaplane in Ahmedabad came a day after the city police denied him permission to hold a mega roadshow in the city.
The police cited congested roads and communally sensitive areas that fall enroute as the reason. The move comes in the backdrop of inputs gathered by central intelligence agencies that a "lone wolf" may try to target roadshows of "big political leaders" during the campaigning for the upcoming elections.
According to a report on NDTV, Modi took a dig at the Congress as well, saying the party cannot even "imagine" development work like the sea-plane. "We won't be able to build airports everywhere so we will focus on waterways," he said.
He added as many as 106 such waterways have been planned in the country.
Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani said this is for the first time in the history of the country that a sea-plane will land on a water body and that will be the Sabarmati river. "Modi will travel in the plane to Dharoi. He will visit Ambaji temple and come back from Dharoi to Sabarmati in the same plane," Rupani said.
The Congress also confirmed that it had sought permission for Gandhi's roadshow and corner meetings. "We will adhere to the decision taken by the administration and the programme stands cancelled," Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said.
He said Gandhi was not facing any security threat in Gujarat. "As far as Gandhi is concerned, he is not facing any security threat as conceived by the Gujarat Police. The kind of affection he has got in Gujarat is unsurmountable," he said, adding that since "Modiji is a big person, the police may be concerned about his security".

The Dover-bound “Pride of Kent” had run aground on a sand bank around midday as she tried to leave the Calais harbour in stormy weather. Nobody was injured.
The ship, supported by two tug boats, was refloated as the tide came in early evening and all passengers have disembarked.
The spokesman said most passengers would continue their journey to the UK on other P&O ferries tonight, while some would stay overnight in Calais on P&O's expense.
UK-based P&O operates 20 ferries which carry nine million passengers per year between France, Belgium, The Netherlands and across the Irish Sea.

According to an ECP official, so far 85 senators, 233 members of the National Assembly, 202 members of the Punjab Assembly, 104 members of the Sindh Assembly, 74 members of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly and 50 members of Balochistan Assembly had submitted their yearly statements with the ratio of 63.71 percent.
He said that still 419 parliamentarians did not submit their
yearly statements including 17 senators, 106 MNAs, 167 Punjab Assembly members, 64 Sindh Assembly members, 50 KPK Assembly members and 15 Balochistan Assembly members.
He said presently there were total 1,174 parliamentarians
including 104 senators, 342 MNAs, 371 Punjab Assembly members, 168 Sindh Assembly members, 124 KPK Assembly members and 65 Balochistan Assembly members.
He said that still seven seats were lying vacant in Senate,
national and provincial assemblies.
He said the commission had directed the members of the
parliament and provincial assemblies to submit yearly statements of assets and liabilities of their own, spouses and dependents.
The defaulters would be suspended from respective seats of
assemblies as this was a mandatory requirement under Section 42A of the Representation of the People Act, 1976 and Section 25A of the Senate (Election) Act, 1975.
He said the members of the Senate, National Assembly and
provincial assemblies of the Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan had been asked to submit with the Election Commission Secretariat yearly statements of assets and liabilities of their own, their spouses and dependents on the prescribed form.

Election Commission Secretariat, Islamabad and offices of Provincial Election Commissioners in each province.
He added forms had already been sent to the Senate
Secretariat, National Assembly Secretariat and secretariats of all the four provincial assemblies for facility of parliamentarians.
On Monday, Christine Harvey, a resident of Malden, Mass., was experiencing intense stomach cramps. She decided that she should seek medical attention, and arranged for a friend to pick her up and take her to the hospital. But her friend didn't arrive soon enough — Harvey ended up delivering a six-pound, six-ounce baby girl on the sidewalk. She didn't even know she was pregnant.
WATCH BELOW: Transgender man talks about being pregnant
“She usually doesn't go crazy over pain, but she was really hurting,” Harvey's boyfriend, Doug Rogers, said to ABC affiliate WCVB5. “I called a friend to come get her. She walked over there [to the sidewalk] and the baby came.”
Rogers, who stayed behind to look after their other two children, called the surprise birth “a miracle.”
“I held her. I was like ‘Huh?' But she's gorgeous,” he said.
What Harvey experienced is called a cryptic pregnancy — although to be very specific, she experienced a cryptic delivery. Cryptic pregnancies are more common than you might think. Research shows that one in every 475 pregnancies in the U.S. is cryptic, while one in 2,500 is a cryptic delivery.
Dr. Kimberly Dever, chair of obstetrics and gynecology at South Shore Hospital in South Weymouth, Mass., said the hospital sees “several” cases of cryptic pregnancies every year.
“We do about 3,500 births a year, and we probably see this a few times a year,” she said to The Washington Post.
These cases aren't chalked up to women who are in denial or who have mental health disorders, either.

“The hormonal imbalance caused by something like poly cystic ovarian syndrome or peri-menopause could cause low hCG [the hormone the body makes when it's pregnant], which would result in a negative pregnancy test,” Dr. Kristen Kaploun, a Burlington, Ont.-based clinical psychologist who specializes in treatment for perinatal anxiety, said to Global News. “It's not associated with any particular mental health disorder. The commonality is the underlying hormonal imbalance.”
Medical practitioners also point to extreme stress as a cause of a cryptic pregnancy, and cite examples of women who have given birth on the front lines of a war zone without ever knowing they were pregnant.
That could have been the case in 2012, when British soldier Lynette Pearce, a bombardier in the Royal Artillery, gave birth at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan. An adept sportswoman who prided herself on besting soldiers who were much bigger than her, Pearce started gaining weight before being deployed to Afghanistan, and a friend said to the Daily Mail that it was distressing because she couldn't understand why.
“At the time Lynette was really confused. A baby was growing inside her, that was why she was putting on weight, but Lynette had no idea at the time she was carrying her son.”
She didn't know until she delivered him in the army base field hospital. At the time, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Defence said: “It is not military policy to allow servicewomen to deploy on operations if they are pregnant. In this instance the MoD was unaware of her pregnancy.”

In other cases, irregular menstrual cycles could be to blame. While both Kayley Straker and Nadia Watson, two British women who had cryptic deliveries, said they continued to get their period regularly during their pregnancies, it is possible that if their regular cycles manifest in light bleeding or spotting, they could have menstruated throughout their pregnancies and been none the wiser.
“This is regarded as one of those ‘how could she not know?' things, but it does happen,” Kaploun says. “But there's not psychological profile linked to it. If anything, the psychological effects would happen after the birth, because all of a sudden these women have a baby and they have nothing planned or prepared. In those instances, I could see there being a need for psychological intervention.”

Friends Eric Deverich and Mark Corritori at Dodger Stadium before the Dodgers' first NLDS game against the Arizona Diamondbacks.
Coming to Dodger Stadium makes Mark Corritori feel like a kid again.
Walking to his seat for the Dodgers' Postseason opener against the Arizona Diamondbacks, Corritori, a 59-year-old salesman from Moorpark, wore a jersey with dozens of pins from games dating back to the 1970s. The jersey had number 88 -- representing 1988, the last year the Dodgers won the World Series.
He's hoping he'll need a 2017 jersey.
"I have a feeling we're going to win it this year," said the lifelong Southern California resident. "It's our time. We came out of our slump, and we're on a roll now."
Corritori was at the game with his best buddy and neighbor, Eric Deverich, who was sporting a Dodgers-themed Hawaiian shirt. Asked how they felt during the Dodgers' late-season losing streak, Deverich laughed and said, "Miserable."
Corritori said he's always positive.
"I think every year the team stands out," he said. "I'm always optimistic about it, one way or another."
His dad brought him to his first game at Dodger Stadium when he was 6 years old in 1965, a year the Dodgers won the World Series. He still has the program from that game.
"The whole atmosphere, it makes me feel like a kid again," said Corritori, as fans streamed into the stadium, which is decorated in the Postseason red, white and blue bunting.
Corritori's dad was a huge Brooklyn Dodgers fan who moved to Los Angeles in 1956, two years before his team did. His dad has a Brooklyn Dodgers jersey with the number 55 -- the last year the team won the World Series in New York.

The memo released by the House Intelligence Committee makes several claims that are in dispute. Here are key points in the debate. Purpose This memorandum provides Members an update on significant facts relating to the Committee's ongoing investigation into the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and their use of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) during the 2016 presidential election cycle. Our findings, which are detailed below, 1) raise concerns with the legitimacy and legality of certain DOJ and FBI interactions with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), and 2) represent a troubling breakdown of legal processes established to protect the American people from abuses related to the FISA process.
David Lauter Washington Bureau Chief Notably, this memo by the Intelligence Committee majority staff does not assert that the DoJ and FBI actions were illegitimate or illegal, just that they "raise concerns."
Investigation Update On October 21, 2016, DOJ and FBI sought and received a FISA probable cause order (not under Title VII) authorizing electronic surveillance on Carter Page from the FISC. Page is a U.S. citizen who served as a volunteer advisor to the Trump presidential campaign. Consistent with requirements under FISA, the application had to be first certified by the Director or Deputy Director of the FBI. It then required the approval of the Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General (DAG), or the Senate-confirmed Assistant Attorney General for the National Security Division.
Lauter The date is significant because Page was no longer working for the Trump campaign at this point. Trump's supporters have argued that the surveillance was improper because it was targeted at his campaign.
The FBI and DOJ obtained one initial FISA warrant targeting Carter Page and three FISA renewals from the FISC.
Lauter The fact that the FISA court renewed the warrant on Page three times was not previously on the record and is significant. That means the federal judges who have been assigned to the FISA court on four separate occasions decided that prosecutors had met the legal standard of showing evidence of probable cause to believe that Page was "a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power.” As required by statute (50 U.S.C. §,1805(d)(1)), a FISA order on an American citizen must be renewed by the FISC every 90 days and each renewal requires a separate finding of probable cause. Then-Director James Comey signed three FISA applications in question on behalf of the FBI, and Deputy Director Andrew McCabe signed one. Then-DAG Sally Yates, then-Acting DAG Dana Boente, and DAG Rod Rosenstein each signed one or more PISA applications on behalf of DOJ.
Due to the sensitive nature of foreign intelligence activity, FISA submissions (including renewals) before the FISC are classified. As such, the public's confidence in the integrity of the FISA process depends on the court's ability to hold the government to the highest standard­ – particularly as it relates to surveillance of American citizens. However, the FISC's rigor in protecting the rights of Americans, which is reinforced by 90-day renewals of surveillance orders, is necessarily dependent on the government's production to the court of all material and relevant facts. This should include information potentially favorable to the target of the FISA application that is known by the government. In the case of Carter Page, the government had at least four independent opportunities before the FISC to accurately provide an accounting of the relevant facts. However, our findings indicate that, as described below, material and relevant information was omitted.
1) The "dossier" compiled by Christopher Steele (Steele dossier) on behalf of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the Hillary Clinton campaign formed an essential part of the Carter Page FISA application.
Lauter This is one of the memo's key, contested assertions. Republicans say the material in the Steele dossier was "essential" for the warrant application; Democrats say it was just one piece of evidence among several. The actual evidence to tell whether this statement is true or false would be the warrant affidavit, which remains highly classified.
Steele was a longtime FBI source who was paid over $160,000 by the DNC and Clinton campaign, via the law firm Perkins Coie and research firm Fusion GPS, to obtain derogatory information on Donald Trump's ties to Russia. a) Neither the initial application in October 2016, nor any of the renewals, disclose or reference the role of the DNC, Clinton campaign, or any party/campaign in funding Steele's efforts, even though the political origins of the Steele dossier were then known to senior DOJ and FBI officials.
Lauter Without seeing the application, there's no way to verify if this statement is true. But legal experts have also noted that a judge reviewing a warrant application might not find the question of who paid Steele relevant. Warrants often rely on information given to law enforcement officials by informants, and informants typically have ulterior motives. That's not a new issue for judges.
b) The initial FISA application notes Steele was working for a named U.S. person, but does not name Fusion GPS and principal Glenn Simpson, who was paid by a U.S. law firm (Perkins Coie) representing the DNC (even though it was known by DOJ at the time that political actors were involved with the Steele dossier). The application does not mention Steele was ultimately working on behalf of – and paid by – the DNC and Clinton campaign, or that the FBI had separately authorized payment to Steele for the same information. 2) The Carter Page FISA application also cited extensively a September 23, 2016, Yahoo News article by Michael Isikoff , which focuses on Page's July 2016 trip to Moscow. This article does not corroborate the Steele dossier because it is derived from information leaked by Steele himself to Yahoo News. The Page FISA application incorrectly assesses that Steele did not directly provide information to Yahoo News. Steele has admitted in British court filings that he met with Yahoo News – and several other outlets – in September 2016 at the direction of Fusion GPS. Perkins Coie was aware of Steele's initial media contacts because they hosted at least one meeting in Washington D.C. in 2016 with Steele and Fusion GPS where this matter was discussed. a) Steele was suspended and then terminated as an FBI source for what the FBI defines as the most serious of violations – an unauthorized disclosure to the media of his relationship with the FBI in an October 30, 2016, Mother Jones article by David Com. Steele should have been terminated for his previous undisclosed contacts with Yahoo and other outlets in September – before the Page application was submitted to the FISC in October – but Steele improperly concealed from and lied to the FBI about those contacts.
Lauter As with the payment issue, the legal question here is whether a judge would consider this relevant in weighing the evidence presented in the application for a warrant.
b) Steele's numerous encounters with the media violated the cardinal rule of source handling – maintaining confidentiality – and demonstrated that Steele had become a less than reliable source for the FBI. 3) Before and after Steele was terminated as a source, he maintained contact with DOJ via then-Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr, a senior DOJ official who worked closely with Deputy Attorneys General Yates and later Rosenstein. Shortly after the election, the FBI began interviewing Ohr, documenting his communications with Steele. For example, in September 2016, Steele admitted to Ohr his feelings against then­ candidate Trump when Steele said he "was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president." This clear evidence of Steele's bias was recorded by Ohr at the time and subsequently in official FBI files – but not reflected in any of the Page FISA applications.
Lauter The key question here is whether Steele was biased against Trump before or after he conducted his investigation. If he began the investigation with a bias, that would raise questions about his credibility. If he became "desperate that Donald Trump not get elected" because his investigation convinced him that Trump was subject to Russian blackmail, that would be a different matter. a) During this same time period, Ohr's wife was employed by Fusion GPS to assist in the cultivation of opposition research on Trump. Ohr later provided the FBI with all of his wife's opposition research, paid for by the DNC and Clinton campaign via Fusion GPS. The Ohrs' relationship with Steele and Fusion GPS was inexplicably concealed from the FISC.
4) According to the head of the FBI's counterintelligence division, Assistant Director Bill Priestap, corroboration of the Steele dossier was in its "infancy" at the time of the initial Page FISA application. After Steele was terminated, a source validation report conducted by an independent unit within FBI assessed Steele's reporting as only minimally corroborated. Yet, in early January 2017, Director Comey briefed President-elect Trump on a summary of the Steele dossier, even though it was – according to his June 2017 testimony – "salacious and unverified." While the FISA application relied on Steele's past record of credible reporting on other unrelated matters, it ignored or concealed his anti-Trump financial and ideological motivations. Furthermore, Deputy Director McCabe testified before the Committee in December 2017 that no surveillance warrant would have been sought from the FISC without the Steele dossier information.
Lauter It's notable that the memo does not quote McCabe's testimony, but merely purports to summarize it. The committee has not released a transcript of what McCabe said. Democrats say the memo's summary of McCabe's words is misleading. The statement that "no surveillance warrant would have been sought" could mean that the Steele dossier was crucial to meet the standard of probable cause. If McCabe said that, it would significantly bolster the Republican case. But the statement could also mean that the FBI, which had other things on its plate, wouldn't have moved quickly to get a warrant for surveillance on Steele if not for the dossier, but had plenty of evidence without it. Or it could mean something else entirely. Without McCabe's actual words, which the committee has, the meaning is uncertain.
5) The Page FISA application also mentions information regarding fellow Trump campaign advisor George Papadopoulos, but there is no evidence of any cooperation or conspiracy between Page and Papadopoulos. The Papadopoulos information triggered the opening of an FBI counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016 by FBI agent Pete Strzok.
Lauter This statement cuts against the Republican case. It confirms that the FBI began its investigation because of information related to Papadopoulos, who is now cooperating with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, not because of the Steele dossier.
Strzok was reassigned by the Special Counsel's Office to FBI Human Resources for improper text messages with his mistress, FBI Attorney Lisa Page (no known relation to Carter Page), where they both demonstrated a clear bias against Trump and in favor of Clinton, whom Strzok had also investigated. The Strzok/Lisa Page texts also reflect extensive discussions about the investigation, orchestrating leaks to the media, and include a meeting with Deputy Director McCabe to discuss an "insurance" policy against President Trump's election.
Lauter The meaning of Peter Strzok's reference to an "insurance policy" has been hotly debated. Moreover, the existence of the text messages doesn't add evidence to the debate over the warrant, which might have been completely valid even if the agents didn't like Trump.

Final scores might not matter in the preseason, but individual performances sure do. Careers can be made, opportunities can be seized and depth charts can be decided in the exhibition contests leading up to the first kickoff that counts. To help put these moments into context, Bucky Brooks will provide a grade for one player of interest from every NFL team after each of the first three full weeks of preseason action.
Below, see player grades for each AFC team from Week 1:
BALTIMORE RAVENS
Ryan Mallett, QB: The shaky training camp for the seventh-year pro continued with a lackluster performance against Washington. Mallett connected on nine of his 18 throws for just 58 yards, without a completion longer than 11 yards. Despite leading his team to 13 points and taking good care of the football, Mallett missed too many layups and still struggles with his consistency as a passer. Grade: C+
BUFFALO BILLS
Nathan Peterman, QB: The fifth-round pick out of Pittsburgh continues to make a favorable impression on his teammates and coaches with his work on the field. He completed 13 of 25 passes for 112 yards and a touchdown against the Vikings, directing one 13-play, 79-yard TD drive that showcased his ability to manage the game. Peterman showed nice touch and anticipation as a rhythm passer, particularly on his one-yard touchdown to Dezmin Lewis. Grade: B
CINCINNATI BENGALS
Joe Mixon, RB: The ultra-talented runner gave the football world a glimpse as his big-play potential in a brief performance against Tampa Bay that saw him total 42 scrimmage yards on seven touches. Mixon flashed nifty footwork, balance and body control running between the tackles, while also displaying outstanding strength and power. The rookie turned a dump-off pass into a first down with a spectacular "make you miss" exhibition in the open field. Grade: B+
CLEVELAND BROWNS
DeShone Kizer, QB: The second-round pick truly entered the conversation as the team's starting quarterback with a strong debut performance that showcased his A-plus arm talent and athleticism. Kizer completed 11 of 18 passes for 184 yards and a touchdown against New Orleans' backups. While he had a few misfires that exhibited some of the accuracy issues he struggled with at Notre Dame, he definitely flashed the big arm and range that scouts raved about during the pre-draft process. Grade: B
DENVER BRONCOS
Paxton Lynch, QB: The second-year pro didn't gain an edge on Trevor Siemian in the QB1 competition, but he made a solid impression on team officials with his play in Chicago. After a slow start, Lynch finished the night with six completions on nine throws for 42 yards. Although he didn't push the action down the field, the big-bodied passer was efficient getting the ball to his playmakers on the perimeter. And he avoided the kind of big mistake/turnover that has plagued him at times. Grade: B
HOUSTON TEXANS
Deshaun Watson, QB: The Texans' first-round pick created a lot of excitement with his pro debut at Carolina. He connected on 15 of 25 passes for 179 yards and added a rushing touchdown, displaying the confidence, poise and composure that made him a big winner at the collegiate level. He displayed solid skills as a quick-rhythm passer from the pocket and a pinpoint thrower on the move, but Watson still needs to work on his ability to make accurate throws down the field. Grade: A
INDIANAPOLIS COLTS
Scott Tolzien, QB: The Colts should have serious concerns about their QB2 spot, based on Tolzien's play against Detroit. The veteran couldn't find his rhythm in the pocket and the offense failed to move under his direction. Although Tolzien only played a few series and didn't have a complete supporting cast at his disposal, you expect more from a veteran QB during a preseason opener that features vanilla looks from the opponent. Grade: D
JACKSONVILLE JAGUARS
Leonard Fournette, RB: During his debut performance against New England, Fournette showed some of the skills that made him the No. 4 overall pick in April. The Jaguars' RB1 rushed for 31 yards on nine carries and scored a one-yard touchdown to cap off an impressive drive. Most importantly, he displayed the combination of strength, power, balance and body control that do indeed make him an NFL rushing title candidate in Year 1. Grade: B+
KANSAS CITY CHIEFS
Patrick Mahomes, QB: The ultra-talented gunslinger was pretty impressive in his debut outing against San Francisco. Mahomes quickly found his rhythm by hitting a few layups (bubble screens) before showing off his gun on some rhythm throws at intermediate distance. While he misfired on a few slants near the red zone, Mahomes' arm talent and athleticism certainly stood out on tape. Grade: B+
LOS ANGELES CHARGERS
Cardale Jones, QB: The Chargers' recent trade acquisition didn't impress in his debut performance with the team. Jones completed just two of his nine passes and looked nothing like a potential QB2. He misfired on handful of throws to open receivers in the flats and couldn't find his rhythm as a pocket passer. While Jones is still adjusting to a new offense after coming over from Buffalo last month, Jones must play better to seize the backup job from Kellen Clemens. Grade: C
MIAMI DOLPHINS
Leonte Carroo, WR: The second-year pro was only targeted once vs. Atlanta, but he snagged a 33-yard touchdown on that lone opportunity. Carroo made a nice adjustment on the underthrown pass from Brandon Doughty, exhibiting nice ball skills and tracking ability down the boundary. With the 2016 third-round pick building on the momentum created throughout training camp, the Dolphins should be encouraged by his progress to this point. Grade: B
NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS
Jimmy Garoppolo, QB: The prized potential QB1 teased prospective teams with his combination of arm talent, athleticism and pocket poise. Garoppolo connected on 22 of 28 pass attempts for 235 yards and two touchdowns and zero picks, exhibiting a wide array of skills as a pinpoint passer inside and outside of the pocket. With the fourth-year pro showing the football world that he can make every throw in the book, the buzz will continue to build about his prospects as a franchise quarterback in New England or elsewhere in the near future. Grade: A
NEW YORK JETS
Christian Hackenberg, QB: The Jets' much-maligned young quarterback silenced his critics for the moment with a solid performance against Tennessee. Hackenberg completed 18 of 25 passes for 127 yards on an assortment of short, quick-rhythm throws that showcased his improved decisiveness from the pocket. Although Hackenberg missed a few downfield throws, he has made some progress as a pro passer in Year 2. Grade: B
OAKLAND RAIDERS
Karl Joseph, S: The hard-hitting safety looks like he is ready to break out in his second season, based on his performance in the Raiders' preseason opener against Arizona. Joseph delivered a handful of "bang bang" hits on the Cardinals' skill players, exhibiting the power and pop that's expected from an enforcer. With Joseph healthy and spry in the back end, the Raiders' secondary should be improved in 2017. Grade: B
PITTSBURGH STEELERS
T.J. Watt, OLB: The hard-working edge defender finished with three tackles, two sacks and a pass breakup, showing off the energy and hand skills that made him one of the top pass rushers in this draft class. Watt's relentlessness, strength and athleticism stood out in his debut vs. the Giants. This is what the Steelers had in mind when they selected J.J.'s little brother with the 30th overall pick in April. Grade: A-
TENNESSEE TITANS
Taywan Taylor, WR: The speedster might've been the Titans' lone bright spot in a disappointing offensive performance against the Jets. Taylor finished the night with 56 receiving yards on four receptions, including a spectacular 42-yard grab that highlighted his speed, ball skills and leaping ability. As a legitimate vertical threat with speed to burn, Taylor's debut could help him earn a permanent role as the team's deep-ball specialist. Grade: B

Rowan Atkinson's Maigret failed to match up to rival drama Line Of Duty in the ratings as it returned on Sunday night.
The crime drama, which aired on ITV at 8pm for two hours, was praised by fans, although it only scored an average audience of 3.8 million viewers according to overnight ratings.
This number includes those watching on catch-up channel ITV +1.
Line Of Duty's dramatic episode, the fourth of the current series, was the highest rated show of the night.
According to overnight data, 5.7 million viewers tuned in to watch the hour-long episode at 9pm, with a 27.3% audience share compared with Maigret's share of 18.5%.
It has previously been beaten in the ratings on a weekly basis by ITV's Vera, which finished last week.
The numbers for Line Of Duty are expected to rise when those watching on iPlayer are later taken into account.
The first episode of the fourth series had been watched by an average of five million viewers in the overnight figures, but consolidated numbers later showed it had been seen by 7.4 million.
Atkinson reprised his role as the pipe-smoking French detective Maigret after receiving mixed reviews upon his debut last year, and was this time given a thumbs-up by viewers.
Fans were delighted with his performance in the episode, entitled Night At The Crossroads, and many said they would happily forget the actor's famous comedy roles Mr Bean and Blackadder for the drama.
One fan wrote on Twitter: "Rowan Atkinson is such a great actor, I forget he was Mr Bean unlike someother people lol."
Another said: "Outstanding performance by Rowan Atkinson in #Maigret.
"So good, I never expect him to say, 'wibble'."
Meanwhile, Line Of Duty viewers were enthralled by the episode, which saw DS Steve Arnott (Martin Compston) wake up after being brutally attacked and falling down several flights of stairs in the previous instalment.
One viewer enthused on Twitter: "Thank the lord I managed to catch @Line_of_duty before I saw any spoilers. What an episode. Might have been the best yet?"
Another said: "Wow, wow, wow! @Line_of_duty How could you possibly top that.Just brilliant all involved and breath. that Steve Arnott is 5 alive!"
Over on BBC Two, one million viewers watched the grand finale of Robot Wars at 7pm - which saw Team Carbide crowned the champion.
Low milk fat, also known as milk fat depression, is a substantial and relatively long-term drop in milk fat concentration, to a level below what is considered normal for a herd of cows at that stage of lactation.
Rather than an individual cow problem, this drop in milk fat occurs throughout the herd, while milk protein concentration, milk yield and intakes remain stable.
Trouw Nutrition GrassWatch studies have shown the highest risk period for this is during April and May grazing. As low milk fat is difficult to correct, it is important to consider preventative measures at turnout.
So why does it occur during spring grazing? There is no single cause of low milk fat, but rather a combination of dietary components in spring grass.
l As spring grass is generally low in fibre and high in sugars, the rumen microbes change so that the volatile fatty acids they produce drive milk yield, rather than support milk fat production.
l Spring grass can have a high polyunsaturated fatty acid content, and these can escape the rumen and inhibit milk fat production
l A drop in rumen pH (rumen acidosis) can change the rumen microbial population so that these polyunsaturated fatty acids escape the rumen and inhibit milk fat production. The lower fibre content of spring grass means cows ruminate less and produce less salivary buffers. A high concentrate feeding rate in-parlour is also a risk factor for rumen acidosis and can exacerbate herd milk fat depression. Over half of Irish dairy cows are affected by acidosis and subacute acidosis during grazing.
When low herd milk fat occurs, these changes in the rumen microbes have already occurred therefore, it is very difficult to make any dietary changes to aid in the recovery of milk fat composition. Many herds report that despite adding dietary fibre (straw, citrus pulp, beet pulp or soya hulls) or rumen health additives (yeasts or rumen buffers), milk fat composition never completely recovers for the rest of the grazing season. Rumen bypass fats can be successfully used to improve milk fat percentage, but it is important to consider the economics of feeding them, and not to feed too much as they can impair rumen fermentation.
Trouw Nutrition can analyze the quality of grass for the risk factors responsible for milk fat depression, which are Rumen Fermentable Carbohydrate (RFC), Acid Load, Fibre Index and Rumen Unsaturated Fatty Acid Load (RUFAL). The results are displayed as a NutriOpt GrassWatch Butterfat Risk Alert table.
Due to the difficulties in restoring milk fat percentage, it is important to take a nutritionist's advice and make dietary changes to prevent the changes in rumen microflora from happening. As mentioned before, there is no single cause of low herd milk fat therefore, prevention should take account of a number of strategies. Providing straw or fibrous silage around milking time as a buffer feed, will reduce diet fermentability and increase NDF. In addition, controlling rumen pH with buffers or yeast can help resist a drop in rumen pH.
Fewer people rolled through Saskatoon's Exhibition grounds this year compared to last year, organizers say.
On Monday, crews worked to clean up following the annual event, which welcomed roughly 205,500 visitors in 2017.
READ MORE: Saskatoon considering PDAP claim after Tuesday's severe storm
That figure is about 4,500 fewer attendees than in 2016, representing a two per cent decrease.
Organizers blame the slight downtick on a rainstorm on Aug. 8 and the tight economy.
Next year, the Saskatoon Ex will run from Aug. 7 to 12.

Adventurer Bear Grylls has criticised schools for not being fully equipped to prepare children for adult life, adding that they need to "empower" young people more.
The TV star, a father-of-three, said many people who go on to be successful do so purely because of their sheer determination - and not for getting top scores in their exams.

Asked in a Radio Times interview if he thinks schools are coming up short when it comes to preparing children for adulthood, Grylls replied: "I do, and the people who suffer are the kids.
"I want my kids to be equipped for life and life is not a sprint to get to the top at 18. It's a long haul. Life kicks the s*** out of you and it rewards the persistent.
"Schools have got to empower kids for life, rather than getting to a certain level on a league table.
"The brain surgeons, the high achievers in life aren't always the best at school, they are just determined to get there. I bet that brain surgeon is the guy who got Bs and Cs at A-Level."
Grylls, a former member of the SAS who has gone on to achieve international fame as a survival expert, said his achievements are not wholly down to his performance at school.
The former Eton student said: "I was never very brilliant at school. Never the sportiest or the cleverest, but the one thing I could control was I could be determined.
"The SAS was the first time I really proved that to myself, when I passed selection. And ever since I have leant on that feeling, that if I hang on in there I can do it."
Grylls said of his time at boys' boarding school Eton: "I look back on that time and think it gave me some of my strongest memories and best friends of my life.
"It was a totally forward-thinking, progressive school and I am always grateful to them."
Grylls also said that he hopes Donald Trump is "too busy" to join him on an adventure.
In 2015, he was joined by Barack Obama for a special edition of his TV series Running Wild with Bear Grylls, but he does not think the current president could stand up to the challenge despite being "tenacious".
He said: "It would be amazing. Of course. And, there's no doubting he's tenacious.
"Obama liked stepping out of his comfort zone, and that attitude is good in the wild. He told me it was one of the best days of his presidency.
"But I don't know ... Donald Trump is a person who likes to be king and the one thing I've learnt in the wild is you're never the king. You've got to learn to put the crown down.
"I'm actually on the same network, NBC, as The Apprentice.
"But I kind of hope he's got more important things to do than to go on an adventure with me."

SEOUL/UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations political affairs chief told senior North Korean officials during a visit to Pyongyang this week that there was an “urgent need to prevent miscalculations and open channels to reduce the risks of conflict,” the world body said.
Jeffrey Feltman, the highest-level U.N. official to visit North Korea since 2012, met with Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho and Vice Minister Pak Myong Guk, the United Nations said in a statement on Saturday after Feltman arrived back in Beijing.
Feltman emphasized the need for the full implementation of U.N. Security Council resolutions and that the international community was committed to achieving a peaceful solution.
“He also said there can only be a diplomatic solution to the situation, achieved through a process of sincere dialogue. Time is of the essence,” the United Nations said. “They ... agreed that the current situation was the most tense and dangerous peace and security issue in the world today.”
North Korea is pursuing nuclear and missile weapons programs in defiance of U.N. sanctions and international condemnation. On Nov. 29, it test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile which it said was its most advanced yet, capable of reaching the mainland United States.
North Korea said in a statement carried by its official KCNA news agency that expressed willingness to ease tension on the Korean peninsula and acknowledged the negative impact of sanctions on humanitarian aid to North Korea.
“The United Nations expressed concerns over the heightened situation on the Korean peninsula and expressed willingness to work on easing tensions on the Korean peninsula in accordance with the U.N. Charter which is based on international peace and security,” KCNA said.

KCNA said North Korean officials and Feltman agreed that his visit helped deepen understanding and that they agreed to communicate regularly.
Feltman did not speak to reporters upon arriving back from Pyongyang at Beijing airport on Saturday morning after spending four days in North Korea.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the situation on the Korean peninsula had entered a vicious circle of shows of strength and confrontation, and the outlook was not optimistic, China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
“But at the same time it can be seen that hopes for peace have yet to extinguished. The prospects for negotiations still exist, and the option of resorting to force cannot be accepted,” Wang was quoted as saying.
The United States and South Korea conducted large-scale military drills this week, which the North said have made the outbreak of war “an established fact”. [nL3N1O65WT]
Last month's missile test prompted a U.S. warning that North Korea's leadership would be “utterly destroyed” if war were to break out. The Pentagon has mounted repeated shows of force after North Korean tests.
North Korea regularly threatens to destroy South Korea and the United States and says its weapons programs are necessary to counter U.S. aggression. The United States stations 28,500 troops in the South, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War.
Instagram's next big Stories feature could let you compliment or trash talk other people's feed posts, or embed a “see post” button to promote your own. A TechCrunch reader sent us these screenshots of the new feature, which Instagram confirmed to us is appearing to a small subset of users. “We're always testing ways to make it easier to share any moment with friends on Instagram” a spokesperson wrote. Now those moments can include dunking on people.
Instagram has never had a true “regram” feature with the feed, just slews of unofficial and sometimes scammy apps, but this is perhaps the closest thing. Users often screenshot feed posts and share them in Stories with overlaid commentary, but this limited the cropping and commentary options. Making an official “reshare could unlock all sorts of new user behaviors, from meme curation to burn book shade throwing to social stars teasing their feed posts in their Stories. Brands might love it for using their Stories to cross-promote a big ad campaign. Employing Stories to drive extra Likes and comments to permanent posts could help them gain more visibility in Instagram's feed ranking algorithm.
Here's how the feed post to Instagram Stories sharing feature works. You pick any public, permanent Instagram post and tap a button to embed it in your Story. You can tap to change the design to highlight or downplay the post's author, move and resize it within your Story post, and add commentary or imagery using Instagram's creative tools. When people view the story, they can tap on the post embed to bring up a “see post” button which opens the permanent feed post.
Users who don't want their posts to be “quote-Storied” can turn off the option in their settings, and only public posts can be reshared. Facebook says it doesn't have details about a wider potential rollout beyond the small percentage of users currently with access. But given the popularity of apps like Repost For Instagram, I expect the feature to be popular and eventually open to everyone.
Quote-Storying could help keep the feed relevant as more users spend their time sharing to the little bubbles that sit above it. And it offers a powerful viral discover mechanism for creators who can now ask fans to quickly reshare their post rather than having to awkwardly screenshot and upload them.
While both Instagram and Snapchat have let people privately send other people's posts to friends as private messages, Snapchat lacks a way to embed other Stories or Discover content in your Story. Snapchat may have pioneered the Stories format, but Instagram has been rapidly iterating with features like Super Zoom and Highlights to extend its user count lead over the app it cloned.
The move by Instagram further ties together the three parts of its app: the permanent feed, ephemeral Stories, and private Direct messaging. You can imagine someone finding a post in the feed, resharing it their story, then joking about it with friends over Direct. It's this multi-modal social media usage that turns casual users into loyal, ad revenue-generating ‘Grammers.
Facebook chief information security officer Alex Stamos is leaving the company in August, a source said on Monday, and a report cited internal disagreements over how the social network should deal with its role in spreading disinformation.
The social media company has already taken away Stamos' responsibilities to counter government-sponsored disinformation, the source said. Not denying his exit, Stamos tweeted that his role at the company did change, but he was still fully engaged with work at Facebook.
Facebook could not be immediately reached for comment. The New York Times first reported his departure from the company.
Inside Facebook, Stamos had been strongly advocating for investigating and disclosing Russian activity on the social media platform, often to the consternation of top executives, including Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, the newspaper said.
Stamos' responsibilities were reassigned in December after which Stamos said he would leave the company, the Times said. Stamos was persuaded to stay through August to oversee the transition of his duties because company executives thought his exit would look bad, it said, citing current and former employees.
Facebook's reputation is already under attack over Russia's alleged use of Facebook tools to sway U.S. voters with divisive and false news posts before and after the 2016 election.
The company is under fresh scrutiny after media reports that political consultancy Cambridge Analytica harvested private information from more than 50 million Facebook users in developing techniques to support President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign.

ISLAMABAD, Jul 4 (APP):The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Wednesday said that the commission has made all necessary logistic arrangements for ensuring to hold the upcoming general election on July 25 in a smooth and an organized manner.
The holding of elections which is considered to be the biggest logistic activity in the country required a comprehensive strategy to deal all matters related with the logistic support, ECP's Spokesperson Altaf Khan said.
“The logistic exercises are of two kinds including sensitive and non-sensitive. Sensitive logistic exercise involves ballot papers while non-sensitive includes deployment of official staff, formation of District Monitoring Teams (DMT), bags, pens, indelible ink and stamps in bulk,”Altaf informed.
Explaining the sensitive logistic exercise, the Spokesperson said, it involved printing of ballot papers and import of the papers, used for ballot papers, from the United Kingdom and France.
He informed that it was estimated that the commission required 210 million of total ballot papers for the total constituencies of national and provincial assemblies.
Enlightening about the non-sensitive he said the commission was engaging the 750,000 work force from the federal and provincial departments to hold the upcoming polls. He said that the commission has arranged bags, pens, indelible ink and stamps in bulk.
It is pertinent to mention here that the process of printing of 220 million ballot papers for the general election 2018 would be completed by July 20. The commission had prepared a plan for dispatch of ballot papers to around 85,000 polling stations across the country well before the polling day.
The ballot papers would be dispatched to far-flung areas of Balochistan through aeroplanes. The paper being used for ballots carrying all security features was imported from abroad.
The process of transportation of ballot paper from Karachi was underway through C-130 planes, Pakistan International Airlines and trucks. Pakistan Army had been providing security to the Printing Corporation of Pakistan and other places during printing of the ballot papers.

Natalie Sawyer has landed a new role after leaving Sky Sports News.
Sawyer, 38, left Sky last month after 18 years with the company amid reported differences and expectations over her role.
She had initially joined as a member of the production team before becoming a popular figure as one of the leading presenters of the 24 hour rolling service.
She departed last month but has now appeared on William Hill's social media channel.
Sawyer appeared alongside former Tottenham and Hull midfielder Ryan Mason to discuss the Champions League clash between Liverpool and Roma.

Since iOS 12 was announced back in June at Apple's WWDC keynote there have been two betas that the Cupertino-giant has released. On 4 July, Apple has released the third public beta for iPhone and iPads.
We saw several new updates on the second beta of iOS 12 such as how the Podcasts app shows a Now Playing indicator on currently playing chapters, a new splash screen for updated Voice Memos, new arrow launcher for Shortcuts and more. In the third beta of iOS 12, the main feature is undoubtedly the first rollout of Apple's in-house mapping data for the Bay Area.
Apart from that, other new updates in iOS 12 beta 3 includes, the ability to clear alerts in one swipe, tweaking of the FaceTime effect picker, third-party apps working with Siri can now be seen on the Watch app, redesigning the voice memos for the iPad, a springy animation for clearing all notifications and more.
Starting with the iPhone SE, you can download the public beta from Apple's public beta website. But be warned, beta versions are usually riddled with a lot of bugs and issues, so ideally you should not download it on your primary device.
To download the iOS 12 beta, first, you would have to become a member of Apple's Beta Software Program. After that, you can enroll a device to access the public beta. As mentioned earlier we recommend that you do not use your primary iOS device for downloading the beta version. However, if you do not have a secondary device lying with you, it is important that you back up all your data from your primary device, just to be on the safer side.

This is a developing story...
Some critics went further to note the possibility of an Objectivist reading of Bird's movie: Here was a story, after all, about literally superhuman individuals being sapped of their potential by the unremarkable, untalented masses. The suggestion that Bird was some sort of closet Ayn Rand disciple eventually calcified into received wisdom, though I've never had much use for it myself. Like the director's other Pixar triumph, “Ratatouille” (2007), “The Incredibles” may allow that some individuals are innately gifted, but it also insists that those gifts, far from being allowed to flourish at any cost, must be tempered and nurtured through creativity, humility and public service.
Halep comes from behind, Wozniacki flying
There were wins for Simona Halep and Caroline Wozniacki at the French Open on Wednesday.
Omnisport NEWS News 31 May 2018, 02:09 IST 20 Share Options × Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit Google+ Email
Romania's Simona Halep.
Simona Halep suffered a scare but eventually triumphed 2-6 6-1 6-1 in her delayed first-round match against Alison Riske at the French Open.
The weather in Paris saw Halep's opener pushed back to Wednesday and she rode out an early storm to book her place in the second round.
Caroline Wozniacki's progression to round three was far more straightforward in a 6-1 6-0 demolition of Georgina Garcia Perez, while Petra Kvitova was similarly emphatic in beating Lara Arruabarrena 6-0 6-4.
In the doubles, the Williams sisters had to come from behind to advance to the next stage.
HALEP RUNS THE RISKE
World number one Halep put her slow start down to nerves.
"I felt the nerves," she said. "I didn't feel the pressure, because I know that every match is tough at this tournament, so I don't expect anything.
"But what I expect from myself is to go there and to play as I play in practice. So, this is the only one thing that I'm following and I want to have on court.
"The result, it's going to come if I play well. If not, I just have to fight and to try to not give up even one point."
“I think the nerves are really good. It means that you care about what you are doing and your desire is really big.
Every time when I get on court is like I'm really excited and nervous about everything, every moment.”

WOZNIACKI OFF TO A FLYER
Wozniacki took just 51 minutes to book her place in the third round, where she will face wildcard Pauline Parmentier, who upset Alize Cornet on Wednesday.
The Dane could be forgiven for wishing her match took a little longer, allowing her more of an opportunity to get used to the surface and the atmosphere.
But second seed Wozniacki disagreed when that point was put to her after the match.
"Definitely not. I wish all my matches were like this and I could win with this scoreline," she said.

LUCKY FOR SOME...
Kvitova's win against Arruabarrena gave her a 13th consecutive victory on clay and she says the hand injury sustained during a robbery at her home at the end of 2016 is not bothering her.
"My hand, it's great, it's not painful at all," she said. "I don't think I have any secret. I just worked pretty hard to get ready physically. Not only for the clay. It's been already from the off-season.
"But obviously on the clay it's a little bit different, and I had a great preparation, as well.
"I wasn't injured, so I really could go for it. So far it's really working well.
"I think the game has to be really changing a little bit on the clay, as well, and not really going that much for the winners. Yeah, so far I'm really glad with that."
WILLIAMS SISTERS COME FROM BEHIND
Serena Williams made a successful return to grand slam singles tennis on Tuesday but endured a scare in the doubles competitions with sister Venus on Wednesday.

By election result 2018 LIVE updates: The Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) jinx in Lok Sabha bypolls seems to be continuing with the saffron party trailing in two out of four Lok Sabha seats — UP's Kairana and Maharashtra's Bhandara-Gondiya constituencies. It is leading in the Palghar Lok Sabha bypoll in Maharashtra while its alliance NDPP is ahead in the lone Nagaland seat. Uttarakhand's Tharali is the only Assembly seat from where the BJP is leading. The RJD and CPM have bagged Bihar's Jokihat and Kerala's Chengannur Assembly seats, respectively. The JMM has won both Silli and Gomia bypolls in Jharkhand. The Congress has upped its count in Karnataka Assembly with a win in Rajarajeshwari Nagar. Results in the 15 Lok Sabha and Assembly by-elections are the first big test of opposition unity ahead of 2019 Lok Sabha elections.
In the first half the day, the Congress has secured wins in three seats — Maharashtra's Palus Kadegaon and Meghalaya's Ampati and Karnataka's RR Nagar. In Kerala's Chengannur, meanwhile, the CPM registered a massive win with its candidate Saji Cherian winning by over 20,000 votes. In Bihar, the RJD has trumped Nitish Kumar's JD(U) to win the Jokihat seat.

In Kerala's Chengannur, meanwhile, the CPM registered a massive win with its candidate Saji Cherian winning by over 20,000 votes. In Bihar, the RJD has trumped Nitish Kumar's JD(U) to win the Jokihat seat.
The Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) jinx in Lok Sabha bypolls seems to be continuing with the saffron party trailing in two out of four Lok Sabha seats — UP's Kairana and Maharashtra's Bhandara-Gondiya constituencies. It is leading in the Palghar Lok Sabha bypoll in Maharashtra while its alliance NDPP is ahead in the lone Nagaland seat.

Lalu Prasad Yadav's RJD has won the Jokihat Bihar Assembly seat with 76,002 votes. The JD(U) polled 37,913 votes. The Jokihat seat fell vacant after the resignation of sitting MLA Sarfaraz Alam. The bypoll is being viewed as a test of strength between Nitish Kumar-led JD(U) and the RJD of Lalu Prasad.
Having won the seat in 2015 on a JD(U) ticket, Alam switched over to the RJD in March this year and got elected to the Lok Sabha from Araria in a bypoll necessitated by the death of his father Mohd Taslimuddin. Taslimuddin himself had represented Jokihat in the Bihar assembly for a record five times. His younger son Shahnawaz Alam had been fielded by the RJD while the JD(U) candidate was Murshid Alam, a former Panchayat Mukhiya.
After 17 rounds of counting in West Bengal's Maheshtala, Trinamool Congress leads with 89,318 votes. BJP topples CPM for second position with 33,737 votes while CPM has2 5,262. Trinamool is leading by 55,581 votes.
According to the latest reports, NCP is leading in the Bhandara-Gondiya Parliamentary constituency by 5,000 votes. The Bhandara-Gondiya constituency comprises of six Assembly (Vidhan Sabha) segments: Tumsar, Bhandara, Sakoli, Arjuni Morgaon, Tirora and Gondiya. Nationalist Congress Party's (NCP) Praful Patel won this this seat in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections but lost it to BJP's Nana Patole in 2014.
Congress candidate Miani D Shira has won the Ampati Assembly by election in Meghalaya by around 3,100 votes, beating nearest rival of the National People's Party (NPP) CG Momin. The seat fell vacant after Shira's father and Congress leader Mukul Sangma, who won from two seats in the Assembly elections, vacated the seat.
CPM candidate Saji Cherian is set to retain the Chengannur seat in Kerala the party had won after a long time in the 2016 Assembly election. His lead has crossed 8,000 when counting reached the half way. The party had captured the seat from the Congress in the 2016 election by 7983 votes. If the trend continues Cherian will cross this.
Muniraju Gowda, BJP candidate in the Rajarajeshwari Nagar Karnataka bypoll, has left the counting centre as his Congress rival Muniratna leads by 45,000 votes. Gowda's supporters have conceded defeat but there is no word yet from the BJP leader. About 54 percent out of the 4.71 lakh voters in the constituency had exercised their franchise on 28 May.
While assembly elections across the state were held on May 12, polling in Rajarajeshwari Nagar was conducted on May 28, as the Election Commission had deferred polling there following the voter ID controversy and various other irregularities. A major row erupted over electoral malpractices and seizure of nearly 10,000 voter ID cards from an apartment in the constituency, ahead of May 12 elections.
Fourteen candidates were in the fray in Rajarajeshwari Nagar polls, including incumbent MLA in the dissolved assembly, Muniratna. While BJP has fielded Tulsi Muniraju Gowda, JD(S) candidate is GH Ramachandra, who had joined the party ahead of polls, quitting BJP. Muniratna is one of the accused in the case related to voter ID cards that were found in an apartment.
The counting of votes is underway in 11 Assembly and four Lok Sabha seats across India, including for the crucial Palghar and Bhandara-Gondia Lok Sabha bypolls. TMC has maintained its lead in West Bengal's Maheshtala. CPM and BJP are in a close fight for the second position. BJP is leading is Palghar with 56,812 votes, while CPM is leading in Chengannur bypoll. According to a report, the BJP candidate has "conceded defeat" in Karnataka's Rajarajeshwari Nagar.
The results of these two Lok Sabha seats are important for all four major political parties—BJP, Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP—as the outcome is likely to have a bearing on their future course.
"The counting of votes will start from 8 am in both the constituencies on Thursday. The final percentage of votes in Bhandara-Gondia will be revised late in the evening after the re-polling in 49 booths in the constituency ends," an election officer said.
While 53.22 percent of the 1.73 crore electorate exercised their franchise in Palghar, in Bhandara-Gondia, 53.15 percent of the total 1.76 crore voters cast their votes on Monday.
The voting was marred by allegations of malfunctioning in electronic voting machines (EVMs).
The Election Commission (EC) on Tuesday ordered re-polling at 49 booths in five of the six Assembly segments in Bhandara-Gondia Lok Sabha constituency on Wednesday, after allegations of malfunctioning of EVMs and VVPATs.
Former Union minister Praful Patel claimed that almost 25 percent of EVMs malfunctioned in the bypoll to Bhandara-Gondia Lok Sabha seat, while Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said those in power were contesting elections while keeping the "key and remote of EVMs in their hands".
Abhimanyu Kale, the district collector of Gondia, was transferred on Wednesday after the Lok Sabha by-election there was marred by large scale complaints of malfunctioning of the EVMs.
An FIR was filed against a polling officer in Palghar as he transported some EVMs to the counting centre in a private car against norms, after voting for the Palghar Lok Sabha bypoll ended.
The by-election in Palghar was necessitated due to death of sitting BJP MP Chintaman Wanaga. The Bhandara-Gondia seat was vacated after BJP's Nana Patole resigned from the party and quit his Lok Sabha membership.
As many as 25 candidates were in the fray for the two LS seats: 18 in Bhandara-Gondia and seven in Palghar. Both the seats are crucial for the BJP. The saffron party locked horns with the NCP to retain the Bhandara-Gondia seat, while in Palghar it is locked in a fierce battle with its estranged ally Shiv Sena, despite the contest being five-cornered.
Retaining Bhandara-Gondia is important for the BJP since its MP Nana Patole had quit the party in December 2017 and later joined the Congress. Stakes are also high in Palghar as Shiv Sena has fielded Sriniwas Wanaga, son of late BJP MP Chintaman Wanaga.
The BJP had roped in Union minister Smriti Irani Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath for the campaign. In Bhandara-Gondia, the NCP had fielded Madhukar Kukde, while the BJP had nominated Hemant Patle. Although there are total of 18 candidates in Bhandara-Gondia, the main contest is between the BJP and the NCP.
Congress leaders in the constituency are miffed that the party gave the seat to NCP despite Nana Patole returning to the Congress fold. Patole had defeated NCP leader Praful Patel in 2014. Patel has represented the seat earlier in the Lok Sabha.
The BJP represents five of the six Assembly segments in the Lok Sabha constituency: Tumsar, Bhandara, Sakoli, Arjuni Morgaon, Tirora, while Gopaldas Agarwal of Congress represents Gondia.
In Punjab, the Shahkot Assembly bypoll results, which will be out on Thursday, is being seen as a popularity test for the 14-month-old Congress government in Punjab, with Opposition SAD striving to retain its stronghold. The bypoll was necessitated following the demise of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) MLA Ajit Singh Kohar in February.
While the SAD is striving to retain its pocket borough from where Kohar was elected five times, the results for the ruling Congress in Punjab is being seen as a barometer for the popularity of the 14-month-old Amarinder Singh dispensation. During the bypoll, the Opposition party had accused the Congress of misusing official machinery against political opponents.
The AAP, which faced a humiliating defeat in the Gurdaspur Lok Sabha bypoll and civic polls, is desperately looking for a victory in Shahkot. The Congress is confident of maintaining the winning momentum by wresting the seat from rival SAD.
Over 76 percent of 1.72 lakh voters had exercised their franchise for the Shahkot bypoll on 28 May where the Congress, the SAD and the AAP were locked in a triangular battle.
The other bypoll seats where the results are expected on Thursday are Bihar's Jokihat Assembly seat where the main candidates are JD-U's Murshid Alam, RJD's Shahnawaz Alam and an Independent candidate Mohammad Shabbir and Jharkhand's Silli and Gomia seat.
In Silli Assembly seat, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) candidate Seema Mahto faces ruling NDA constituent All Jharkhand Students Union (AJSU) president Sudesh Mahto and in Gomia, the BJP and the AJUS are fighting separately. The BJP has fielded former minister Madavlal Singh and AJSU has fielded Lambodar Mahto who was a state government employee. The JMM has fielded Babita Devi, wife of Yogendra Mahto who was disqualified as legislator after he was convicted in a case and sentenced to two years in jail.
Meanwhile, in the east, bypoll in West Bengal's Maheshtala Assembly seat was held following the death of Trinamool Congress MLA Kasturi Das. The party has fielded her husband Dulal Das, while the BJP, which is trying to emerge as the main challenger to the rulign TMC, has fielded Sujit Ghosh, a former CBI joint director. The Left has nominated Prabhat Chowdhury.
The results of the Ampati Assembly in Meghalaya will be interesting as it witnessed a triangular contest, where Miani D Shira, the daughter of Leader of Opposition Mukul Sangma, is the Congress candidate, Clement G Momin is the nominee of the ruling Meghalaya Democratic Alliance while Subhankar Koch is the Independent contestant.
The by-election in this constituency was necessitated after Sangma resigned from the seat as he had won from Songsak seat as well in the February 27 Assembly election.
Down south, in Kerala's Chengannur, the battle is largely between the ruling CPM, the main Opposition Congress and the BJP. The BJP has just one MLA in Kerala, and it is seeking to expand its support base in the state where politics has been dominated by the CPM-led Left Democratic Front and Congress headed United Democratic Front for decades.

A Suisun City man pleaded no contest Tuesday in Solano County Superior Court on attempted robbery and vandalism charges related to an altercation in January at a local fast food restaurant. As part of his plea, the man will serve two years on summary probation and 60 days in county jail.
Around 11:30 a.m. Jan. 27, police were dispatched to a Del Taco Restaurant on Sunset Boulevard in Suisun City after reports that a physical altercation occurred between a customer and employees.
The customer, Ronald Rantasuo, 29, was allegedly upset because his taco was made incorrectly. He then demanded his money back and threatened to take the cash register if the employees didn't comply with his order. Rantasuo then went on to grab the cash register but was pushed away by an employee.
Rantasuo then pushed another employee and slapped her cell phone out of her hand, causing it to fall to the ground and shatter.
Because of the damage to the cell phone, Rantasuo was ordered by the judge to pay restitution fines, which would pay for a replacement cell phone.
Prior to detailing the plea deal, the prosecutor on the case asked the judge to reduce the vandalism charge from a felony to a misdemeanor — which the judge agreed.
As part of the deal, Rantasuo pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor vandalism charge and a felony attempted robbery charge. He has remained in county jail since his arrest Jan. 28.
The man will be released after serving the remainder of his county jail sentence. After that, he will be on summary probation for two years. At the close of Tuesday's court proceedings, the judge ordered the man upon release to stay away from the Del Taco Restaurant in Suisun City.
Rantasuo was previously being held in county jail on $63,333 bail.

Halep and Ostapenko following the final in Paris (Getty/Jean Catuffe)
An extremely interesting women's semifinal clash at the China Open sees ninth seed Jelena Ostapenko, who has secured her place at the WTA Finals this week, take on second seed Simona Halep, once again just one win from the world number one ranking, face off for a place in the final in Beijing.
The two have only played each other one time before, with that meeting coming in the final of the French Open earlier this year. It proved to be one of the most entertaining Grand Slam finals in recent memory, with Ostapenko coming from a set down and then a break down in the second and third sets to secure her first ever tour title. With both women playing well this week, we may be set for another fantastic encounter.
Ostapenko and Halep meet following their clash in Paris (Getty/Jean Catuffe)
This will be the second match of the day on the National Tennis Stadium, taking place after one of the Women's Doubles semifinals, with the encounter starting no earlier than 14:30 Beijing time. The winner will face 12th seed Petra Kvitova or Caroline Garcia in the final.
So far in Beijing
Both women have impressed in Beijing so far, though Ostapenko may be slightly more fresh having played less tennis this week.
The Latvian received a bye in the first round, due to the fact that she had reached the semifinals in Wuhan last week. In her opening match she saw off Samantha Stosur in straight sets to seal her place in Singapore as well as reach the third round, where she progressed after Shuai Peng retired just three games in. Ostapenko then impressed as she beat Sorana Cirstea to reach the last four, and will be confident having lost just one match since the US Open.
Halep celebrates following her win over Daria Kasatkina (Getty/Lintao Zhang)
Halep came into Beijing on a three match losing streak, and that may have shown as she was pushed to three sets by Alison Riske in her opening match, eventually prevailing. The Romanian eased into the third round after Magdalena Rybarikova retired a set and a break down, though then put in one of the best performances of her career as she beat Maria Sharapova for the loss of just four games; she had never beaten the Russian before. Halep then crushed Daria Kasatkina 6-2, 6-1 (the same scoreline that Kasatkina had beaten her by last week) to reach the last four, and will be looking to amend her loss in Paris.
Analysis
Perhaps the best performance from either women this week was Halep's against Sharapova. The world number two was striking the ball beautifully, allowing her to be aggressive and force mistakes, as well as serve well, and if she is able to do that again she will have a good chance at reaching the final. Ostapenko is the more powerful of the two, so Halep will have to defend, though the Romanian should look to frustrate the Latvian by forcing her to play extra shots in as many points as possible.
Serving may be a key factor for Ostapenko (Getty/Emmanuel Wong)
Serving is important for both women but particularly Ostapenko, whose second serve can be a liability and could be punished if her opponent is in an aggressive mood. The Latvian should perhaps look to take some power off her first serve to make sure it gets into play, though must be willing to attack at full strength (as she always is) to try and break Halep down; she must also show some patience, as the Romanian will likely stay in the point longer than many others will.
Assessment
The French Open final between was one of the most enjoyable matches in recent years, and if both women are playing well once again we could have another memorable encounter. Both are certainly capable of winning this encounter and no result, whether one-sided or extremely tight, should be surprising, but it seems that Halep may be confident enough to take the win.
Prediction: Simona Halep in three sets
A data dump containing over 1.4 billion email addresses, passwords, and other credentials, all in clear text, has been found online by security shop @4iQ.
The 41-gigabyte file was discovered on December 5 and had been updated at the end of last month, indicating the data is both current and being used by third parties. The identity of the collator isn't known but the miscreant left Bitcoin and Dogecoin wallet details for donations.
"None of the passwords are encrypted, and what's scary is that we've tested a subset of these passwords and most of the have been verified to be true," said Julio Casal, founder of @4iQ. "The breach is almost two times larger than the previous largest credential exposure, the Exploit.in combo list that exposed 797 million records."
The Exploit.in list is included in this dump, as are records reported stolen before, but a lot of this data is new. It has even all been indexed for easy searching and search tools are also included in the archive.
Disturbingly the archive also shows that years of advice on choosing strong passwords is still being ignored. The top password is, depressingly, still 123456, followed by 123456789, qwerty, password and 111111, and the history of some accounts shows the minor variations that would make other passwords for the account easier to guess.
It's hardly rocket science to guess the possible permutations
When the firm contacted some of the recipients, the email addresses of many proved to be still active, although in most cases the passwords were no longer in use. That said, those passwords may well have been used on other accounts, making the job a lot easier for hackers. ®
A federal judge recommended Monday that former state Sen. Ron Calderon, who is in federal prison on corruption charges, be considered for early release.
The recommendation is for a transfer to a community correctional facility and then home confinement.
In January, Calderon began a 42-month prison sentence after pleading guilty to accepting tens of thousands of dollars in bribes from undercover FBI agents and a hospital executive in return for official favors.
U.S. District Court Judge Christina A. Snyder on Monday agreed to recommend to the United States Bureau of Prisons that Calderon be considered for early release from prison as soon as next January under the Second Chance Act, which aims to ease reentry into the community for some felons.
“Mr. Calderon understands that such recommendation by Your Honor would not be binding on the BOP, but that the BOP would give it serious consideration,” wrote Mark Geragos, an attorney for Calderon, in a letter to the judge.
The law allows a move from prison to a community halfway house up to 12 months before a sentence is over. Calderon could then serve the last six months in home confinement, depending on what the bureau decides.
Snyder's order says she granted the request from Calderon, a 59-year-old Democrat from Montebello. He is serving his sentence in the Federal Correctional Institution, Sheridan, a medium security prison in Oregon. He cited health problems in asking for a lesser sentence.
Funding from the city has been an on-going issue for the Nord-Bridge Seniors Centre. Management went before council on Monday, asking for equitable and appropriate funding. Joe Scarpelli reports.

Former state Sen. Robert Mellow leaves the William J. Nealon Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse in 2012 after pleading guilty to a felony flowing from his misuse of public resources for political gain. He later was allowed to keep his $245,000 annual pension. (Times-Tribune File)
When he was managing the woeful New York Mets in 1962, Casey Stengel supposedly wailed, “Can't Anybody Here Play This Game?” — which became the title of Jimmy Breslin's book about that legendary season.
Pennsylvania taxpayers reasonably could likewise wail about the state Legislature, which like Stengel's charges, expends a great deal of energy but doesn't accomplish much.
Now, however, the state Senate has hit a softball out of the park, and the House is on deck.
Tuesday, the state Senate voted unanimously to close a loophole that enables felonious lawmakers to thumb their noses at taxpayers while on the way to the bank.
Mellow's example
Exhibit A is former state Sen. Robert Mellow of Lackawanna County. He served 16 months in federal prison on a felony conviction flowing from his misuse of public resources while a senator. Then, last year, he charged through a yawning loophole in state law that enables felons to collect their pensions.
Because Mellow was in the Legislature for 40 years and self-indulgent lawmakers have ensured themselves outlandishly lucrative pensions, his pension amounted to $245,000 a year.
The State Employees Retirement System board voted last year, 6-5, to allow Mellow to collect that pension despite the crimes he committed while in office. The preposterous reason was that the federal felony to which Mellow pleaded guilty does not have an exactly worded counterpart in state law.
Lawmakers included such nitpicking escape hatches in the pension law, of course, to ensure that they collect their pensions regardless of whether they betray the public trust.
Outrage resulting from the Mellow decision prompted Republican state Sen. John DiSanto of Dauphin County to introduce a bill holding that any lawmaker who is convicted of committing a crime relating to his conduct in office, whether by jury verdict or plea, must forfeit his pension.
That obviously is the correct standard. Gov. Tom Wolf already has said he will sign it. The House quickly should make sure that he has the opportunity to do so.

BUCHAREST Romanian Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu refused to resign after his ruling Social Democrat Party (PSD) withdrew its support for his cabinet late on Wednesday, contributing to the political infighting in the European Union's fastest growing economy.The PSD completed a performance review of Grindeanu's six-month old cabinet on Wednesday evening and found it had failed to uphold an ambitious governing programme that had won the party a sweeping election victory in December and a comfortable parliament majority.PSD leader Liviu Dragnea, who holds tight control over his party, said all cabinet ministers have filed their resignations and that his party was ready to nominate another premier and government together with junior coalition partner ALDE."I think it is important that this country benefit from this governing programme that Romanians massively voted for," he told reporters.But Prime Minister Grindeanu said the review was a surprise and showed his cabinet had failed to enforce measures which had deadlines of 2018 or later, as well as some that could not be implemented, such as bolstering economic relations with Russia, which would be difficult given sanctions imposed by the EU.
"I have tried to understand why ... there is such fury in getting rid of your own government after not even six months," Grindeanu told reporters. "I don't see another answer other than ... one man's desire of holding all the power."He said he would only resign after centre-right President Klaus Iohannis held consultations with parliamentary parties and indicated he would appoint a replacement from the PSD."I want PSD to stay in government," Grindeanu said. "I don't want to risk it. At this moment all options are open."
With Grindeanu's refusal to resign, the ruling coalition must file a no-confidence vote in parliament to topple the prime minister and consequently nominate a replacement. Under Romanian law, the president must endorse a premier after consultations with political parties. The appointee then needs to secure a vote of confidence from parliament, where PSD and ALDE control a comfortable majority.Either way, there would be more delays in policymaking in the EU's second-poorest state, which has massive healthcare and transport infrastructure needs.
Sergiu Miscoiu, a political science professor at Babes-Bolyai University, said there would be "no gain here for the Social Democrats - the party will see a huge loss of image, or what was left of it."The PSD's great advantage was unity and its capacity to mobilise, vertical decisions and discipline. These myths are gone now. To the extent that Grindeanu will resign, he will throw the ball into President [Klaus] Iohannis's court, who could appoint a technocrat," Miscoiu said. Romania was the EU's fastest-growing economy in the first quarter, expanding by 5.7 percent, and its budget ran a small surplus at the end of April.The legacy of Grindeanu's government also includes a failed attempt at the start of the year to decriminalise several corruption offences, a move foiled by the largest street protests in Romania since the 1989 fall of its communist regime.

KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine will provide protection to the Russian journalist who was the target of an assassination plot by the Russian security services, President Petro Poroshenko said on Wednesday.
Ukraine said it had foiled a plot to kill Kremlin critic Arkady Babchenko, who was declared murdered and then later turned up alive in the middle of a press briefing about the killing. Russia said Ukraine had used Babchenko as a propaganda tool.
"Ukrainian law enforcement agencies are becoming stronger every day in countering Russian aggression," Poroshenko said on Twitter. "It is unlikely that Moscow will calm down -- I've given an order to provide Arkady and his family with protection."

STILLWATER, Okla. -- Oklahoma State avenged its loss to Alabama from four years ago while blasting the Crimson Tide to win the NCAA men's golf championship on its home course Wednesday.
Viktor Hovland never trailed in the opening match against Lee Hodges in a 4-and-3 victory. Zach Bauchou won five straight holes, holing out a bunker shot on his way to an 8-and-7 victory over Jonathan Hardee.
Matthew Wolff delivered the clinching point, a 4-and-3 victory over Davis Riley, and the celebration was on at Karsten Creek Golf Club.
The Cowboys had the home crowd on their side, and they gave their orange-clad fans plenty to cheer.
Oklahoma State won its 11th NCAA title, second only to Houston's 16. Its previous championship was in 2006 when it was stroke play. Since switching to match play in 2009, the Cowboys have been runners-up twice.
One of those years was to Alabama in 2014 at Prairie Dunes in Kansas, about a three-hour drive north of Stillwater. Alabama won big for back-to-back titles.
The Tide advanced to the championship match by sweeping the five matches against Duke in the semifinals. Alabama fell behind big in three matches against Oklahoma State and trailed in all five matches when Wolff clinched it.
The final score was 3-2 because the other two matches, which no longer mattered, ended where they were.

Islamabad - The Minister for Capital Administration and Development Division (CADD) in his last attempt failed to regularise the daily wages of employees of 422 educational institutes of the city, sources said on Tuesday.
Official sources informed The Nation that minister for CADD Dr. Tariq Fazal Chaudhry remained unsuccessful in convincing the bureaucracy of the ministry to finalize and approve the summary sent by FDE.
Sources said that the minister on May 28 held meetings with Federal Directorate of Education (FDE) officials and representatives of Daily Wages Employees Association (DWEA) to prepare and move the summary of their regularization.
“Daily wages employees were given assurance that the summary will be finalized and added in the agenda of the cabinet meeting,” sources said.
However, at eleventh hour a senior official at CADD who recently assumed his charge refused to sign the summary expressing reservations on its legal consequences.
The minister had vowed to put the summary of the regularization of the daily wages employees in the last cabinet meeting as additional agenda item and to get it approved from the cabinet.
“The summary is still in CADD and no development has taken regarding putting it on agenda of the cabinet meeting,” source said. According to the secretary, CADD Saqib Aziz is taking briefings on the regularization of employees and there is no chance of its approval when the government is left with only two days in power.
Sources informed The Nation that the minister made all efforts to resolve the issue of daily wages employees in his last days but the bureaucracy was not convinced of regularizing the above 16 grade employees ignoring the Federal Public Service Commission (FPSC) recruitment rules.
Around 1800 employees from scale 01 to 17 remained on roads during last five years demanding release of salaries and regularization in their institutions. 1800 employees include 800 teachers and 1000 non-teaching staff.
Islamabad High Court (IHC) had also directed the CADD minister to find a way to address both issues of the teaching employees as the government had hired their services for decades. Sources also added that the recent top-level reshuffle in CADD occurred after differences emerged between the minister and bureaucracy on a number of pending decisions including regularization of daily wages employees.
Earlier, Secretary Azhar Ali Chaudhry was transferred and Muhammad Saqib Aziz a BS-22 officer of Pakistan Administrative Services posted as Secretary Postal Services Division was given the charge of secretary CADD. Additional secretary Jamal Yousaf was replaced with Mathar Niaz Rana a BS-21 officer of Pakistan Administrative Services.
The daily wages employees held a more than 100 days sit-in for approval of their demands and minister formed committees to find the solution but all efforts were in vain.
“The principals of the institutions had banned the entry of the teachers involved in 100-day protest,” source said.
However, the matter was solved after the intervention of acting Director General (DG) FDE Dr. Tariq Masood and the principals were requested principals to accept the teachers again.
Talking to The Nation President DWEA Fahd Meraj said that the summary has not been approved as it was not included in the agenda.
Minister convinced the protesting employees to end their strike as their case will be solved on emergency basis, he said. “However, the summary was prepared at the wrong time and daily wages employees issue remained unsolved in five years,” he said.
Fahd Meraj also said that the minister assured employees of release of their salaries but the promise was not fulfilled.
“Daily wages employees received their last salary on June 1st 2017,” he said.
He also added that if the salaries are not released till June 04, the funds will lapse.
DG FDE Hasnaat Quershi said that the proposal for regularization of daily wages employees was sent to CADD however, he is not aware about the status of the summary in the ministry.
Plans by Heather Mills to take over the former Walkers factory have been welcomed by a local MP.
PepciCo closed its crisp-making plant in Peterlee towards the end of last year when it said it needed to make savings through its Walkers brand, leading to the loss of around 350 jobs.
Now Heather Mills, a former model, activist, businesswoman and media personality, who originally hails from Washington, has confirmed she has bought the Stephenson Road site with the aim of turning it into a production line for her VBites food firm.
That will continue the town's 50-year tradition of making snacks on the site.
Easington MP Grahame Morris has said he was contacted at around the time the Walkers factory was closing, but was unable to reveal any details as negotiations were under way.
Mr Morris hopes to see a deal rubber-stamped take on the site, with around 130 people to be taken on initially with a chance that could rise to 255 or more as the products make their way into more shops.

The MP helped put VBites in contact with parties involved in the site and business support organisations as discussions began.
He said: “I continue to be very supportive of discussions that have been ongoing with Heather Mills and her representatives since Walkers announced the closure of their Peterlee operation.
“This could be much needed good news for Peterlee, which has 50 years experience of manufacturing top quality snacks at this site.
“I would like to thank Heather for her commitment and willingness to invest in our community and in the jobs this project could deliver.

“I look forward to snack food manufacturing returning to Peterlee and would be delighted to see VBites products made in Peterlee on supermarket shelves in the near future.
“The town has a long tradition of manufacturing high quality products on that site and the hundreds who were made redundant will be interested in the potential that it could reopen.”
The development has also been welcomed by Tom Allison senior organiser for Durham and Tees with the GMB, which is the union which represented most of the Walkers employees.
He said: “This could give job opportunities to those who have been unable to secure employment and get well-paid employment, because a lot of job opportunities are of the type with low or minimum wages, rather than good production jobs and we hope we get those back.

“While this is still in the embryonic stages, we see the plans Heather has and the potential has to offer in terms of employment for the area, but she is also someone who has an understanding of the North East and she knows the work ethic of people in this area.”

There will be no relief to Goan consumers from the spiralling petrol prices, as the state government has no plans of lowering tax to cool down the prices.
Speaking to The Navhind Times on Wednesday, Deepak Bandekar, commissioner of commercial taxes, said that there is no proposal before the government to lower VAT on petrol. He said that VAT rates on petrol at 17 per cent were the lowest compared to other states.
“Petrol is cheapest in Goa because of lower VAT. In Karnataka, the price is higher by Rs 5 to 6 per litre and in Maharashtra by Rs 15 to 16 per litre,” said Bandekar while responding to a query on whether VAT will be cut on petrol.
Recently, the NITI Ayog had said that states must reduce duty on petrol to
make it cheaper, a suggestion that has been turned down (for revenue reasons) by all state finance ministers, including Goa. “If taxes need to be lowered, the central excise must be lowered first,” said Bandekar.
Goans are at an advantage in fuel prices vis-à-vis other stares, as the VAT rate is on the lower side. The VAT on petrol at 17 per cent is the lowest in India while on diesel the VAT at 19 per cent is at par with one or two states.
Petrol and diesel prices are spiralling because of a steep hike in international crude prices and the rupee-dollar exchange rate. The steep surge is being viewed with concern by everyone on account of the impact on transportation costs and overall price increase.
However, in Goa, industry is viewing the rising trend as “inevitable.” A senior source at the Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) said that there is no representation from the industry to take up the fuel price issue with the state government as of now.
Petrol in the state is currently priced around Rs 72.27 per litre and diesel at Rs 70.54 per litre.
In 2012, the state had withdrawn tax on petrol which had brought down the price to slightly below Rs 60 per litre. Subsequently, the tax was steadily increased to its current rate of 17 per cent.
A major recruitment drive for occupational therapists (OTs) has followed criticism of Lancashire County Council by the Local Government Ombudsman.
Now the full county council will assess work being done to increase staffing and improve performance when it meets on Thursday.
A report to councillors notes compensation of £750 has already been paid to a bereaved wife and an apology issued after she complained to the Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman that the council had failed to meet the assessed equipment needs of her husband.
He was left bedbound in the final month of his life after the council failed to provide a special chair.
The Ombudsman, reporting in September, had “found fault causing injustice” in the case and demanded the full council consider its implications.
The council will be told an urgent review of policies and working arrangements is taking place and the number of occupational therapy posts has doubled to 40 FTE (full time equivalent).
Charlottesville natives Dave Matthews Band are speaking out against the violence incited by Saturday's white nationalist rally in their Virginia hometown.
The group, which first got their start in the Charlottesville music scene back in 1991, issued a statement on its website denouncing the events as an act of “racist, hate-filled terrorism.”
“Like so many our hearts are broken. Our thoughts go out to the families and victims of these unbelievable acts,” the band wrote. “This is not the Charlottesville we know and love. This town has grown from its sometimes great but often difficult history and is marching toward an inclusive future. This murderous act and those who incited it are not what we aspire to be. We will work tirelessly, hand-in-hand with our community to help one another so we can all heal from this sickening display of horror. Hate speech disguised as free speech is cowardly and shameful. Such speech gives permission to the murderous crimes we witnessed today. There is nothing pure, acceptable, or philosophical about Nazism, or racism masked as heritage.”
The band concludes with an earnest appeal to the nation, writing, “The multicultural tapestry that is America must come together, acknowledge our very difficult but remarkable history. We must move away from the racist and ignorant elements of our past toward an inclusive, kinder, more intelligent future.”
Toronto digital pop experimentalists Bernice have impressed us with early singles “St. Lucia,” “Don't Wanna Be European,” “David,” and “Talking About Her,” songs that zeroed in on a liquid electronic pop sound that struck an enticing balance between playful abandon and chilly remove. Now those tracks have been packaged into an EP called Puff along with a new song called “Gemini.” On the whole, the project reminds me of what Thom Yorke's solo albums might sound like if they weren't so insular and dour. Its blend of physical, emotional, and cerebral is well worth your time, so stream it below.

Editor's Note: The threat to the sanctity of journalism has not been more serious in these challenging times. With the menace of fake news already rampant, thanks to easy access to social media, there is another legion of individuals who now pose as pseudo-journalists, threatening the very edifice of journalism — trust. In a series of stories, reporters from Tier-I and Tier-II cities in India will examine self-proclaimed journalists and their modus operandi to blackmail and extort money by abusing their ill-gotten power.
In May, a "journalist" was arrested from Haryana's Ambala district after being charged with blackmail and extortion. The accused, Yashpal Sharma, ran a YouTube channel called Khabari Lal Haryana. He was accused of using the channel to malign property dealer Rajesh Mehta. Mehta filed a police complaint after claiming that he had been receiving extortion calls, which led to Sharma's arrest.
The Ambala Police arrested Sharma on 8 May under sections 384 (extortion), 500 (defamation), 501 (printing defamatory material) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code. One Vijay Rana, who worked as a middleman for Sharma, was also booked, along with the father-son duo of Dalip and Shristi Kumar. The police also recovered Rs 1 lakh from Sharma after arresting him.
According to the complainant, there was a long-standing property dispute between him and Dalip and Shristi Kumar, which was pending in a court in Ambala. Mehta alleged that the Kumars had also filed a false complaint against him at the Haryana 'CM Window' forum, but he was given a clean chit. He said he was shocked to learn that the Kumars were being interviewed on Khabari Lal Haryana and were levelling serious allegations against him. These allegations were played out over several episodes on Sharma's YouTube channel, and the story was gaining a lot of views through social media shares.
Mehta alleged that on 1 May, he had received a call from Rana, who had sought money to retract the stories. On 8 May, Rana offered to settle the deal for Rs 5.25 lakh. "I was not ready, but he kept calling, and were settled for Rs 4.25 lakh, with Rs 1 lakh as advance to stop the episodes from being re-shared on social media the same day (8 May)," Mehta said in his FIR registered at the Baldev Nagar Police Station in Ambala.
He said that to confirm that Rana was not faking the deal, he insisted on having a word with Sharma first. After receiving an assurance from Sharma, he handed the money over to the accused at their decided location. Mehta then gave a written complaint to the police, seeking action against Sharma and three others for extortion.
Ex-marketing professional
Pardeep Antal, who works as a reporter with Khabari Lal Haryana, said Sharma was a marketing professional. "He used to write on social issues on his Facebook page, which received a lot of praise. This prompted him to enter the media sector," Antal said.
He said Sharma had worked with reputed brands in marketing before starting his own magazine, Future Solution, to offer advertisement-cum-media solutions on a single platform. It became quite successful and was followed by Khabari Lal Haryana, launched on 20 February.
So far, the YouTube channel has produced 43 episodes on local civic issues, political debates, and edutainment programmes. However, on closer look, it is evident that many of the programmes regularly promote the products of advertisers under the garb of news.
Not a new phenomenon
This is not the first such incident to be reported in Haryana.
In March, the police arrested a freelance journalist after he filmed a Faridabad resident in a compromising position and demanded Rs 10 lakh to keep mum. The accused had allegedly hatched a conspiracy with a businessman who owed the victim Rs 6 lakh in a land deal.
The same month, a Kurukshetra-based journalist was arrested for smuggling people by passing them off as reporters on their way to cover the Commonwealth Games in Australia.
On 15 April, the police in Haryana's Karnal district busted a gang of blackmailers in Indri and also arrested two "journalists". According to the compliant filed at the Bayana Police Chowki, the accused, Bansi Lal, and his aide had introduced themselves as editors of Sat Samachar. THe police said they had demanded Rs 10,000 from Deepak Kumar, a local quack who was practising in the area without a licence. However, the victim informed the police and got them arrested instead.
In another such case, three months ago, two journalists, claiming to run the Tehelka News YouTube channel, were arrested from Nilokheri in Karnal district. The accused, identified as Nitin Kumar and Aman Kumar, were arrested after Dr Rakesh Dua filed a complaint, alleging that the journalists had demanded Rs 2 lakh and threatened to run a smear campaign against him. The journalists were arrested, along with two aides, while they were receiving the money.
In May, the Palwal Police arrested a fake journalist who was targeting unemployed youths by promising to get them a reporter's job in lieu of Rs 10,000. The accused, Veerpal Kumar, was caught when one Satpal Kumar registered a police complaint, alleging he had been duped.
Demand for regulation
Kamal Midha, president of the Haryana Patrakar Sangh, said they were aware of the problem. He said they had proposed setting up a district-level data bank to distinguish reporters who represent the mainstream media from self-styled journalists. A proposal has also been submitted to crack down on these "journalists" running blackmailing rackets.
The president of the Rohtak Press Club, Sunit Dhawan, said there should be a check on such YouTube channels mushrooming and self-proclaimed journalists who generate content for their platforms by putting the credibility of the media at stake. He said it was difficult for the public to differentiate between the mainstream media and "social media journalists", leading them to fall prey to unscrupulous elements.

The Weinstein Co. Files For Bankruptcy, Cancels Non-Disclosure Agreements
Enlarge this image toggle caption Richard Shotwell/AP Richard Shotwell/AP
The Weinstein Company Holdings LLC announced that it has filed for voluntary bankruptcy and entered into an agreement to sell its assets to a Dallas-based equity firm.
It also announced that it is ending all nondisclosure agreements that prevented victims of alleged sexual misconduct at the hands of disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein from talking about their experiences.
The Weinstein Co. will enter into a "stalking horse" agreement with an affiliate of Lantern Capital Partners in conjunction with entering into bankruptcy proceedings.
"Under the agreement, Lantern will purchase substantially all of the assets of the Company, subject to certain conditions including approval of the Bankruptcy Court. The Board selected Lantern in part due to Lantern's commitment to maintain the assets and employees as a going concern," said the company in a statement released late Monday.
But it was the second and third paragraphs of the statement that are likely to draw even greater attention in light of the many women who have come forward to accuse Weinstein of sexually harassment and abuse.
"Today, the Company also takes an important step toward justice for any victims who have been silenced by Harvey Weinstein. Since October, it has been reported that Harvey Weinstein used non-disclosure agreements as a secret weapon to silence his accusers. Effective immediately, those "agreements" end. The Company expressly releases any confidentiality provision to the extent it has prevented individuals who suffered or witnessed any form of sexual misconduct by Harvey Weinstein from telling their stories. No one should be afraid to speak out or coerced to stay quiet. The Company thanks the courageous individuals who have already come forward. Your voices have inspired a movement for change across the country and around the world."
The announcement comes after a group of investors, led by former Obama administration official, Maria Contreras-Sweet, tried and failed to purchase the assets of The Weinstein Co. earlier this month. That deal, which would have re-invented the firm as a female-run company, collapsed upon the discovery of debt previously unknown by the investors.
Weinstein has been accused of raping or sexually assaulting many women over decades.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who has brought suit against The Weinstein Co., Harvey Weinstein and his brother, Bob Weinstein, issued a statement praising the announcement.
Kramer said he met with residents along Pecan Avenue to try to ease concerns but did not meet with everyone who lives along Main Street. He said he did meet with Martinez, her husband and two of their neighbors on Main Street about their worries about nighttime lighting and traffic.
ARLINGTON, VA.—The solemn ritual of a burial with military honors is repeated dozens of times a day, in foul weather or fair, at Arlington National Cemetery, honoring U.S. service members from privates to presidents. But in order to preserve the tradition of burial at the nation's foremost military cemetery for future generations, the Army, which runs Arlington, says it may have to deny it to nearly all veterans who are living today. Arlington is running out of room. Already the final resting place for more than 420,000 veterans and their relatives, the cemetery has been adding about 7,000 each year. At that rate, even if the last rinds of open ground around its edges are put to use, the cemetery will be completely full in about 25 years.

“We're literally up against a wall,” a spokeswoman for the cemetery, Barbara Lewandrowski, said as she stood in the soggy grass where marble markers march up to the stone wall separating the grounds from a six-lane highway. Even that wall has been put to use, stacked three high with niches for cremated remains. The Army wants to keep Arlington going for at least another 150 years, but with no room to grow — the grounds are hemmed in by highways and development — the only way to do so is to significantly tighten the rules for who can be buried there. That has prompted a difficult debate over what Arlington means to the nation and how to balance egalitarian ideals against the site's physical limits. The strictest proposal the Army is considering would allow burials only for service members killed in action or awarded the military's highest decoration for heroism, the Medal of Honor. Under those restrictions, Arlington would probably conduct fewer burials in a year than it does now in a week.

A policy like that would exclude thousands of currently eligible combat veterans and career officers who risked their lives in the service and who planned to be buried in Arlington among their fallen comrades. “I don't know if it's fair to go back on a promise to an entire population of veterans,” said John Towles, a legislative deputy director for Veterans of Foreign Wars who deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. The group, with 1.7 million veterans, has adamantly opposed the new restrictions.

“Let Arlington fill up with people who have served their country,” said Towles, who is eligible under current rules because he was wounded in battle. “We can create a new cemetery that, in time, will be just as special.” There are 135 national cemeteries maintained by the Department of Veterans Affairs across the country. But Arlington is by far the most prominent, and curtailing burial there would mean changing the site from an active cemetery into something closer to a museum. The Army is conducting a survey of public opinion on the question through the summer, and expects to make formal recommendations in the fall.
“What does the nation want us to do?” Arlington's executive director, Karen Durham-Aguilera, said in an interview. “If the nation has the will to say we want to keep Arlington special and available, we have to make a change.” In a fitting turn of history, the cemetery now faced with a threat of overcrowding was created to address overcrowding. Early in the Civil War, the heavy death toll in battles near the capital soon filled Washington's existing cemeteries. Desperate for more burial space, the Quartermaster General of the Army, Montgomery C. Meigs, turned to a rolling green plantation just across the Potomac — the home of Gen. Robert E. Lee, whose decision to fight on the Confederate side marked him as a traitor in many Union eyes.

Meigs' men began burying corpses beneath simple wood markers in the fields, and then, in a grim rebuke to the absent owner, lined the flower garden with the graves of Union officers and built a tomb near the door of the plantation house to hold the bones of 2,100 unknown dead.

At first, Arlington was anything but a coveted resting place. Most early burials were of soldiers whose families could not afford to have their remains shipped home. But as revered Union officers chose to be buried in Arlington among the troops, the cemetery rose in prestige. The Tomb of the Unknowns was erected after World War I, and on nearly every Memorial Day since, the sitting president has laid a wreath there. Among the limestone rows are milestones of human progress: The first explorer to map the Grand Canyon, the first person killed in an airplane crash, the first astronauts to die trying to reach space. Some distinguished themselves on the battlefield, others in later life, including Albert Sabin, who served briefly as a wartime Army doctor and went on to develop a polio vaccine, and Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., a wounded Civil War lieutenant of little distinction who later became a Supreme Court justice. Most would have been barred under restrictions now being contemplated by the Army. The modern concept of Arlington — an egalitarian Elysian field where generals and GIs of every creed and color are buried side by side — did not truly emerge until the cemetery was desegregated after World War II, according to Micki McElya, a history professor at the University of Connecticut. “Many look to the place as a self-evident case for national inclusion and belonging, as an expression of the many and diverse become one,” McElya said in an interview. That, she said, is the Arlington cited by Khizr Khan, the father of an Army captain killed in Iraq and buried at the cemetery, when he urged Donald Trump to visit. “Look at the graves of brave patriots who died defending the United States of America,” Khan said in his speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. “You will see all faiths, genders, and ethnicities.”

Now, though, that all-inclusive idea is bumping up against the lack of space. Arlington has tried to stretch what room it has. It ended the old practice of burying family members side by side, and now stacks them two or three deep in a single plot. In sections that hold only cremated remains, the rows are now spaced closer together. But planners say those measures can do only so much. Under current rules, burial plots in Arlington are open to veterans who served long enough to retire from the military; to troops who were wounded in battle or received one of the three highest awards for valor; to prisoners of war; to troops who die while on active duty; and to a few civilians who serve in high-level government posts. Their spouses and dependents are also eligible. The Army has laid out several proposals for changing those rules to keep Arlington open longer, but only the most restrictive options would make much difference — and those are the least popular among veterans. “Everybody wants to see Arlington stay open,” said Gerardo Avila, a wounded Iraq veteran who spoke to Congress on the issue on behalf of the American Legion. He said that while he would gladly give up his own spot to ensure a place for a future Medal of Honor recipient, the Legion, with 2.3 million members, does not share that view. “You are voting your own rights away,” he said. “I'm not sure our members are willing to do that.”

Army surveys indicate that the public supports giving priority to troops killed in battle or awarded the Medal of Honor. But it is not hard to find graves in Arlington of arguably deserving men and women who did neither. On a recent evening, Nadine McLachlan knelt before the grave of her husband, Col. Joseph McLachlan, to trim the grass with scissors before arranging a bright vase of lilies. McLachlan was a fighter pilot who strafed the beaches of Normandy on D-Day; a week after, he was shot down and, though wounded, made his way back through enemy lines to safety. He went on to fly more than 100 more missions, earning the Legion of Merit, the Distinguished Flying Cross and 17 Air Medals for acts of heroism in flight. He survived the war and lived for six more decades, until 2005. So under the most restrictive proposals, he would not qualify for burial at Arlington. “My Joe was a wonderful man — very courageous, very kind,” Nadine McLachlan said. “I'm not sure that's fair, to cut out men like him. They were in the line of fire, even if they made it. Being buried here with his friends meant a lot to him. It really is a dilemma.”
