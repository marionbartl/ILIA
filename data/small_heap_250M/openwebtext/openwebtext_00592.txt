North Dakota's local authorities have brought attention to what they are calling the potentially the largest illegal oil waste dumping case in the state's history after a discovery in an abandoned building of hundreds of radioactive oil filter socks used in the production process.
State waste management authorities are describing the incident as potentially more than twice as large as another illegal dumping incident uncovered in February in McKenzie County.
State Waste Management Director Scott Radig told reporters that hundreds of radioactive oil filter socks were discovered earlier this month stuffed into trash bags in an abandoned auto repair shop in the small town of Noonan in northwestern North Dakota.
“It appears, unfortunately, to be the biggest one we've found,” Radig said. “And it appears to have been there for quite some time.”
Disposal of these radioactive oil socks is banned in North Dakota, and oil companies are required to transport them to approved waste facilities in other states, where landfills allow for a higher level of radioactivity.
Officials said the illegally dumped oil socks were tested for low levels of radioactivity, and that they presented no danger to the public unless directly handled.
The owner of the abandoned building is reportedly a felony fugitive—Ken Ward--who is suspected of doing “independent work” for the oil and gas industry.
“I suspect that [Ward] was doing contract work for some oil company and he told them he would — I'm sure for a price — take these and properly dispose of them,” Radig speculated. “He did it the cheap way, took the money and took off.”
According to local health officials, the oil production boom in the state has led to increasing incidents of illegal dumping, with cases of radioactive oil socks being found along roadsides, in abandoned buildings or in commercial trash bins.
In the meantime, state officials are working on new rules to better enable them to track oil field waste, with a draft due to be released to the public in June.

Philip Glass had already broken through the so-called “Curse of The Ninth” after completing his Tenth Symphony in 2012 – a mere six months after his Ninth. And when that was over, came the speculations wondering whether his best symphonies (the Eighth and Ninth) were already behind him. I think we can safely say that this is not the case, as his Symphony no. 11 gives us a Philip Glass back in his signature repetitive style, following a five year break from his rather lackluster but adventurous Tenth. The work was co-commissioned by the Bruckner Orchestra Linz, and Istanbul Music Festival. The work is thematically very close to his 2015 Double Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra, also co-commissioned by another Turkish institution, the Borusan Istanbul Philharmonic Orchestra (BIPO) who were on stage with their artistic director and principal conductor Sascha Goetzel for this evening's concert to play the symphony's Turkish première.

Glass' Eleventh echoes recent symphonies in structure, designed in three movements. The first movement's initial invocation was definitely Brucknerian, almost a homage in its unrelenting dialogues between the strings and the brass with heavy-duty falling on the shoulders of tuba and bass trombone. As it progressed, the movement reminded me of a Spanish Rhapsody with off-the-beat percussive strikes and Iberian chord progressions. The BIPO is a very fine orchestra, but it is primarily their brass and percussion sections that make them stand out, and during the first movement's many interludes, it was the brass that kept the musical conversation interesting. What was most interesting about the first movement was the complex polyrhythms the composer has put into use. Although, on the surface, the ideas sounded simple enough, once you started to count the beats, you couldn't easily make them out. It was on the heels of the increasing harmonic tension and rhythmic density that we arrived at the more serene second movement. The middle act, more reliant on strings, featured an uncharacteristically tranquil Sascha Goetzel, known for his joyous and festive style of conducting. As static as he was on the podium, that didn't take away from his masterful fine-tuning of his orchestra. He frequently hushed the brass and the woodwinds in favour of the strings to accommodate for the excess reverberation of the hall. He slowly lifted the veil off his strong brass guns though, as the movement peaked towards a final eruption, provoking an early ovation from the audience.

It was the third movement that proved both Glass and the BIPO at their best, however. This movement was mostly fast in its pacing, at times at marching tempo, at others, sprinting in a blissful discordance towards an eruption giving birth to a reincarnated leisurely stride. The orchestra's percussion section did a very fine job in keeping the strings and other sections in check, as the music tends to get quite hectic, particularly near the end, as Glass presents one false cadenza after another. Goetzel, accordingly, became more and more animated and he really has to be commended for his total control over the orchestra, especially during the symphony's chaotic but miraculous ending – one of the finest I've heard in any symphony.

The second half of the evening was reserved for The Double Concerto for Violin and Cello, part of Philip Glass' “The Concerto Project”, featuring siblings Mari Samualsen on violin and Hakon Samuelsen on cello. The composer's unconventional take on the double concerto was originally conceived for the ballet Swan Song, and it is hard to miss the music's yearning for a dance performance on stage. Each of the three movements is introduced with a tender duet section between the two solo instruments, as if between a male and a female dancer, followed by a more tempestuous orchestral section, originally written for a full dance company on stage. Without the dance elements present, however, the music falls flat, as if the audience is listening to a Bach concerto introduction that leads to the ether, rather than a contrapuntal and polyphonic orchestral composition. The duet sections were played gently and wistfully by the soloists, conjuring a romantic dialogue, void of any conflicts. The following orchestral parts, were also realized competently in vigour, diagonally opposing the soloists. In that sense, the concerto fulfills its premise of soloists against the orchestra, but when these two are not played in tandem, the effect is mostly lost. Be that as it may, the BIPO were in full form during the whole concerto with level dynamics and great rhythmic precision.
After repeated calls for an encore, the Samuelsen siblings came back on stage to play the Handel-Halvorsen Passacaglia, an excellent concert-ender and a virtuosity showcase for the soloists.

For me, preparation is all about the physical, the mental and most importantly, the spiritual. If I'm not spiritually in the right place, I'm a mess.
You're always trying to feel confident and to feel good about yourself, but what it comes down to is really giving up to someone else. Having faith. When I'm getting ready for a fight — when I'm in that locker room or I'm making that walk and I finally get to the Octagon — it's all spiritual.
When I'm spiritually in the right place, there's no stopping me.

You've left the plane and collected your luggage, and the last thing you want to do is submit to a customs search. Getting your souvenirs and taxable items out is a hassle, but nothing like the stomach churning thought of handing over your digital fingerprint to border officials.
Do you know what your rights are when travelling overseas with a laptop, smartphone or hard drive?
Travelling With Data
Flights have never been this cheap. Even with rising fuel costs, it's possible to zigzag across Europe and America for next to nothing, partially due to the rise of discount airlines like RyanAir and SouthWest Airlines.
Similarly, laptops have never been quite this portable. The rise of the affordable ultrabook What Is An Ultrabook & Can It Succeed? [Technology Explained] What Is An Ultrabook & Can It Succeed? [Technology Explained] Remember when the word laptop described virtually every mobile computer on the market? The choices were certainly easier back then (because there was simply less choice available), but today there's a far wider variety including... Read More and the obsolescence of optical media has made laptops cheaper, thinner, faster and thus easier to travel with. Many people never leave the country without their computers.
There are a lot of reasons why you might not want an airport security agent to rifle through your computer:
You might be traveling with privileged, confidential documents or files for whom you are personally responsible.
Your laptop might hold personal files, photos or correspondence whom you would rather keep private due to them being of a sensitive or intimate nature.
You might just find the idea of someone wandering through your personal files and correspondence makes you incredibly uncomfortable. That's not unreasonable.
When flying, we consent to put our laptops in separate x-ray bins for inspection. Likewise, depending on the routes we fly, we also consent to turn our phones and laptops on to prove they are genuine Flying to the US, Canada or UK? Here Are the New Rules Regarding Flying With Electronics Flying to the US, Canada or UK? Here Are the New Rules Regarding Flying With Electronics Flying to the UK or US?

But what about when the scrutiny our devices undergo reaches another level?
We're going to explore what rights customs and TSA agents have to inspect your mobile devices and computers. First stop? The Great White North.
Flying To Canada
The laws surrounding what (and who) goes into Canada fall under the Customs Act. This permits employees working for the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) to stop and search anyone entering Canada from any port of entry, including the land borders with the United States, seaports and airports.
The Customs Act also gives CBSA officers the right to search your laptops, tablets and smartphones in the same way they can search your bags. And they don't even need a warrant or any suspicion of wrongdoing. Want to learn more? Check out this privacy information sheet from the CBSA.
Flying To Australia
I've got some bad news for you. Australian customs have the right to inspect laptops and the contents of external hard-drives and removable media. They don't need a warrant or a court-order, and they don't need your permission.
As anyone who as ever flown to Australia will attest, as your flight starts to make its descent you'll be given a boarding card asking you to declare what you are carrying in your luggage, and on your person as Australia has some of the strictest laws in the world on what can be taken into the country.
There are some things that you'll be asked to declare that you might expect, such as food, fruit and untreated wood or other natural products. This is due to the country's fragile ecosystem having been ravaged by non-native species in the past. One surprising thing you'll have to declare is pornography. Although Australia is a liberal democracy with a number of progressive policies, they've got a number of restrictive laws on the books with respect to pornography.
If you are traveling into Australia with pornography or sexually explicit material, you will have to declare it. This also applies to homemade films and pictures. Failure to do so is an offense, and can result in legal action or a hefty fine.
And if you declare it, there's a chance that some embarrassed young customs agent might be given the unenviable task of having to look through the darkest and most depraved recesses of your hard drive.
Flying To The United Kingdom
Glenn Greenwald's Brazilian partner David Miranda was catching a flight to Rio de Janeiro from Berlin. It was a period when Greenwald was under immense public scrutiny, due to the then recent revelations by Edward Snowden about the depth to which the British and American security services were spying on Internet users Can You Escape Internet Surveillance Programs Like PRISM?

Ever since Edward Snowden blew the whistle on PRISM, the NSA's no longer secret surveillance program, we know one thing with certainty: nothing that happens online can be considered private. Can you really escape the... Read More , as well as Snowden's leak of tens of thousands of confidential documents to Greenwald and the Guardian newspaper.
And unfortunately for Miranda, he had a layover in London Heathrow.
He was detailed for nine hours under Schedule 7 of the UK's broad-reaching Terrorism Act, 2000. This states that the person seized has to give the examining police officer any information in his possession the officer requests, as well as any artifacts of objects in the suspect's possession. Any property seized must be returned after seven days.
His laptop and cell phone were seized, as well as other equipment. This was later challenged in the courts, although was found to be lawful. This is an extreme example, although not an isolated one. In 2013, Yulia Zamanskaya – a journalist working for the Voice Of Russia – had her laptop seized in Terminal 4 of Heathrow Airport due to containing material that was deemed to be terrorism-related.
Zamanskaya is a journalist working for a major Russian news publication, so reporting on terrorism is a significant part of her job. But what if you're not a journalist? What if you're just a sunburned tourist on your way back home from a beery beach vacation in Benidorm?
Police still have the right to inspect any devices at the border, due to the broad-ranging rules in the Terrorism Act, 2000. Indeed, each year sees 60,000 people have their devices inspected and the data stored therein duplicated and retained. The same laws which saw Miranda and Zamanskaya temporarily being separated from their laptops also apply to you.
Flying To The United States Of America
No surprises here: according to a 2008 ruling made in a federal court, customs agents at U.S. airports can inspect the contents of passengers' laptop computers. They don't even need any evidence to do so. The Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco declared a computer to be no different to a suitcase, car or any other property subject to search at an international border.
The above ruling also applies to tablet computers and smartphones. If it switches on and you can store things on it, it's fair game.
There have been numerous challenges to the TSA's rights to search your electronic devices. The most recent one was brought by Pascal Abidor, whose laptop had undergone a deep forensic search when crossing the border from Canada in 2010. His challenge was summarily dismissed earlier this year.
Encryption Can't Save You
You have no rights to resist an inspection. With this in mind, you might be tempted to resort to fully encrypting any mediums you travel with. We've previously written extensively about Truecrypt, and how it can help secure your hard drive.
Let's be blunt: encrypting your laptop or smartphone to prevent airport security from inspecting it is at the very least foolish, and massively illegal at its very worst. This is due to most countries having laws which mandate the disclosure of encryption keys on demand. Although, there is one surprising exception.
Let's start with Canada. There's not really a single Canadian law surrounding key disclosure. However, there is a broad range of existing legislation that could compel a person to disclose their decryption keys. Feel like refusing? Well, that's a little something called contempt of court, and can see you banged up for five years.
But what about Australia? According to the Cybercrime Act, 2001, magistrates can compel a person to provide a police officer with any decryption keys that they feel will unlock any evidential material. Failure to do so caries a maximum penalty of six months imprisonment.
Moving on to the UK, we've got the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, part III. This requires the disclosure of decrypted information or decryption keys to government representatives with a court order. If you fail to do so, you can expect a maximum of two years in jail.
Three people have been convicted for refusing to surrender their encryption keys, including a science enthusiast suffering from schizophrenia who had no prior criminal record, and only came to the attention of the authorities after sniffer dogs detected a model rocket he was importing from France.
The US is a bit confusing. Firstly, they've got quite a forward-thinking constitution which contains something called the Fifth Amendment. This protects people from being forced to incriminate themselves in a criminal trial.
In the US, the constitution reigns supreme. As a result, it's incredibly hard to have any key disclosure laws that are effective, whilst being legal under constitutional law.
Despite that, there are some precedents where a court has ordered people to surrender their decryption keys, including a case from 2012 where a Colorado woman was forced to make her laptop readable to the authorities. Amusingly, less than one month later, another court in the element circuit (which covers Florida, Alabama and Georgia) declared that forcing someone to decrypt one's laptop is a violation of the Fifth Amendment.
However, it's worth adding that customs and TSA agents have the right to refuse you entry into the country (or at least hold you up for a long time at the airport) for the most spurious of reasons.
The Bottom Line
Whenever you fly abroad, you give your implicit consent for someone to inspect your belongings. The all-seeing rubber-glove of airport security can go through your phone, laptop or tablet, and there's absolutely nothing you can do about it.
Have you ever had your laptop or hard drive searched? How do you feel about the laws? Sound-off in the comments, below.

They are the invisible waterways. Laced with farm manure, choked with invasive grasses and often seasonally dry, their subtle meanderings go unnoticed and unappreciated. There are hundreds of them in the Fraser Valley, providing critical habitat for endangered fish and frogs against a tide of government neglect, poor farming practices and public ignorance. On Zero Avenue in south Langley, some don't even have proper names, including F1.1, a ditch that flows into Bertrand Creek — one of the Fraser Valley's most important fish streams — and eventually the Nooksack River in Washington state's Whatcom County. The Washington state target for the Bertrand watershed is 49 fecal coliforms per 100 millilitres of water, to protect public health and avoid polluting Lummi shellfish beds. But the numbers flowing south from Canada are far above those levels — and livestock manure is to blame. State agency staff make regular trips north through the Aldergrove-Lynden border crossing to take water samples from the ditch, and analyze them at a Bellingham lab. The results show a spike of 34,000 fecal coliforms in November 2013 and 3,800 at Jackman Ditch at the border, just to the west. The May results are no better: 19,000 fecal coliforms in the Bertrand main stem at the border, 25,000 at nearby Cave Creek, and 3,000 in Jackman Ditch. Farm manure is part of a cycle that acts to diminish the productivity of fish streams, especially when there is no streamside vegetation to help keep the water cool. It creates conditions for growth of invasive sun-loving species such as reed canary grass, which clogs the ditches. This grass dies back annually and rots, stripping the water of oxygen during high temperatures. Then farmers demand to have the streams excavated to improve drainage; excavation causes even more damage. Ammonia in manure can also be toxic to fish at high levels. Nitrates, found in manure and fertilizers, have filtered into the aquifer to pollute wells used for drinking water. In 1998, the Washington state agriculture department developed a water-quality program backed by law. Dairy farmers are required to develop and follow manure management plans and there are regular inspections. In B.C., after more than two years of trying, the province is still embroiled in talks with farmers to find a compromise that would allow a crackdown on manure violators. “It's a significant concern, an ongoing challenge,” explains Andrea Hood, a program co-ordinator with Washington's office of shellfish and water protection. “Farmers in the county feel it's unfair that the state cracks down on them, while manure continues to flow unimpeded from Canada. “‘Why should we clean up when it's already polluted?' They maybe feel more persecuted ... whereas they don't see improvements from the north.” Without public recognition and protection, these important streams stand little chance of survival. • “People have no idea,” says Mike Pearson, a consulting biologist from Agassiz who has worked on federal recovery plans for endangered Salish suckers and Nooksack dace. “The majority of coho in the Fraser River are produced between Vancouver and Hope. Their habitat is under threat. The root problem is bad farming practices.” Pearson recalls surveying for fish on Elk Creek in Chilliwack and finding almost no fish in the main stem, but hundreds of coho in a roadside ditch that was slightly warmer and out of the stronger flow. “That's where they go in winter. They get off the main channel.”
He laments that agriculture is a big player on the land base, with “very little regulation environmentally. It's quite legal to spray and spread manure right up to the water's edge. I've even seen it spread over top of streams. It's an invisible problem, but once you understand it, it's everywhere.” Guillermo Giannico, a fisheries specialist at Oregon State University who did his PhD on juvenile coho in Langley, has documented 15 species of fish that depend on small streams flowing through farmland. Meandering streams with streamside vegetation and buffers from active farming are most productive for fish, while “torpedo ditches” lacking complexity are the least productive. The problem on both sides of the border is that these critical streams remain poorly protected, he says. Ditch F1.1 is directly across Zero Avenue from an Aldergrove mushroom farm, Truong's Enterprises Ltd. On the day The Sun visits, the property looks cluttered with debris. Water floods from the property almost across the narrow two-lane road into the ditch. A row of compost sits on the property only a few metres from the road. Owner Quan Truong is not around and does not return The Sun's phone calls. B.C. authorities are familiar with the mushroom farm, which was fined $18,641 by WorkSafeBC in 2012 for failing to install proper guardrails after a worker suffered a skull fracture when he fell two metres from a mobile work platform. This time, it's the pollution that has caught the province's attention. Ministry of Environment spokesman David Karn says that a new ministry team responsible for monitoring, compliance and stewardship is investigating “alleged discharge from the mushroom farm.” Of course, sometimes pollution goes the other way — and the Americans are known to take decisive action. In April, the state's Department of Ecology fined Sarbanand Farms and Pacific Pumping Inc. $4,000 each for spreading a large amount of manure last September on a bare field before heavy rain, allowing manure to pollute a tributary of the Sumas River, which flows north into the Fraser River. “Manure can be a resource or a waste, depending on how you use it,” said Ginny Prest, program manager for Washington's dairy nutrient management program. She remembers what it was like in the late 1980s into the early 1990s. “It was pretty ugly — a lot of manure getting into the water, shellfish bed closures, beach closures, those kinds of things.” • At the same time, farmers' reaction to nutrient legislation was “loud and unhappy,” she added. She estimated more than one-fifth of dairy farmers continue to use practices that have the potential to pollute. However, officials only act when pollution occurs to state waters. “You can see there is manure right up against the creek, no buffer, no setback,” she said. “We have to get that number smaller ... take stricter enforcement. It's going to take a legislative change to make that happen. The language could be stronger so we could be more proactive.”
Over the past decade, the state has issued 16 penalties and 169 warnings to dairy farmers for violations such as applying manure without adequate setbacks or to saturated fields, during non-application seasons or at inappropriate rates. Others relate to record keeping or collection, conveyance and storage. In 2013, the penalties included $7,000 and $9,000 for applying manure under inappropriate field conditions and $8,000 for a collection system malfunction. In one case in Custer, an inspector noted about 30 dead fish, some as far as almost three kilometres downstream from the spill. Whatcom County Health closed the beach at the mouth of California Creek and the state Department of Health closed commercial shellfish harvesting in Drayton Harbor for one week. The Washington legislation may have had some unintended consequences —the higher cost of meeting environmental laws leading to concentration of ownership. While the number of dairy cattle in the state has increased to 270,186 from 240,421 since the act came into effect, there's been a significant change in concentration of ownership, with the number of dairies dropping to 426 from 754. “Government policy in a lot of ways has helped facilitate the generation of factory farms,” said Prest, noting that the state legislation does not apply to other agricultural sectors that could also cause manure problems. On the B.C. side of the border, you'd be hard-pressed to find a dairy farmer fined for a manure-related violation — although that could be changing. In January 2012, the B.C. Ministry of Environment released a discussion paper on changes to the Agricultural Waste Control Regulations aimed at a code of practice — legally binding requirements for farms promoting sound practices for using, storing and managing wastes, such as manure and compost. It proposed that manure storage sites be located at least 30 metres from any watercourse, that farms must have the capacity to store at least a year's worth of manure and other waste, and that direct discharge to surface water or groundwater be banned. It raised the potential for buffers or setbacks from the property boundary and a ban on spreading manure during wet conditions, and hinted at a ban on applying manure to crops grown for human consumption 90 days prior to harvest. Angry farmers blocked the proposal. “The people who did it didn't understand agriculture,” said Ken Vandeburgt, a dairy farmer from Dewdney, east of Mission. “They threw this thing out at the farmers and it was like an instant war. A lot of it made no sense, it was complete nonsense.” • Farmers formed a committee and began working with the ministries of Environment and Agriculture on a model they could live with. More than two years after release of the discussion paper, agreement on new regulations giving the province more powers could happen later this year. “If a guy is going to spread manure right up to his creek and there is manure going in the creek, he's going to get nailed,” Vandeburgt, vice-chair of the B.C. Dairy Association, said of the changes. “That's pretty much where we're at. There is zero tolerance for pollution.

One day at a shopping mall in the afternoon, a woman was coming out of the mall from a shopping spree. She was in a happy mood. She had gotten to her car and loaded her stuff that she had bought into her trunk. When she was done loading, she shut the door of her trunk and she saw an old lady standing by the passenger side of her car.
The old woman said “Would you be a darling and give me a lift home? I don't have a car and I was walking all day.” The woman said “I'd be happy to.” So she unlocked the door for the old woman.
As she started to make her way around the car to the driver's side, she started to feel uncomfortable. So when she got in the car, she looked in her purse and said “Darn, I can't find my credit card. I'm going inside to see if anybody found it.” The old woman said “I'll wait for you here.”
The woman left to go look for help. Then she found a security guard and told him the situation. They went back to the woman's car and the passenger door was wide open. On the seat of the car was a shopping bag that the old woman had been carrying. Inside of the bag was the old woman's dress and a gray haired wig, along with a huge butcher's knife, a video camera, and a roll of duct tape.

RuPaul's Drag Race has inspired fans around the world to create toys and games, like “Guess Ru?,” based on their favorite reality series. Now designer Roberto Júnior has dreamed up a deck of Drag Race playing cards featuring queens from the first nine seasons of the series.
Roberto Júnior
Each queen gets a card number corresponding to what season they competed on (Trixie Mattel is a seven of hearts, Latrice Royale is a four of hearts, etc.).
The face cards—jacks, queens, kings and jokers—are reserved for the winners of each season, including both installments of All Stars, Sasha Velour from Season 9—and Tammie Brown who is an honorary joker.
And which lucky queen gets to grace the four coveted aces in the deck? RuPaul, of course! Each of the aces shows Ru from a different era in Drag Race herstory, with her most gag-inducing look from the Season 9 cast announcement.
Roberto Júnior
Sadly, these playing cards are nothing but a dream for now, but hopefully Junior—or some Drag Race fan—will find a way to make these a reality. It would be a perfect way to pass the time while the girls are sitting backstage waiting to see who will lip sync for their life!
But remember: the house always wins and RuPaul trumps everyone.

Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Model Reeva Steenkamp was shot four times through the bathroom door at the home of Olympian Oscar Pistorius, a South African official familiar with the case told CNN on Monday.
She was alive after she was shot and was carried downstairs by Pistorius, said the official, who was not authorized to release details to the media.
A blood-stained cricket bat has also emerged as key evidence in the case, according to the City Press newspaper of Johannesburg.
Detectives are working to determine whether the bat was used to attack Steenkamp or she used it in self-defense, the newspaper reported, citing a source with inside knowledge of the case. Detectives are also looking into the possibility that Pistorius used the bat to break down the bathroom door.
The details are the latest to emerge in the shooting death that has roiled the nation and left South Africans asking what went so terribly wrong inside the upscale Pretoria home of the man nicknamed "Blade Runner" for his lightning-fast prosthetic legs.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there were indications the 29-year-old model intended to stay the night at the house: She had an overnight bag and her iPad.
Opinion: Pistorius case and the plague of violence against women
Authorities have released little about a possible motive in the Valentine's Day shooting, while local media have reported that Pistorius had mistaken his girlfriend for an intruder. South African authorities have stressed that the scenario did not come from them, and said there was no evidence of forced entry at the home.
Police have charged Pistorius with murder, and he will appear in court Tuesday for a bail hearing. South African prosecutors have said they intend to upgrade the charge to premeditated murder, but have not released further details.
Pistorius, 26, has rejected the murder allegation "in the strongest terms," his agent said in a statement.
Nike's bullet ad with Pistorius backfires
Burial service
The same day Pistorius returns to court, Steenkamp will be buried in a private service in her hometown of Port Elizabeth.
Her burial Tuesday will come two days after South Africa's national broadcaster aired a pre-recorded reality TV show featuring Steenkamp discussing her exit from "Tropika Island of Treasure," on which local celebrities compete for prize money.
The decision to air the program took "much deliberation," and "this week's episode will be dedicated to Reeva's memory," said Samantha Moon, the executive producer.
The shooting has stunned South Africa, where Pistorius is a national hero as the first disabled athlete to compete in the able-bodied Olympic Games. He competed in the London Games as well as winning two gold medals in the Paralympic Games.
Headlines about the case have dominated in the days since Pistorius was arrested, though tight-lipped authorities have revealed little about what, if anything, the track star has said.
Questions swirl
Reports say Pistorius and Steenkamp became an item around November and were popular in South African social circles.
The night before the shooting, Steenkamp appeared to be looking forward to Valentine's Day.
"What do you have up your sleeve for your love tomorrow?" she asked her Twitter followers the day before. "Get excited."
Steenkamp was found in a pool of blood at Pistorius' home Thursday morning. Neighbors alerted authorities to the early morning shooting, saying they had "heard things earlier," police spokeswoman Denise Beukes has said. She did not clarify what the neighbors reported they heard.
Authorities also have not said whether Pistorius called for help.
Pictures of his walk to a police car, his head covered by a sweatshirt, have flashed repeatedly across television screens.
On Sunday, Pistorius canceled his appearances in five upcoming races.
The move is meant to help Pistorius focus on the legal proceedings and "help and support all those involved as they try to come to terms with this very difficult and distressing situation," said Peet Van Zyl of Pistorius' management company, In Site Athlete Management.
CNN's Robyn Curnow reported from South Africa; Chelsea J. Carter and Faith Karimi reported from Atlanta.
Berlin - On Tuesday night (22.09.15), a crowd of 40,181 inside the Olympic stadium in Berlin saw Hertha record their second home win of the season, beating Cologne 2-0. Summer signing Vedad Ibisevic was the hero of the hour, scoring both goals – one in each half. Home coach Pál Dárdai made three changes to the team which lost away to VfL Wolfsburg last time out. The-splendidly-named Rune Almenning Jarstein replaced injured first choice goalkeeper Thomas Kraft between the posts, while Niklas Stark took the place of Sebastian Langkamp (also injured) in central defence. Hertha opted for a two-pronged attack consisting of Salomon Kalou and Vedad Ibisevic. Tolga Cigerci reverted to the bench. Cologne boss Peter Stöger saw no reason to change his team wi´hich beat rock bottom Borussia Mönchengladbach in the Rhein derby on matchday 5. Gladbach's former Hertha coach Lucien Favre resigned this week.

After an initial 10 minutes period of waiting to see what the other team would do, both sides began to create some goal mouth action. Cologne blocked efforts by Darida and Stocker ab (13.). Moments later is a case of Déjà Vu for Hertha fans as they were reminded of the 0-2 defeat in Wolfsburg last time out. Cologne's failed to strike the ball properly but did appear to strike Hertha striker Kalou. Once again the referee's whistle remained silent. Moments later stand-in Berlin stopper Jarstein produced two top drawer saves to deny Cologne duo Vogt (16.) and Lehmann (17.). Kalou then threatened at the other end again but only momentarily, as the Ivorian goal-getter failed to bring the ball on target while under intense pressure (23.). Hertha remained on top and kept up the pressure, winning two corners in quick succession. The first saw Cologne keeper Horn tips over an Ibisevic header (39.), before Niklas Stark, headed agonisingly wide of the post (40.). Two minutes later Cologne's Anthony Modeste sent a header wide of goal (42.). Just as everyone was preparing for the opening half to end goalless, Hertha struck! Marvin Plattenhardt delived a superb cross onto the head of Ibisevic who gleefully nodded home in front of Hertha's famous east stand to give the home side a deserved half-time lead (43.).
Hertha began the second half the brighter of the two sides, with Kalou sending a fierce effort fizzing past the far post (53.). Then Valentin Stocker shot wide of target (56.). At the other end Cologne remained dangerous on the break. A last-ditch effort by Per Skjelbred was needed to prevent a dangerous square ball from reaching its target (60.). Three minutes later summer signing Mitchell Weiser headed the ball off his own goal line as Cologne substitute Gerhardt looked certain to equalise (63.). Dárdai's men remained calm during that period of Cologne pressure, relieving the pressure well whenever possible. Horn was called into action again to tip a Dardia shot from the edge of the box over his crossbar (73.). The Berliners dropped down a gear for the final quarter of an hour in order to protect their slender lead and Cologne failed to create any further scoring chances. Instead excellent approach work involving Alexander Baumjohann set up a simple tap in for Ibisevic to make it 2-0 to Hertha four minutes into injury time.
Hertha BSC were well worth their second home win of the season. They took the initiative in what was an entertaining game and created plenty of scoring chances. The-forced replacements in Dardai's starting line-up didn't affect their game, as Rune Jarstein and Niklas Stark both played well. Man of the match Vedad Ibisevic shone by scoring a brace of goals in his first start for his new club. So it was a great night in the nation's capital. Matchday 7 sees Hertha on their travels. Eintracht Frankfurt away from home next Sunday (27.09.15, 3.30 PM).

I'll admit, I was looking for something quick to throw up here tonight. I've been especially busy lately (I know, me saying I'm busy is like Bush keeping the terror alert on orange for three months and then expecting everybody to wake up Orange-level terrified every one of those 90 interminable days. Innefective) But really, it's been busier than usual.
Anyway, while I was looking for something fast, I saw the word Grammy trending on Twitter, and headed over to check it out. Apparently, America's adorable Canadian love puppet, Justin Beiber was not nominated for a Grammy this year. Tragedy, I know. As you can imagine, his fans were out in force.

Sinn Féin deputy first minister Martin McGuinness and Democratic Unionist Party deputy leader Arlene Foster clashed at the North South Ministerial Council meeting over the flying of the Irish Tricolour on Stormont House.
Sinn Féin deputy first minister Martin McGuinness and Democratic Unionist Party deputy leader Arlene Foster clashed at the North South Ministerial Council meeting over the flying of the Irish Tricolour on Stormont House.
Mr McGuiness dismissed the controversy as "much ado about nothing" and said unionists were "over-reacting" about the incident.
However, Ms Foster insisted it caused "huge offence" and called on the authorities to "get to the bottom" of how it happened as soon as possible.
The Police Service of Northern Ireland launched an investigation after the Irish flag was flown over the parliament building in Northern Ireland on Wednesday.
The hugely divisive issue of flags and parades has led to violent clashes between protesters and police in recent years.
Mr McGuinness and Ms Foster were speaking alongside Taoiseach Enda Kenny, Tánaiste Joan Burton and Foreign Affairs Minister Charlie Flanagan at the North South Ministerial Council meeting
There were wide-ranging discussions between leaders north and south of the border on issues including fuel smuggling, the all-Ireland bid for the Rugby World Cup and the ongoing tensions over the Northern Assembly's welfare budget.
Mr McGuinness condemned the criminals involved in fuel smuggling - and said they were damaging the peace process.
Mr Kenny committed to raising the issue of Northern Ireland welfare cuts at his meeting with British Prime Minister David Cameron in Downing Street on June 18. The Northern Ireland Assembly is at crisis point over its budget.
Mr McGuinness and Mr Kenny said they were both in favour of a cross-border investigation into allegations of republican sex abuse.
Authorities in both jurisdictions are carrying out separate investigations into allegations that sex abusers were moved both north and south of the border by the IRA.

EARTH Magazine: Naturally occurring methane found in groundwater in New York
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Megan Sever (msever@earthmagazine.org)
5/7/2014
Alexandria, Va. – Since hydraulic fracturing operations began in the Marcellus Shale region, debate has raged over whether drilling operations are causing high levels of methane in drinking-water wells. But few systematic scientific studies have been published to date, so it's unknown if high methane levels are natural or the result of contamination from nearby gas wells. Now, a new study is adding some much-needed baseline data for methane levels in groundwater in New York. The results suggest that at least in some cases methane occurs at naturally high levels in groundwater.
Read more about the findings and what they might mean for oil and gas exploration and production in the Marcellus Shale in the May issue of EARTH Magazine: http://bit.ly/1gRB0Rl.

Many southeastern Michiganders are excited to attend the “A Future to Believe In Rally” Monday at Eastern Michigan University's Convocation Center, where Bernie Sanders is set to speak about a “wide range of issues important to Michiganders including making college affordable, reforming our health care system, and getting big money out of politics,” as it states on Sanders' campaign website.
I am one of those supporters who are absolutely ecstatic to attend the event and hear Sanders speak; and, while I've already heard most of what he has to say, that is one of the very reasons I back his campaign for president — because for “over 40 years Sanders has built his political career on a very focused message about what he calls a ‘rigged economy,'” according to Tamara Keith, a NPR White House Correspondent.
Contrast that to Hillary Clinton, whose political career has been a rollercoaster of inconsistencies, platitudes and kowtows to corporate interests — including ties to special interests and Wall Street. She was also on the Wal-Mart Board of Directors for six years, between 1986 and 1992, during which she “remained silent as the world's largest retailer waged a major campaign against labor unions seeking to represent store workers,” according to the Huffington Post. And on October 11, 2002, according to the U.S. Senate Legislation and Records, she voted in favor of the “Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq,” which lead to a decade-long illegal war and thousands of needless casualties (most being innocent civilians).
Bernie Sanders strongly rallies against corporate interests and Wall Street, he has heavily criticized Wal-Mart for its poor wages and he voted against the Iraq War. A series of positions that only add to his resume as a progressive. Which, unlike Hillary, has earned him the trust of every-day Americans who are sick of seeing bought politicians move their lips to false promises and sickeningly obvious lies about somehow bettering the nation through this or that particular special method of the day.
Bottom line, Americans are tired of hearing the same old from vacuous politicians, because they never follow through; but, with Bernie Sanders' history of consistency and his genuine passion for the people, I think we have a shot at a better America. An America that is inclusive to all people, no matter their gender, sexual preference, ethnicity, religion or non-belief or economic class.
“A Future to Believe In Rally” will be at the EMU Convocation Center Monday, February 15. Doors open at 12:30 P.M. and the event is free.

The head of NATO warned Tuesday that, in addition to deploying forces and military equipment into eastern Ukraine, Moscow is now engaged in a “serious military buildup” on the Russian side of the border with Ukraine.
“We call on Russia to pull back its troops,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said as he arrived for a meeting with EU defense ministers in Brussels.
Mr. Stoltenberg, a former prime minister of Norway who took up the NATO leadership post last month, said the alliance has intelligence showing a flow of Russian troops, tanks, artillery and advanced air defense systems into eastern Ukraine.
Reuters reported that he said the Russian actions violate a Sept. 5 cease-fire agreement — the so-called “Minsk protocol” — that German leaders negotiated between Russia and Ukraine.
Ukrainian forces for months have clashed with Moscow-backed separatist rebels around the city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine and the recent troop buildups, along with an uptick in violence in the area, suggest the tenuous cease-fire has all but collapsed.
Last week, NATO's supreme allied commander, U.S. Air Force Gen. Philip Breedlove, cited intelligence showing “columns of Russian equipment, primarily Russian tanks, Russian artillery, Russian air defense systems and Russian combat troops, entering into Ukraine.”
Gen. Breedlove said Russia also appeared to be reinforcing its military bases in the Crimean Peninsula with equipment that is “capable of being nuclear,” but added that NATO wasn't certain nuclear weapons were being deployed.
Russia this year annexed the peninsula, which had been a region of Ukraine.
The latest developments have prompted fears in Washington that Moscow may now be preparing to try and repeat its Crimea action by annexing a wider swath of eastern Ukraine.
But Russian officials have denied charges they are expanding Moscow's military presence in the area.
Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, a spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry, called Gen. Breedlove's claims unfounded last week.
“We've stressed many a time there are no real facts behind the acts of shaking the air by Brussels officials,” said Gen. Konashenkov, who accused the NATO commander of making “alarmist anti-Russian allegations.”

Reserve guard Nate Robinson has agreed to sign with the Nuggets for two seasons, a league source confirmed Monday.
The source confirmed that the two-year deal is for the bi-annual salary cap exception, which is $4.03 million combined.
Robinson, 5-foot-9 and 180 pounds, averaged 13.1 points, 4.4 assists and 24.4 minutes in 82 games last season with the Chicago Bulls. He made 141-of-348 (.405) 3-point attempts last season, which would rank higher than only two Nuggets — Wilson Chandler (.413) and Evan Fournier (.407) — who made more than 50 attempts in 2012-13.
Robinson, 29, has a bit of history with the Nuggets. He was involved in the 2006 Nuggets-Knicks fight when Carmelo Anthony and J.R. Smith mixed it up with Mardy Collins and Robinson.
With the Bulls last season, Robinson made waves with a 23-point fourth quarter against the Nets in the playoffs, on his way to 34 in that game.
At the 2010 all-star weekend, Robinson became the first three-time slam dunk contest winner. He also won in 2006 and '09.
The eight-year NBA veteran was drafted by Phoenix with the 21st overall pick of the 2005 draft. He left the University of Washington after his junior season. He played football for the Huskies in 2003 before his father convinced him to concentrate on basketball. He was first-team all-Pac-10 as a sophomore and junior.
Robinson has averaged 11.5 points and 3.0 assists in his NBA career, and has made 36.3 percent of his 3-pointers. He also has played for the Boston Celtics, Oklahoma City Thunder and Golden State Warriors.
Mario Hezonja's rookie season showed he still has a lot to learn. While other players seem racing ahead of him, Hezonja clearly still needs some seasoning.
Mario Hezonja has had a rough start to the 2017 season.
The Orlando Magic understood when they picked him with the fifth pick in the 2015 Draft out of Croatia that he was a promising prospect who would take some time to blossom into a full rotation player. They hoped he would still be able to provide the shooting the team needed to break through and continue to grow from there.
But his rookie season showed Hezonja still has a lot to learn both on the defensive and the offensive end. The results did not come immediately.
Hezonja has shown some more confidence and signs of life early in his sophomore year. But it is hard not to look at the success so far from Dario Saric — both at the Olympics and with the Philadelphia 76ers — and wonder why.
The way Hezonja developed as a young player in Spain has a lot to do with their different development tracks.
Hezonja did not play too much in Europe. This is why he is, more or less, starting from scratch as a basketball player.
That differs from Dario Saric. The Philadelphia 76ers' Croatian power forward matured on every basketball team he played in. He established his role on the teams he played, eclipsed those teams, and then entered the NBA.
Saric's plan to grow as a player is paying off. The Magic should learn from this. Sometimes waiting on a player stashed overseas makes sense.
It worked for Hezonja's countrymen — Dario Saric and Bojan Bogdanovic. Hezonja's early NBA struggles likely have to do with his upbringing in basketball.
Patience pays off, and developing for a young player comes easily if he is playing serious minutes, even in a weaker league. Hezonja's relative inexperience entering the league certainly played a role in the slow start to his career.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) seems closer to putting his full support behind his opponent for the White House, Hillary Clinton, to further strengthen her campaign against the Republican Party's presumptive nominee, Donald Trump.
“We have got to do everything that we can to defeat Donald Trump and elect Hillary Clinton,” Sanders said Thursday to a Bloomberg reporter for a PBS program. “I don't honestly know how we would survive four years of a Donald Trump [presidency].”
Sanders has before said he would fight for the nomination up to the Democratic National Convention later this month. But when asked Wednesday night on MSNBC if he was “not denying” the report that there were talks of a potential endorsement, Sanders replied, “that's correct.”
Clinton was declared the party's presumptive nominee at the beginning of June.
Gravitational variations across Australia. Credit: Christian Hirt et al.
Keen weight-watchers might notice that standing on a set of scales in Tasmania produces a slightly higher reading than in Queensland.
That's because the Earth isn't perfectly spherical, so gravity varies ever so slightly around the world.
An Australian-German research team recently combined gravity measurements with satellite data and small-scale topographical models to find that gravity varies by about 0.7%: about 40% larger than previously expected.
That means a 100kg person weighs 700g more near the North Pole, where gravity is 9.83ms-2, than at Peru's Nevado Huascaran summit, where gravity is 9.76ms-2.
The same person would weigh 200g more in Tasmania than Queensland, where gravity is 9.78ms-2 and 9.805ms-2 respectively.
“Your weight is largest in Tasmania and smallest in NT/Queensland,” Curtin University researcher Christian Hirt, who led the research, told Business Insider.
“This reflects the dominating effect of Earth's flattening on the gravity field: Earth's gravity is generally the largest near the poles and smallest in equatorial regions, and experiences a further decrease as you go higher [for example, in mountainous regions].
“[Gravity] varies because Earth rotates, the flattening of Earth, and because the mass-distribution is not homogeneous – think about valleys and mountains that makes Earth deviate from a perfect sphere or ellipsoid, or ore-bodies with higher mass-density than the surrounding masses.”

Hirt said the maps were created with the help of the government-supported iVEC supercomputing facility in Western Australia, and were more detailed than previously available maps because they accounted for small-scale topographical features like Ayers Rock.
Researchers expect the maps to be used by civil engineers to help position canals, bridges and tunnels, and miners who could analyse the data to find target areas for mineral exploration.
Hirt said they had no plans to commercialise the maps and data, which are freely available online.
The study was supported by the Australian Research Council; a report was published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters late last month.

When Kent Hirozawa's term ended last month, the NLRB was reduced to three members – two Democrats and one Republican. By tradition, it takes three Board Members to reverse precedent, and since no proposed rules are pending, it's fair to say that President Obama's NLRB will not be breaking any new ground for the duration of his term. As a result, this seems like a good time to look back on the Obama Board. During President Obama's two terms, the NLRB has been as noteworthy for the partisan wrangling it has generated in Congress as for substantive labor law. The first part of this review will look at how Republican hardball tactics led to three Supreme Court cases and a change in the filibuster rules and the next installment will focus on some of the decisional highlights.
One of the most notable aspects of President Obama's NLRB is the difficulty the President has had filling the seats of the five Board Members. As a result, at the end of President Obama's eight years in office, there will have been only 41 months where the Democrats had a three-person majority on the Board. When President Obama came into office there were three vacant seats. In April 2009, he announced his intent to nominate Craig Becker and Mark Pearce and he waited for Republicans in Congress to recommend a Republican to fill the third empty seat. Finally, on July 9, 2009, President Obama formally sent three nominations to the Senate. The Republican Senators on the Health, Education, Labor & Pension (HELP) committee submitted 280 questions for Becker to answer in writing. Then Senator McCain (who you may remember lost to President Obama) insisted on holding the first hearing on an NLRB nominee since 1994. Even after the hearing, the Republicans still would not allow an up or down vote on Becker's nomination. Instead, the Democrats had to file for cloture and that vote failed when 52 Senators voted for cloture and 33 voted against. These Republican obstructionist tactics ultimately led the Senate Democrats to reform the filibuster rules so that (except for the Supreme Court) it no longer takes 60 votes to confirm a Presidential nominee.
While the Republicans dragged their heels on filling the vacant seats on the Board, the two remaining Board Members, Wilma Liebman and Peter Schaumber did their best to decide the cases where they were able to reach a consensus. But, in June 2010, in New Process Steel, L.P. v. NLRB, the Supreme Court held that they lacked authority to issue any orders, forcing the NLRB to revisit the 500 cases that they had decided.
President Obama did eventually place Becker on the Board as a recess appointment, but Becker did not take office until April 2010 and his appointment only lasted until January 3, 2012. Since the Republicans were still threatening to filibuster President Obama's nominees, the President made three additional recess appointments on January 4, 2012. But, in NLRB v. Noel Canning, the Supreme Court held that the appointments were invalid because the Senate was holding a series of pro forma sessions every three days when President Obama made his recess appointments. As a result of the Supreme Court's decision, the Board had to reconsider over 100 cases that were decided by the recess appointees. Needless to say, this delayed decisions in other pending cases.
Not only did the Republican Senators block President Obama's appointments of Board Members, but they also blocked his initial choice to serve as NLRB General Counsel. In June 2010, President Obama asked an NLRB career employee, Lafe Solomon, to serve as Acting General Counsel, and then in January 2011 the President sent his nomination to the Senate. The Senate refused to act on Solomon's nomination, largely because Solomon had authorized a complaint against Boeing when Boeing transferred a 787 production line from its unionized Washington State facilities to a non-union site in South Carolina. Solomon's tenure as General Counsel led to the third Supreme Court case involving the Board's authority. This case, NLRB v. SW General, Inc., which will be argued this fall, involves construction of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998. Following the lead of Presidents Clinton and George W. Bush, President Obama construed the Vacancies Act to allow Solomon to serve as Acting General Counsel while his nomination was pending, but the D.C. Circuit held that Solomon lacked authority to continue serving as Acting General Counsel while his nomination was pending.
It's truly remarkable that President Obama's efforts to make appointments to this small, relatively powerless federal agency have led to three Supreme Court cases. But, this reflects the outsized role that hostility toward the labor movement plays within the Republican Party. This antipathy is evident in a press release issued last month by the Chairman of the House Education and the Workforce Committee that asserted “harassing and threatening the employer with frivolous charges … has long been the standard operating procedure for unions.” Back in the beginning of President Obama's first term, Senator Mike Enzi's spokesperson stated that Senator Enzi, then the ranking Republican on the HELP committee, “believes that the President is due some deference when it comes to choosing nominees – that's one of the consequences of the last election.” But, when the Democrats lost their 60th vote in the Senate, Senator Enzi apparently changed his mind, and he supported the Republican filibuster of Craig Becker's nomination. As we've seen with Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland, this is now the new normal. The next President can no longer assume that qualified nominees will gain Senate approval. Instead, it's time to start gearing up for a fight to ensure that the Board can operate at full capacity throughout the next Administration.

“I'VE seen grown men with tears in their eyes” in front of it, an auctioneer from Sotheby's said as he opened bidding on June 29th on the 1,109-carat Lesedi La Rona, the biggest diamond to be discovered in over a century. Within minutes the tears were, if anything, of embarrassment. Bidding, which started at $50m, was desultory. A rough stone that Sotheby's had put in the same league as the 3,107-carat Cullinan diamond, discovered in South Africa in 1905, failed to make its $70m reserve. “I'm a bit disappointed. There were no private buyers and the diamantaires stayed away,” said Lukas Lundin, chairman of Lucara Diamond, a Canadian firm that unearthed the stone in Botswana last year.
It was the latest disappointment to befall an industry that has had little to celebrate. Two days before, William Lamb, Lucara's chief executive, said he believed the auction would symbolise the allure of diamonds and their promise for African development. He hoped to “dispel the rumour that all diamonds are bad”. That reek of notoriety has clung to the industry in recent years, especially among the millennial generation that came of age as evidence of “blood diamonds” emerged from the war in Sierra Leone in the 1990s.

Since 2003, about 75 countries linked to the diamond supply chain have allied with non-governmental organisations in the Kimberley Process (KP), which aims to ban the export of diamonds to fund conflict. It is still considered a badge of honour within the industry, but this year NGOs have boycotted it, accusing the chair country, the United Arab Emirates, of leniency toward the sale of conflict diamonds from the Central African Republic.
Financial stresses are also mounting, especially on “sightholders”, the family-run middlemen who buy rough diamonds and ship them to places like Antwerp and Mumbai for cutting and polishing. Since the financial crisis, banks have come under pressure to ensure they are not lending to businesses associated with money-laundering, transfer pricing and terrorist financing. The publicity-shy middlemen have been caught out by the pressures to improve transparency. “Their corporate structures look like bowls of spaghetti,” says Faz Chaudhri, a diamond-industry consultant.
In June Standard Chartered shut down its $2 billion diamond-financing business, saying it was beyond the bank's new “risk tolerance”. De Beers, an industry leader, recently told the 80-odd sightholders authorised to buy its rough diamonds to shed an aura of “secrecy and discretion” and from next year produce consolidated accounts under international standards. It said more than $12 billion of bank credit would be subject to tighter norms.
The reputational headaches have been compounded by a glut of diamonds caused by a slump in consumer demand in China. That has dragged prices of top-quality cut diamonds down from about $12,000 per carat to $7,400 in five years, according to Rapaport-RapNet Diamond Trading Network, a price index.
Against this backdrop, a technological challenge is also emerging that could make it harder for the industry to win over the millennial customers on whom future sales depend. From China to California, boffins are improving their ability to cultivate diamonds in labs. They are looking beyond the billions of carats of synthetic diamonds produced under high temperature and pressure that are used in industries such as oil drilling. Now they are perfecting gem-quality stones for jewellery.
Since last year, California-based Diamond Foundry has been producing lab-grown rough diamonds of a quality almost indistinguishable from those dug up from the ground, produced using chemical-vapour deposition, a technology common in semiconductors. In a plasma reactor as hot as the sun, atomised gases produce carbon atoms that attach to the crystal lattice of a natural diamond seed, or substrate, enabling a new diamond to grow. Martin Roscheisen, the firm's boss, says productivity is the essence; his firm can grow 150-300 gems in a two-week batch, rather than just a handful previously. They can be cut as exquisitely as any diamond and are only slightly less expensive, he says.
The firm seeks to bolster their appeal by attacking traditional miners at their weakest point—ethical sourcing. The impact is more deeply felt because one of its backers is Leonardo DiCaprio, star of “Blood Diamond”, a film released in 2006. Selling its diamonds as “morally pure” should play on the social conscience of millennials. Diamond miners chuckle at the thought of slipping a lab-grown diamond onto an engagement finger as a symbol of eternal love. But Mr Roscheisen says that buyers will at least know where his stones came from (even if it is California). Buyers of mined diamonds will not.
Sales of such diamonds are still minuscule compared with the $14 billion of rough stones dug up each year. Frost & Sullivan, a consultancy, estimated in 2014 that they could grow strongly, especially as traditional mines are exhausted (see chart). Industry veterans, however, believe that as production soars, values will plummet.
Yet the ethics-based marketing still troubles the industry. It tars all miners with the same brush, possibly unfairly. It also feeds the industry's insecurity about the tastes of millennials, who may prefer spending on stunning experiences rather than diamonds, and who are taking longer to forge committed relationships. This month, the Diamond Producers' Association, an industry body, came up with a slogan, “Real is rare,” aimed at such consumers.
This may lack the resonance of De Beers's “A Diamond is Forever”, one of the great slogans of the 20th century. But, by paying a backhanded compliment to the threat from synthetics, it shows the industry is becoming less complacent. These days, any industry that thinks anything can last forever is ripe for toppling.
(My daughter in an Amish schoolhouse)
I have written much about homeschooling versus public schooling. I have done both and each has advantages and disadvantages. I pretty much allow my kids to make their own choice as to the type of schooling they prefer and all three are in public schools right now. But for weeks now I have been considering pulling rank and taking my middle child, my daughter, out of school and continuing her education at home. I always thought she would be the best equipped to handle public schooling but some changes in her mood and behavior lately are causing some concern. She is only in Kindergarten for cripes sake but if this year is an indication of more like this to come… I am so very afraid.
Academically she is doing well and this is no surprise.. she is a VERY smart cookie. Socially she is doing well, she has friends and she enjoys school for the part. So I guess I am the one with the problem. I have a problem with her being more than a little obsessed with how fashionable her clothes are. I have a problem with her throwing tantrums if I try to make her wear the wrong color, a skirt that has not been bejeweled in some way, or heaven forbid.. a plain t-shirt. I have a problem with everything she wears or owns either adding to or detracting from her “popularity points” at school. No I am not kidding.
I have a BIG problem with my six year old little girl acting more like a freaking teenager with every single day she spends in these public institutions! I also see a problem when observant family members start using terms like “mean girl” or “diva” to describe some of her behavior lately and not because they dared say it, but because they have a point.
This just confirms for me that public schools are the WORST type of social setting for kids. They may or may not be good for education but for socialization and for exposing kids to good role models… they really suck. I am putting so much effort in counteracting the bad stuff she learns there that it just makes sense to pull her out altogether.
I have some big decisions to make over the summer. Do you have any advice or experience for me?

Filed under ghc.
This is the first blog post by our colleague Austin. Austin is one of our GHC engineers, part of the GHC HQ team and carries the heavy burden of being GHC release manager.
Today, GHC 7.8.1 RC1 has been released after many months of work, with a huge number of new features.
There are some great highlights in the new release, including:
A host of I/O manager improvements, which results in significantly better scalability on multicore machines (up to 32 to 40 cores).
The new code generator is now live. There are some new and improved optimizations, like better support for turning self-recursive tail calls into loops. Along with that, there's some preliminary support for SIMD operations in the LLVM backend, and other optimization improvements.
Improvements to the compiler and build system, including a parallel ghc --make -j , and significantly better (but not yet perfect) cross compilation support. We've also merged full iOS support, so it should be possible to build an iOS compiler with the main tree.
Dozens of other improvements, new features, and tons of fixed bugs (OS X 10.9 support, dynamic GHCi, Applicative-Monad warnings, etc).
See the release notes for the full details.
You can download the sources or pre-built binaries for your platform.
How big has this release been? The other day I did an approximated diffstat between the 7.6 and 7.8 branches:
2784 non-merge changesets 964 files changed, 99952 insertions(+), 116187 deletions(-)
That's just in GHC itself, not including the extra repositories. We've had contributions from over 70 people this release, including 15 new committers in 2013 and 2014. As always, GHC HQ and our many other contributors have yet more stuff planned for the future (Overloaded Record Fields, Applicative Do, further integer-gmp optimizations, and more type system features).
This release includes over a year of hard work by many people, and hopefully it will turn out to be a great release (finally). But please try the RC — it's much easier for us to fix bugs before it's done!
Iraq's former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki had reportedly siphoned off $500bn (£327bn) during his tenure between 2006 and 2014, it has been alleged. The Iraqi Commission of Integrity (CoI) has claimed nearly half of the government's revenues during the eight-year period had been "stolen".
What is being termed as "the greatest political corruption scandal in history", CoI's spokesperson Adil Nouri told the Iraqi parliament that as much as half a trillion dollar funds from the government's coffers have systematically disappeared during al-Maliki's tenure. Nouri said the war-torn country's oil income alone amounted to $800bn between 2006-14. He added the Maliki administration also received aid amounting to $250bn from several countries including the US in these years. The CoI has been tasked with investigating corruption scandals in Iraq.
"[Around] 600 officials including ministers, deputy ministers, advisors, general directors have been sued on grounds of corruption. There are even officials who have been sentenced to 130 years in jail," the Iraqi parliament heard from Nouri. "Former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has also been sued for corruption but there is still no solid decision or development so, he is still out of jail."
Iraq is considered as the most corrupt country in the Arab world, according to the latest Transparency International report. There were widespread protests across the country against top government authorities forcing the current Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to take sweeping measures.
As part of his reforms, he dismissed around 123 high-ranking government ministers and officials in 2014. Meanwhile, al-Maliki, who took over as vice-president after he was expelled as premier, was also sacked in August 2015, when al-Abadi announced another set of political reforms.
In his address to the Iraqi parliament, Nouri pointed out that the defence ministry was the nerve-centre of the massive corruption scandal. He said: "There are a great number of them (ghost employees) in the ministry of interior...There are 57,000 people being paid as workers since 2007, when in fact they have not been to work a single day," according to the Kurdish news agency, Rudaw. "The ministry of defense has started carrying out some procedures to eliminate this kind of corruption. It has been decided to make everyone receive his own salary in person instead of lists."
Former North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) is struggling to find a new job due to widespread public disapproval of HB 2, a state law he signed last March that targets transgender people.
“People are reluctant to hire me, because, ‘oh my gosh, he's a bigot' ― which is the last thing I am,” McCrory said in a recent podcast interview first reported by The News & Observer.
HB 2 prevented local governments from passing anti-discrimination protections for LGBTQ people, and requires that individuals use the bathroom that corresponds with the gender listed on their birth certificate. The law has cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars as a result of companies and businesses bypassing North Carolina in protest. McCrory ended up adding protections for sexual orientation and gender identity via an executive order, but he left the bathroom portion of the bill untouched.
“North Carolina has already lost hundreds of millions of dollars in economic activity and thousands of jobs as a direct result of House Bill 2, but I guess we can start adding Gov. McCrory's career to the total as well,” Mike Gwin, a spokesman for the North Carolina Democratic Party, said in a statement.
Advocacy groups like Equality NC, Campus Pride, the Human Rights Campaign and the American Civil Liberties Union mobilized against McCrory in protest of the bill's transphobic nature.
“HB2 really is a wink toward the religious conservatives who want to help steer this state's direction,” Carla Merritt, a trans woman, told The Huffington Post in November. “HB2 is all about us, people like myself, and [McCrory is] really fortunate he hasn't gotten anyone killed yet.”
In the podcast interview, McCrory, who insisted during his failed re-election bid that “the left” had introduced the “radical concept” of gender identity to North Carolina, blamed liberal groups for harming his reputation.
“If you disagree with the politically correct thought police on this new definition of gender, you're a bigot, you're the worst of evil,” he said. “It's almost as if I broke a law.”
McCrory didn't go into much detail about his current career trajectory, but he did say he's pursuing options in consulting and advisory board work.
“I've currently accepted several opportunities in business to do work that I'd done prior to becoming governor in consulting and advisory board positions, and I've also been exploring other opportunities in academia, nonprofits and government,” he said, according to The News & Observer. “And I'll hopefully be making some of those decisions in the near future.”
Dubai's largest Islamic bank said that it was offering Tamweel shareholders Dh1.25 per share to buy the remaining stake in the company.
Dubai Islamic Bank has made an offer to buy the remaining 13.5 per cent of the Sharia-compliant mortgage lender Tamweel which it does not already own.
Dubai's largest Islamic bank said that it was offering Tamweel shareholders Dh1.25 per share to buy the remaining stake in the company, which it did not purchase back in 2013 when it bought a majority 86.5 per cent stake in Tamweel and took the company private.
According to Bloomberg data which reports that there are currently 864.99 million Tamweel shares in circulation, at the offer price the remaining stake would be worth about Dh146.3 million.
The largest shareholders in Tamweel after DIB are listed as Amundi Funds Equity Mena and Deka Middle East & Africa.
The offer will be open for one month until it expires on April 30.
Like its key rival Amlak Finance, Tamweel was an immediate casualty of the 2008 global financial crisis when credit markets froze and the two were unable to access fresh sources of capital.
Both companies stopped issuing new loans and slashed staff numbers as the bottom fell out of the country's property market and abortive moves were made to merge the two.
The merger plan was abandoned when Tamweel, which had been traded on the Dubai Financial Market when the crisis hit, was converted into a private joint stock company and delisted in 2013 after DIB acquired a majority stake in the troubled mortgage provider.
At the time the bank's board approved plans to fully acquire Tamweel.
Protracted negotiations with lenders and large distressed legacy loan books have meant the lenders have not reaped the full benefits of the Dubai real estate market rebound over the past two years.
“This will provide another opportunity to those shareholders of the company who missed out on the previous offer by the bank,” DIB said in a bourse statement. “These shareholders now have limited options to exit following delisting and conversion of the company into a private joint stock company.”
The news comes as Amlak prepares to start trading again on the Dubai Financial Market after an absence of six years.
The rival Sharia-compliant mortgage lender, which is 45 per cent owned by Emaar Properties, announced last month that it was aiming to have its stock readmitted to the DFM for restart of trading this month after it completed a restructuring of US$2.7 billion worth of debt last August.
“Amlak is now well placed to resume normal business operations and work towards creating future value for our shareholders once again,” said the Amlak vice chairman Ali Ibrahim Mohammed last month.
However, with property prices expected to weaken, this year investors may see its return to the market as being two years two late.

.- In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court sent the Little Sisters of the Poor HHS mandate case back to the lower courts on Monday, in light of new developments in the case.
“We are very encouraged by the Court's decision, which is an important win for the Little Sisters. The Court has recognized that the government changed its position,” said Mark Rienzi, senior counsel at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty and lead attorney for the Little Sisters of the Poor.
“It is crucial that the Justices unanimously ordered the government not to impose these fines and indicated that the government doesn't need any notice to figure out what should now be obvious – the Little Sisters respectfully object,” he continued.
Religious charities including the Little Sisters of the Poor had sued the federal government saying that they were being coerced, under threat of heavy fines, to violate their consciences. They said that despite revisions, the Obama administration's federal contraception mandate requires them to cooperate in actions they believe to be immoral.
The mandate began as part of the Affordable Care Act, which required coverage for preventative care in employee health plans. The Department of Health and Human Services, in its regulations released after the law was passed, interpreted this to require employer coverage for contraceptives, sterilizations, and drugs that can cause abortions.
Churches and their immediate affiliates, like schools and parish groups, were exempt from the mandate but religious non-profits, charities, and universities were not. Some large corporations were exempt from the mandate because their health plans that existed before the health care law were “grandfathered” into its regulations.
Heavy fines are the punishment for not complying with the mandate. Many religious institutions objected to complying with the mandate, saying they were being forced to violate their consciences by providing coverage for practices they believed were immoral. They were being coerced to cooperate in such acts, they said.
After the mandate was issued, the government offered an “accommodation” to objecting parties – they could notify the government of their religious objection, and it would then direct their insurer to provide the mandated coverage free-of-charge. The government argued that contraception can be offered without cost because it reduces later costs associated with births and provides “tremendous health benefits” to women.
The Little Sisters and other charities said this “accommodation” still required them to violate their consciences, because they were effectively acting as “gatekeepers” for the contraception coverage. They also voiced concern that because it was still part of their health plan, they would ultimately end up paying for the coverage they found immoral.
A total of more than 300 plaintiffs have sued to challenge the mandate. In the case currently before the court, Zubik v. Burwell, the Little Sisters are joined by other plaintiffs including the Archdiocese of Washington, Bishop David Zubik of Pittsburgh, the pro-life group Priests for Life, and several Christian colleges and universities.
The Supreme Court, in a rare move in the middle of a case, had ordered both parties to come up with alternative solutions, if possible, of guaranteeing both contraceptive coverage for employees and religious freedom protections for the non-profits.
“Following oral argument, the Court requested supplemental briefing from the parties addressing ‘whether contraceptive coverage could be provided to petitioners' employees, through petitioners' insurance companies, without any such notice from petitioners',” the court's statement read.
“Both petitioners and the Government now confirm that such an option is feasible.”
The Little Sisters and other plaintiffs, in their brief, outlined an acceptable alternative: when setting up their health plan with their insurer, they would express their wish for a health plan without coverage for the contraceptives, sterilizations and abortion-causing drugs. The insurer would take note and offer employees “cost-free contraception coverage” on the side and outside the health plan.
For their part, “the Government has confirmed that the challenged procedures ‘for employers with insured plans could be modified to operate in the manner posited in the Court's order while still ensuring that the affected women receive contraceptive coverage seamlessly, together with the rest of their health coverage,” the statement read.
Because of the new developments in the case, the court then sent the group cases back to their respective federal courts – the Third, Fifth, Tenth, and D.C. Circuit Courts of Appeals.
“Given the gravity of the dispute and the substantial clarification and refinement in the positions of the parties, the parties on remand should be afforded an opportunity to arrive at an approach going forward that accommodates petitioners' religious exercise while at the same time ensuring that women covered by petitioners' health plans “receive full and equal health coverage, including contraceptive coverage,” the court stated.
The Supreme Court did not say if the government's mandate and “accommodation” violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Under that federal law passed in 1993, if the government action “substantially burdens” a person's free exercise of religion, the government must establish that it has a “compelling interest” for the action and that it is using the “least-restrictive means” of furthering that interest.
“In particular, the Court does not decide whether petitioners' religious exercise has been substantially burdened, whether the Government has a compelling interest, or whether the current regulations are the least restrictive means of serving that interest,” the court stated, leaving that decision for the lower courts.
Because the Supreme Court's decision voided lower rulings on the mandate, it could ultimately affect the cases of numerous other plaintiffs challenging the regulation.
Michael Warsaw, chairman and CEO of EWTN Global Catholic Network, responded to the ruling with optimism. EWTN is among the plaintiffs who have lawsuits in the federal court system. CNA is a part of the EWTN family.
“Today's U.S. Supreme Court ruling reversing the decisions of four federal appellate courts on the HHS Mandate is a clear victory for EWTN and all of the plaintiffs who have spent the last several years fighting against the government's attempt to hijack our employer-sponsored health care plans in order to force us to provide contraception, abortion-inducing drugs and sterilization procedures,” Warsaw said.
“With regard to EWTN's own case, today's ruling by the Supreme Court strikes down several of the key decisions upon which the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals based its previous ruling against EWTN,” he continued. “While we await further action by the 11th Circuit in the EWTN case, we are even more confident that we will prevail.”

Detroit's alleyway bar, The Skip, has undergone a Christmas transformation. From now until Dec. 24, it'll be known as Miracle, and it's offering all things Yule.The pop-up concept is one that was born in New York City in 2014, but it has since expanded to 50 cities across the U.S. This is the first year Detroiters will be able to enjoy it. Freep reports that cocktails are all $12 and have titles like Bad Santa (a hot drink made with mulled red wine, tawny port, and orange liqueur and served in a Santa mug), Snowball Old Fashioned (gingerbread bourbon with a ball of ice), and You'll Shoot Your Eye Out (pumpkin-spiced rye whiskey, Budweiser-marshmallow syrup, and egg).The bar's also decked out in multi-colored Christmas lights, and evergreen branches. It looks pretty cozy.The bar will be open from 4 p.m. to midnight everyday until Christmas Eve. Miracle at the Skip is located at 1234 Library St., Detroit.
Being caught talking to yourself can be one of the most mortifying experiences. Whether you're encouraging yourself to get a task done or chastising yourself for making a mistake, it's a nightmare to be called out on it, especially considering the stigma that people who talk to themselves are "crazy." But if anyone's ever laughed at you for talking to yourself, the joke's on them.
According to a new study, talking to yourself is not only totally normal, it might actually be healthy. Researchers at Bangor University asked participants to read written instructions either silently or out loud. They then measured each participant's concentration and performance of each task. As it turned out, they improved greatly when those instructions were read aloud.
MUST-SEE: What Is Self Care?
This isn't the first study to point to benefits of talking to yourself, either. Back in 2001, researchers found that humans' brains act more like monkeys' brains when we stop talking to ourselves—whether it's silently or out loud.
Apart from talking to yourself being a sign of high cognitive functioning, more researchers are beginning to say that "self-talk" can also help with recalling memories as well as improving your confidence level and sharpening your focus.
"It's not an irrational thing to do," said Gary Lupyan, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin. "You don't know everything you're going to say—you can even surprise yourself."
MUST-SEE: Everything You Need to Know About Meditation and Weight Loss
Lupyan, who has studied how hearing ourselves speak can impact our memories, added that saying a name—any name—out loud can be incredibly powerful in recalling memories.
He said, "Think of it as a pointer to a chunk of information in your mind. Hearing the name exaggerates what might normally happen if you just bring something to mind. Language boosts that process."
And this news gives us a big boost for the next time someone gives us a hard time for talking to ourselves! As it turns out, we were doing it right all along.

The federal and B.C. governments are helping fund a $126 million Simon Fraser University expansion in Surrey that aims to put the institution's scientists — and the city itself — on the global map.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Premier Christy Clark announced each level of government will contribute $45 million to start construction of the first phase of what will be a five-storey, 15,000-square-metre facility.
The proposed Energy Systems and Environmental Engineering Program, the first of its kind in Western Canada, will focus on degree programs and research into clean technology and sustainable energy.
Among the research areas will be energy issues related to the use of hydrogen, electricity and liquefied natural gas.
The building at University Drive and 102 street, located across from the existing Surrey campus, will be one of the last buildings designed by the renowned late B.C. architect Bing Thom.
“I truly believe — more, I know — that Canada has the opportunity to be a world leader when it comes to research and innovation,” Trudeau told a gathering of local politicians and university administrators as hundreds of students looked on in the Surrey campus's vast atrium.
“This investment, this institution, and many others, are what's going to help us get there.”
Clark, who followed Trudeau on the podium, was also effusive in her portrayal of the multilateral investment in Surrey's post-secondary education infrastructure.
“Every great city is anchored by a great university,” she said. “SFU is a great university. Surrey is a great world city.”
The announcement was made in the atrium of the existing Thom-designed Surrey campus as hundreds of students in upper levels surrounding the stage watched eagerly, snapped photos with their smartphones and, in many cases, tried to position themselves for selfies with the prime minister after the speeches.
“I love you Justin!” shouted one young female student, while another male who tried to take a photograph of a departing PM said his hands were shaking too much to take a proper photo.
Even a local female RCMP officer approached Trudeau with her smartphone to pose for a selfie as he left the campus.
The building will also accommodate SFU's Mechatronics Systems Engineering program, which “combines the fields of mechanical, electrical and software engineering with entrepreneurship and business,” according to a news release.
“The new space will be dedicated to students commercializing their research through the Technology Entrepreneurship program.”
In addition to the $45 million from each level of government, SFU and private donors are putting up $26 million to fund a second phase of the project. The university is also providing land valued at $10 million.
The announcement lines up with the federal government's innovation agenda, but also plays into the federal party's political strategy that aims to secure its major gains throughout Metro Vancouver, including Surrey.
SFU President Andrew Petter described Surrey, which produces 20 per cent of all Grade 12 graduates from entering the university, as his institution's “top priority” for expansion.
The first two levels of the building are to be completed in 2018, and will house engineering labs, classrooms, “innovation workplaces,” administrative offices, study spaces and a 400-seat lecture hall.
That will accommodate new degree programs in energy systems and environmental engineering, on top of the mechatronics studies, for 320 undergraduate students and 120 graduate students.
The remainder of the project will be completed in the subsequent one to two years, according to SFU spokeswoman Marianne Meadahl.

Frances Levine, president of the Missouri History Museum, pictured at the Missouri Historical Society's library and research center, housed in the former United Hebrew building in St. Louis. (Photo: Lisa Mandel for the St. Louis Jewish Light)
We recently had an opportunity to see how Jewish establishment groups in St. Louis exercise power in an attempt to control public discussions on Palestine/Israel. It was quite informative and is worth looking at in detail.
In March, the Missouri History Museum canceled a planned presentation with fewer than two days' notice. The presentation, entitled “From Ferguson to Ayotzinapa to Palestine: Solidarity and Collaborative Action,” was organized by the Washington University student group AltaVoz. Although the program had been scheduled for over six weeks, and advertised for nearly two weeks on the official museum website, Museum Director Frances Levine personally made the decision to stop the event as planned. Articles in the St. Louis Jewish Light and email records given to St. Louis Jewish Voice for Peace in response to a Sunshine (FOIA) request to the public institution help illuminate the details of what happened.
Jewish Community Relations Council (JCRC) Executive Director Batya Abramson-Goldstein wrote to Levine shortly before she canceled the event, expressing concern about the inclusion of Palestinian voices on the panel. Abramson-Goldstein claimed to be worried about how to answer to people who were writing to her and what to tell both the Jewish Federation and the Board of the JCRC, which was meeting that day. During the course of the day, both Levine and History Museum Managing Director of Community Education and Events Melanie Adams communicated multiple times about the situation with Abramson-Goldstein as well as Anti-Defamation League (ADL) Regional Director Karen Aroesty.
The Museum put out a statement claiming that “the issue was never with talking about Palestine. The issue was with adding a third topic to the discussion.” This statement was a lie. The museum did not tell the students that one of the three issues must be removed. Talking about Palestine was the problem, as revealed by this email from Adams to Abramson-Goldstein:
“am still waiting to hear back from the student. At this point I have given them two options. Remove the Palestine group from the program or find another location. Based on their initial response I think they are going to find another location. I will let you know when I hear from him.”
Levine states in the Jewish Light interview that the JCRC Director never directly asked her to do anything, but that she decided on her own to take action once Abramson-Goldstein brought the issue to her attention. This statement ignores the power dynamics at play given the extensive links between the History Museum, the Jewish Federation and Frances Levine.
At least five members of the Missouri History Museum's Board of Trustees either have served on the Board of Directors or have been major donors of the Jewish Federation, which funds JCRC. The Jewish Federation and the JCRC have close ties with the State of Israel and they openly see one of their core missions as defending Israel from criticism.
The Jewish Federation also funds the Jewish Light, which has published no fewer than four glowing pieces by or about Levine — who is herself Jewish — in the one year that she has lived in St. Louis. The most recent piece gave her space to present her views on the recent controversy with the panel, where she explained her decision this way:
“By the time I saw it on March 17, my concerns were: Have we lost that first message? Have we lost that message of community policing in Ferguson? And the student protests over Ayotzinapa. Those are two terrible tragedies. And, could we bring it back to that?”
Levine is able to recognize the predatory and racially biased criminal justice system of Ferguson as a tragedy. She is able to see the massacre of students in Mexico as a tragedy. But somehow when Palestinians deal for sixty-seven years with the theft of their land and water, house demolitions, military detention of children with no due process, extrajudicial assassinations, military checkpoints, the uprooting of their crops, the degradation of their culture, and the turning of their cities into walled ghettos, this does not also count as a tragedy.
She then says, “I could understand the timeliness of Ayotzinapa, but I felt like the Palestinian voices needed their own [forum, with a] plurality of voices.”
On the exact same day that Levine demanded the removal of Palestinian voices from the panel, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu was reelected after a high-profile campaign in which he promised never to accept a Palestinian state while appealing to the racism of Jewish Israelis by explicitly portraying the phenomenon of Palestinians inside Israel using their right to vote as an existential threat. This is the context in which Levine claimed that the issue wasn't timely enough.
And what does Levine mean when she says that a forum on Palestine needs a “plurality of voices”? We get a good sense of this by looking at the emails obtained from the Sunshine request and by comparing and contrasting the museum's handling of the solidarity panel with their protocol for other programs.
Very shortly after canceling the students' program, Adams writes to Aroesty of the ADL (which in 2011 paid for then St. Louis County Police Chief Tim Fitch to go to Israel to learn about “counter-terrorism” from Israeli police and military):
“In light of the current situation, we would like to plan a program that looks at the history of Palestine and Israel. We would like to work with the ADL and the JCRC to put something together in connection with State of Deception (a program related to the Holocaust and Nazism). Is this something you are open to doing? If so I will try to set up a meeting next week.”
Levine then decides that she and Adams need to have lunch or coffee with the JCRC and the ADL, from whom she seeks guidance on which Palestinians will be part of their new program. Adams writes to Levine:
“This is a discussion with Batya (from the JCRC) and Karen (from the ADL) to help shape the program. Karen said she has some suggestions from the Palestinian side. I am happy to get the suggestions and invite them as well. I do see this probably taking more than one meeting.”
To sum up: the History Museum decided that it is unacceptable for Palestinians to choose the context in which they speak about their struggle for justice. Instead, the leaders of two groups with close ties to the State of Israel are to meet with the leadership of the History Museum to plan the details of a new panel where a Palestinian may speak. Any Palestinian who is to speak will first needed to be vetted by the leadership of these pro-Israel organizations.
Let's do a thought experiment. Let's pretend the museum had a Palestinian president and multiple Palestinian donors and board members who defended violence against Jewish Israelis. Let's pretend the president of this publicly funded museum refused to allow a Jewish Israeli to speak about her experience on a planned panel because it was not tragic or timely enough. How do you think the Jewish Federation, the Jewish Community Relations Council and the Anti-Defamation League would react? Would they be asking for a new director?
This scenario could never happen. There are no Palestinian groups with this kind of access to power within public institutions, let alone Palestinian groups with explicit ties to illegal activities in the way that the Jewish Federation, JCRC, and ADL are openly tied to Israel's illegal policies of colonization and ethnic cleansing (in the words of Israeli historians).
This impossible scenario is the exact mirror image of what actually happened, and what happens all the time to Palestinians around the world, including in St. Louis. Many of us at Jewish Voice for Peace were surprised by the museum's actions, but local Palestinians were not surprised at all. For the Jewish Federation, JCRC, ADL, and institutions and individuals aligned with them — public and private, progressive and conservative — silencing Palestinian voices is business as usual. And when Palestinian voices cannot be silenced, they are paired with Israelis to give the illusion of balance, reinforcing the idea that Palestinian narratives cannot be trusted, that they are incomplete and unworthy without an Israeli to balance them out, to legitimize them.
When the History Museum brought Michelle Alexander to speak about The New Jim Crow, did they invite Rush Limbaugh to ensure a “plurality of voices”? When the museum does forums on women's rights and feminism, do they make sure no woman speaks without a man next to her to keep things proper? When the museum planned the upcoming State of Deception Holocaust program, did they look for an SS perspective to balance it out? When Levine's staff approved the panel with speakers from Ayotzinapa, did they insist on getting representatives of the Mexican government and drug lords?
It is only with Palestinians that such “plurality of voices” is required. We must recognize that this insistence on coupling Palestinian narratives with Jewish ones — no matter what the Jewish perspective –is rooted in racism. We must recognize that denying Palestinians agency over telling their own stories — rather than have them told by a person chosen by their oppressor — is a form of violence. We must recognize the behavior of the JCRC — expressing displeasure in a top-down manner about a student program and seeking reassurance from the director that it was being taken care of — as firmly rooted in white privilege. It is this same racism, violence, and white privilege that we all need to resist – from Ferguson to Ayotzinapa to Palestine.

The webpack-dev-server from Kees Kluskens is added to the devDependencies in the npm package.json file. The webpack-dev-server package implements and supports the HMR feature.
"devDependencies": { ... "webpack": "^3.2.0", "webpack-dev-server": "^2.5.1", },
In the scripts section of the package.json, the start command is configured to start the dotnet server and also the webpack-dev-server with the –hot and the –inline parameters.
See the webpack-dev-server documentation for more information about the possible parameters.
The dotnet server is only required because this demo application uses a Web API service implemented in ASP.NET Core.
"start": "concurrently \"webpack-dev-server --hot --inline --port 8080\" \"dotnet run\" "
webpack dev configuration
The devServer is added to the module.exports in the webpack.dev.js. This configures the webpack-dev-server as required. The webpack-dev-server configuration can be set here as well as the command line options, so you as a developer can decide which is better for you.
devServer: { historyApiFallback: true, contentBase: path.join(__dirname, '/wwwroot/'), watchOptions: { aggregateTimeout: 300, poll: 1000 } },
The output in the module.exports also needs to be configured correctly for the webpack-dev-server to work correctly. If the ‘./' path is used in the path option of the output section, the webpack-dev-server will not start.
output: { path: __dirname + '/wwwroot/', filename: 'dist/[name].bundle.js', chunkFilename: 'dist/[id].chunk.js', publicPath: '/' },
The module should be declared and the module.hot needs to be added the the main.ts.
// Entry point for JiT compilation. declare var System: any; import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic'; import { AppModule } from './app/app.module'; // Enables Hot Module Replacement. declare var module: any; if (module.hot) { module.hot.accept(); } platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule);
Running the application
Build the application using the webpack dev build. This can be done in the command line. Before building, you need to install all the npm packages using npm install.
$ npm run build-dev
The npm script build-dev is defined in the package.json file and uses the webpack-dev script which does a development build.
"build-dev": "npm run webpack-dev", "webpack-dev": "set NODE_ENV=development && webpack",
Now the server can be started using the start script.
$ npm start
The application is now running on localhost with port 8080 as defined.
http://localhost:8080/home
If for example, the color is changed in the app.scss, the bundles will be reloaded in the browser without refreshing.

SUNDAYS mean soccer for these pint-size players who are part of a growing number of peninsula girls who have taken up the game.
For the first time this season, Manly Warringah Football Association has introduced girls-only divisions for under-8s, under-9s and 15s, to meet demand.
MWFA girls' and women's vice-president Louise Walker said younger girls can still opt to play in mixed teams, but the new all-girls teams were proving very popular.
“They're on a more even playing field, figuratively speaking” she said.
“They are playing among their peers, they're playing a game that is perhaps slightly different in style to that of the boys and they are able to be coached as such.”
And the numbers of girls lacing up their soccer boots each weekend on the peninsula is growing.

In 2015 there were 873 girls aged six to nine registered with the MWFA. This year there are 1079.
Overall, the total number of female players registered with the association has grown by 745 players to 4632 over the last three years.
“I think it's partly the Matildas' success and the W-League is becoming more popular,” Ms Walker said.

“And there is a real push across a number of areas to recognise that women are able to play sport at a high level and sports traditionally male-dominated are also quite attractive to women.
“It's a great opportunity to be active outdoors and part of a team.”
Maya Langley is in her second season with Seaforth FC's under-8 side, Lollipops.
Mum, Phillipa Gow, who is also the team manager said it is her daughter's first team sport.
“Being in the girls competition has been really good for her confidence,” she said.

“When she played with the mixed team, it was more of an uneven competition.”
Maya said her favourite things were “defending and scoring goals.”
“I think I've scored three,” she said proudly.
A New York Times writer who was called out this week by supermodel Emily Ratajkowski for reportedly calling first lady Melania Trump a “hooker” has come forward to apologize.
Jacob Bernstein, a feature writer at The New York Times, took to Twitter Tuesday to “take ownership” for a remark he made over the weekend at a New York Fashion Week event.
“I want to take ownership of a mistake I made,” Mr. Bernstein, son of Watergate journalist Carl Bernstein, wrote in a four-part tweet. “Speaking at a party in what I thought was a personal conversation, I nevertheless made a stupid remark about the first lady.
“My editors have made it clear my behavior was not in keeping with the standards of the Times, and I agree,” he wrote. “My mistake, referring to unfounded rumors, shouldn't reflect on anyone else and I apologize profusely.”
Mr. Bernstein's offending comment was first reported by Ms. Ratajkowski, who didn't give his name in a series of tweets defending the first lady.
“Sat next to a journalist from the NYT last night who told me ‘Melania is a hooker,' ” the model claimed. “Whatever your politics it's crucial to call this out for what it is: slut-shaming. I don't care about her nudes or sexual history and no one should.”
Mrs. Trump, a former model, took to Twitter Tuesday evening to thank Ms. Ratajkowski and others for their support.
“Applause to all women around the world who speak up, stand up and support other women! @emrata #PowerOfEveryWoman #PowerOfTheFirstLady,” the first lady wrote.
The New York Times said in a statement Tuesday that the reporter was reprimanded for the remark.
“At a party last night, a Times reporter who does not cover Washington or politics, referred to an unfounded rumor regarding Melania Trump,” a Times spokesperson said. “The comment was not intended to be public, but it was nonetheless completely inappropriate and should not have occurred. Editors have talked to the reporter in question about the lapse.”
Mrs. Trump is currently suing British tabloid The Daily Mail for publishing a story that included the unfounded claim that she had once been an escort.

My Santa is a super mystery... I saw that they had pulled my info, but didn't hear anything else from them. No probing anonymous messages, no obvious stalking, etc. This is my first year doing Reddit's Secret Santa and I had no idea what to expect. That's fine though, because nothing could have prepared me for the awesome gift my Santa gave me!
I came home from work today and found a package containing a heavy gift wrapped item. There was a card attached that said "Your first gift! More to come I hope you like it!" - this was signed "Your Reddit Secret Santa."
So I'm so giddy with excitement I can't even bring myself to open the present at first - it was so exciting that I almost wanted to keep it a mystery forever. Almost! After about a half an hour of just admiring the present with childlike glee I could no longer stand it and I opened it up to find... OMG! The Uncanny X-Men Omnibus Volume 2! It's an amazing collection of some of Chris Claremont and John Byrne's best work on The Uncanny X-Men including The Dark Phoenix Saga and Days of Future Past. I can't wait to read all of these classic stories again! I can only hope that the person I bought for loves their gifts as much as I love this one!
I am blown away at the amazing gift my Santa gave me and I hope they can see this and know what an awesome gift they've given me and how much giddy joy I felt as I opened that wrapping paper and found this amazing book. I have read a lot of "Thank you kind stranger" posts in the Secret Santa threads, but (hopefully without being too cheesy) I have to disagree as far as my gift goes. Yes, thank you to my Secret Santa but this is no stranger to me - it's just an awesome friend that I haven't had the pleasure of meeting yet!
Update - A second package arrived in the mail this morning! This time it seems like my amazing Secret Santa was hinting that I should enjoy a movie and game night! Inside was a book that I've been wanting for ages "The Ultimate History of Video Games". I'd read it at the library some time ago and always wanted to own a copy. My Santa also sent me the awesome "King of Kong" documentary! It's a great flick about competitive arcade gaming, and I've always loved it, so I'm super happy to own it! I'll be watching it tonight while munching on the awesome chocolates my Secret Santa sent me. They also sent a carton of Flavacol! What the heck is that? Well last year my wife gave me a pretty awesome popcorn machine for a theater room that I've been slowly building. I'm a total nerd for authenticity, so in my research I found that this is the stuff real theaters use on their popcorn. Now I'm excited to pop up a batch of popcorn for a movie night and see if it's really just like theater popcorn. Last, but certainly not least they sent me an awesome looking card game called "Tichu". I love games of all types and I'm really eager to gather a couple of friends together and give this game a whirl.
Thank you again Secret Santa - you are AWESOME!
Fireworks: McCain vs. Carney on Iraq: "It's Not A Matter Of Disagreement; It's A Matter Of Facts"
Senator John McCain (R-AZ) and newly minted CNN contributor and former Obama press secretary Jay Carney spar over the Iraq war and if the current situation in Iraq and Syria could have been avoided.
SEN. JOHN McCAIN: I think it was a very weak argument. And by the way, I'm astounded that Mr. Carney should say that the Free Syrian Army is now stronger. In fact, they have been --
JAY CARNEY: Well, that's not that I said, Senator. If I could, sir, what I said is, if we know a great deal more now about the makeup of the opposition. --
McCAIN: Come on, Jay, we knew all about them then. You just didn't choose to know. I was there in Syria. We we knew about them. Come on, you guys were the ones -- your boss was the one when the entire national security team wanted to arm and train them that he turned them down, Mr. Carney after --
CARNEY: Well, Senator --
McCAIN: The fact is --
CARNEY: I think we have to agree to disagree on this.
McCAIN: No, facts are stubborn things, Mr. Carney, and that is his entire national security team, including the Secretary of State said we want to arm and train and equip these people and he made the unilateral decision to turn them down. The fact he didn't have a residual force in Iraq, overruled all of his military advisers, is the reason why we're facing ISIS today.
So the facts are stubborn things in history and people ought to know them. And now the president is saying basically that we are going to take certain actions, which I would favor, but to say that America is safer, and that the situation is very much like Yemen and Somalia shows me that the president really doesn't have a grasp for how serious the threat of ISIS is.
CARNEY: Well, again, Senator, we're going to have to agree to disagree. And I think on the question of the residual force, there was another player in that which was the Iraqi government. A, and B, it was the fulfillment of the previous administration's withdrawal plan. And it was also the fulfillment of the president's promise to withdraw from Iraq and not maintain a true presence, in perpetuity, which is pretty consistent with what the American people wanted and believed it was the right approach.
McCAIN: Mr. Carney, you are again saying facts that are patently false. The fact is because [Senator] Lindsey Graham, [former Senator] Joe Lieberman and me, we were in Baghdad, they wanted a residual force. The president has never made a statement during that or after that he wanted a residual force left behind. The Iraqis were ready to go. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that the number cascaded down to 3,500. That was not sufficient to do anything but to defend themselves. And you in your role as a spokesperson bragged about the fact that the last American combat troop had left Iraq. If we had left a residual force the situation would not be what it is today. And there would be a lot more --
CARNEY: Senator, I can posit for great respect for you we can disagree on that.
McCAIN: You can't.
CARNEY: Sir --
McCAIN: You don't have the facts, Mr. Carney, that's the problem.
CARNEY: Senator, I understand that that you present the facts that you believe are true based on the arguments that you have made for a long time, sir, that we should leave troops in Iraq for perpetuity. And that is not what this president believes. Obviously, he was elected president to fulfill what he believes is right for our country and right for our national security.
McCAIN: It is a bad decision.
CARNEY: I certainly understand where we are today.
McCAIN: It is not a matter of disagreement; it is a matter of facts, and you have yours wrong and you have distorted it.
COOPER: Jay, do you believe, does the president believe at all, if a residual force had been left on the ground in Iraq, that we would not be in this situation now?
CARNEY: Anderson, I think it is a mis -- basically a whitewash of history to suggest that there was not -- were not periods of enormous chaos and fighting and bloodshed in Iraq when there were tens of thousands of troops, of American troops on the ground. That is a fact. And it was true in 2004, it was true in 2007. And it was true even when we had the highest number of U.S. troops on the ground.
We cannot -- the United States of America ask our military to be a permanent occupying force in a country like Iraq. We have to get to a situation where we can help build up and assist an Iraqi security force, where we can put pressure on Iraqi political leaders to form an inclusive government, which they have taken steps to do, as was noted earlier. And then we can provide the kind of military support that we're providing, an action that we're taking against a threat like ISIS as appropriate.
But the alternative of leaving a permanent, massive U.S. force on the ground in Iraq, not for 10 years, not for 20 years, but in perpetuity, is simply not sustainable financially; it is not consistent with what the American people think we should do.
MCCAIN: Again, Mr. Carney misstates the facts. We had it won, thanks to the surge. It was won. The victory was there. All we needed was a force behind to provide support, not to engage in combat, but to supply support, logistics, intelligence. And by the way, the Koran War, we left troops behind. Bosnia, we left troops behind. Not to fight but be a stabilizing force. And Mr. Carney neglects the fact that thanks to David Petraeus, and Ryan Crocker, who by the way, are very strong on this issue, that we won the conflict, and then by pulling the rug out and setting a date for withdrawal and bragging about it --
CARNEY: Excuse me, sir, but I think you have forgotten that the date for withdrawal was --
MCCAIN: I think you have forgotten -- no, the date for withdrawal. They always contemplated an additional date behind it. And you can ask Condoleezza Rice, or George W. Bush.
CARNEY: Absolutely, and so did we, and we--
MCCAIN: So that is absolutely false too. And we didn't need to go through the Iraqi parliament. All you had to do was have an agreement. And we were there on the ground.
COOPER: Senator McCain, let me ask you about in terms of what you heard tonight, do you believe the U.S. can fight an effective counter- terrorism strategy, which is what the president is calling this fight against ISIS, without U.S. military personnel on the ground? In harm's way?
MCCAIN: We -- this is another falsehood the president is purveying. We already have boots on the ground, well over 1,000. We need more. But we don't need them like the 82nd Airborne sent in direct -- to do -- into direct combat.
We need to have additional support there, and we need to help the -- the Iraqi army rebuild its capabilities. But we don't have to have a ground combat invasion of the type we had before. But, the fact that they didn't leave -- we were not there before is a direct result we are paying a very heavy price for. And it doesn't mean in perpetuity, but it does mean to keep the situation stable, which we could have done.
COOPER: Senator McCain, the president also said that we have not yet detected specific plotting against our homeland. Americans who hear those words might wonder, if that is really the case, then why do we need to take action against ISIS? To that you say what?
MCCAIN: I say that today, we had a hearing, and there was testimony from the counterterrorism people and the Department of Homeland Security. There is Twitter traffic right now and FaceBook traffic, where they are urging attacks on the United States of America. And there is a great concern that our southern border and our northern border is porous and that they will be coming across.
So is there a specific, direct threat? No, but is there any doubt to what their goal is? Mr. Baghdadi, the day he left our prison in Iraq, Camp Bucca, said "see you in New York."
COOPER: And in terms of, as you said, you have been in Syria, you met with Syrian moderate opposition a while back, do you believe there are enough on the ground right now in Iraq who actually have military capabilities that can actually stand up and fight against ISIS, against the Assad regime?
MCCAIN: I do, but it is going to be very tough, and it is going to be a heck of a lot tougher, despite what Mr. Carney said, than it would have been two years ago when it was recommended by his entire national security team.
'Something smells here,' finds 538.com, suggesting possibility of 'very devious manipulation' of voting machines or tabulators...
Brad Friedman Byon 6/11/2010, 8:55pm PT
This post is an update to our earlier one today, which highlighted early, unexplained disparities seen by academic experts working on behalf of South Carolina Democrats, between paper-ballot absentee voting results and those from the 100% unverifiable ES&S iVotronic touch-screen systems used on Election Day last Tuesday in South Carolina for the Democratic U.S. Senate primary race between the unheard of, jobless candidate Alvin Greene (who did absolutely no campaigning), and state legislator Vic Rawl (who did).
As we detailed in the previous post, Greene's "victory," thus far, seems to make absolutely no legitimate sense to state Democrats, or anybody else, in truth. The disparities in the voting patterns were described by experts quoted in Politico earlier today as "curious," "staggering," and "red flags," and by Election Integrity experts who we quoted as "clear signs of election fraud." Please read that post first for the full background on this story.
We've already included one update to our previous post, based on a post by Tom Schaller at FiveThirtyEight.com, a site which focuses on statistical analysis of elections. That post examined the possibility of the race factor in Greene's "win" over Rawl as the former is African American while the latter is white. Schaller's analysis of precinct data in the race, however, as compared to non-white registrants in each, found "no relationship between the race of a county's registrants and Greene's performance in that county," thus largely, but not entirely, ruling out race as an explanation for the bizarre results.
While Schaller had posited four existing possibilities for what "could have happened here" in his original article --- including the possibility of "systematic" election fraud --- he has now filed a follow-up report describing the matter as "getting weirder by the hour." His new piece includes a number of reports from other statistical experts which "suggest tampering, or at least machine malfunction, perhaps at the highest level"...
Schaller's follow-up piece quotes from a number of analyses by statistician and election expert colleagues of his which narrow down the possibilities of what "could have happened here," to just "two scenarios."
The analyses by Schaller's colleagues find, among other things, statistical tests in which "Rawl's Election Day vote totals depart from the expected distribution at 90% confidence. In other words, the observed vote pattern for Rawl could be expected to occur only about 10% of the time by chance."
The results of those tests lead Schaller to believe "something smells here."
Another analysis debunks the theory that the results were due to GOP dirty-tricksters, crossing over in SC's open primary to vote for the candidate presumed to be the easiest one for Republican incumbent Sen. Jim DeMint to defeat in November.
"In conclusion," writes the author of the analysis examining that theory, "while the voting patterns in the D-Senate primary are strange and may not be totally legitimate, they don't bear the expected hallmarks that would arise in the case of a Republican plant."
Schaller then summarizes what he sees as the dwindling possibilities for what may have happened as such:
[W]e can almost certainly eliminate the idea that there was a coordinated GOP effort to get Republican and/or conservative voters to pick up Democratic ballots with the intent of selecting Greene as DeMint's general election opponent. That leaves what I think are now two scenarios: A. The first is a combination of the first and second possibilities of my initial post: Greene was a nobody, but Rawl was darn near close to a nobody, and thus Greene's alphabetical ballot position, coupled with whatever signal the spelling of his surname sent to some African Americans that he might be (and in fact is) an African American, with a dash of Rawl's high disapproval among the 18 percent of survey respondents who had heard of him, combined to take what in theory might otherwise have been a 50/50 split among two broadly unknown candidates and turned it instead into a 59/41 race. B. Somebody with access to software and machines engineered a very devious manipulation of the vote returns--but not so devious that he/she/they were unable to cover the tracks of the digit patterns in those results.
While we're certainly not a statistical analyst, and nowhere near as smart as Schaller, the first of his two scenarios above does not seem to take into account the disparities noted previously between the paper-based absentee votes and those cast on the unverifiable touch-screen systems on Election Day.
While Scenario A would seem to make potential sense, it seems that the same voting patterns would apply to both Election Day votes cast at the polls and absentee votes cast in the same race. But that wasn't the case, as we detailed in our previous article, which quotes academic experts who found, among other similar anomalies, "a staggering 84 percent to 16 percent margin" in favor of Rawl in Lancaster County, where "Greene easily led among Election Day voters by 17 percentage points."
Overall, a study by an academic expert has found, according to the Rawl campaign, that "the result in the Senate election is statistically highly significant: Rawl performs 11 percentage points better among absentee voters than he does among Election Day voters."
If Scenario A doesn't similarly apply to both the absentee and Election Day vote counts, that would seem to point to his Scenario B, "a very devious manipulation of the vote returns," or what we'll call "Scenario B.1," the somewhat less nefarious possibility of out-and-out e-voting system malfunction.
Malfunction and/or programming error with ES&S systems is neither unheard of, nor particularly rare. We experienced our own similar machine failure while attempting to vote (unsucessfully) on an ES&S e-voting system this week in Los Angeles, on the same day as the South Carolina primary, and previously, two years before when the very same system mis-recorded four out of twelve of our votes.
South Carolina itself is no stranger to failure and known breakdowns of the e-voting system. In the 2008 Republican Party primary in Horry County, as we reported at the time, the ES&S machines failed to work at all for much of the day, leaving voters scrambling to find bits of paper, and even paper towels, on which to cast emergency paper ballots. For the Democratic primary the following week, the party advised voters to print out sample ballots from off of the Internet before coming to vote, just in case the same train wreck occurred.
And, of course, we could offer countless links to BRAD BLOG reports detailing ES&S touch-screen systems flipping the intended votes of voters right on the screen. While one would presume a massive case of on-screen vote flipping would be noticed and reported, the fact is, as we've tried to warn, a vote can appear to register accurately on the screen, but be recorded for anybody or nobody internally, in the only tally that actually counts. It remains, as we've often pointed out, impossible to know that any vote has ever been recorded accurately --- ever --- on one of these types of voting machines during an actual election.
Given the well-documented history of malfunction by ES&S iVotronics and its central tabulating system, along with similarly well-documented scientific reports of how easily those specifics systems can be manipulated --- most easily and directly by election insiders --- it's sounding more and more like there is a serious problem, of some type, in South Carolina's electronic voting system.
For the record, this is not the only questionable race in South Carolina's Democratic primary. We may have more soon on a different race with very odd results. And there are also strange numbers emerging in South Carolina's Republican primary as well, where Schaller's piece quotes a study finding "three counties with more votes cast in [the] Republican governor's race than reported turnout in the Republican primary," resulting in the nearly impossible case of zero overvotes or undervotes in that race, across all three counties.
This isn't Arkansas after all, where they also use the same unverifiable ES&S voting systems, which also reported impossible numbers in the May 18th general primary as we reported last week. Or is it?
Or Florida, where the still-unexplained failure by the ES&S iVotronic system resulted in some 18,000 votes disappearing all together in Sarasota in the FL-13 Special Election for the U.S. House in 2006, resulting in a 329 vote "victory" for the Republican candidate Vern Buchanan over Democrat Christine Jennings. Or is it?
"Something smells here," indeed.

Popular gay YouTube star "Davey Wavey" recently raged against ageism and looksism in the gay community. Here, a typical sampling of his videos -- usually shirtless, often with porn stars -- always youthful, always gym-built, always white. Can we talk, Davey?
Dear Mr. Wavey,
From one Davey (actually, I stopped calling myself that around age 12) to another, hello from the other side of 35. Can we have a long-distance talk about ageism and looksism among gay men?
Yesterday on Twitter, and then several times on Facebook, I saw headlines linking to a new video you made. Being a gay man who occasionally writes about LGBT interests, your moniker, face and Baywatch-ready pectoral projections are not new to me. I've seen countless Davey Wavey videos promoted by countless LGBT sites and blogs over the years, and I've watched a few of them, usually finding myself wondering why.
Towleroad's headline, "Davey Wavey wants you to show some f*cking respect to older gay men -- WATCH," was irresistible for this older gay man, being 37 years old and therefore essentially ghosted by the greater gay community of Washington, D.C. about seven years ago. I admit I was equally intrigued by the topic and the headlined weirdness of someone who calls himself "Davey Wavey" defending older people.
"That creepy old gay man that looks like Santa Claus and the people in his generation are literally -- literally! -- the only reason that you can walk down the street in your pink [bleep] tank top and not get your ass beat," you say. "It is because he fought, and marched, and sweat, and rallied, and stood up so that the world that you live in is better than the world that he grew up in."
Mr. Wavey, please accept my heartfelt appreciation for your words. They are, in my opinion, obvious observations that are too rarely discussed -- despite a relative abundance of LGBT media outlets.
Now can we discuss your actions, and how they undermine those words?
Over the years, I've become accustomed to seeing links to your videos, almost always with screen shots of your unclothed torso, and sometimes more. These are accompanied by such headlines as "How to Gay Cruise," "7 Things You Don't Know About Porn," "Are Virgins Hot?" and "I'm a Boy-Crazy, Teenage Girl..." In the last of these, you are bare chested as usual and you discuss meeting a "really beautiful, blond YouTuber who I've probably masturbated to for, like, the last two years of my life." In case we think you are kidding, you emphasize, "I have masturbated to him." You go on to relate yourself to a teenage girl.
I don't say this to be mean, but all of your videos are as narcissistic as anything offered to the world by any Kardashian, made of paradoxically thoughtless thoughts that orbit around a conventionally attractive face and body. I don't have much of an opinion on the Kardashians, but as everyone loves to talk about the family and do so with resentment, Kim and all the K girls are a useful reference: a lot of women feel that the Kardashian women are diminishing to them by being the very fulcrum of popular culture built upon a foundation of Kim Kardashian's sex tape and Kim Kardashian's stunning facial features and big butt.
The reasons I don't have any opinion of the Kardashians are that 1) they don't have any meaningful influence on my life and 2) as far as I know, they seem to acknowledge and remain within their self-made beauty boxes. If Kim Kardashian has ranted about respecting older women for their bodies and minds, I haven't heard about it; and if she has, she's set herself up for real criticism.
More of your videos: "Getting Naked with Davey Wavey!" "Hunky Guys Sex Quiz!" and "They Filmed a Porn in My House!"
Here I end up straddling a fine line between what is sure to get me lambasted as "prude" and "jealous" and observing some serious hypocrisy.
You claim you are "sex positive" -- and believe it or not, I think such an attitude is a great thing -- but the "sex" you display, consistently and from what I can tell 100 percent without exception -- is limited to a specific Adonis-type of young white male, and this is where, in my view, what you claim is a positive attitude toward sex is actually the very nucleus of the ageism and look-ism you rally -- with words, not actions -- against in your newest viral video.
Comments in response to your body-focused videos, expectedly, always lavish praise on your body. In reviewing your YouTube feed just now, I see that you have occasionally had guests on your show --p orn stars, underwear models, et al. Not one of them, not one, can possibly be over 30 years old. Almost all are unclothed, all are white, and all have similar typically gym-built bodies -- maybe three perfect body fat and breast muscle disproportionate enough to your otherwise slim body to qualify you as a Butterball turkey.
It's worth restating: Every single gay man you present in your videos appears to be under age 30, 35 tops. Every single one conforms to an idealized physical standard. Every single one of them is white. Your rant against young gay men who are cruel to older, less attractive gay men, therefore, can't be considered any more authentic than, say, Hugh Hefner ranting against objectifying women. It doesn't make any actual sense when you think about it.
The older-gay-man "eww" factor against which "Davey Wavey" speaks is caused by the images and ideals that "Davey Wavey" promotes.
You, Mr. Wavey, show no appreciation in your entire video archive for or even awareness of any sort of diversity at all -- same idealized bodies, same age groups, same ethnic groups. (Honestly, the "Getting Naked With Porn Stars!" video features porn stars who appear to be barely "barely legal.")
So, it's a little curious to see you, Mr. Wavey, celebrated for preaching appreciation of older gay men when, reviewing your videos, one would be led to think that you live in a world in which all gay men are youthful and issued from one of two molds labeled either "twink" or "jock." In my experience, these are the gay molds that come pre-programmed to say "eww" when a gay man (but curiously not straight men) over 30 dare to breathe the same air they do.
You see yourself as a "boy-crazy teenage girl," but you are actually a 31 year-old gay man. Trust me, by age 35, boy-crazy gay man-boys will make it known to you that "you can't sit with us."
Mr. Wavey -- may I call you Davey? -- I don't think that you can in good faith claim that you are known to the Gay Internet for any reason beyond your presentation of your own idealized body and those of your youthful, white, gym-built guests. Having spent about an hour reviewing your videos, it appears that nearly all exist solely to show your breasts in motion. There's nothing any more "wrong" about this than there is about Pam Anderson running in slo-mo on a Baywatch beach... except that Pam Anderson understands her self-defined role and her influence, and she probably understands that if she suddenly tried to present herself as a Gloria Steinem type, she'd be booed off the stage by people who actually get Gloria Steinem.
Davey, a question for you to think about: What is it about older gay men that young gay men resist? Just one thing: they don't look the way we are now programmed to think a "good gay" looks -- which is to say, like you and the guys you have on camera with you. You're welcome to retaliate and call me jealous, ugly... even old. Go for it. I can take it; trust me, after entering my third decade and living with a chronic illness that has made it impossible for me to maintain abs of steel and pecs of plastic, I'm quite accustomed by now to criticism from other gay men -- which, it has to be said, is meaner than the meanest scene from Mean Girls. I've been told by young gay men online that I should have killed myself after 30 -- young, white, worked out gay men who see me and say or think "eww, die."
We can take this particular message of yours to heart.
But if we do, I'd ask you to consider the fullness of what you present to the world. Is it possible (It is, but can you admit it?) that your videos to date have fueled the very diminishing and entirely superficial, appearances- and conformity-based attitude toward older gay men that you criticize? As you saunter in your skivvies, 22-year-old porn stars at your side, into your third decade of life, you're only going to notice more and more how your current body worshippers and your model friends judge older and less-perfect-looking men because at some point you will be one of those men. You're going to have to let some the anger go at some point because gay-on-older-gay verbal violence is a reality -- and it's a reality you've helped to create.
Not because I am sex-negative, but because I think it would be useful for you to start exploring aspects of life beyond the skin and muscle covering, might I suggest you put on a shirt and continue to observe what gay men really value, and whether your contributions to the LGBT community are really promoting healthy attitudes toward sex or a basis for condemning attitudes toward people who don't look like you and your on-camera friends.
Hello, Davey. Drawing from Adele:
Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing
You won't do much heal, Davey, if you try to sustain a livelihood based on being pretty and naked and cavorting with pretty, naked young men.
From one Davey to another, all the way from the other side of 35 (there's not such a distance between us; just a million miles of experience), now that you've begun to see the cruelty promulgated by young gay men against older gay men, think about what you're doing, not just saying, and maybe show us that what's inside is worth revealing as much as what's on the surface.
With love,
Obviously this could change. Nothing is solidified. But based on conversations with White House sources, top Hill aides from both parties, and immigration-restrictionist power-brokers, we have concluded that, at the moment, progressive Democrats hold a superior negotiating position to immigration hardliner Republicans.
This is because, on the DACA issue, President Trump has already blinked. Both publicly — in a Sep. 5 tweet, when he hinted he may reinstate DACA unilaterally if Congress can't save it — and privately, the president has indicated he doesn't have the stomach to let DACA die.
One conservative member of Congress, who has discussed DACA with the president, told me Trump made very clear to him he was prepared to keep the protections in place beyond March — when the program is currently set to expire — if Congress does nothing.
Roy Beck, an influential immigration hawk who runs NumbersUSA, said Trump's nominee for DHS Secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, further reduced the administration's leverage last week when she assured in her confirmation hearing she would protect DACA recipients. "This doesn't strike me as being from the art of negotiations book, does it?" Beck told me.
Stephen Miller, one of the White House's only immigration hardliners, is telling conservative activists that Trump will back legislation giving current DACA recipients legal status — aka amnesty — in exchange for legislation ending chain, or family, migration. And Miller doesn't want the must-pass December spending bill to include a DACA fix.
That appears to be a non-starter. Top Democratic Senate aides have told me they think it's hilarious that Miller thinks he can get this deal, and that chain migration isn't going anywhere.
Where that leaves us:
Congress must pass a spending bill by December 8. Bernie Sanders and other Democrats expected to run for president in 2020, including Kamala Harris, are effectively threatening to shut down the government over the issue — saying they won't vote for any spending bill unless it protects DACA recipients.
Democrats are confident Trump won't have the stomach to let DACA expire.
Democrats in leadership think this means that, despite Miller's opposition, they will be able to include a pathway to citizenship for DACA recipients in that must-pass spending bill.
In exchange, they say they may allow modest increases in border security measures. But nothing that could reasonably be described as a "big beautiful wall" along the southern border.
Just to reiterate: Everything is up in the air. But the above scenario seems the most likely outcome, since it would placate both progressives and moderate Republicans.
Bottom line: Despite the fact that Donald Trump became president running on a historically anti-immigration platform — promising to end DACA on Day One, build a wall, and slash legal immigration — it currently looks like Capitol Hill and the White House may find a solution that would make Jeb Bush proud.
My attention span was shot even before the internet conditioned me to forget what I'm doing every five seconds. My guess is that I'm not the only one. Thankfully, there are still people in this world that can concentrate long enough to do things like project the point spreads for all 798 games in college football next season. Whatever the quality of the predictions, that kind of effort is commendable in today's twitchy age.
Here's what Wisconsin's working with next season:
Northern Iowa at Wisconsin -37
Wisconsin -14 at Oregon State
Utah State at Wisconsin -27.5
UTEP at Wisconsin -32.5
Wisconsin at Nebraska -4
Illinois at Wisconsin -18
Wisconsin -6.5 at Purdue
Minnesota at Wisconsin -23
Michigan State at Wisconsin -7
Wisconsin -21 at Indiana
Ohio State at Wisconsin -4
Wisconsin -5 at Penn State
At Nebraska is the only game where Wisconsin isn't favored, which makes some sense considering how much better the Huskers played at Memorial Stadium last season.
Purdue sticking within a touchdown is a headscratcher, especially considering last year's result. I'm not sure Ohio State deserves a larger benefit of the doubt relative to Michigan State, either. Otherwise, I dig the positive vibes emanating our way in recent weeks.

Idling workers, distracted housewives and a decline in reading: Alan Connor looks at the great crossword panic of the 1920s
Some people associate crosswords with respectability: the suburbanite knocking off the Times on the 7.22 from Twyford, or the major's wife tidying away her coffee morning and settling in to the Telegraph.
It wasn't like that when they first appeared. Imagine a new video game called Benefit Cheat which comes in a box with a week's supply of meow meow, picture the likely response from the mid-market tabloids, and you'll have a sense of how crosswords were welcomed in Britain.
The British Library's new online newspaper archive lets solvers have a look at the 1920s, and feel that if they'd been around then, they'd have been considered a little bad-ass.
Part of the concern seemed to be the speed at which crosswords were catching on. How speedy are we talking? "The cross-word puzzle mania is becoming more hectic even than craze for 'put and take'," notes the Nottingham Evening Post in 1925. (Yes, you do. Sort of a die shaped like a little spinning top.) And for the effects of this hectic craze, we only need to look to America.
The papers had for a while been terrifying readers with tales of the mayhem wreaked by crosswords across the Atlantic. "CROSS-WORD PUZZLES. AN ENSLAVED AMERICA", howls the Tamworth Herald in 1924. The crossword, the piece explains, "has grown from the pastime of a few ingenious idlers into a national institution: a menace because it is making devastating inroads on the working hours of every rank of society."
Everywhere, at any hour of the day, people can be seen quite shamelessly poring over the checker-board diagrams, cudgelling their brains for a four-letter word meaning "molten rock" or a six-letter word meaning "idler," or what not: in trains and trams, or omnibuses, in subways, in private offices and counting-rooms, in factories and homes, and even - although as yet rarely - with hymnals for camouflage, in church.
These pernicious puzzles, the Herald goes on, "have dealt the final blow to the art of conversation, and have been known to break up homes." This family-wrecking comes about when husbands spend time solving a clue rather than earning a crust:
Twice within the past week or so there have been reports of police magistrates sternly rationing addicts to three puzzles a day, with an alternative of ten days in the workhouse.
A 1924 Reuters report contains a further warning from Canada - "Cross-word puzzles and the radio have been given as the reason for a marked decline during recent months in the demand for books at the Ottawa public library" - but this is nothing compared to what's to come to the UK. "The damage caused to dictionaries in the library at Wimbledon by people doing cross-word puzzle," we read in 1925, "has been so great that the committee has withdrawn all the volumes." In Willesden, it's the same sad story. Dulwich Library, meanwhile, starts blacking out crosswords' white squares "with a heavy pencil, to prevent any one person from keeping a newspaper for more than a reasonable length of time." Selfish paper-hogging solvers.
Meanwhile, booksellers bemoan falling sales of the novel - no longer itself considered a menace to society - in favour of "dictionaries, glossaries, dictionaries of synonyms, &c.". The Nottingham Evening Post goes on:
The picture theatres are also complaining that cross-words keep people at home. They get immersed in a problem and forget all about Gloria Swanson, Lilian Gish, and the other stars of the film constellation.
It gets worse. Also in Nottingham, the zookeeper is getting swamped in correspondence. The reason? Crosswords, of course.
Correspondents [are] unabashed over requests for aid in solving "cross-word" puzzles, and the Zoo at least will be relieved when a new hobby takes the place of the current one. What is a word three letters meaning a female swan? What is a female kangaroo, or a fragile creature in six letters ending in TO?
Across town at the theatre, the stage is bare:
Mr. Matheson Lang... missed his entrance in the Inquisition scene through becoming absorbed in a puzzle. This caused him much chagrin, for he is extremely conscientious as regards his stage work. All the "Wandering Jew" company at the New Theatre are, like their chief, interested in cross-word puzzles.
Who is safe from this funk? Surely the world of grocery is unblighted? Sadly not:
A girl asked a busy grocer to name the different brands of flour he kept. When he had done so, expecting a sale, she said she didn't want to buy any. She just thought one of the names might fit into a cross-word puzzle she was doing. The cross-word craze has been described as a disease. For which the scientific name might be "cluemonia."
If you find "cluemonia" comical, wait until you read the whimsical the Village Philosophy column in the Western Times, a kind of 1920s Karl Pilkington:
This week us 'ad a bit of talk about those yer crossword puzzles as they calls 'm. I duunaw that I knaws rightly what they are, 'cause seems to me they'm mostly for the bettermost people what got time to spare... I got a [daughter] only her don't ask me any questions. Her's fiddling about most all the week about what don't seem to be no use to nobody. Her send in to the competitions [but] her never won nothing yet, and I don't s'pose hers ever likely to."
And this aspect of "cross-words" - the competition - adds to the alarm. A 1925 Western Times think piece begins:
One of the most marked characteristics of this present century is the competition fever, which holds a big proportion of the population under its allurement. The root of the whole problem can be found in mankind's instinctive desire "to get something for nothing." It is not surprising, therefore, to find that many ingenious devices have been used to attract the attention of the public in this respect, and the latest method is known as the cross-word puzzle.
The time and energy spent on crosswords, the Times explains, would be more profitable "devoted to reading an instructive book, or intellectual conversation" - or, again, working. By the 1930s, the prizes offered for puzzles find crosswords in the courts with judges having to decide whether skill is involved or whether, as a lawyer for the police argues at Bow Street in 1935, "the words are ridiculously easy, and a child of 12 should have no difficulty in solving them". This would apparently mean that crosswords contravene the Betting and Lotteries Bill: literally, as well as morally criminal.
Judges, to the chagrin of police and moralisers, tend to find in favour of crosswords, putting them on a path to respectability also marked by an important announcement:
Eating our own words is a familiar phrase. Eating cross-words is a new pastime, but a pleasant one since Messrs. Huntley and Palmers, Ltd. have put on the market their "Cross-word" Cream Biscuit, so named because of its design. Simultaneously with arrival of the new biscuit Messrs. Huntley and Palmers have inaugurated a cross-word competition in which prizes are offered to the extent of £1,000.
Of course, the newspapers themselves had by now got in on the act, publishing crosswords and by some accounts relying on the puzzles for newsstand sales. Hypocrisy, following scaremongering and berating the British public for not toiling every hour God sends. Who'd have thought it from the press?
The best NBA photographs can turn a fraction of a second into an eternal memory. They manage to summarize players, personalities, careers and eras.
There is so much motion in the game and in the way our minds work that it might come as a surprise how many classic NBA moments lacked a great original photograph to go with it. Screen grabs don't count. There's no true still photo of Dr. J rocking the cradle and dunking on Michael Cooper or Willis Reed limping through the tunnel in Madison Square Garden.
And yet there's no shortage of timeless pictures, thanks to the photographers who had the right combination of composition, angle and timing as they hit the shutter button. Here are 12 of the most memorable:
12. Jerry West's pose
Want iconic? How about The Logo. This iconic pose -- taken in 1970 in a game against the Portland Trail Blazers -- mirrors the inspiration for the NBA insignia. We're so accustomed to the silhouette that it's fun to see the detail, such as the wrinkles in the uniform or the stripes on the shorts and socks. (Credit: Wen Roberts/NBAE/Getty Images)
11. Ray Allen and the yellow rope
Ray Allen's 3-pointer in the 2013 NBA Finals of those events that has grown in stature even in the relatively short time since it happened. It didn't deliver the championship (this was only Game 6 in a series that went seven). It didn't even win the game (it sent it to overtime). But it did alter NBA history, if for nothing else allowing LeBron James to enter the conversation of all-time greats thanks to the access granted by multiple championships. There isn't a definitive angle of this shot. I like this one because it has so many key components, including the security team with the now-infamous yellow ropes ringing the court. And you can see Jimmy Goldstein in the corner. (Credit: Issac Baldizon/NBAE/Getty Images)
10. Bird vs. Magic
Who knows how many times Larry Bird and Magic Johnson, who will always be connected for their roles in elevating the NBA, were actually connected on the court? This picture is also symbolic of the way they constantly jockeyed for position for the top spot in the league, whether competing for individual awards from afar or battling for the championship in their three head-to-head Finals meetings. They didn't always need to score to impact the game -- sometimes they didn't even need the ball in their hands. Fighting for rebounding position was just one of the elements of the game they valued so much. (Credit: Andrew D. Bernstein/NBAE/Getty Images)
9. Chamberlain's 100
This is how we remember March 2, 1962, the greatest scoring achievement in NBA history. In a way, it also helps us remember Harvey Pollack, the supreme statistician who chronicled so much of the game, including this magical night. It was Pollack who grabbed a sheet of paper from a reporter and wrote down Wilt Chamberlain's unprecedented point total, setting up Associated Press photographer Paul Vathis' immortal shot. Bonus points and current currency for how meme-able it is. Any time a player is on his way to a big scoring night get ready to see his face superimposed on Wilt's. Whenever the dream lives, so does this picture. (Credit: Paul Vathis/AP Photo)
8. Young Kobe reverse dunks
This is the best action shot of Kobe Bryant, when he was young and dedicated to making noise in the league. This shot captures this moment in his career, literally beginning to take off in 1998. Back then he did it with athleticism more than the acumen he honed over the years. He was about flash and flair more than finesse. And it was fascinating. Note how Nick Van Exel takes a peek over his shoulder as he heads back downcourt. Even his teammates were curious to see what this kid could do. (Credit: Andrew D. Bernstein/NBAE/Getty Images)
7. The Doctor is in
This shot from 1977 is nothing less than the transformation of the sport. Julius Erving took basketball above the rim in the 1970s, and it never came back down. This is a composition as artistic as its subject. Dr. J made style the equivalent of substance. Fortunately, NBA photographers were up to the challenge of capturing it on film. (Credit: Neil Leifer/NBAE/Getty Images)
6. Heatles heights
No action photo crystallized the height of the Heat's Big Three era like this one, take in a Dec. 6, 2010, game against the Milwaukee Bucks. LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh are all in the shot (you can see Bosh at the far end of the court, in the lower right corner). The Heat were acrobatic in every sense: the way they flew through the air and the dramatic flourishes they added from their first public appearance together. They didn't just play games, they put on performances. Ta-daaah. (Credit: Morry Gash/AP Photo)
5. Kobe and Shaq
Kobe and Shaq, back in the trainer's room in Staples Center, in the aftermath of their first championship in 2000. The excitement of the victory finally gave way to the exhaustion from the task: a first-round series that went the distance, the epic comeback in the seventh game of the Western Conference finals, and one last push to get past the Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals. You get a sense of what it took to win those trophies. No, this doesn't reflect their contentious relationship. But it reminds us of what they achieved when they collaborated on the court. (Credit: Paul Morse/Los Angeles Times)
4. Tears of a GOAT
When the doubt was erased, when the method was validated. Today the legend of Michael Jordan is so embedded that it's easy to forget there once was a time when there was doubt he'd ever hold the Larry O'Brien Trophy. The conventional wisdom was that guys who won scoring titles couldn't lead their teams to championships. It hadn't been done in the same season for 20 years, since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar brought a title to Milwaukee in 1971. That ended on June 12, 1991. The tears were for all of the doubters. And the reassuring grip on his right arm from his father makes it even better. There are other angles of this, but I prefer this one because it shows James Jordan's face; NBA dads don't get enough credit. (Credit: Andrew D. Bernstein/NBAE/Getty Images)
3. Jordan takes flight
In 1988, the image of Michael Jordan in flight began morphing into the image of the NBA. This dunk from the free throw line in front of the home crowd at Chicago Stadium secured the victory in a memorable dunk contest showdown with Dominique Wilkins. He was wearing the Air Jordan III, the first shoe in his signature line that featured the Jumpman silhouette. He went on to win the first of his five Most Valuable Player awards that year, and in the playoffs he advanced past the opening round for the first time. He's in midair in the pictures of this dunk, but in reality he's ascending. (Credit: Andrew D. Bernstein/NBAE/Getty Images)
2. Vinsanity soars over Weis
If the Olympics can include NBA players, then we can include an Olympic photo in our NBA list. Not only is this an amazing picture, capping the pinnacle of Vince Carter's dunk over Frederic Weis in the 2000 Games as Kevin Garnett and Gary Payton look on in awe/disbelief, it's the most necessary NBA photo since Wilt's 100. With television replays in America restricted by NBC's exclusive Olympic rights and with YouTube not yet in existence (less than 10 percent of American households had broadband internet in 2000 anyway), this photo provided early visual proof that the dunk actually happened. (Credit: Darren McNamara/Allsport/Getty Images)
1. End of MJ's remarkable Bull run
The finale. The culmination of Michael Jordan's career in a Chicago Bulls uniform, the conclusion of his 1990s dominance with the last shot he'd take in the decade. His sixth championship. We've seen the shot go in so many times now that it's great to revisit the moment it was still in doubt, to look back at all of the faces in the Utah crowd filled with wonder and fear and hope on the night of June 14, 1998. It's an exceptional moment in NBA history and yet it's so commonplace. It's the playground fantasy, the driveway dream, the moment all basketball players have imagined: hitting a last-second shot to win a championship. Here it is, coming to fruition.

Men's Health has remained constant, by recycling headlines, but younger sister Women's Health has been charting a whole new path: turning into Cosmo-lite. This happened for many of the same reasons that all women's fitness magazines are so lobotomized.
It's been exactly a year since Michelle Promaulayko became editor-in-chief of the women's spinoff Rodale launched in 2005. I've never met Promaulayko, and a spokeswoman said she wouldn't be available in time to comment on this, and I'm sure she's a very nice person. But the still-successful Cosmo business model is as follows: on the circulation side, huge newsstand sales achieved mostly through sexed-up cover lines, and on the advertising side, a cozy relationship with the beauty industry. Great for profits, bad for anyone looking for an unpatronizing read on health and fitness.
When Women's Health launched, there was reason to believe that the magazine would break the mold. The pages were information-dense, sometimes too much so, and there was a robust, slightly smart-ass energy that belied the faux you-go-girl tone of its competitors. There were fitness models on the cover, so there was no need to pretend that a micro-starlet with a project to plug actually had something to say about a healthy lifestyle. The magazine covered beauty back then too, but it also did reported pieces on hospital safety and travel stories on fly fishing. And it ran things like this:

(The caption reads, "We'll be kick-ass grannies.")
And this:

Even before hiring Promaulayko, editorial director Dave Zinczenko's fondness for all things Cosmo was well-documented. And when it comes to currying favor with the beauty industry, Zinczenko does not discriminate: He used the same strategy to beef up Men's Health's advertising base by creating the Men's Health Grooming Awards in 2007, and was rewarded with beauty advertising growing 45.8 percent for that issue, according to WWD.
Launch editor-in-chief Tina Johnson left Women's Health abruptly in August 2008, after which Zinczenko took over. Like Men's Health before it, Women's Health joined the celebrity cover game, starting with Elizabeth Banks. When Promaulayko was hired away from her longtime gig at Cosmo it was with the specific mission of beefing up fashion and beauty. She brought in top editors from the Cosmo family. Out: the tomboyish verve. In: eating licorice wrapped around your partner's penis (actual June 2009 sex tip), page after page of beauty product placements (including a 25-page beauty package in the April 2009 issue), and Ashlee Simpson on the December 2009 cover, on how she - you guessed it - lost the baby weight.
So far, by conventional standards, her strategy has worked: The magazine was AdAge's Magazine of the Year, Its advertising numbers are less crappy than everyone else's. It has several books planned. The circulation is climbing to 1.5 million, close to beating its more established brother, so apparently there are still plenty of people who want to read it.

Just not the readers who turned to it for a fresh take — some of them complaining about the dumbing down of the content on the magazine's own site. Count me among them.

Women's Health: Magazine Of The Year [AdAge]
Taylor Martinez, former quarterback for the University of Nebraska, has released a new “positive social network” app called Journey, which allows users with disabilities, disorders and chronic diseases to encourage each other and seek advice.
Martinez says that he was inspired to create the app after his famous touchdown experience with Jack Hoffman, a boy with pediatric brain cancer.
“Jack's run inspired me to create Journey to connect people with the same challenges,” said Martinez. “Fifteen percent of the world has some form of disability. There's no social media network out there where they can share that experience.”
Martinez sees Journey as a unique, safe place for people to tell their own stories.
“On Facebook there are groups for people with disabilities, but on here you can really share your journey,” said Martinez.
It's clearly the most ambitious app Martinez has released so far. In 2013 his first mobile game, Follow the Pattern, attracted national media attention. In 2014 he released four more mobile games: Stupid FAST, Risky Road, Wobble Wobble, and, perhaps the most well-known, Tiny Ninja Jump.
Journey, however, is Martinez's first foray into developing a social network.
“Doing a game is fun to do but with me and [co-founder] Loren Hall it's been really touching,” said Martinez. “We've reached out to a lot of people with disabilities. Some of the emails we receive are inspiring. It means a lot to us.”
Martinez said he's received some help from Jeff Slobotski, co-founder of Silicon Prairie News and founder of Router Ventures, as well as Blake Lawrence, CEO of opendorse.
How Journey works
Journey users start by creating a basic profile, which includes identifying one's challenge. For example, “I have agoriphobia” or “An adult with breast cancer” The current app has over 300 categories to choose from. Users can then share reflections, struggles and photos of their journey.
One obvious question is what Journey plans to do about potential bullying, trolling, and fake accounts–common problems that plague many social media sites. When you download the Journey app, it warns that anyone who posts negative comments will have their profile “suspended indefinitely.”
“We have a system in place where it removes a comment after so many flags,” said Martinez. Martinez and Hall also can manage comments manually. They are currently the only two people working on Journey.
The app also has a verified account option as well.
“You can send in $2.99, and you'll get a badge on your profile,” said Martinez. “It proves you are who you say you are.”
The app is free but includes in-app purchases.
“The in-app purchases help to cover the server because the server is expensive,” said Martinez. “We hope it will cover the operation of the servers.”
So what's next for Martinez?
Martinez's interest in helping people with challenges isn't new. In 2014 he donated half the proceeds of his Risky Road app to the Team Jack Foundation, which supports pediatric brain cancer research.
Both Martinez and Hall, have been active in recent years helping children with special challenges.
So is app development still a hobby for Martinez, a personal mission or is it a business?
“Hopefully Journey grows. I don't know how long it will take. I'm looking to make it a household name,” said Martinez. “That would be awesome.”
Where does he see all this going in the future?
“I might be moving up to San Francisco soon to work with tech companies up there,” said Martinez. “I like to be in the tech industry, and I have a lot of fun doing it.”
Journey is now available in the Apple App Store.

Mr. Obama won praise from around the world when, shortly after taking office in 2009, he ordered the Guantánamo Bay prison closed within a year, saying it was contrary to American values and a symbol for terrorist propaganda.
By then, the Bush administration already had transferred more than 500 of the detainees it had sent to Guantánamo, and the Obama administration has since winnowed the population to 174 from 240, with help from Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Belgium and other countries. But Mr. Obama missed his deadline, and the goal has faded as a priority, with domestic opposition to moving some detainees to a prison inside the United States and with other countries that condemned the Guantánamo prison reluctant to take in detainees.
While Mr. Obama went to Norway to collect a Nobel Peace Prize, for example, the Norwegians called resettling Guantánamo detainees “purely a U.S. responsibility.” Germany and several other European countries that had criticized the prison eventually accepted a few detainees but balked at taking as many as the United States had hoped.
In the fall of 2009, Lithuania's newly elected president backed out of her country's previous agreement to resettle a prisoner amid an uproar over reports that the Central Intelligence Agency had run a secret jail in Lithuania. The chairman of the Lithuanian Parliament's national security committee privately apologized and suggested using mutual allies to pressure her to reconsider, the cables show.
Other dispatches illuminated the difficulties of resettling Uighurs, Chinese Muslim prisoners who had been ordered freed by a federal judge. China was deemed likely to abuse them, but Beijing demanded their return.
At an October 2009 meeting in Beijing, a Chinese official linked the Uighurs to American hopes to secure supply routes through China for the Afghan war, saying, “More ‘prudent' actions by the U.S. on the Guantánamo Uighurs would help remove ‘some of the obstacles' on the Chinese side to helping with the shipments.”
And an aide to Finland's prime minister confided in August 2009 “that Chinese diplomats in Helsinki have repeatedly warned them about the damage to bilateral relations should Finland accept any Uighurs,” a cable said.

Still, a few allies were eager to help. After accepting five Chinese Muslims in 2006, Albania's prime minister in 2009 offered to resettle three to six detainees not from China. American diplomats portrayed his offer as “gracious, but probably extravagant.”
“As always, the Albanians are willing to go the extra mile to assist with one of our key foreign policy priorities,” a cable said.
The United States repatriated other detainees for prosecution at home. Afghanistan, however, granted pretrial releases to 29 out of 41 such former detainees from Guantánamo, allowing “dangerous individuals to go free or re-enter the battlefield without ever facing an Afghan court,” diplomats in Kabul complained in a July 2009 cable.

Perhaps the greatest obstacle to closing the prison has been figuring out what to do with detainees from Yemen, who constitute about half of the remaining prisoners at Guantánamo. In a September 2009 meeting with Mr. Brennan, Mr. Obama's top counterterrorism adviser, Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, proposed transferring them all into his prisons. But, a cable later said, “Saleh would, in our judgment, be unable to hold returning detainees in jail for any more than a matter of weeks before public pressure — or the courts — forced their release.”
Mr. Saleh's erratic approach compounded the situation. In that same conversation, for example, he “signaled that rehabilitation is not his concern, but rather ‘the U.S.'s problem' because he is ready and willing to accept all Yemeni detainees into the Yemen prison system.” But moments later, he assured Mr. Brennan that he was committed to “freeing the innocent people after a complete and total rehabilitation.”
Neither Mr. Saleh nor the Saudis were enthusiastic about an American proposal to send Yemeni detainees to a Saudi deradicalization program, cables show. But when Mr. Saleh proposed a Yemeni version, the United States showed interest — but also caution.
In March 2009, Mr. Saleh demanded $11 million to build such a program in Aden, but Mr. Brennan replied that “such a program takes time to develop and that Saleh had his hands full dealing with al-Qaeda in Yemen.” When the two met again six months later, Mr. Saleh “repeatedly,” according to a cable, asked how much money he could expect. When Mr. Brennan “offered $500,000 as an initial investment currently available for the crafting of a rehabilitation program, Saleh dismissed the offer as insufficient,” the cable said.
Several cables shed light on the Saudis' rehabilitation program. A March 2009 dispatch estimated that the program had processed 1,500 extremists, including 119 former detainees. That cable put the “recidivism rate” at 8 to 10 percent, arguing that “the real story of the Saudi rehabilitation program is one of success: at least 90 percent of its graduates appear to have given up jihad and reintegrated into Saudi society.”
Over time, however, the numbers apparently slipped. In March 2010, Daniel Fried, the State Department's special envoy for closing the Guantánamo prison, told European Union officials that the Saudi program was “serious but not perfect,” citing a failure rate of 10 to 20 percent. Another cable noted that of 85 militants on a “most wanted” list published by Saudi authorities in early 2009, 11 were former Guantánamo detainees. But the cables offer details on only a few individual cases — like a Saudi who became a leader of Al Qaeda's Yemen branch and a Kuwaiti who committed a suicide bombing in Iraq in 2008, both of which have been previously reported.

The suicide bomber proved deeply embarrassing for the Kuwaiti government. Months later, in February 2009, Kuwait's interior minister proposed a solution for other detainees who seemed too extremist for reintegration into society: let them die in combat.
“You know better than I that we cannot deal with these people,” the minister, Sheik Jaber al-Khaled al-Sabah, told the ambassador, a cable reported. “If they are rotten, they are rotten and the best thing to do is get rid of them. You picked them up in Afghanistan; you should drop them off in Afghanistan, in the middle of the war zone.”
Mr. Sabah's private comments contrasted with the public stance of his government. Under domestic pressure to urge the United States to send home all Kuwaitis from Guantánamo, Kuwait has strongly suggested that it is doing so.
The United States often has required countries to impose travel bans — among other restrictions, including continuing surveillance — on freed prisoners, sometimes with mixed success.
In February 2009, for example, a diplomat in Qatar urged Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. not to meet with his Qatari counterpart, citing reports that a Qatari former detainee traveled “despite explicit assurances that he would not be permitted to do so.” The freed prisoner, Jarallah al-Marri, had traveled to Britain to join a speaking tour with another former prisoner, Moazzam Begg, a British-Pakistani citizen.
Another American diplomat later praised Mr. Begg's activities, saying he had pressed Luxembourg's foreign minister to take in detainees, and — displaying “minimal ill will toward his captors” — reiterated that request at an Amnesty International event.
“Mr. Begg is doing our work for us, and his articulate, reasoned presentation makes for a convincing argument,” a January 2010 cable said. “It is ironic that after four years of imprisonment and alleged torture, Moazzam Begg is delivering the same ‘message' as we are: please consider accepting GTMO detainees for resettlement.”

Wait, what? Complaint filed against Amitabh Bachchan for singing national anthem incorrectly
Short-filmmaker Ullhas PR on Monday filed a police complaint against Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan, accusing him of taking more time than mandated while singing the national anthem during the Twenty20 World Cup clash between India and Pakistan.
The complaint was lodged at the New Ashok Nagar police station in east Delhi.
Bachchan sang the national anthem on March 19 at the Eden Garden in Kolkata along with thousands at the sprawling stadium -- before the high-voltage match began.
Ullhas told IANS: "Amitabh Bachchan sang the national anthem in 1 minute 10 seconds while the mandatory time is 52 seconds. One can take two or three seconds more or less while singing the national anthem but Amitabh crossed the mandated time limit."
In his complaint, Ullhas also said that Bachchan used the word "Sindhu" in place of "Sindh" while singing the anthem.
The filmmaker had on November 25 last year filed a police complaint against Bollywood actor-producer Aamir Khan for his remarks on intolerance in the country.
Earlier, he lodged a complaint against Aamir Khan following the release of his film PK, in which he referred to policemen as "thulla".

Jon Super / AP Senegal's Moussa Konate celebrates after scoring against Great Britain during their group A men's soccer match at the London 2012 Summer Olympics on Thursday, July 26 at Old Trafford Stadium in Manchester, England.
In many ways, the soccer match that unfolded at Manchester's Old Trafford stadium Thursday evening followed a familiar script. In the hours leading up to kickoff, fans bedecked in red (the color of home club Manchester United) streamed into the stands, trailed by the scent of overpriced hot dogs and fish ‘n chips. But on this night intercoms blared announcements in both English and French, and flags unknown to many locals—think North Korea and the United Arab Emirates—hung from the stadium's rafters. That's because this Premier League stadium was hosting the first day of men's soccer at the 2012 Olympics.
Anyone who remotely follows the sport will know that the Olympics in no way represents the pinnacle of competitive soccer. Playing in a World Cup final remains the dream of children from Brazil to Germany, and few could tell you that Nigeria won the silver medal in Beijing. In Britain, where soccer is the unofficial national sport, tribal loyalties ensure that England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales compete separately at the international level. It's no wonder that Great Britain did not field a soccer team at the last 12 Olympics. “When I think of the Olympics, I don't really think about soccer,” said 17-year old Amanda McCue before taking her seat at Old Trafford. “I think of all the other sports, but I guess soccer is a big part of it too.”
(MORE: 50 Olympic Athletes to Watch)
Now Brits can say that with certainty. With London hosting the games this year, the nation's soccer factions decided to set aside their rivalries to compete as one. Around 75,000 spectators turned out to watch a unified Team GB square off with Senegal, a nation making its Olympic debut. Pundits—and even the Senegalese—anticipated a lopsided match. That might explain why the British team marched onto the field for its warm-up to the Black Eyed Peas song “I Gotta Feeling” (that tonight‘s gonna be a good night).
It seemed apt early on. After twenty minutes, captain Ryan Giggs, a Manchester United midfielder and the oldest ever Olympic outfield soccer player at 38, set up a shot for Welshman Craig Bellamy, who put the Brits ahead 1-0. Britain maintained possession of the ball for 61% of the first half. Meanwhile, a physically uncompromising Senegalese side racked up eight fouls to Britain's five, and its increasingly frustrated players walked off the pitch for halftime with two yellow cards.
Those statistics gave the home crowd reason to cheer. Britain may have been absent from the festivities since 1960, but they made up for it with chants of “GB” so loud they could have been heard in Senegal. Catherine Applegate, a 26-year-old who endured a three-hour drive from Cambridge, said Brits weren't struggling to get behind their boys. “I think the World Cup teams are more well-known, but when it comes to the Olympics we get behind Team GB as well as we do the other national teams that we have.” Cue fans in red, white and blue spandex suits, and shirtless men with Union Jacks painted on their chests.
(MORE: Olympic Soccer Screw Up: After Flag-Gate Comes Welshman-Gate)
The patriotism lasted, but the celebrations did not. Senegal emerged from the locker rooms a re-vitalized squad—and their physical game seemed to turn into one of downright aggression. In the 70th minute of the match, Senegalese defender Saliou Ciss crunched into Bellamy with two feet. The Brits—and plenty of booing fans—wanted a penalty kick. They didn't get it. Senegal went on to equalize in the 81st minute. “In a Premier League game he would probably have been sent off three times,” Giggs said after the match. “There were a few naughty challenges. A few of our lads are struggling now.”
That struggle suggests the Olympics may mean more to the British side than people realize. Manager Stuart Pearce suggested the enormity of the Games began to weigh heavy on his players' minds in the hours leading up to their debut. Speaking in a post-match interview, he said his side had the jitters. “I saw nerves in the dressing room,” he said. “A lot of our players have played Premier League football but this cranked it up a bit.”
Fans can forgive nerves. Less certain is whether they can forgive British players—more specifically, Welsh and Scottish players—who chose not to sing the British national anthem. “Not singing the national anthem is bang out of order,” one user wrote on Twitter, adding that Team GB should “unite on every level when you work together.” More generous commentators suggested that those men, including captain Giggs, simply weren't used to singing it.
They have a few days to learn the words and soothe any sore feelings. Team GB will play the United Arab Emirates on Sunday at London's Wembley Stadium.

Edinburgh Castle from the Vennel (HDR)
For those of you that don't know…
“A vennel is a passageway between the gables of two buildings which can in effect be a minor street in Scotland and the north east of England”
This one is more famous than most perhaps and is a great area to get a slightly less (albeit still significantly) clichéd view of the popular landmark. This particular shot was taken in the early evening about a month ago. I took 3 exposures (-2EV, 0EV and +2EV) and merged them to HDR using Photomatix 4 (a program which I find to be more much easier to get a good result from than Photomatix 3!). I'm quite pleased with the result but I would quite like to return there when it is a bit darker as I suspect the lights being on would improve the photo. A good sunset illuminating the sky behind the castle would also be nice.

Bitcoin remittance provider BitPesa has officially launched its beta test.
The Kenya-based company offers a 3% cut-rate fee, and is aiming to target the country's expats abroad who send $1.17bn home annually, according to The Wall Street Journal.
Users send their bitcoin to BitPesa, which then converts the amount into the local Kenyan currency and sends it on to the recipient. The service promises same-day delivery and no hidden fees.
BitPesa aims to disrupt a traditional remittance market that often imposes high costs on those wishing to use remittance services.
For example, the cost of sending money to Kenya by other means can be as much as 9.2% of the value being transferred by services like Western Union and MoneyGram, and 19.8% by banks, reports have found.
Disrupting the remittance market
Many have spoken to bitcoin's potential in the remittance market, as cross-border money transfers otherwise come with weighty fees. The digital currency faces an uphill battle in that business though, mostly due to the costs of compliance and regulation.
Lawmakers' attitudes toward bitcoin and digital currencies differ in each country – the kind of uncertainty that will become increasingly problematic as bitcoin gains popularity.
But BitPesa claims “end-to-end regulatory compliance and KYC protocol”, helping to “eliminate fraud, increase the growth of bank balances” and gain back “the trust of valued diaspora clients”, its website says.
Western Union currently accounts for about 31% of the total market, and MoneyGram 6%. Commercial banks account for 50%
BitPesa's competition
Still, while BitPesa is closer to reaching the market, it's not the only operator trying to use the power of the Bitcoin protocol to improve the global remittance process.
Coincove entered the bitcoin remittance market last year for Latin American expats from Argentina, Mexico, Spain and Chile, and BuyBitcoin.ph did the same one month later for Filipino expats.
Notably, Coincove saw its formal launch earlier this week, and though it offers and exchange and wallet service, it still sees a big opportunity in the remittance space.

You could argue, or pray, that Sharon Edwards is a monstrous one-off. Yet cases of female brutality against men – and other women – seem to be becoming more prevalent.
Women murdering men is still mercifully rare. In 2014/15, 19 men died at the hands of their partner or ex-partner, compared with 81 women. However, the number of women convicted of perpetrating domestic abuse has more than quadrupled in the past ten years, from 806 in 2004/05 to 4,866 in 2014/15.
Male domestic violence charity The ManKind Initiative say that for every three victims of partner abuse, two will be female and one will be male. According to the Office for National Statistics, 2.8 per cent of men – 500,000 individuals – suffered partner abuse in 2014/15.
While it's important to state that more women than men suffer domestic abuse in Britain (4.5m women versus 2.2m men over the age of 16, according to the ONS), there remains a theory that men underreport their experiences due to a culture of masculine expectations.
Staggeringly, a recent report from liberal Canada, where men are encouraged to talk about their feelings, showed that men are more likely to suffer spousal violence, with 342,000 women and 418,000 men suffering abuse in the preceding five years to 2014.
Could the same be true in other countries – like the UK? It's possible: the ManKind Initiative say only 10 per cent of male victims will tell the police, as opposed to 26 per cent of women.

Looks like Rollo is returning to the show after all. Clive Standen, who plays Ragnar's brother on the History show, has confirmed that he's definitely on “Vikings” season 5. He further teases that fans will get a hold of a “very different Rollo” next season.
Spoiler alert: This article contains plot details about “Vikings” season 5. An official announcement has yet to be made regarding the air date of the season premiere. Episodes from the series' previous seasons are available for Australian viewers to watch on SBS.
Fans were starting to wonder if Ragnar's older sibling was still on the show considering Rollo's Mediterranean midlife crisis and return to Normandy. Adding fuel to the gossip fire is the fact that Standen is now the star of the new NBC series “Taken.”
All the speculations are now down the drain as Standen himself confirmed his season 5 appearance. And according to him, fans should expect a whole new Rollo when the show returns.
“Nearly every season, [creator] Michael Hirst has allowed me to reinvent this man, and season 5 is no different,” Standen tells TV Guide. “I think when he comes back, all bets are off. You'll see a very different Rollo.”
But no matter how “different” the new Rollo is going to be, his contempt for his former associates and family apparently remains the same. Nothing less than a fiery Viking reunion is bound to happen.
“It's going to be explosive,” says Standen teases. “But not in the ways that you'd expect.”
Although History hasn't announced an official “Vikings” season 5 release date, a November launch is likely. The show averages nine months per intermission, and that includes the season 4A and season 4B break.
The first two seasons had a 10-month pause while the third season began airing nine months after the season 2 was done. There was another 10-month wait before season 4A started, and fans had to wait for seven months before the second half of the fourth season was underway.
It's also confirmed that the upcoming season is going to consist of 20 episodes, just like the previous one. It's also likely going to be divided into two parts. The first half of season 5 is presumed to be done. And although filming of the second half is still on-going, it's probably close to wrapping up as well.
Post-production is another story, though. That could take some time and potentially impact the “Vikings” season 5 release date. Stay connected with IBTimes Australia for more updates.

Americans thought electing a trash-talking billionaire reality TV star to the presidency of the #$%^ United States would finally be enough to convey the message that they hate both political parties. If anything, they hate Republicans more.But the Uni-Party can't learn. The bureaucracy, the judiciary and congressional Republicans are all openly working for the "Resistance." It's President Trump against the world.In Congress, the hate for Trump is personal. Not only did he throw a grenade into politicians' little do-nothing club, but his very existence destroys their self-conception as people with a set of skills.While Trump was making billions of dollars building skyscrapers, developing golf courses and starring on a hit reality TV show, members of Congress were slowly working their way up the political ladder -- interning at think tanks and congressional offices, taking some small government job, then running for the House or Senate, and, hopefully, marrying a woman with a large inheritance.A stunning number of senators and congressmen are supported by rich wives -- Sens. John McCain, Mitch McConnell, Richard Blumenthal, John Kerry and Ron Wyden, and Reps. Michael McCaul, Scott Peters and Paul Ryan, to name a few. Is there any other profession with as high a percentage of men sponging off their wives' inheritances?Then a self-made billionaire came along, violated all the rules they had lived by, and swept aside more than a dozen experienced politicians just like themselves! Not only did Trump make his own money, but he beat them at the one thing they thought they knew how to do.How else to explain Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's sneering dismissal of Trump's request for an investigation into voter fraud, followed -- one week later! -- by McConnell's assurance that the Senate would investigate former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's phone call to the Russian ambassador?
These useless Republicans allowed a Senate seat to be stolen from under their noses in Minnesota in 2008, giving Obama the vote he needed to pass Obamacare and destroy our health care.No, don't investigate that! Why bother with the very foundation of democracy? How will these nitwit politicians win praise from The Washington Post without devoting all their energy to some current leftist fetish, like Russia?At least when liberals fixate on Russia, they have a clear subversive mission.Congressional Republicans are just nincompoops. The only thing they know is: Imitate Reagan -- from 30 years ago. It would make more sense for Republicans to demand that all air traffic controllers be fired for no reason than it is for them to keep treating Putin like it's 1950 and he's Stalin. (We know Putin isn't Stalin because Democrats aren't affectionately calling him "Uncle Joe" and spying for him.)If senators have time for hearings on Flynn's discussions with the Russian ambassador, could they possibly squeeze in an afternoon to repeal Obamacare?How about the campaign pledge that rocketed Trump to the White House? According to The Washington Post, at the GOP retreat last month, when Trump talked about using tax policy to help pay for the wall, Republicans expressed "confusion about what exactly he meant."Are they retarded? (By "they," I mean all Republicans in Congress, except Sen. Tom Cotton and about a half-dozen others.)If Republicans had an ounce of self-respect, right after repealing Obamacare and writing a bill taxing remittances to make Mexico pay for the wall, they'd be impeaching the ridiculous Judge James Robart. Even lawyers who oppose Trump's travel ban agree that Judge Robart made a complete ass of himself when he blocked the executive order.The "Resistance" claims to be terrified that Trump will not be constrained by our Constitution, but they're the ones who are perfectly willing to disregard the Constitution simply to stop Trump.At least since the Chinese exclusion case of 1889, the Supreme Court has made blindingly clear that "the power of exclusion of foreigners" belongs to the political branches of government: Congress and the president -- not to the judiciary.The president's authority to exclude aliens in the public interest has been reaffirmed in dozens of cases since then. Among them:-- Harisiades v. Shaughnessy (1952): "Any policy toward aliens is vitally and intricately interwoven with ... the conduct of foreign relations, the war power, and the maintenance of a republican form of government. Such matters are so exclusively entrusted to the political branches of government as to be largely immune from judicial inquiry or interference."-- Shaughnessy v. Mezei (1953): "Congress expressly authorized the President to impose additional restrictions on aliens entering or leaving the United States during periods of international tension and strife. ... (The President) may shut out aliens whose 'entry would be prejudicial to the interests of the United States.'"-- Mathews v. Diaz (1976): "(T)he responsibility for regulating the relationship between the United States and our alien visitors has been committed to the political branches of the Federal Government. ... (Therefore, there is) a narrow standard of review of decisions made by the Congress or the President in the area of immigration and naturalization."-- United States v. Valenzuela-Bernal (1982): "The power to regulate immigration -- an attribute of sovereignty essential to the preservation of any nation -- has been entrusted by the Constitution to the political branches of the Federal Government."-- INS. v. Aguirre-Aguirre (1999): "(J)udicial deference to the Executive Branch is especially appropriate in the immigration context where officials 'exercise especially sensitive political functions that implicate questions of foreign relations.'"And on and on and on.There are lots of constitutional questions that reasonable people can disagree about. Whether the president can exclude foreigners from seven terror-prone countries is not one of them.But congressional Republicans are happy to ignore the Constitution, ignore the balance of powers, ignore written law, even to relinquish their own constitutional authority and let the courts run our foreign policy, just to be a part of the establishment's STOP TRUMP movement.Instead of neurotically fixating on Russia in some fantasy camp imitation of Reagan, circa 1982, what we'd like these worthless Republicans to do is: Imitate Trump -- circa now.COPYRIGHT 2017 ANN COULTERDISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION
House of Cosbys is an American animated sitcom created by Justin Roiland for the film festival Channel 101. The series centers on Mitchell Reynolds (Jeff Davis), who builds a cloning machine to make duplicates of his favorite comedian, Bill Cosby. The show stars Davis, Roiland, and a rotating cast of performers, many of whom were participants at Channel 101. The series premiered January 30, 2005, and was the number one-rated program on the site for three months. Four episodes of the series were created, which debuted at Channel 101 screenings and were posted online thereafter. The series concluded on June 26, 2005 with an "unofficial" fifth installment.
The series garnered media attention when lawyers for Cosby sent Roiland and site administrator Dan Harmon a cease and desist letter in June 2005, which resulted in the series' ending. The show was created prior to public knowledge of any sexual assault allegations against Bill Cosby. It is the best-known series to arise from Channel 101.[1]
Plot [ edit ]
The series revolves around Mitchell Reynolds (Davis), a fan of comedian Bill Cosby who, using one of Cosby's hairs, spends a decade crafting a cloning machine to create his dream: a "house of Cosbys". Each duplicate contains random and mild attributes, such as curiosity and dancing.[1] He then begins cloning several more Cosbys to help him around the house, much like in the plot of the 1996 film Multiplicity. However, the quality of the clones seems to deteriorate as the process is repeated, and he decides to stop using the machine; but when one of the clones subversively activates it, he discovers that every tenth Cosby he clones has superpowers. At the suggestion of Data Analysis Cosby (the first super-powered Cosby) they decide to continue cloning Cosbys so that their superpowers can be used to help the world.
Many participants of Channel 101 gave voices to the series, including Rob Schrab, Steve Agee, and all three members of The Lonely Island.

History [ edit ]
Justin Roiland first began working in television in the early 2000s, mainly producing reality television programs. He and his close friends, Sevan Najarian and Abed Gheith, were more interested in creating comedic short films, and would work on them at his apartment in spare time. In 2003, they began submitting their projects to Channel 101, a non-profit monthly short film festival in Los Angeles, in which participants submit a short film in the format of a pilot under five minutes in length. After submitting several films, he began working on House of Cosbys, which originated between him and Gheith doing poor impressions of Bill Cosby. While the original idea was similar in setup to the sitcom The Brady Bunch—consisting of multiple Cosbys together in a home—it eventually evolved into its final form with more development. Roiland deemed the concept "Multiplicity meets The Smurfs meets the original concept."[2]
He wrote the first episode in an unusually short time, and began working on it alongside Najarian. Roiland would design and draw characters and scan them into a computer, where they could be further manipulated in Adobe Photoshop. From there, Najarian would digitally animate the drawings using Adobe After Effects.[2] As the series progressed, he enlisted friends Myke Chilian and Steven Chunn to help with character design and background art, respectively. Roiland later likened it to "our own little animation studio."[2] The first episode debuted at a screening on January 30, 2005, and received a wildly supportive reaction from the audience. Two more episodes were created over the following two months, where it remained the most popular show at each screening.[3] By the fourth episode, Roiland fell ill with bronchitis, which resulted in what they felt was a subpar installment. Following this, a "perfect storm" of things helped lead to the ending of the series: Roiland had a close friend die in a car accident, which was "traumatizing" for him, he and his small team grew exhausted with making the series, and he and Channel 101's site administrator Dan Harmon received a cease and desist letter from Bill Cosby's attorney in June 2005:
“ Dear sirs, we are lawyers for Mr. William H Cosby, Jr. We have just learned that you offer a deeply offensive animated film that you created, entitled House of Cosbys. [...] As you are certainly aware, none of you are licensed or in any way authorized to use Mr. Cosby's voice, name, or likeness. [...] Therefore, we demand that you immediately cease and desist from any use of our client's name, voice, and likeness, including the development and distribution of the House of Cosbys series. Very truly yours, John P. Schmitt ”
Although he scripted a fifth installment of the series, a mockumentary about receiving the letter, he decided to end the series. Roiland attributed much of his reluctance to continue not on the prospect of potential legal action, but the passing of his friend. He gave the script to friends Chester Tam, and Chris Romano and Eric Falconer, who produced an "unofficial" fifth episode of House of Cosbys.[2]
Despite no longer making the series, Cosby's lawyers insisted that the online distributors of the episodes—Channel101.com and Roiland's own site, ComicSacrifice.com—take them down. Harmon initially pulled the episodes from the site, but re-uploaded them shortly thereafter upon realizing their requests were unreasonable.[4] He was forced to take them down when Cosby's lawyers went to the company that maintained the server for the site, CI Host.[5] Harmon noted that the shorts were widely available on other video sites in a post on his site, commenting, "The actions of Cosby's legal team are somewhat laughable, somewhat sad and ultimately symbolic of a quantum shift in the business of entertainment."[6] Blogger Andy Baio made the series available via his website, waxy.org, beginning in November 2005, though he was also sent a letter from Cosby's attorney the following March.[7] "I'm sure he despised it, which is sort of sad because we're all fans," said Roiland at the time.[5]
The series received media attention upon the cease and desist letter, which resulted in Roiland—then "an unemployed 23-year-old"—gaining a talent agent and being signed to the United Talent Agency.[1]

Reception [ edit ]
Erik Adams of The A.V. Club called it a "hilarious" show that "ended too soon, [and] proved to be as versatile as its clones."[3]
In a fitting visual metaphor for the 2016 presidential campaign, current Republican runner-up Ted Cruz spoke to reporters Friday afternoon from a little postage stamp in the corner of a live shot featuring the empty venue where frontrunner Donald Trump would shortly arrive. Cruz was asked for his reaction to the protests that greeted Trump Thursday night, and which would soon force Trump to abandon his motorcade Donald Trump this afternoon, and Cruz showed something approaching solidarity by noting that the protesters had “crossed the line” and were “leftist agitators” who were “trying to silence a voice they don't like.”
True to form, though, Cruz couldn't resist a shot at Trump, noting that his own responses to protesters don't involve “inciting violence.” In a particularly surreal touch, today's protesters could be heard in the Trump venue as Cruz finished his response. Watch the video above.
Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com
With the possibility -- and what some commentators say is the probability -- that between one and three Supreme Court justices will retire during the next four years, the next president could have an enormous and lasting impact on the nation's highest Court and its legal and social policy.
But often neglected in the hype surrounding the future makeup of the Supreme Court and the hot-button issues that frequent its docket, is the considerable opportunity for the next president to shape the legal landscape through appointments to the 13 federal appellate courts. The Supreme Court hears arguments in only about 75 cases a year, while the geographically representative federal appeals courts provide the final decision in more than 60,000 cases annually. For most Americans therefore, it is the so-called lower federal appellate court, rather than the justices in their fabled marble temple in Washington, that will truly be the "court of last resort." This year, the potential impact of the next president on the federal courts of appeals is especially noteworthy.
The U.S. Constitution states that the president has the power to nominate all federal judges -- not just (as one might infer from listening to campaign rhetoric) Supreme Court justices. Moreover, upon Senate confirmation, these judges also serve a life tenure, meaning that vacancies among the 179 federal appeals court judgeships and the 578 federal trial court positions provide one of the greatest opportunities for a president to create an enduring legacy.
This assertion relies on a conclusion, generally agreed upon and documented by several studies, that judges from different party affiliations reach distinct legal conclusions on key legal issues. This is not to say that federal judges work from party talking points; most take seriously their independence, which is, after all, the reason behind their constitutionally mandated lifetime tenure. Nonetheless, the choice of a judge by a president is an inherently political undertaking, and different judicial philosophies of constitutional interpretation can lead to vastly different results in judicial decisions.
For example, according to a study of the period from 1970 to 1994 by George Washington University law professor Richard J. Pierce, Republican-appointed judges considering environmental cases voted to deny standing (access to the court) to plaintiffs challenging decisions of the Environmental Protection Agency 79.2 percent of the time. In contrast, during that same period Democratic-appointed judges voted to deny standing just 18.2 percent of the time in those challenges.
Doug Kendall, the head of the Constitutional Accountability Center and co-director of the Judging the Environment Project, which has examined the environmental record of Bush administration appointees to the federal bench, notes an additional significance.
"The Supreme Court rarely reviews these cases, making the composition of the lower courts just as important as the Supreme Court when it comes to the enforcement of our fundamental environmental laws."
But the impact that judges of differing ideologies and partisan affiliations can have covers the spectrum of legal issues. At a recent Senate Judiciary hearing, for instance, Cyrus Mehri, an attorney specializing in employment discrimination, cited several cases in which judges have closed the door for individual plaintiffs, including a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit in which that court "reached out" to overturn a jury's decision in favor of a plaintiff whom it found had been discriminated against.
In the case, Septimus v. University of Houston, the assistant general counsel of the University of Texas applied for the position of associate general counsel. After her supervisor belittled her and refused to consider her for the position, she filed a grievance, which in turn led the supervisor to draft a confidential memo reflecting plans to retaliate against her, which he later acted upon. The employee ultimately resigned and sued her former employer. A federal jury found that she was forced to leave because of the treatment she received and awarded her nearly $400,000 in damages. But a panel of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decision by what Mehri called "shifting the legal standard."
Even with such a clearly defined link between party and judicial philosophy, of course, the potential impact of a president's appointments also depends on the quantity, geographic distribution, and ideology of the judges he is replacing. For a president to be able to appoint a new judge, a current judge must either retire or take senior status, or Congress must create a new seat. But all judicial vacancies are not equal. If a judge decides to retire and he is from the party of the president, that president's appointment of the replacement is less likely to significantly change the balance of that court.
Indeed, this is one reason why if John McCain were elected president he would have a much greater opportunity to move the Supreme Court further to the right than Barak Obama would have to move it back to the center -- the justices who are rumored to be thinking of stepping down are more liberal in orientation. (Although, ironically, two of them, Justices John Paul Stevens and David Souter, were appointed by a Republican president.)
Obama would likely have a greater opportunity to shape the federal appeals bench if elected president, however, because of the current makeup of those courts. Of the 13 circuit courts, two, the 2nd and 3rd Circuits, are evenly divided between Republican and Democratic appointees, three, the 1st, 4th, and 11th have a Republican majority of one or two judges, and of the others, Democrats have a solid majority on just one, the 9th Circuit, while Republicans control the rest.
Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former Deputy Director of the Federal Judicial Center, recently completed a study of the status of the 179 current federal appeals court judges, focusing on which judges would be likely to retire, as well as the probability that Congress would create 14 new appellate positions. He found that an Obama presidency could potentially raise the number of Democratic appointees from 44 percent to 58 percent and significantly increase the number of appeals courts with Democratic majorities.
"On the Supreme Court, the best Obama can do is hold the ground and keep the Court in its current state, whereas McCain could really firm up the conservative wing of the Court," Wheeler explained. "On the appeals courts, however, Obama would not be limited in this way. He could bring a greater degree of balance."
But Wheeler's study also points out the significant reward from potential appointments to the appeals court bench that a McCain presidency would reap, with the number of Republican appointees rising to a virtually unprecedented 74 percent, as well as likely control of all 13 courts of appeals.
Ideological balance on these courts is reflected in two ways. First, judges are assigned randomly to the three-judge panels that hear most of the arguments. The makeup of a panel affects not only its decision but also its magnitude. Studies have shown that panels with judges appointed from different parties are less likely to reach sweeping ideological decisions as are panels on which the judges are of the same party. Secondly, a party's control of the circuit can be significant on those occasional instances when a court grants en banc review, that is a review of a panel's decision by the full appeals court.
Though much of the "science" of judicial appointments involves the very unscientific reading of tea leaves, there is little dispute that the next president will have a significant opportunity to shape the federal courts. Americans would do well to gain greater understanding of and pay more attention to this subject as they prepare to choose a new leader. As Justice Robert Jackson wrote, "It is not the function of the government to keep the citizen from falling into error; it is the function of the citizen to keep the government from falling into error."
Many people dream of becoming spies. Life as James Bond or a character from an Alan Furst novel seems racy and well-paid. But when faced with actual espionage—the training, the danger, the use of other human beings for motives that can feel questionable or even sordid—they forget about it. They move on.
Juan Pujol didn't move on. At the beginning of World War II, this brilliant young Spaniard wanted to “start a personal war with Hitler,” and espionage was his chosen method of doing it. He was willing to risk his life—and that of his gorgeous wife, Araceli—to have a great adventure and perhaps save the world in the process.
There were a few problems with this plan, though. Pujol wasn't a spy. He was an ex-chicken farmer and hotel manager who was, in the spring of 1941, stuck in a one-star dump in Madrid. He had no training in espionage. He had no contacts in the espionage world. He was living in a Fascist-controlled country that was infiltrated by thousands of Nazi agents and informers. He had about as much chance of becoming a world-class intelligence operative as you or I have of winning the gold in the Olympic steeplechase.
Only one year later, Pujol had transformed himself into something almost unprecedented in the long history of intelligence. He was on his way to becoming a completely self-made master spy. By that time, Pujol was a rising star in MI5's stable of double agents. The Germans trusted him implicitly. He conducted missions that involved global assets and caused the Nazis to send fighter planes and destroyers to attack convoys that didn't even exist. The Allies were so in awe of his powers of confabulation that they'd given him the code name “Garbo,” because he was the greatest actor they'd ever seen.
And when the Allies began planning D-Day, it was Pujol who was chosen to lead the deception effort. He would be the point of the spear in convincing Hitler that the Normandy landings, the greatest invasion in human history, was in fact a fake, and that a million-man army was about to attack him along another length of French coast. Pujol was going to be lead actor in the most complex wartime deception ever conceived.
This simply doesn't happen. Nobodies won't themselves into the game in the course of one short year. But somehow this mischievous and enigmatic man had done just that. At a price, however.
At the beginning of his career, Pujol had only one thing to recommend himself as a spy: raw imagination. He'd been a dreamer since childhood, which he spent “covered in bandages” after acting out wild adventures as an explorer or the Hollywood cowboy Tom Mix. His parents didn't understand him, didn't understand why he crashed his tricycle through plate-glass windows and nearly decapitated himself while acting out some daydream. Pujol tried to explain that his imagination “controlled” his brain, and that he was powerless to stop it.
That imagination cursed him throughout his early life. Pujol was so convinced that he had a great part to play in world affairs that he was a disaster at everyday life. He was a bad student and an even worse soldier who spent all of the Spanish Civil War trying not to kill anyone. His beloved father died thinking his son was a failure. His Catholic mother was in despair.
When the German divisions began rolling through Poland, however, something changed in Pujol. His father had taught Pujol to fight for freedom and individual dignity, and the young man saw all that going up in smoke along the Western Front. He decided to take up arms in his own unorthodox way. And he had only one weapon to offer the Allies: the brain that had almost ruined his life.
Pujol and his new wife, Araceli, went to work. First he went to the British embassy in Madrid and offered his services. “Your services of what?” was the reply. He would try on four separate occasions to volunteer for the Allied cause and be shot down every time.
There was only one alternative. He would have to pretend to be a Nazi and volunteer for the German side, then turn double agent. Madrid at the time was practically controlled by the Third Reich, so this was a seriously dangerous option, but he went ahead anyway.
Pujol marched into the German embassy and soon hornswaggled an experienced Nazi spy-runner named Federico into believing his wild stories about his friends and contacts in key wartime positions. (None of these friends or contacts actually existed). To prove his bona fides to the Nazi agent, Pujol traveled to Lisbon, the WWII capitol of intrigue. In Lisbon, even the hotel chambermaids worked for one spy service or another and people sold their heirlooms and their relatives to get to the West. There were thousands of desperate men and women trying to escape Portugal. Pujol arrived and joined the sorry-looking crowds looking for a break, a way into the game.
After drifting around for days, Pujol found a fellow Spaniard who was carrying a special diplomatic visa, which would allow the owner to leave on the seaplane that flew out of Lisbon for points west every day. Pujol instantly made friends with the man (Pujol was very good at that), accompanied him to the cafés and restaurants for weeks, then set his plan in motion. He set him the Spaniard with a supply of drinks and chips at one of the local casinos, then snuck into the man's hotel room, found the visa and photographed it. He sent the Spaniard on his way then visited a series of shops in Lisbon and had the visa reproduced down to the special stamps. The forged document was something that men in Lisbon would have killed for, and it convinced Federico that Pujol was the real thing. Soon he was snapped up by the Abwehr, the German intelligence service, and sent into action.
Pretending to be heading to London, Pujol settled in Lisbon and sent a stream of intricately detailed reports on British armaments, Allied airfields, massive troop movements, and convoys headed toward the besieged island of Malta. They were utterly convincing and 100 percent fake, cribbed from propaganda films, flyers, and phone books. When British analysts later studied the messages, they refused to believe that Pujol had never set foot in England.
Throughout his early career as a spy, Pujol was one phone call or one background check away from being executed. He lived by the slimmest of margins. “It seemed a miracle that he'd survived so long,” said his MI5 handler later on. Pujol agreed. “It was crazy. I had no idea what I was doing.”
The self-made spy finally convinced the Allies that he wanted to work for them and was smuggled into England. At his debriefing in London, he told his British handlers why he'd volunteered to fight the Nazis. His brother, Joaquin, had been vacationing in France when he came across a horrific scene: the Gestapo pulling out refugees from their hiding places in a French home and executing them in cold blood. The MI5 officer, a half-Jewish artist named Thomas Harris, listened to the gruesome tale and afterward declared that Pujol would make a “marvelous agent.”
In doing the research for Agent Garbo, my book on Pujol, I discovered what became one of the more fascinating details of his story: at the time Pujol was being debriefed, his brother Joaquin had never been to France. He'd never been out of Spain. The story was a complete fantasy, created by Pujol to make sure the Allies believed him and that he would be allowed to live out his dream.
Soon afterward, Pujol and Harris began one of the great partnerships in espionage history: they sent the Abwehr airplane manuals baked into cakes, created an army of 27 fake sub-agents to feed the Nazis fake narratives, made battleships vanish from the Indian Ocean and pop up thousands of miles away. An MI5 advance man toured the English countryside for hotels the imaginary informants could “stay” at and pubs they could describe in their bulletins. The Germans rated Garbo their best spy in England; he was even awarded the Iron Cross, something that amused Pujol to no end.
The Allies were just as impressed. Churchill read his dispatches at night. J. Edgar Hoover wanted to meet him.
When it came time to concoct a scheme to “cover” D-Day, Pujol was given the job of convincing Hitler that the Allies would attack Calais and not Normandy. Few believed he would succeed, but Garbo and a handful of other double agents began by creating an imaginary million-man-strong army. George S. Patton was assigned as commander. Made-up Morse code and stacks of Garbo's eyewitness reports was bolstered by physical trickery: gargantuan fake oil depots, sham tanks, and airfields. One British soldier even imitated the British General Montgomery, to trick the Germans into believing that the sham invasion was real.
Pujol was nervous throughout the run-up to D-Day. He would walk the parks of central London, passing by the American G.I.'s and their British girlfriends, knowing that many of them would live or die by the lights of his acting skills. (He should have been nervous: a 1943 dress rehearsal for the landings had resulted in a total failure of the deception plan and the deaths of hundreds of French civilians). Araceli, his partner who'd helped him create Garbo, was lonely and jealous; he spent too much time with Harris, not enough with her. His marriage was breaking up.
But when the invasion came, the plot to deceive Hitler was a tremendous success. Months later, the Führer was still holding back some of his best panzer divisions, still believing that Garbo's million-man army would appear at Calais. One message that Garbo sent on June 9th was seen by the Führer and became the key factor in keeping some of the best German divisions away from Normandy. When he met Thomas Harris, General Eisenhower told him: “Your work with Mr. Pujol most probably amounts to the equivalent of a whole army division. You have saved a lot of lives.”
The other reviews were equally strong. The British spy Anthony Blount called Pujol's work “the greatest double cross operation of the war.” But the British historian Roger Fleetwood-Hesketh put it best: “It couldn't have been done without him… It was Garbo's message…which changed the course of the battle in Normandy.” Garbo emerged from D-Day as the greatest double-agent of the war, perhaps of all time.
After his services were no longer needed—MI5 tried to “sell” him to the Soviets but the traitor Kim Philby nixed the deal—Pujol and Araceli escaped to Venezuela with their small children. His attempts to start a new life ended in failure and misery. His business plans came to nothing, and Araceli left him and took the kids back to Madrid, where she married an American entrepreneur, a former body double for Rudolf Valentino. Pujol had to start from scratch. He eventually lost contact with his children by Araceli. They wouldn't be reunited until nearly four decades later, when Pujol reemerged for the 40th anniversary of D-Day, much to the astonishment of his sons and daughter, who thought he'd died in Angola of malaria.
If Pujol had followed his talents to their natural ends, he would have become one of the great scam artists. A Bernie Madoff type. But in reading his private letters in Madrid, I was able to see why this never happened. Pujol's operatic gift for the flimflam was paired with a set of ideals that he described in his private letters (always capitalizing the first letter) as “Humanist.” It's an old-fashioned term, not used much anymore, but Pujol believed in it single-mindedly.
In other words, he enjoyed the game for its own sake, but he limited his victims to the Nazis. We're lucky, in more ways that one, that this was the case.
Does this mean it's no longer racist to oppose her nomination as Secretary of State? Or, since she's now admitting her mistake, does this mean it's really racist to oppose her nomination as Secretary of State?
I'm sure the left will tell us when the time is right.
Today, Acting CIA Director Michael Morell and I met with Senators McCain, Graham, and Ayotte to discuss my September 16th public comments regarding the attack against the U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya, and the intelligence assessments that formed the basis for those comments. I appreciated the opportunity to discuss these issues directly and constructively with them. In the course of the meeting, we explained that the talking points provided by the intelligence community, and the initial assessment upon which they were based, were incorrect in a key respect: there was no protest or demonstration in Benghazi. While we certainly wish that we had had perfect information just days after the terrorist attack, as is often the case, the intelligence assessment has evolved. We stressed that neither I nor anyone else in the Administration intended to mislead the American people at any stage in this process, and the Administration updated Congress and the American people as our assessments evolved. The Administration remains committed to working closely with Congress as we thoroughly investigate the terrorist attack in Benghazi and bring to justice the terrorists responsible for the tragic deaths of our colleagues, Ambassador Chris Stevens, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods. We also look forward to the findings of the Accountability Review Board and the FBI investigation.
The White House press corps got Carney to say the magic words this afternoon too. For what it's worth, Rice's statement does jibe with what U.S. intel officials told the Wall Street Journal last month about what she knew and when. If you believe them, the first intelligence inklings that the whole “protest” storyline was crapola came on the evening of Saturday, September 15th, hours before Rice appeared on the Sunday shows to talk Benghazi. That Sunday morning, while she was making the rounds on TV, they collected more intel further debunking the protest claims. But then that raises other questions, which the Journal framed at the time:
Unanswered in the account is whose role it was to prevent Ms. Rice from broadcasting information that already risked being wrong. Also unanswered is why it took longer for the new information to come out publicly, even after the DNI revised its assessment.
Let me throw another one at you. Why was U.S. intelligence still leaning towards the protest theory on Sunday, September 16th, when a Libyan guard who was wounded in the consulate attack had already told McClatchy three days earlier that there had never been any protest? All they had to do was read the newspaper that Friday to realize the narrative they were handing Rice was in doubt. And here's a fourth question, which I believe remains unanswered even now: How did the idea that there had been a protest over the Mohammed movie at the consulate get started in the first place? Was it just a matter of U.S. intel officials watching what happened in Cairo and blindly leaping to the conclusion that the same thing must have happened in Benghazi or was there actual circumstantial evidence of a protest at some point? The only evidence I've heard of after months of reading about this came from an AP story on October 27, in which an eyewitness claimed that one of the jihadis at the scene had pressured bystanders to chant about the movie while his crew was busy setting up roadblocks for the attack. The “spontaneous protest,” in other words, was propaganda manufactured by terrorists at the scene as the plot was being put in motion, but maybe the CIA heard about the chanting from another eyewitness and hadn't yet figured out who was behind it when Rice was briefed. Is that the explanation? Or, as I say, was this pure half-assed guesswork early on, which they nonetheless dutifully passed along to Susan Rice for dissemination on America's news shows?
Anyway, there are lots of reasons not to want her as Secretary of State even if you think her main failing in the Benghazi affair was being too willing to believe what the CIA was feeding her. Exit quotation from Dan McLaughlin:
It's hilarious that people who spent 8 years calling Colin Powell & Condi Rice liars now say it's racist to accuse a diplomat of lying. — Dan McLaughlin (@baseballcrank) November 27, 2012
Update: Jay Carney's sick and tired of Obama's flacks and mouthpieces being beaten up by the press, darn it:
White House Press Secretary Jay Carney grew testy with reporters Tuesday over questions about UN Ambassador Susan Rice's role in the aftermath of the Benghazi attack. “What is the point of the focus on this,” Carney asked of questions about Rice's comments on the five Sunday shows days after the September 11, 2012 attack that killed four Americans signaling it was a spontaneous event. “It could have been me. We all relied on information from the intelligence community.”… “What your question seems to suggest is that it is more important that I or others used talking points provided by the intelligence community than actually what happened in Benghazi,” Carney said.
Over in the Greenroom, Duane Patterson has some questions for the administration's much-maligned spokespeople.
The controversial cop who said he was thrown in a psych ward for blowing the whistle on a quota system in the NYPD settled his case Tuesday for $600,000.
Adrian Schoolcraft had sued the city for a whopping $50 million in 2010 for his alleged unlawful detention at Jamaica Hospital.
He said his brothers in blue waged a campaign of harassment against him after he blew the whistle on cops using arrest quotas and fudging crime stats at the 81st Precinct covering Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.
Schoolcraft's claims against the hospital and two doctors still stand.
The case is to go to trial in Oct. 19, though that schedule could change in light of the deal.
The settlement includes backpay and benefits from Oct. 31, 2009 — the date Schoolcraft was hauled to Jamaica Hospital — through the end of 2015, filings show.
A source said the backpay and benefits will make Schoolcraft's settlement in excess of $1 million and that it's highly likely he will retire from the force.
He remains suspended without pay.
Schoolcraft had said his own brothers in blue barged into his Queens home and declared him an emotionally disturbed person on Halloween 2009 because he'd blow the whistle.
The alleged architect of his detention was Stephen Mauriello, his commanding officer at the 81st Precinct who is now a deputy inspector.
Mauriello's attorney Walter Kretz his client wasn't happy about the settlement because he wanted the whole story to be told at trial. Schoolcraft secretly recorded Mauriello discussing crime stats.
“He is disappointed but he accepts the city's decision,” Kretz said.
“I don't think the real story of what happened here has ever been told. The tapes have been misconstrued. He can defend everything he said on them.”
He said his client has no comment.
“Mauriello just looks forward to continuing what was a promising career before Schoolcraft interfered,” Kretz said.
Mauriello is now stationed in Bronx transit.
Departmental charges against Mauriello for manipulating crime statistics at the 81st Precinct are still pending — five years after they were first reported by the Daily News.
Recent filings had indicated the trial could be a brutal one in which the city assailed Schoolcraft's credibility by attacking his father, among other tactics.
Schoolcraft attorney Nat Smith declined to comment citing the ongoing case against Jamaica Hospital.
“We are pleased that we were able to reach a just and fair resolution of this dispute with Adrian Schoolcraft,” a city Law Department spokesman said.
“The settlement should not be construed as an admission that the City or any City employee engaged in wrongdoing. We believe this settlement is in the best interests of the city.”

Late on Thursday, a 28-year-old from the Vanniyar community from Vengampatti died as a result of an alleged assault by a group of Dalit youth in Mallur town panchayat.
The New Indian Express reports that the incident took place in Ambedkar Nagar and five Dalit youth have been taken into custody.
Now, the police have reportedly deployed 400 personnel to prevent any further incidents.
The Mallur police have told media that there was an alleged clash between the Vanniyars and Dalits during the Mariamman temple festival on Wednesday. This temple is located in a village dominated by Vanniyars and some Dalit youth had come from Ambedkar Nagar to attend the festival. They reportedly teased a Vanniyar girl which led to a fight and the police at the temple intervened and sorted it out.
The daily reports that on Thursday night at around 10 pm, a group of about 50 Vanniyars from Vengampatti went to Ambedkar Nagar and threw stones at some houses. Post that, around 100 Dalits got together and hit back. But they managed to catch B Karthick and assaulted with stones and weapons. He is stated to have died on the spot.
Salem Range DIG Nagarajan and SP Amit Kumar Singh immediately went there and then sent Karthick's body to the Salem Government Hospital for a postmortem. The police managed to catch five out of the seven youth who assaulted him.
David Brooks writes a pro-Marco-Rubio column, and in passing says this:
At this stage it's probably not sensible to get too worked up about the details of any candidate's plans. They are all wildly unaffordable. What matters is how a candidate signals priorities.
It won't surprise you to learn that I disagree deeply. My experience is that the best way to figure out a candidate's true priorities — and his or her character — is to look hard at policy proposals.
My view here is strongly influenced by the story of George W. Bush. Younger readers may not know or remember how it was back in 2000, but back then the universal view of the commentariat was that W was a moderate, amiable, bluff and honest guy. I was pretty much alone taking his economic proposals — on taxes and Social Security — seriously. And what I saw was a level of dishonesty and irresponsibility, plus radicalism, that was unprecedented in a major-party presidential candidate. So I was out there warning that Bush was a bad, dangerous guy no matter how amiable he seemed.
How did that work out?
So now we have candidates proposing “wildly unaffordable” tax cuts. Can we start by noting that this isn't a bipartisan phenomenon, that it's not true that everyone does it? Hillary Clinton isn't proposing wildly unaffordable stuff; Bernie Sanders hasn't offered details about how he'd pay for single-payer, but you can be sure that he would propose something. And proposing wildly unaffordable stuff is itself a declaration of priorities: Rubio is saying that keeping the Hair Club for Growth happy is more important to him than even a pretense of fiscal responsibility. Or if you like, what we've seen is a willingness to pander without constraint or embarrassment.
Also, his insistence that the magic of supply-side economics would somehow pay for the cuts is a further demonstration of priorities: allegiance to voodoo trumps all.
At a more general level, I'd argue that it's a really bad mistake to wave away policy silliness with a boys-will-be-boys attitude. Policy proposals tell us a lot about character — and the history of the past 15 years says that journalists who imagine that they can judge character from the way people come across on TV or in personal interviews are kidding themselves, and misleading everyone else.
Iowa –-(Ammoland.com)- By now you've probably heard, House File 517 breezed through the House last Tuesday on a 58-39 vote. This means HF517, the biggest pro-Second Amendment bill in state history, is now in the Iowa Senate. Our bill has been assigned to the Senate Judiciary Committee and a three-person subcommittee consisting of Senators Dan Dawson, Janet Peterson and Brad Zaun. This is very good news.
As we've told you before, Senator Zaun is staunch supporter of the Second Amendment and long time ally of the Iowa Firearms Coalition. Senator Dawson is new to the Iowa Senate (he's the man who replaced Mike Gronstal) and is a major supporter of gun owner's rights and has been a big advocate for our bill in the Senate. Both Zaun and Dawson made time to come over to the House and watch the debate on HF517 last Tuesday. Senator Dawson stayed and observed the entire 4+ hour debate. That's extremely encouraging.
When will they vote? At this point it's impossible to tell, nothing is on the schedule yet. Though both Zaun and Dawson have assured us this will not get brushed aside. We could see movement on HF517 in the Senate as early as this week, so be ready to take action on short notice.
Who Voted YES
Please take a moment and send a quick thank you to the 58 Republicans and Democrats who voted YES on HF517. Here's the list of House members Who Voted YES on HF517.
Thank you to all of you who took time to reach out to your representatives. Representative Scott Ourth, a Democrat, recently explained why he broke ranks with many of his fellow Democrats and voted YES on HF517:
“I got hundreds emails and phone calls urging me to vote “yes” and hardly any asking me to resist.”
Because of you and the thousands like you who took the time to send emails and make phone calls Rep. Ourth voted yes on our bill. This proves it yet again, your time and effort are not in vain. Keep up the good work, we're not done yet!
2A Day a SUCCESS!
Big shout out to all of you who took time to join us in the capitol for Second Amendment Day 2017! We had a great turnout of at least 120 people (note: these are all voting age Iowans -not minors- who are unpaid and took time off work to join us). We booked a large private room in the capitol so that we could have a number of speakers join us, unfortunately the room was too small to hold everyone, we had more than 30 people lined up outside the door trying to get in.​​​​​​
We're extremely pleased (and proud) to report that everything went smoothly. We had a great crowd. Everyone in attendance did an outstanding job of representing IFC and gun owners everywhere. And we got to see the House vote on a historic pro-gun owner bill.
We're already planning on doing this again next year so please make plans to join us for Second Amendment Day 2018!
Forums
Don't forget, your legislators hold town hall meetings and forums regularly. Right now they're getting bombarded by anti-gunners. It's critical that these lawmakers hear from Iowans like you. We need to make sure we're balancing out the gun control arguments and making it abundantly clear that a majority of Iowans like you want their right to keep and bear arms protected and enhanced. State legislator forum schedule
While you've got your calendar out, Senator Joni Ernst is holding a pair of town meetings in Cedar Rapids and in Des Moines this Friday. If you can, please get to her meeting and speak up about the Second Amendment! Senator Joni Ernst forums
More updates to come, thanks for supporting the Iowa Firearms Coalition
Samsung Electronics announced today that it has appointed Boo-keun Yoon and J.K. Shin as co-CEOs following its annual shareholders meeting. That means the Korean tech giant now has three CEOs: Oh-Hyun Kwon will continue on as CEO and chairman of Samsung's board of directors.
Yoon will stay in his current role of overseeing Samsung's consumer electronics division, which includes TV and appliance products, while Shin will remain in charge of the company's IT and mobile communications division. Samsung's mobile business became the world's number one smartphone seller in 2011 under Shin's leadership.
Fresh from unveiling the Galaxy S4 in New York City, Shin afterwards gave an interview to the Wall Street Journal, in which he said that he's not satisfied with Samsung's smartphone market share in the U.S. and that the company is seeing “lackluster demand” for Window-based products in Europe.
In its statement, Samsung said that “the new leadership structure will serve to clarify and enhance independent management of the two set divisions, as well as the independent management of the set and component businesses.”
While having three chief operating officers might seem a little unwieldy, it makes sense for a company that is responsible for one-fifth of South Korean's $1.1 trillion economy. It's also worthwhile to note that five years ago, Samsung Electronics underwent a leadership crisis after Samsung Group chairman Lee Kun-hee was involved in a bribery scandal, with Samsung Life Insurance chairman Lee Soo-bin saying at the time that “without a captain or rudder, Samsung now faces a complex crisis, with each unit meeting cut-throat competition independently.” Making the heads of Samsung's different departments work closely together might be a move to prevent potential fractures in the leadership. (Lee Kun-hee, whose father Lee Byung-chull founded Samsung in 1938, remains in his current position as the boss of everyone.)
This presidential election has the country captivated. As many commentators have pointed out, the primaries are more focused on personalities than policy. While the parties focus on who is going to represent them in the fall, I want to make the case for something that I hope every candidate will agree on in November: America's unparalleled capacity for innovation. When the United States invests in innovation, it creates companies and jobs at home, makes Americans healthier and safer, and saves lives and fights poverty in the world's poorest countries. It offers the next president a tremendous opportunity to help people in America and around the world.
Bill Gates will be joining Reuters' Editor-in-Chief Stephen J. Adler for an exclusive Newsmaker interview on innovation at 3 p.m. ET.
Of course, America's capacity for innovation is nothing new. We have been inventing for more than two centuries: think of Benjamin Franklin, Margaret Knight, Thomas Edison. By the end of World War Two, the United States led the world in automobiles, aerospace, electronics, medicine, and other areas. Nor is the formula for success complicated: Government funding for our world-class research institutions produces the new technologies that American entrepreneurs take to market.
What is new is that more countries than ever are competing for global leadership, and they know the value of innovation. Since 2000, South Korea's research and development spending (measured as a percentage of GDP) has gone up 90 percent. China's has doubled. The United States' has essentially flatlined. It's great that the rest of the world is committing more, but if the United States is going to maintain its leading role, it needs to up its game.
I have seen first-hand the impact that this type of research can have. I was lucky enough to be a student when computers came along in the 1960s. At first they were very expensive, so it was hard to get access to them. But the microchip revolution, made possible by U.S. government research, completely changed that. Among other things it enabled Microsoft, the company I co-founded, to write software that made computers an invaluable tool for productivity. Later, the Internet — another product of federal research — changed the game again. It is no accident that today most of the top tech companies are still based in the United States, and their advances will have a massive impact in every area of human activity.
My favorite example is health. America's investment in this area creates high-paying jobs at universities, biotech companies, and government labs. It leads to new treatments for disease, such as cancer therapies. It helps contain deadly epidemics like Ebola and Zika. And it saves lives in poor countries. Since 1990, the fraction of children who die before age 5 has fallen by more than half. I think that's the greatest statistic of all time, and the United States deserves a lot of credit for making it happen.
The next few years could bring even more progress. With a little luck we could eradicate polio, a goal that is within reach because of vaccines developed by U.S. scientists. (Polio would be the second disease ever eradicated, after smallpox in 1979 — in which the United States also played an irreplaceable role.) There is also exciting progress on malaria: The number of deaths dropped more than 40 percent from 2000 to 2012, thanks in part to America's support for breakthrough tools like drugs and bed nets. But to make the most of these opportunities, we need to invest more in basic health research and specific areas like vaccines.
Energy is another great example. American-funded research defines the state of the art in energy production. Early advances in wind and solar technology were developed with federal money. And this research offers a strong return on investment. Between 1978 and 2000, the Department of Energy spent $17.5 billion (in today's dollars) on research on efficiency and fossil fuels, yielding $41 billion in economic benefits. Yet, until this year, the DOE's research budget hadn't seen a real increase since the Reagan administration.
If we step up these investments, we can create new jobs in the energy sector and develop the technologies that will power the world — while also fighting climate change, promoting energy independence, and providing affordable energy for the 1.3 billion poor people who don't have it today. Some of the more promising areas include making fuel from solar energy, much the way plants do; making nuclear energy safer and more affordable; capturing and storing carbon; and creating new ways to store energy that let us make the most of the renewables.
There's a lot of momentum right now on clean energy research. Last year, the leaders of 20 countries, including the United States, committed to double federal investments in this area. Complementing that crucial effort, I helped launch the Breakthrough Energy Coalition, a group of private investors who will back promising clean-energy companies. The next president will have a chance to accelerate this momentum.
Investing in R&D isn't about the government picking winners and losers. The markets will do that. It's about doing what we know works: making limited and targeted investments to lay a foundation for America's entrepreneurs. This approach has been fundamental to U.S. leadership for decades, and it will become only more important in the years ahead.
By the end of this summer, the political parties will have chosen their leaders and will start looking ahead to the November election. The nominees will lay out their vision for America and their agenda for achieving it. These visions will probably have more differences than similarities. But I hope we can all agree that, no matter how you see America's future, there will always be an essential role for innovation.
Leicester City defender Christian Fuchs is not worried about doubters continuously writing the club off this season.
Claudio Ranieri's men are an incredible three points clear at the top of the Premier League table, just twelve months after they were fighting for survival.
Many have expected to see Leicester fall of the pace, but after a run of poor results they managed to pick up an important win against Stoke City on Saturday and reclaim top spot in the table.
"We've broken this cycle of results so we're all happy and it was an important three points against Stoke," he told the Leicester Mercury.
"We're solid and we believe in ourselves. We are a really good team on the field and you guys can keep waiting, we will try to keep winning.
"People writing us off isn't a topic for us.
"We know there's a lot of writing about us outside the club and the press can talk and assume things but we focus on our work and we do it well."
Leicester's next run of games get a little more difficult, however, hosting Liverpool before away trips against Arsenal and Manchester City.
Liverpool (0-1) and Arsenal (2-5) are Leicester's only two losses in the league this season, and Fuchs says the side are prepared to get their revenge.
"We've got three games against big teams and they are important," he said.
"We want to win against Liverpool and the defeat to Arsenal was one of our worst games.
"It was our biggest defeat of the season and we want to win there. I don't see the game as Arsenal as a title decider.
"We're just having fun, we keep winning at the moment and we try to do our best."
The cousin of Qatar's foreign minister has been convicted of funding international terrorism and is believed to be linked to an alleged terrorist known as the “Wolf of al-Qaeda”.
Abdulaziz bin Khalifa al-Attiyah was found guilty in absentia by a Lebanese court of channelling financial support to al-Qaeda.
He was detained in Lebanon – apparently following a tip-off by British and American intelligence – but was allowed to leave the country before his trial after intense pressure by Qatar on the Lebanese government.
On social media, al-Attiyah appears to have energetically supported Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda's Syria franchise, the al-Nusra Front.
He also appears to have tweeted support for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil.)
The al-Nusra Front last year instructed donors to channel money to it through an organisation closely linked to al-Attiyah.
Al-Attiyah is also associated with Umar al-Qatari, known as the “Wolf of al-Qaeda”. Al-Qatari was named last month by the United States government as a designated terrorist.
In a brief statement, lawyers for al-Attiyah insisted that he had not funded terrorism.
However, they repeatedly refused to deny that he had been arrested and convicted for doing so in Lebanon or that he had written pro-terrorist messages on social media.
The lawyers declined to respond to any further questions about him, despite repeated requests over several days.
Al-Attiyah's conviction, in June, brings the funding of terrorism closer to the heart of the Qatari government and will increase the growing pressure on the country to end its role as a centre for the funding of global jihad.
The tiny Gulf sheikhdom has been accused of financing terrorist groups directly, which it denies, and of allowing terrorist funders to operate freely from its soil.
David Weinberg, of the US-based Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, said: “Mr al-Attiyah's case appears to show another instance of Qatar's government taking the side of an alleged terror financier to the dismay of the international community in our fight against groups like Isis [another name for Isil] and al-Qaeda.”
Al-Attiyah is a former member of the Qatar Olympic Committee and is closely related to the country's ruling elite.
One of his cousins is Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyah, Qatar's former energy minister and deputy prime minister, who now heads the country's “administrative control and transparency agency” in charge of enforcement against money-laundering and terrorist funding.
Another of his cousins is Khalid bin Mohammed al-Attiyah, the foreign minister, who insisted this month that Qatar “does not support in any way the radical groups who are terrorising innocent citizens”.
Khalid bin Mohammed al-Attiyah was to have been a guest on BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show last week as Qatar went on the offensive following criticism of the country's failure to crack down on terrorist financing.
However, he did not appear after The Telegraph put a series of questions about his cousin to Qatari government representatives.
The al-Attiyah family comes from the same tribal lineage as the ruling al-Thani family, the Bani Tamim, and is described as “without doubt the second most prominent clan in Qatar today.”
In her book, Oil and Politics in the Gulf, Jill Crystal, professor of politics at Auburn University in the US, described the al-Attiyahs' position as “once near-equal to the al-Thanis.”
The first message that appeared on al-Attiyah's Twitter account, on May 14 last year, was an image mourning the death of a Qatari al-Qaeda fighter who had been killed in Syria.
In July and August that year, he appears to have written or retweeted messages calling on God to “have mercy on our sheikh, Abu Abdallah,” another name for Osama bin Laden. The messages included pictures of bin Laden.
At around the same time, al-Attiyah co-presented a fundraising video for the Qatar-based Mahdid Ahl al-Sham Campaign, which sought donations to arm jihadis in Syria.
In August 2013, al-Qaeda's Syrian franchise, the al-Nusra Front, instructed Qataris to donate to it via the Mahdid Ahl al-Sham Campaign. The instruction was given from an official Twitter account controlled by al-Nusra.
In May 2012, al-Attiyah was detained in Lebanon, accused of channelling financial support to an al-Qaeda cell raising funds for Syria.
According to a variety of Lebanese media reports, al-Attiyah met and paid thousands of dollars to two men subsequently designated by the US government as global terrorists — Umar al-Qatari, known as the “Wolf of al-Qaeda,” and Shadi al-Mawlawi, another al-Qaeda operative.
Al-Qatari told investigators that he had travelled to Lebanon to meet al-Attiyah, who was apparently in the country for medical treatment.
He said he had received $20,000 (£12,500) from the “Qatari sheikh,” according to Lebanese newspapers.
He said that al-Attiyah had supported him to raise funds for Syrian jihadists.
Al-Qatari was arrested at Beirut airport as he tried to leave, complete with “thousands of dollars intended for al-Qaeda”, according to the US Treasury Department. He remains in prison in Lebanon to this day.
The American government describes him as a man with a “long history of raising funds for al-Qaeda.”
By contrast, al-Attiyah did not remain under Lebanese detention for long.
On May 23, 2012, the media office of the Lebanese Armed Forces republished an article by a local newspaper, al-Akhbar, saying that “Lebanese authorities had conceded to Qatari pressure to release detained Qatari citizen Abd al-Aziz al-Attiyah”.
His passport was returned and he was allowed to leave the country. According to some reports, the Qatari government threatened to expel 30,000 Lebanese citizens from the country unless al-Attiyah was released.
In early June 2014, al-Attiyah was sentenced in his absence to seven years in jail for “belonging to an armed terrorist organisation and conspiring against state institutions with the purpose of altering the structure of the Lebanese state,” and for “financing terrorist groups and the introduction of weapons to Syria delivered through rebels”.
During the proceedings, the military court judge asked for al-Attiyah to be brought before the court, but was told that he “possesses diplomatic immunity and was released to his country several days after his arrest in May 2012”, according to Lebanese media reports.
Al-Attiyah also appears to have expressed sympathy for Isil, also known as the Islamic State. In a tweet dated June 20 last year, he wrote: “We are all the (State) in Iraq, and we are all (al-Nusra) in Sham [Syria].”
Last month, The Telegraph launched the Stop the Funding of Terror campaign, calling for action to cut the flow of funding from states such as Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia to extremists.
A series of investigations disclosed that Gulf states with major trade links to Britain have been allegedly “turning a blind eye” to the financing of jihadists, including via individuals with close links to the ruling regimes.
In the case of Qatar, which owns Harrods and co-owns the Shard in London, at least seven extremists connected to the Gulf state have been hit by US sanctions.
But only two have been hit with similar sanctions by Britain.
Qatar has insisted that as a state it does not fund terrorism. In his first interview last month, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, the Emir of Qatar, said: “We don't fund extremists. If you talk about certain movements, especially in Syria and Iraq, we all consider them terrorist movements.”
He added: “I know that in America and some countries they look at some movements as terrorist movements … But there are differences.
"In some countries some people thought that any group with an Islamic background were terrorists and we don't accept that.”
The US has an airbase in Qatar and the Gulf state has formed part of the coalition forces taking part in air strikes against Isil.
Lawyers for Abdulaziz al-Attiyah insisted last week that he had not funded terrorism, describing the claim as “completely untrue” but they refused, despite days of repeated questioning, to discuss the court case or social media messages, or to respond to further inquiries.
THE KILLER ROBOT
Ask any bystander on the street what “killer robots” are and you'd probably hear something out of the “Terminator” series. The fear of autonomous machines killing humans is so ingrained in society that some organizations have made it their mission to ban these terrifying creations.
But researchers are questioning whether banning killer robots is worth it. They found the problem isn't killer robots themselves, but how society — particularly military organizations like The Pentagon — are enabling and researching violent robots, according to a new study from the SUNY University at Buffalo.
“Instead of demonizing Killer Robots as such, we need to understand the tools, processes and operating procedures that create, support and validate these objects,” the researchers said.
Co-author Tero Karppi, a professor of media study, warned how “we have to deconstruct the term ‘killer robot' into smaller cultural techniques.”
After nearly a month in Samoa – a country we fell in love with – we reveal five incredibly surprising facts about Samoa we learned during our stay.
surprising facts about Samoa
If you were asked to name the most religious countries in the world, chances are your list would be similar to mine. Saudi Arabia and Pakistan would be up there as would Brazil and Italy. In the spectrum from Saudi to Sweden, I would put Samoa somewhere in the middle, especially in relation to the Abrahamic religions. Turns out, I'd be wrong.
When we journeyed from Samoa's main airport to its capital, Apia, on a Sunday evening, we came across more than 40 men in high-visibility jackets lining the roads of the villages. The driver explained that between 6pm and 7pm, these men ‘guard' the villages against outsiders so that the residents can pray. Any cars driving past must do so quickly and quietly or they risk having stones thrown at them. Surprised by the zealousness, I asked if it happened every Sunday or if it was a special occasion. He met my eyes in the mirror and said: “Every day.”
At first I thought it was a lone brave soul working for a particularly open-minded employer. Dressed in women's clothes, he had on a full face of makeup with groomed brows and shaven skin while serving customers at a retail store. And then I saw another man dressed in a similar way – and another one.
I soon came to learn that these men were Fa'afafine, a third gender that has been recognised and accepted in Samoan society since at least the early 20th century. Fa'afafine are born male but live as women. They do not identify as ‘gay' but do engage in relationships with other men who, incidentally, are not Fa'afafine themselves and who also don't identify as gay (more info here).
One of the most surprising facts about Samoa is that it seems that Samoan concepts of sexuality are rather complex. Either way, it's heartening to see that the Fa'afafine can coexist with the population's deeply religious mindset.
(Image: tattoosforyou.org)
Over half the Samoan population is obese, according to the CIA's World Factbook. This alarming fact isn't solely caused by genetic disposition or indeed pure gluttony, but a historical belief that obesity is a symbol of health, wealth and happiness [1, 2]. It is said that, historically, village chiefs (matai) were fed the most in terms of quantity and quality and thus obesity came to be seen as a symbol of status.
This was exacerbated by Western colonisation when the ability to purchase and consume imported products – usually of low nutritional value – came to signify prosperity [3, 4]. Locals tell us that attitudes have been changing for the better, especially as government initiatives to educate the population take hold. This will hopefully lead to a reversal in the current trend.
The woman tugged the sleeve of my shirt. In the jam-packed aisle of the bus, I turned to her gingerly. She pointed at her lap and asked if I wanted to sit. Taken aback, I politely declined. Half an hour later when I finally managed to bag a seat, I found myself next to a father and his daughter to whom I smiled hello. After a few stops the man stood and, without a word, left the bus. I realised that they were not father and daughter but two strangers (if there can be such a thing in Samoa). It was both surprising and heartening.
Buses in Savai'i, Samoa's second main island, are basically a perpetual reconfiguration of the seating plan: people stand, sit, offer their laps and switch seats to get the maximum number of people on the bus and, where humanly possible, sitting comfortably. It's a stark contrast to London where even the elderly and pregnant struggle for seating.
From independence in 1962 all the way to 1990, only Samoa's matai (holders of family chief titles) were allowed to vote. This meant that only about 9% of the general population had any say in the governance of their country. The state of affairs has clearly progressed but, to this day, only matai can run for government precluding large swathes of the population.
Considering the country's relatively progressive approach to a number of things, surely one of the most conflicting facts about Samoa is that they are so traditionalist, or perhaps downright unprogressive, when it comes to democracy.

Among Canadian households with internet access, 96 per cent had a high-speed connection in 2010, a Statistics Canada survey suggests. ((Toby Talbot/Associated Press)) About a fifth of Canadian households, many among the poorest in the country, still had no internet access in 2010, a survey suggests.
Forty-six per cent of households falling in the lowest income quarter — those earning $30,000 or less — had no internet access, according to Statistics Canada's 2010 Internet Use Survey, released Wednesday.
But in the highest income quarter — made up of households earning $87,000 or more — only three per cent lacked internet access, the survey indicates.
Lack of interest or need was the reason cited by a majority — 56 per cent — of the households that had no internet access.
Cost of service or equipment was next (20 per cent), followed by no access to a device such as a computer to connect to the internet (15 per cent), and a lack of confidence, knowledge or skills (12 per cent).
Households with three or more people or with at least one child or adolescent were far more likely to have internet access (93 per cent) than one-person households (58 per cent), the survey found.
Lowest in N.B., highest in B.C.
Across the country, households in New Brunswick were the least likely (70 per cent) to have internet access, while those in B.C. were the most likely (84 per cent). The trend appears despite the fact that a 2009 study by the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission found high-speed internet access was available throughout New Brunswick, and less widely available in B.C.
Homes in urban areas were more likely (81 per cent) to have internet access than homes in rural areas (71 per cent), where the availability of internet service is often limited and the cost is typically higher than in urban areas.
Among households with internet access, 96 per cent said they had a high-speed connection.
"This means that, among all Canadian households, about three-quarters reported home high-speed internet access in 2010," said a Statistics Canada statement.
More than half (54 per cent) of households with internet used more than one device to connect.
Desktop (71 per cent) and laptop (64 per cent) computers were still the main source of connectivity, but 35 per cent of households used a wireless device such as a smartphone or tablet and 20 per cent used a video game console to access the internet.
Statistics Canada's survey of 30,000 households was conducted in October and November. Because the survey was redesigned for 2010, the results can't be compared with previous surveys. The survey also included questions about Canadians' online behaviours, and the results of that portion will be released later in the year.
In May, the CRTC announced that it wanted all households to have access to internet download speeds of at least five megabits per second by 2012.
China‘s censors are working hard to make sure its citizens don't see a sci-fi movie about the demise of Hong Kong.
A seven-minute short in the vein of Armageddon or Deep Impact, “Hong Kong Will Be Destroyed After 33 Years” depicts a universe in which an asteroid is headed straight for the city, making it a ticking time bomb.
It's a not-too-subtle metaphor for real life. In 2047, Hong Kong, formerly a British colony and currently a semi-autonomous region in China, is scheduled to have to harmonize its laws with the mainland.
YouTube has long been banned outright in China. But Internet users in China say that normally accessible video sites, like YouTube equivalent YouKu, delete the video after it's uploaded. And while search engine Baidu does list the video among its results, most of those pages have since been deleted. One version, hosted at umelook.com, does load, but Anthony Tao, founder of the China-centric blog Beijing Cream, told the Daily Dot that it won't work for him.
Something of a satire, the video shows Hong Kong residents initially unworried by their impending doom. They see it as a way to save money on rent, an excuse to get mad at the stock market, or flat-out avoiding dealing with the inevitable.
By the end, our narrator helps create a giant laser to destroy the asteroid just before it's too late. Is that just the film choosing a happy ending? Is it encouraging Hong Kongers to rebel against the mainland? A brief clip does show Leung Kwok-hung, perhaps Hong Kong's most visible anti-mainland political activist.

A David Douglas School District employee pleaded not guilty last week to accusations of trying to take a photo and video of a woman in a Troutdale sports bar bathroom, according to court records.
Joshua R. Lockman, 30, is facing one count apiece of first-degree attempted invasion of personal privacy and driving under the influence of intoxicants, court records show. He's a night custodian at David Douglas High School, a district spokesman said, and has been on leave since June 13 -- two days after his arrest.
Lockman was arrested after he "allegedly was taking photos of women in the women's restroom" at Skyland Pub, Capt. Steve Alexander, a Multnomah County Sheriff's Office spokesman, said in an email. The case is still under investigation, Alexander said.
Lockman, a Troutdale resident, pleaded not guilty to both charges last Tuesday, court records show.
He works full time for the district, according to court records. He has worked for the district since September 2014, district spokesman Dan McCue said in an email.
Lockman was released from the Multnomah County Detention Center on his own recognizance the day he was arrested, according to jail records.
He's next scheduled to appear in court July 25, court records show.

- Jim Combs, from Issue #3 (March 2008)
The late 80′s and early 90′s where breakthrough years for classic gamers, the Sega Genesis had hit the market in 1989, SNK released the mind-blowing arcade perfect home console, Neo-Geo in 1990, the Nintendo Entertainment System was still going strong and in late August of 1989 one very nostalgic gaming system was released along side the Sega Genesis, the TurboGrafx-16 by NEC. Being 22 years old, one of my first memories as a gamer that I'm very fond of, was playing the TurboGrafx back in 1990 at our neighbors house. I still live in the same neighborhood and every time I drive by that house, memories of me eating Broccoli (monster trees I used to call them) dipped in a bowl of melted cheese while playing Keith Courage, Ninja Spirit, Bonk, Air Zonk and Splatterhouse among many others come rushing back. As a gamer, I'm very grateful for the TurboGrafx because originally the TurboGrafx was never intended to be released in the states…. let's pack our bags and find out what happened. Don't forget your tooth brush, Nintendo DS and oh yeah, your TurboExpress as we take a flight back in time to Japan.
From 1983 to 1987, Nintendo's Famicom was the system of choice in Japan and the most popular. Cruising on the success of the Famicom, Nintendo did not know what was about to hit…. the PC-Engine released by Hudson Soft and NEC. It's kind of Ironic actually because Hudson Soft who came up with the concept for the PC-Engine tried to sell it to Nintendo since they already had a relationship with Nintendo as their first Third Party Developer, developing games for the Famicom such as Lode Runner and Bomber Man. However, Nintendo turned Hudson Soft's concept down. So, Hudson Soft approached a very big name in the electronics world, NEC, and together they developed the PC-Engine, Hudson designed the system's graphics chip and they released it in late 1987.
Hudson Soft was founded in Sapporo, Japan on May 18th, 1973 by the Kudo brothers, Hiroshi and Yuji Kudo. Both being fascinated with trains, they restored a Steam Engine train that used to run nearby their house when they where kids. The Kudo brothers named their company after their favorite train called the Hudson locomotive. They started out as a small shop selling telecommunication devices and photographs. In 1975, they started to venture more into the electronic entertainment route by selling personal computer products and in 1978 started developing games. NEC which stands for Nippon Electric Company, was founded in 1898 by Kunihiko Iwadare and Takeshiro Maeda, spans a very long in depth history. NEC started Production, Sales and maintenance of Telephones and Switches and later went onto being a powerhouse in Super Computers. It was in 1987 that NEC broke into the home console market when approached by Hudson Soft.
Flashing Forward, The PC-Engine was billed as the first 16- bit console due to it's 8-Bit CPU combined with it's 8-Bit Graphics Chip, the colorful graphics contributed as well sporting 512 on screen colors. However, soon after the PC-Engine launched, NEC faced their main competition when Sega released their first 16-Bit System, the Mega Drive. No worries for NEC though, the PC-Engine remained on top and hundreds of games where released for it. Due to the major success of these two consoles in Japan, they where both released State side where they continued to duke it out.
Avoiding Godzilla's attack in Japan and landing safely back home in the good old USA, let's continue. In late August of 1989, both Sega and NEC released their systems, now known as the Sega Genesis and the NEC TurboGrafx-16 (Turbo for it's fast game play speed, Grafx for it's colorful graphics power and 16 for it's 16-bit graphics processor) in the states. Sega released the Genesis a day earlier than the TurboGrafx to get the 1up, in an attempt to beat NEC to the punch. Both systems entering into the market where competing with Nintendo who had 90 percent of the US market at the time. NEC crowned their own mascot to represent them, Bonk, the very lovable character who starred in his own adventures, going around smashing everything up with his noggin and fighting prehistoric creatures including a giant green dinosaur through 28 levels to save the princess. Bonk joined Sega's, Sony's and Nintendo's famous mascots (Sonic the Hedgehog, Crash Bandicoot and Mario).
The TG16 with an MSRP of $199.99, came bundled with one controller and Keith Courage In Alpha Zones Hu-Card, it is interesting to note that this game was named after NEC's Executive Vice President Keith Schaefer. The TG16 uses credit card sized game chips called Hu-Cards, also known as TurboChips. NEC also released the following accessories: The TurboTap allowing for up to five players for multi-player gaming, the TurboStick which is an arcade style controller and the TurboBooster which when hooked up to the back of the TG16 and once plugged into a Sound System, offered a very nice gaming experience. NEC and Hudson Soft released a total of 94 games in the States making it one of the easiest systems for collectors to attain a complete collection. On the contrary though, collectors will have their work cut out for them in finding the two rarest Turbo games, Bonk 3: Bonk's Big Adventure and Magical Chase. Both where released in 1993 during the end of the TurboGrafx-16′s run.
The TG16 was the first system in America to release an optional CD adds on called the TurboGrafx-CD, beating the Sega CD to the punch. Released a couple months after the TG16 launched, The TGCD which retailed for $399.99, plugged into the back of the TG16′s expansion port and once the TurboGrafx CD TurboChip is plugged into the TG16, you are ready to get your game on with the TurboCD's which featured more advance graphics and FMV sequences. For example, It Came From the Desert, featured live actors similar in fashion to Sega's Sewer Shark and Night Trap which where released after the TurboCD. TGCD games also featured beautiful animated sequences to tell the game's story, similar to the animated sequences in Sonic CD. The TGCD also has an upgrade TurboChip called the CD-Rom Super System Card, which allowed for 2 megabit power for faster game play compared to the 1 megabit line of games. Also when detached, the TGCD could be used as a CD player, however, it must still be plugged into a wall outlet.
In 1990, NEC released The TurboExpress, a favorite among fans. Competing head to head with Nintendo's Game Boy and Atari's Lynx handheld system, The TurboExpress retailed for $249.99 and played all the TurboChip games that could be played on it's parent system. A popular peripheral came out along side the TurboExpress, the $149.99 TurboVision, which plugged into the TurboExpress and allowed gamers to watch the good ol boob tube on their Express as well as play games. Some gamers who bought the TurboExpress experienced the missing pixel dilemma, something that happens at times with handhelds, even including the Game Boy Advance SP.
NEC didn't waste any time starting their marketing campaign once they where state side, releasing television commercials and magazines. From June/July 1990 to August/September 1992, Larry Flynt Publications released 14 Bi-Monthly issues, 32 pages in length, of TurboPlay Magazine which covered anything and everything Turbo. TurboForce was another publication at the time, that covered only the TurboCD games. Also released for Turbo fans, where VHS promo videos which talked all about the Turbo Grafx-16 Hu-Cards and CD games that where available to buy or coming soon, as well as the accessories that you where able to purchase. Amongst their marketing, NEC released some bad ass Tshirts. I saw a collector at the Classic Gaming Expo last year wearing an insanely cool Splatterhouse T-shirt, I wanted to jump him for it, but hey, I'm a nice guy.
Also, as a marketing move to help attract back those who where slowly starting to convert over to the Sega Genesis early in the game, NEC and Hudson Soft created a new software company called Turbo Technologies Inc. (TTI). As a result, they cut the prices on all their systems including the TG16, TGCD and the TurboExpress. On October 10th 1992, the TurboDuo was released for $299.99 under the newly founded TTI, to help generate a new fan base. The TurboDuo combined the TG16 and TGCD into one gaming unit, similar to the JVC X'Eye which played both Sega Genesis cartridges and Sega CD games.
After all was said and done and the war was over, the Sega Genesis turned out to be the system of choice in the states compared to the TG16. Mainly what happened was NEC had games developed exclusively in house by Hudson Soft and all the games had already been released in Japan, so they just ported them over to the states. Since the Japanese gaming market was different, American gamers did not always catch onto the Turbo games that where being ported over to the states from Japan. Sega on the other hand, had many third party developers and geared toward the American gamers including licensing such games as movie tie-in's with games like Cliffhanger and Hook for example. This attracted the TG16 buyers and brought them over to the Genesis side. NEC and Hudson Soft came into the states very strong and launched a system that is extremely fun to play and collect for. Just pop in a copy of Splatterhouse, Bonk or Ninja Spirit and you'll see what I'm talking about. TurboGrafx-16 “The Higher Energy Video Game System.”

THE first day of the Cambodia National Rescue Party's planned demonstrations kicked off this morning at the capital's Freedom Park with tens of thousands turning out to see party leaders Sam Rainsy and Kem Sokha.
Rainsy said today that the demonstrations, initially planned to be a three-day long event, would continue until election irregularities are properly investigated.
“The demonstrations will continue if our demands [for justice] are not met,” he told the roaring crowd this morning.
The Ministry of Interior has said the protests must end by 6pm today, raising the prospect of a possible forced removal this evening of demonstrators – many of whom are planning to camp out overnight.
Despite explosives being found in sensitive locations, including Freedom Park, on Saturday, the turnout this morning suggests ordinary Cambodians are not scared.
A festival-like atmosphere engulfed the park and its surrounding streets for most of the morning with the crowd, decked out in stickers and hats and bearing signs such as “Where is my vote?” and “Long live democracy”, joyously dancing following the leaders' speeches.
Many rural protestors said they had come to the capital in large convoys of buses and trucks.
Around noon, thousands followed Rainsy and Sokha in a march down Sothearos Boulevard towards the Royal Palace.
The CNRP leaders managed to slip through a barbed-wire checkpoint blocking the road near Wat Ounalom and were followed by protestors who toppled and dragged away the barricades as riot police loaded their tear gas canisters and looked on.
Following a short speech from Rainsy outside the palace, demonstrators were eventually ushered back down Sothearos Boulevard towards Wat Phnom by CNRP officials, who despite being able to control the crowd's movements, could not control their whoops and cheers in the face of stoic military and police officers.
Although a few isolated confrontations almost erupted between protestors and police at several barricades in the city centre, the actions of both CNRP youth leaders to defuse tensions and the calm response of police meant the first day of protests has thus far come off without serious incident.
The US government's emergency rescue of Citigroup offers a new model for bank bail-outs: explicitly insuring against losses on toxic assets, with taxpayers footing the bill.
The Citigroup plan extends the federal commitment beyond the previous framework of capital injections from the Treasury and credit from the Federal Reserve.
Now, the US is a partner in the performance of $US306 billion ($500 billion) in real-estate loans and securities, sharing losses beyond $US29 billion on what are likely to be some of Citigroups the worst holdings.
"Everybody and his brother has got to have their hand out now,'' said Eric Hovde, chief investment officer at Hovde Capital Advisors. "The whole problem is so much bigger and deeper than the Fed and Treasury ever understood.''
Taxpayers are likely to be at greater risk from the new template, which may be used to help more companies as debt writedowns continue to climb, analysts said.
Update: I made it into the top 30!!!! TTwTTI had loads of fun and learned a lot participating in this contest, and the absolutely mindblowing knowlege that freaking Justin "Lemongrab" Roiland looked at my drawing!!?? That's my prize right there. Absolutely acceptable!!My entry for the "Rick and Morty Interdimensionally Dysfunctional" season two kick off contest!I'm sorta nervously typing this as fast as I can as the deadline is in a little less than 3 hours, but I had an absolute blast doing this! I normally work traditionally, and I've done little digital things here and there, but this was my first time really trying to cram a lot of different techniques I've picked up over time into something more dynamic with a lot of different textures and things going on.When I started brainstorming I found that no matter which way I went, a little story couldn't help but emerge, which was pretty funny to imagine, especially in the characters voices with their personalities XDD - so here's the story:One day Beth goes into the garage where Rick is busy tinkering with one of his crazy inventions at his workstation, and proceeds to totally yell his ear off about the piles of beer bottles all over the place, in his ship, in the garage, you name it. He painfully agrees to clean up and Beth skeptically leaves. Conflicted with how into his project he is, and how much he doesn't want to interrupt his flow to clean, to he enlists the help of a Mr. Meseeks to do the job for him. He opens a portal with his portal gun and tells the Meseeks to just start cleaning up the pile in the corner of the garage - and not to ask any questions. Meseeks hops right to it enthusiastically as Meseeks do.Meanwhile in the driveway, skeptical Beth doesn't even give Rick a chance to clean at his own pace, in an impatient rage, she enlists the whole family to help her clear out Ricks ship.Back in the garage, Mr. Meseeks is on it, picking up the bottles in arm-fulls and tossing them in the portal, when suddenly the load he throws in just bounces right back out of the portal. Curious, he peeks inside, pushing a mound of clanky bottles out of his way. They tumble down a steep mountain of glass and empty bottles. As he looks up, Meseeks looks out on an alternate reality version of Earth that has been nuked to near desolation - other than the mountains and mountains of liquor bottles as far as the eye can see.Many years ago the Council of Alternate Ricks got together and came to an agreement, (after the collective bitching of all the alternate Beth's became too much to bear) that they would use this no longer habitable version of Earth as a mutual dumping ground. Over time an irradiated slime mold, using the tiny amounts of remaining alcohol at the bottom of the bottles as a food source, merge with the collective Rick's backwash DNA to form mountainous structures resembling Rick, and forming their own biological network of Rick/radioactive slime-mold/bottle monsters.After a moment of hesitation as to whether he should just leave the Meseeks to die, or rescue him, he remembers that Meseeks can only disappear when their purpose has been fulfilled, and in a rare moment of overwhelming guilt at the thought of little Meseeks having to live an eternity in a radioactive Rick-monster hellhole, he rushes to his ship.Seeing the whole family already in the ship and not having time to wait, as every second that goes by, Mr Meseeks is absorbing more and more radiation, Rick blasts a portal and goes in to save him with the whole family.Shenanigans ensue. There is a radioactivity shield - don't ask me how it works yet. XD I need say no more as this already embarrassingly long X3but yeah,Me and my husband have been big fans of Rick and Morty since pretty early into season 1. It's a phenomenal show with absolutely brilliant writing and creative execution, and never ceases to get a good laugh out of us!! That damn chunk of time between season 1 and 2 was long as fawk (but totally worth it.) and we had a hard time finding any shows that filled the same space in out hearts that were anywhere near as funny, so I'm glad season 2 is here!!Disclaimer#1: For any of my younger watchers under 18, I do not recommend you to watch this show, it is definitely intended for mature adults and deals with a lot of pretty heavy stuff not quite suitable for school age folk - just wait till you're older, it will be okay. :]Disclaimer#2: This is only a potential alternate Earth, not our good Earth. Through the cycles, the spirals, the loops, the ups and the downs, when we choose love and life, we keep on movin'With love,Silent Shout
NEW DELHI: Telecom regulator Trai is set to reject differential pricing for data services, a move that would mean the end of controversial services like Facebook's Free Basics and Airtel Zero.Trai will issue an order to this effect within a week, top sources told TOI. The order is also expected to bar free or subsidised data packages that offer access to only a select service, such as Facebook, Twitter or WhatsApp messenger. “These are discriminatory and are against the concept of digital democracy. We will not allow them,” a source said.The regulator's stand will clear the confusion over net neutrality. There were apprehensions over the manner in which free Internet was being offered, after the introduction of some zero-rated platforms with preferential treatment to a few websites for a fee.This will come as a setback for Facebook and Airtel, which have campaigned heavily for zero-rated platforms.The government on Friday shunted out telecom secretary Rakesh Garg and replaced him with JS Deepak — the man who first raised the red flag when A Raja was circumventing rules in the controversial 2G spectrum allocation and the officer who was roped in to usher in auctions in 2010.Garg's transfer to the minority affairs ministry is seen to be linked to the telecom department's failure to fix the nagging issue of call drops and the slow progress on Digital India, the PM Modi-led government's ambitious programme.The 1980 batch IAS officer had moved into Sanchar Bhawan in July 2014 and will chech out just months ahead of his retirement in November. The appointments were part of a top-deck reshuffle and promotion of nine secretary-rank officers.Madhya Pradesh cadre officer Aruna Sharma will replace Deepak in the department of electronics and information technology, while Avinash K Srivastava will be the new food processing secretary.Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) chief Krishan Kumar Jalan has been appointed the secretary for micro, small and medium enterprises.The changes in the communications and IT ministry were the hot topics for discussion in bureaucratic circles although government officials insisted that Garg's departure from DoT was part of a larger reshuffle. Those in the knowhow said that he had to pay the price for deficient telecom services in the country.“The issue of poor telecom services and call drops had even been raised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. There clearly had been a dissatisfaction over this issue, and despite recent efforts, the problems still persist,” a top source said, while giving out the possible reasons for Garg's sudden ouster.“Also, the government's digital programme, which is the main outreach initiative of the Modi government to connect to the millions of countrymen, appears to be going slow. The Prime Minister is not pleased by its performance.”However, an official in the ministry said that Garg had himself sought an “easy posting”.In Deepak, the government found a ready replacement as he is familiar with DoT, having worked there as joint secretary. In his last assignment as IT secretary, he was dealing with several elements of Digital India. He is often described as a troubleshooter, having also dealt with the Commonwealth Games, when the event was in a crisis and running well behind deadline.But it is experience in telecom, first as a whistleblower during Raja's term, that got him the job. Although Deepak was posted in the commerce department, where he dealt with complex WTO negotiations, he was specially requisitioned to conduct the first round of auctions.Besides call drops, Rakesh Garg's transfer to the minority affairs ministry is seen to be linked to the slow progress of PM Modi's ambitious Digital India programme. However, an official said that Garg had himself sought an ‘easy posting'.
- Fire crews in Grosse Pointe had their hands full battling a four-alarm blaze at a commercial building.
Employees at the Jim Saros Real Estate Agency and residents at Mack and Cadieux could only watch as fire crews put out the flames and smoke.
The fire happened between 9 and 9:30 a.m. Thursday morning and the owner says the past 40 years of his business have gone up in smoke.
"I cannot even begin to count what we have inside, 40 years of records and everything," said Jim Saros.
There were about 10 people inside the building at the time of the fire, but everyone made it out safely.
"I mean it's devastating from a business standpoint," Saros said. "But I would trade that for not having one person, hurt in anyway shape or form."
The owner says he believes some flash flooding may have caused an electrical problem leading to the fire but investigators say it's too early to know that for sure. They do know the fire started in the basement.
The flames may not have spread, but the smoke sure did throughout the neighborhood.
"I got a feeling a lot of these houses are going to be filled with smoke for a while," said resident Gary Hamilton. "That's going to cause some problems."
Some of the firefighters got a bit fatigued, but nothing serious according to the director of public safety.
Their hard work has not gone unnoticed.
"A lot of smoke and my hat goes off to these firemen, what they do is remarkable," Hamilton said. "They're up there on that ladder and you can't even see those fellas, not a bit."
"They were hoping they could keep it out of the vents," Saros said. "But then it just went from the basement, and then in between the floors, so at this point it's just a defensive fire now."
The Czech Republic (also known as Czechia) has an election scheduled for the 20and 21. And the leader of the frontrunner party is being called the “Czech Trump”:
From the Washington Post:
The man poised to lead the Czech Republic following elections this week is a polarizing billionaire who vows to drain the swamp of this capital city's politics, run his country like a business and keep out Muslim immigrants. He casts himself as the straight-talking voice of the common man and derives support from the country's forgotten communities. He makes a sport of attacking the European Union and says NATO's mission is outdated. He pledges to put his own nation's interests above all else but is dogged by investigations into alleged shady dealings that threaten to cripple his political career. Andrej Babis is so similar to the U.S. president in profile and outlook that he feels compelled to offer at least one key distinction. “I was never bankrupt,” the 63-year-old says mischievously in an interview at his featureless office park on the outskirts of this gloriously gargoyle-and-spire-pierced city. In center of Europe, politics takes a Trumpian turn with rise of anti-immigrant billionaire By Griff Witte, Washington Post, October 17, 2017
Babi has been dubbed the “Czech Trump” and the “Czech Berlusconi” but interestingly, Babis was actually born in Slovakia back when Czechoslovakia still existed, and stayed with the Czech entity when the Czechs and Slovaks had their parting of the ways.
Babis is apparently the second richest citizen of the Czech Republic and ran Agrofert, a conglomerate of over 230 companies dealing with “agriculture, food, chemical, construction, logistics, forestry, energy and mass media industries in the European Union and China.”
The WaPo article quotes Babis critic, “Jiri Pehe, the director of New York University's Prague campus” who says of the candidate that “He's no democrat” but is that just because he doesn't agree with him?
Pehe's big complaint is that “The danger here is that the Czech Republic could slide to the European periphery, along with Hungary and Poland.” Horrors!
Actually, it seems to me that these Central European countries are doing a better job of protecting their own people than governments farther to the west.
Who has more worries about Islamic crime and terrorism: France, Germany and Britain on the one hand, or Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic on the other hand?
To ask the question is to answer it.
According to the Washington Post,
[Babis]was a political novice when, in 2012, he founded his own party, Action of Dissatisfied Citizens, which is known by its Czech acronym ANO, meaning “yes.” The party, running on a pro-business and anti-political-establishment platform, stunned the nation a year later when it took second place in parliamentary elections. Babis became finance minister in a coalition government, and served until May, when he was forced out amid a swirl of accusations over alleged tax evasion and other improprieties — all of which he denies.
…the ouster didn't weaken him. If anything, it may have bolstered his carefully cultivated reputation as a political outsider whom the insiders will do anything to ruin. “People are saying that I'm a danger to democracy in this country, which of course is ridiculous,” he said, his gray suit neatly pressed, his gray hair and beard trimmed tight. “I'm a danger to this corrupt system.”
It's a message that [Babis] repeats relentlessly on the trail, where he signs copies of his slickly produced campaign book and gives out his cellphone number to people who say they could use his help to battle the turgid Czech bureaucracy. “He's a normal guy,” said Zdena Krskova, a 69-year-old who was shopping for dinner one day at an open-air market in a working-class neighborhood of north Prague. “Plus, he has enough money, so he doesn't need to steal from the people.”
Babis's support is concentrated outside Prague, in smaller cities and towns that haven't shared the same bump in prosperity as the country's tourist-thronged capital. It also comes from older voters who are looking to the billionaire to cut through the messy logistics of democratic politics and use a firm hand to restore a simpler, bygone time, said Daniel Prokop, head of political polling for the research firm Median.
THE EURO No euro. I don't want the euro. We don't want the euro here. Everybody knows it's bankrupt. It's about our sovereignty. I want the Czech koruna, and an independent central bank. I don't want another issue that Brussels would be meddling with. MULTICULTURALISM I have stopped believing in successful integration and multiculturalism. ANGELA MERKEL AND THE “REFUGEES” It was she who let migrants enter Germany and the whole of Europe in uncontrolled waves, without papers, therefore without knowing who they really are. Germany is paying a high price for this policy. The solution is peace in Syria and the return of migrants to their homes. There is no place for them in Europe. MORE ON MERKEL In return for billions of euros, she should make sure that Greece and Turkey completely stop the arrival of refugees in Europe. Otherwise, it will be her fault what happens to the European population. Unfortunately, Mrs. Merkel refuses to see how serious the situation is in Germany and in other EU nations. Her attitude is really tragic. CZECH SOVEREIGNTY VS. THE EUROPEAN UNION We have to fight for what our ancestors built here. If there will be more Muslims than Belgians in Brussels, that's their problem. I don't want that here. They won't be telling us who should live here.
But getting kicked out of the government didn't hurt Babis politically.That sounds familiar.What about the demographics of the candidate's support?The Gatestone Institute found some interesting Babis quotes:
Ask the Scientists
Join The Discussion
What is the context of this research?
While studying indoor air quality I focused on Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). Scientists have extensively studied VOCs and their health effects since the 1970s when sick building syndrome (SBS) was most prevalent. SBS is a condition affecting office workers, most issues are headaches or respiratory symptoms. Chronic exposure is the main concern; people can develop asthmatic symptoms over time.
To address this problem NASA studied plants and their ability to consume VOCs, specifically formaldehyde. This research leads us to question how we can improve the efficiency of plants. My hypothesis is, "Can providing ample air flow to the roots of plants significantly increase the efficiency of formaldehyde consumption?"
You may read my literature review on VOCs here.

VOC Hazards
What is the significance of this project?
Currently there is no low-cost system for remediation of formaldehyde. A plant system like this has been built on a Public Lab project. However, they do not have data comparing an aerated plant system to a traditionally potted plant. A system similar to the Public Lab setup has potential, but it needs to be verified through more experiments. Another benefit to proving this air remediation method is that it is sustainable, meaning that there are no filters to replace. The plant will become more efficient over time as the bacteria colonies grow.
What are the goals of the project?
My goal is to collect data on the formaldehyde remediation capabilities of a regularly potted plant, and the aerated plant system. This data will show exactly how much more or less efficient the aerated system is. As soon as funding is received I will begin the assembly process of the system, then carry out the experiment. An air sample will be taken before the experiment to get an initial level of formaldehyde. The plants will be placed in similar rooms, and air samples will be taken every day for 8 days.
Yahoo, initially vilified for being part of the PRISM program, which allows the National Security Agency (NSA) to tap it and other companies for users' information, is about to be vindicated.
A court ruled Monday that the Department of Justice must reveal classified documents from 2008 that Yahoo says will demonstrate that the company fought back against a secret court order to reveal their users' data.
“The Government shall conduct a declassification review of this Court's Memorandum Opinion of [Yahoo's case] and the legal briefs submitted by the parties to this Court,” the ruling read. The Department of Justice has two weeks to estimate how long it'll take to declassify the documents and can still redact the parts it finds contains classified information.
Ironically, it's the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Court that ruled for Yahoo. It was the FISC, often referred to as a “secret court,” that signed off on an order for Yahoo to hand over users' information in the first place.
That demand came with a gag order, something that's been particularly stressful to Yahoo, considering the beating its reputation took after former NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked files that prove that through PRISM, the NSA can apparently easily get Yahoo users' data.
Yahoo, like all the companies named as part of PRISM, issued a denial that it knowingly aided in such a program. Other companies that denied willfully participating—like Google and Facebook—included the caveat that they do, in fact, comply with court orders.
As the FBI has said, PRISM is legal through the FISA system. Yahoo's was perhaps the shortest of the major companies' denials and didn't address the legality of PRISM at all: “Yahoo! takes users' privacy very seriously. We do not provide the government with direct access to our servers, systems, or network,” the company wrote.
Also on Monday, the Electronic Frontier Foundation praised Yahoo for putting up a legal fight against FISA in the first place, awarding it a “gold star” in It's Who's Got Your Back survey, which tracks how well major companies stand up for Internet freedom
As the EFF noted, Yahoo's fight was classified, and other companies might have acted similarly:
“Of course, it's possible more companies have challenged this secret surveillance, but we just don't know about it yet. We encourage every company that has opposed a FISA order or directive to move to unseal their oppositions so the public will have a better understanding of how they've fought for their users.”
This is only the second known civilian victory in a FISA court. Earlier this month, the EFF itself won a case compelling the FISA court to release some of its previous rulings, and to admit that FISC proceedings are classified by the executive branch, not by the rules of the court itself.

Assistant health minister says her chief of staff, who quit over conflict of interest allegations, did not act improperly
Prime minister Tony Abbott has said he did not have a conversation with the assistant health minister, Fiona Nash, in which she offered her resignation after her office intervened to pull a food star rating website while her chief of staff, Alastair Furnival, was connected to the food industry.
Asked whether Nash offered her resignation, Abbott said: “The short answer is I had no such conversation with her.”
Nash refused to say in Senate estimates if she had offered her resignation to the prime minister or his office. She maintains that Furnival, who resigned amid conflict of interest allegations, did not act improperly.
Nash has also revealed that Furnival wrote her a letter outlining how he would deal with potential conflicts of interest, but she has refused to produce it.
Furnival resigned earlier this month after Nash's office intervened to take down a food star rating website and it emerged that Furnival's wife owned a lobbying firm, Australian Public Affairs (APA). Furnival was still the director and co-owner of one of the companies which made up the partnership.
Food companies were among APA's clients.
Nash was asked whether, at the time she directed Furnival to take down the food star rating website, she was aware he was still a shareholder and a director.
“I was aware he was still a shareholder. I wasn't aware that he was still listed as a director on the Australian Securities and Investments Commission website for the Sim [Strategic Issues Management] company until after that,” Nash said.
Abbott said that even with the slightest suspicion that something was wrong, Furnival had resigned.
“I know that whenever there is any suggestion someone has done something wrong … everyone hyperventilates about who said what to whom,” the prime minister said on Wednesday.
“This is a fairly minor case ... all the decisions that senator Nash has made are eminently justifiable and I support them ... [but] they have been resolved by [Furnival's] resignation and the matter is now at an end.”
Nash said she accepted Furnival's resignation but did not seek it and it was not asked for by the prime minister's office or the government staffing committee.
“He resigned because given this issue that was creating a degree of media interest was causing a distraction for the government, was also having other impacts and he felt it appropriate to offer his resignation,” she said.
Nash said she understood that Furnival had given his accountants instructions to remove him from all directorships. Asked whether, after that initial advice, she subsequently inquired as to progress, Nash said: “My assumption was that that had been completed.”
As for the divestment of the shareholding, Nash said she was “certainly” aware on a number of occasions that the process was “still under way”.
“It was a complex process that was taking a period of time to complete … I don't think there was anything untoward; it was just a process that was complex and was taking a period of time to complete.”
When asked in Senate estimates on Wednesday morning if she offered her resignation to the prime minister, Nash replied: “I'm not going to comment on discussions with the prime minister's office.”
Nash said she and the government staffing committee were aware of potential conflicts of interest and Furnival had written Nash a letter outlining how he would deal with them, which she then passed on to the government staffing committee.
“I was completely aware of the issues relating to the employment of my former chief of staff regarding his former employment and his connection to the APA and indeed the fact that Tracey Cain was his wife. Because I was aware of those issues I had a series of undertakings put in place so there could be no real or perceived conflicts of interest,” she said.
Nash refused to provide the letter from Furnival with the undertakings on how he would deal with perceived conflicts of interests, saying it was “internal communications”.
“Mr Furnival was required to provide me an undertaking of what he was going to do. He did that by way of letter and that is that,” she said.
Nash's evidence comes the day after the special minister of state, Michael Ronaldson, refused to say whether he sent a letter approving Furnival to start work while he was still director and co-owner of Strategic Issues Management, which makes up one of the partnerships with APA.
The statement of standards for ministerial staff says the special minister of state must provide a written agreement for a ministerial staffer to retain a directorship.

While we have already seen Chris Hemsworth head-stomping his way through battle on the set of Thor 2, there were still questions as to what exactly whose heads he was stomping.
We've got more on set pictures now, courtesy of Spiber-Man, which give us another good look at the mystery marauders.
And look – they are seemingly packing heat. Now we want to hear some more definite guesses from you as to who these beasts are.
And just to reassure the Asgardian gods that we are not picking sides here, a look at the other team…
We're pretty sure that these pics by Wayne Howes give us our first look at Zachary Levi, taking over the role of Fandral.
Firstly you'll see him up in the top left, pulling his best battle stance. And then you can see his back side. In case you wondered what that would look like.
And just to spoil you further, Nuke the Fridge have reported some confirmation of Stan Lee's inevitable cameo. Of course, Stan seems pretty jazzed for the role. Appearing on stage at LA's Comikaze Festival, The Man said:
You've never seen anything like it, neither have I. Don't miss it!
I'm now intrigued to see if I have seen something like it.
Maybe we will get a superteam of the many Stan Lee look-a-likes that the Marvel Movieverse has amassed, cameo by cameo, over these last few years. I haven't seen anything like that…

Kimchi is synonymous with South Korea. Though it's only a side dish, the mix of fermented vegetables and spices is so common in Korean households that a South Korean-born chef once told NPR it is “like air in Korea.”
Kimchi's unique taste is what makes people love it or loathe it. The dish, a red-hued, tangy mix of vegetables and seafood sauces, is sour like vinegar, garlicky, pungent in taste and smell, and has an effervescent kick.
And now, South Korean scientists at the World Institute of Kimchi are working to tone down some of kimchi's characteristics ― including its strong smell ― so it will appeal to a foreigner's palate, according to The Washington Post.
“We're trying to engineer the smell out of kimchi,” researcher Lee Mi-ae told the Post. “But it's difficult because the smell is linked to the flavor of the kimchi.”
The scientists' main goal is to create a global market for the traditional pickled dish, which has been around for more than a thousand years ― so tinkering with its recipe to make it more palatable for non-Korean people make business sense.
But for anyone who loves kimchi because they grew up with it, the news might hurt a little. It's another reminder that in countries like the U.S., traditional Asian foods such as kimchi are viewed as a source of shame that Asian immigrants and their children must hide or adapt to be accepted.
The 2015 pilot episode of ABC's “Fresh Off the Boat” depicts this experience: During lunchtime at school, Eddie, the show's adolescent star, pulls out a container from his lunch bag. “It's Chinese food,” he explains. Repulsed by the look and smell of of his food, Eddie's classmates shun him from the table. Eddie eats his lunch behind the school and, later, asks his mom for “white people food.”

It's a common experience for Asian immigrants and their kids. Writer Vivian Gian described in a 2015 essay how the “lingering smells” from her parents' cooking was the reason she never had friends over for dinner. In 2014, Indian-American reporter Arun Venugopal wrote of how liberating it was to finally eat with his hands in public, after years of only doing it in private to avoid looking like “the Indian kid who ate like a third-world savage.”
To fit in, immigrants are often pressured to hide their traditional foods because they are considered weird or gross. And when those same foods become trendy and are presented to the rest of the public without the appropriate context, immigrants are forced to wonder why their foods are shameful when they prepare them, but desirable when non-immigrants do.
“In a weird turn of events, people were making money and becoming famous for eating the things I had grown up with and had been bullied for,” wrote Clarissa Wei, a Chinese-American food writer.
Ruth Tam, a web producer, explained in a Washington Post essay how odd it was to watch Cantonese cuisine become popular in the U.S., years after her friend insulted her home by saying it smelled of “Chinese grossness.”
As Tam explained, “This cultural appropriation stings because the same dishes hyped as ‘authentic' on trendy menus were scorned when cooked in the homes of the immigrants who brought them here.”

Kimchi isn't just a food staple in Korea, it's a part of a cultural identity. In fact, it's so deeply embedded in Korean culture that the tradition of making and sharing the dish, known as “kimjang,” is recognized by UNESCO as an intangible cultural heritage of humanity.
With its goal of globalizing kimchi, the World Institute of Kimchi has an opportunity to introduce one of South Korea's most prominent dishes to the rest of the world on its own terms and to promote its healthful qualities.
But by altering the dish to accommodate Western tastes in an apparent attempt to bridge a cultural gap, the institute is letting another group control South Korea's narrative about its own culinary staple.
And if scientists succeed in making kimchi less smelly ― and, perhaps as a consequence, less flavorful ― are they selling the dish short?
Some people seem to think so.

Pressure is mounting on Tony Abbott to push for a ban on President Vladimir Putin attending the Brisbane G20 meeting after Moscow moved troops and tanks into neighbouring Ukraine.
The Prime Minister condemned Moscow in scathing terms on Friday, branding the stream of Russian soldiers and weapons into eastern Ukraine an apparent "invasion" and calling the actions "utterly unacceptable".
"It is an absolutely clear-cut case of a larger country bullying a smaller country, and this should have no place in our world.": Tony Abbott. Credit:Andrew Meares
Opposition Leader Bill Shorten called on Mr Abbott and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop to talk to other G20 member nations about banning Mr Putin from attending the leaders' meeting in November.
"It is probably time for the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister to be talking to other nations ... about whether it is appropriate for Mr Putin to come to Australia," he said. "Following the tragic events of MH17, the complete lack of remorse or responsibility, the lack of full co-operation ... and now scenes of thousands of Russian soldiers flooding across the Ukrainian border, I think most Australians have grave reservations about welcoming Mr Putin to Australia."
Alou Diarra has not played since being released by West Ham last summer.
France international Alou Diarra has joined Charlton Athletic on a contract until the end of the season, the Championship club announced on Monday.
The defensive midfielder has been without a club since leaving West Ham following the end of last season. He went on a preseason trial with MLS side Chicago Fire before signing with Charlton.
Diarra, 33, has earned 44 caps for France and played in the 2006 and 2010 World Cups. He has played for a number of Ligue 1 clubs in his career, including Le Havre, Bastia, Lens, Lyon, Bordeux and Marseille, while also going on loan to Rennes before West Ham released him last summer.
"He will add some height, experience, and most of all, quality to the midfield," Charlton coach Guy Luzon told the club's website.
"We lost Milos [Veljkovic] to injury and Johnnie Jackson is out for a month, so he will help us to bring results and more points.
"It's a coup for us that we can attract a player with so much international experience and I'm sure he will be fantastic for us."
Diarra will be available to play on Tuesday at Championship leaders Derby County.
Phosphorus is a critical nutrient in farming, but it has also received a lot of negative attention for the impact it can have on water quality.
If we consider the path of a single phosphorus molecule, it probably originates in a rock formation in the U.S. or North Africa. From there it becomes fertilizer and nutrition for a crop. Once in the soil, it can be taken up by plants, and there's a good chance it will be recycled (in crop residue decomposition or in canola meal fed to livestock and returned to the field in manure).
The phosphorus continues to be cycled on the farm, until it leaves to be consumed by humans — that's where there's a gaping hole in the phosphorus cycle.
A 50 bu/ac canola crop requires approximately 80 lbs of phosphorous. Around 50 lbs are removed in the seed, with 30 lbs returning to the soil in the remaining plant residue.
“Where the big disconnect occurs is after people consume canola and other agricultural products, because 90 percent of phosphorus that's consumed by people is not recycled back into the food system, and that creates a big challenge in terms of sustainability and environmental problems,” explains Don Flaten, soil scientist at the University of Manitoba, in this Canola School episode, filmed at the Manitoba Canola Growers' Community Summit at Kelburn Farm south of Winnipeg.
Instead of being recycled to grow more food, much of the phosphorus that leaves the farm in food ends up where it's of no value and is often detrimental to the environment — in landfills, sewage systems, and waterways.
Composting leftover food is only slightly better than throwing it out, because the concentration of phosphorus from household waste in a small yard will quickly build to too-high levels, says Flaten. “We have to have systems that take that composted organic material and get the nutrient back to where the food was produced.”
At the same time, there's only a finite, non-renewable supply of rock phosphorus in the world, he notes.
So what does this mean for the production of canola and other phosphorus-loving crops?
Slowing this leak in the overall phosphorus cycle requires recovering these nutrients after they're consumed in food, opening the possibility of more non-traditional phosphorus sources like struvite and biosolids. Cities like Saskatoon, Edmonton and Portage la Prairie are investing in technology to extract phosphorus from their sewage systems.
(One of the obstacles to biosolid extraction for some cities and towns is that human waste has to meet the same regulations that apply to livestock manure — for example, storage requirements and winter spreading bans.)
“We're working to evaluate these fertilizer products to make sure they're at least as good as regular commercial fertilizers, and that's what we've found,” says Flaten. “Everybody's working together, but we still have a ways to go.”

With its Blue Bottle coffee and startup-chic aesthetic, luxury transit company Leap's buses offer white-collar workers a comfortable cocoon to protect them from the unpleasantries of the daily commute.
But that luxury is available only to some, a complaint filed last month with the Department of Justice alleges. It says that in failing to make its buses accessible to wheelchairs, Leap has discriminated against disabled people and violated the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Furthermore, the complaint alleges, the San Francisco startup actually purchased wheelchair-accessible buses only to remove the standard-issue ramps and fold-up seats. By checking the paper trail, The Chronicle determined that at least four Leap buses featured wheelchair accommodations before they were sold to the startup.
The spaces once reserved for wheelchairs now feature bar-style seating and plush leather armchairs.
“This is a step backwards,” said Chris Pangilinan, 32, the former transportation engineer for the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency who filed the complaint. Pangilinan, who recently relocated for a job with the New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority, has cerebral palsy and has used a wheelchair for nearly his entire life.
“If they had put up a sign that said 'no whites' or something like that there would be national outrage,” he said. “This is the same kind of violation. There just aren't as many people affected.”
Leap launched a version of its service in 2013, but then went on hiatus and relaunched last month. The company, which has raised $2.5 million in venture capital, runs one route from the Marina to the Financial District during morning and evening commutes. Each fare is $6 and an app controls every aspect of the ride — from checking on whether a bus has open seats to purchasing cold-pressed juice once on board.
Pangilinan's complaint hinges on a section of the ADA that requires both private and public transportation providers to make “vehicles and facilities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities,” and repair accessibility features such as ramps or wheelchair lifts “promptly if they are damaged or out of order.”
The ADA is a set of wide-ranging civil rights laws passed in 1990 to prevent discrimination against disabled people. Its sections dealing with transportation are among its most important, said Marilyn Golden, a policy analyst at the Disability Rights Education & Defense Fund, a civil rights law center.
“The provision of the ADA that went into effect the fastest was the one that required buses to be accessible to people with disabilities,” said Golden. “People with disabilities had faced for many years significant hurdles in access to transportation. The ADA was supposed to gradually make that a thing of the past.”
It's unclear exactly which, if any, ADA regulations apply to Leap.
The ADA has different rules for public and private transportation and distinguishes between private transportation companies and “private entities not primarily engaged in the business of transporting people,” such as hotels that run airport shuttles.
If Leap was considered a private transportation company, the law would require it to keep accessibility equipment such as ramps “in operative condition.”
The ADA does not include specific requirements for used vehicles — such as the four Leap buses purchased from a Southern California transit agency. The law was drafted so that older vehicles could be grandfathered in and eventually brought up to compliance or decommissioned.
But the law does not explicitly exempt used vehicles from accessibility requirements.
In a statement to The Chronicle, Leap said that its “understanding is that used vehicles do not have the same accessibility requirements as new vehicles.”
Leap uses four 2001 and 2002 North American Bus Industries buses sold to the company by the Riverside Transit Agency through an auction house. The manufacturer confirmed that the models purchased by Leap originally come equipped with a wheelchair ramp and interior wheelchair securement. A Riverside Transit Agency representative said any buses used by the agency would include wheelchair-accessibility.
The fact Leap buses were at one point wheelchair-accessible, Golden said, is a clear violation of the spirit of the law, if not the letter.
“Not only did they fail to maintain accessibility features, as they are legally required to do, they took them out,” said Golden. “To remove the accessibility features is the ultimate opposite of accessibility maintenance. It renders hollow the requirement for a vehicle to have accessibility.”
Leap would not comment specifically on whether the company removed ramps and wheelchair securements.
In its terms of service, Leap says it “does not provide transportation services,” and that it is “not a transportation carrier.”
But even if the company wasn't classified as a private transportation company under the ADA, there is still a set of regulations that would require the company's buses to be wheelchair-accessible. Transportation services run by entities for which transportation is not the core of their business are still required to offer disability accessibility on vehicles that fit more than 16 people and have fixed routes.
Leap's website says it would like to eventually accommodate expanded accessibility.
“Our vision is for Leap to be accessible to anyone who wants to use our service. We currently operate a small fleet of buses purchased from public transit agencies that arrived in different states of mechanical condition. The current design does not include retrofitting for wheelchair access,” Leap CEO Kyle Kirchhoff said in a statement. “We're exploring new designs and vehicle types to add this type of access to Leap as we expand to accommodate the demand from members of the community.”
A DOJ official said the agency can't discuss pending complaints. If the agency finds that Leap potentially violated the ADA, it could send it to the ADA Mediation Program, refer it to a U.S. attorney or investigate the company itself. Pangilinan's ADA complaint is not a lawsuit, meaning he does not have any financial stake in his complaint.
“This is deliberate, it isn't some accident of fate,” he said. “I think they have a good service, but they should do it in a way that includes everybody.”

So last Friday during the inauguration of President Trump and all of the attendant civil disorder that went along with it, Richard Spencer got punched in the face by a hit-and-run SJWer. Some folks would say he was asking for it, while others are a bit disturbed by the whole affair. Many, of course, don't have a problem with punching a “Nazi” in the face. After all, who would? We all know that Nazis are bad guys, and it helps that we beat them like a drum in World War II. Hence, Nazis make an excellent Schelling point against which good, patriotic Americans (or people, like SJWs, who are only pretending to be good, patriotic Americans) can rally.
Yet – as it is almost always the case – the devil is in the definitions.
One of the major problems with invoking a label in politics is that it tends to be subjectively applied. Someone is a “Nazi,” for instance, not because they actually are, but because the one calling them that disagrees with them and wants to get others to disagree with them as well. Such tends to be the case with Richard Spencer. Now, it can easily be granted that Spencer holds to positions which are both well outside the mainstream and being offensive to many. I've discussed elsewhere my own disagreement with the sort of white nationalism represented by Spencer, which I think is unrealistic, atheistic, and globalistic. However, calling him a “Nazi” is actually pretty stupid. That word means something very specific. A “Nazi” is a “National Socialist,” which is a specific and fairly well-defined ideology that goes far beyond “says stuff about race that I don't like.” Whatever other things Spencer may be, a “Nazi” is not one of them. But because he takes some pretty controversial positions on race, the charge superficially appears to apply in the eyes of people who don't really take time to think deeply about these issues.
However, my purpose here is not to defend Richard Spencer or his brand of white nationalism. Rather, I say all of the above to say this: Blithely throwing around emotionally-charged slanders like “Nazi” for the purpose of scoring political points is idiotic and repellent, especially when 99.9% of the people to whom it is being routinely applied are manifestly not. That this has formed a large part of American political discourse for decades serves only to highlight the fact that democracy is a failing political system, specifically because most people are simply not capable of handling themselves within a democratic framework. This has been especially demonstrated over the past few months by progressives, most of all the type of progressive who makes up the “Antifa” movement and who are prone to things like vandalism and assaulting strangers on public streets, as we saw in Washington D.C. this past Friday.
As obnoxious as mere words may be, it becomes quite a bit more disconcerting when we observe the radical Left – and not just the pencil-necked, low-testosterone pink-haired types who seem to dominate street-level progressive activism – seriously asking the question of whether or not it's okay to “punch Nazis.” First of all, if your answer to this question is anything other than “No,” then you're an idiot. This is especially the case when we consider that the people whom “Antifa” considers to be “Nazis” include basically everyone who is not a socialist. Seriously, there are progressives on social media who literally think that if you're not a hard-core socialist, then you're necessarily a Nazi. And a lot of them think it's perfectly fine to physically assault these “Nazis” (i.e. basically everyone who is white and not a progressive).
So let's say that you're some kind of right-leaning normie who opposed illegal immigration and affirmative action and political correctness, like a FReeper or something. You'd be tempted to think it's okay to “punch Nazis” because, by gum, Nazis are anti-American and Grandpa Bob punched Nazis when he was on Omaha Beach back in 1944! Ah, but you see – to the people arguing that it's okay to punch Nazis, YOU'RE a Nazi. So are all your friends and family who are Trump supporters. So is Trump himself. Shoot, so is your Grandpa Bob, since he wasn't too keen on desegregation later on and probably still holds some racial views typical for his era. Hence, we arrive at the irony of Antifas bragging about being the heirs of the Allied soldiers who defeated Nazi Germany even though they would condemn about 99% of those soldiers for being Nazis if they were here today. If nothing else, merely being white makes you a potential Nazi, since you're the beneficiary of the progressives' mythical “structural racism” which “codifies white supremacy” in America.
Think I'm exaggerating? Then why did Antifas attack Frank Luntz (you know, the guy that has those focus groups after each presidential debate) as a “fascist” and throw glitter into his eyes (which could have blinded him)? Frank Luntz is about as inside-the-beltway mainstream as you can get. Even he didn't get away from being branded and attacked.
This whole “punching Nazis” thing is an incredibly bad idea for several reasons.
First, there's the fact that “Nazis” punch back. And since Trump supporters and those on the alt-Right tend to be higher testosterone than the average American male, this means that they'll be able to hit back harder since they are more likely to pump iron and know how to fight effectively. Also, they're well-armed, much more so than your typical hoplophobic progressive dweeb. Whoever on the Left thought that it would be a good strategy to demonise 64 million angry, heavily-armed people and then try to legitimise physically assaulting them needs to be fired. The main result of this, if they really try to act on their “punching Nazis” fantasies, will be a whole lot of progressives who end up getting beaten up or even shot.
Second, most progressives still have not caught on to the fact that the legal atmosphere in which they are operating has completely changed within the past week. They no longer have a friendly president and a friendly justice department setting the tone from the top down. In previous years, progressives could commit acts of violence and get away with it because the progressives in charge would either do nothing or else give them slaps on the wrist. Further, people who responded to their violence with violence would face prosecution. Now, however, progressive hooligans actually face serious consequences for their actions. Just ask the 230 Inauguration Day rioters who now face felony charges and up to 10 years in prison and $25,000 fines apiece.
Third – and the most important reason of all – is that the precedent that will be set by legitimizing, and even normalizing, violence against political enemies will only serve to tear apart even further the already weak social fabric in America. Further, it certainly wouldn't stay contained to righteous progressives punching nasty old Nazis. After all, Muslims have killed far more Americans in the past 40 years than Nazis have so why shouldn't it be okay to punch Muslims? Gays caused the AIDS crisis which has killed many, many more Americans than the Nazis did, so why shouldn't it be okay to punch gays? Once you open the door to this against one type of enemy, you're not going to be able to close it for all the others.
Really, the prime culprit for all of this is democracy itself. When you give massive numbers of unworthy people a part in government, you only increase social turbulence and the attendant instability within society. Democracy gives its participants a false sense of their “rights” while simultaneously encouraging them to resist any enforcement of responsibilities. It is likely for this reason that Plato observed,
“Dictatorship naturally arises out of democracy, and the most aggravated form of tyranny and slavery out of the most extreme liberty.”
Democracy leads to license, which then leads to all the sorts of degeneracy that we see today, which will in turn lead to democracy's collapse.
Old Plato knew what he was talking about, too. The history of archaic and classical Greece was one of failed democracies. While there exists within every governmental system at least some potential for class envy and strife, democracy was early on noted for its especial tendencies in that regard. Within a polis, such strife could develop into what the Greeks called stasis, which was essentially an intractable divide between two factions, typically one of them being democratic and the other aristocratic (i.e. poor vs. rich, which sounds like today's socialism). Stasis was often resolved essentially by having a civil war of some sort. Unfortunately, that seems to be the direction which the United States of America is headed with our own stasis.
The Greeks had an option which we do not have today. Often the losers in a polis‘ internecine strife had the choice of packing up and colonizing some other place around the Mediterranean. They'd get a few ships, some tools and weapons, and some seed corn, and would be able to go off in search of a place of their own. A fairly substantial number of Greek colonies outside of Greece itself were founded in this way.
Unfortunately, today we live in a world that is pretty much all filled up. Until we figure out a way to reach the stars, we're all pretty much stuck with each other. This makes the maintenance of social order all the more important. The best way to maintain right order, of course, would be to abolish politics and return to regal and aristocratic authority. The fewer who presume to make decisions for everyone else, the less trouble you generally tend to have. When invested with legitimate authority to exercise power, the wise ruler will be a blessing to his people which the shifting masses cannot ever be. However, since a return to this type of authority doesn't seem to be in the offing apart from radical structural changes which will likely only accompany a society-wide collapse, we have to make do with trying not to make our democratic system any less stable than it already is. One way to do this, most rational people would agree, is to heartily discourage individual citizens from “punching Nazis,” or anyone else. Screech as they will about “fascism,” progressives who attempt to turn their fantasies into reality should find themselves facing the heavy hand of the state. If not, then it'll be the heavy hands of the Trump supporters they were attacking. The progressives have the choice whether to behave like civilised people or not. Let's hope for everyone's sake that they make the right choice.

The Royals had seven different players steal a base on Tuesday night. That's a playoff record, and an incredible figure considering that most teams would have become gun-shy after a disastrous failed double-steal in the first and a four run deficit after six innings. The Royals are not most teams.
There's a great anecdote from the low point of that game in Andy McCullough's look at the Royals' reliance on speed:
"Should we stop running?" a coach asked. The conventional offensive wisdom called for the brakes. In this situation, an out is considered more valuable than an extra base. This team, of course, does not rely upon conventional offensive wisdom. As the question hung in the air, one voice piped up. "Heck no!" shouted Rusty Kuntz, the team's first-base coach and running coordinator.
This has been the Royals' and M.O. for a while now, but only in the past couple seasons have they embraced it to this extent. "That's what speed do" was just a Jarrod Dyson quote from a few years ago, when his legs were the only thing keeping him on the roster, but now it's a clubhouse motto—you even heard the plodding Salvador Perez use it after getting the winning hit in the 12th.
The Royals stole a league-leading 153 bases this season, and stole successfully nearly 81 percent of the time. No other team has stolen that many, while being thrown out as rarely, since the 2007 Mets, who were paced by Jose Reyes's 78-steal year. More importantly, that stolen base percentage is well above the point where stealing bases makes mathematical sense.
The break-even rate is the percentage at which a team needs to successfully steal bases to make it worth the risk. And not surprisingly, that rate is different from team to team based on power. The more home runs a team hits, the higher the opportunity cost of giving up an out, and the higher the break-even rate.

The Royals hit the fewest home runs in baseball this season, and are, in all, a terrible offensive team. Because of that, and because they have a terrific pitching staff, and because baseball generally is in a low-scoring era, they're in a very low run environment, which actually means that running makes a lot of sense, mathematically. Their break-even rate, using a formula from Fangraphs' Bradley Woodrum, sits at a meager 64.22. So not only are these Royals stealing bases more efficiently than just about everyone else, but each stolen base carries less risk and more potential value for them than it does for any other team.
Kuntz, the team's base-running coordinator, understands this, at least on a visceral level.
"You constantly have to weigh that," Kuntz said. "If the reward outweighs the risk, then you go. If we've got a legitimate situation, we jump on it."

Baseball's changed a lot from the era in which statheads started to pay attention to this stuff, even in recent memory; the leaguewide break-even rate is down significantly from its peak at baseball's home-run apex in 2000. It's sort of baffling that anyone thinks running is somehow anti-sabermetric. For a slap-hitting team like the Royals, stealing isn't just a weapon. It's almost a necessity.
You can make fun of Ned Yost's stubbornness on pitching changes, and the futility of the Royals' propensity for bunting, but this is a team—with Alcides Escobar, Nori Aoki, and Lorenzo Cain at the top of the lineup, and Dyson and Terrance Gore off the bench—that is specifically constructed to run, and to be good at it. What Kansas City does isn't small ball for small ball's sake; it's playing the percentages. And, not incidentally, it's what makes them a blast to watch.
The Angels know what's coming. Players and coaches have talked about the need to limit the damage the Royals do on the basepaths, through a combination of pitchers shortening up their deliveries, varying their looks to first base, and liberally tossing over there to keep runners honest.
"You have to pay attention to some things," Mike Scioscia said. "We'll do what we can do. Obviously, with that much speed they are going to put it to use, and we'll have to contain it the best we can."

Good luck with that. Actually, no. Bad luck with that. Royals baseball is sexy as hell, and I want to watch it for as long as possible.

Joe Jamail, a legendary Texas attorney, billionaire, and football megabooster to the Longhorns football program, died on December 23rd, 2015. He once called another attorney “fat boy” in a deposition; He put his name on the football field Texas plays its home games on; He inspired songs written by Willie Nelson, and not particularly flattering ones. He's still watching the games.
No, this isn't just Hatin' Ass Spurrier, there are Texas jokes in there—
Goddamn, Aggies. I mean, just, goddamn. Up 44-10 and you lose 45-44? You went sixty minutes and couldn't muster one single solid point when you needed to? Thats a Mad Men episode, Aggies. You're out there pissing in a boot but only filling a slipper. You're an asshole short of a whole donkey, Aggies, and the asshole store's closed.
It opens Monday and it's selling you. Too bad this is Sunday.
Josh Rosen threw for 292 yards and four TDs in one quarter while your guy couldn't hit the broadside of a barn. Fortunately, you could run the ball, and not call seventeen passes with a lead. That'd be foolish, like throwing passes at a barn. What are you doin', Aggies? You built that barn, but I own it, because that's what Longhorns do. We own stuff that you build, so get away from my barn before I call the authorities.
I'd offer to let you buy the barn for a dollar, but four quarters is obviously too much to ask of you.
Whew. I don't know. I don't really know how you get over that. One time I lost a big case. It was in Delaware. Wanted to argue it in Texas, where I could goad ol' boy it. Say things about swinging my nuts in court without everyone acting like I just shot a nun in broad daylight. You know, the good shit. Delaware's a sandy boil on Maryland's ass. I'm dead and rich and Texan. Quote me on that twice.
Anyway, I was walking out of the courthouse when Willie and Owen Wilson showed up. Four days later I walked out of a burning casino in Alice Springs, Australia with fifty grand in my pockets, a spider bite on my thigh that glowed in the dark and made a humming noise, and a newfound appreciation for life. Owen Wilson died in that fire, but he got better, and we all had a good laugh about it later. He's from Dallas; I call him friend nonetheless.
What I'm saying is that I can't help you, and wouldn't. Because I like you weak and sad, and because I can't help you burn down a casino to make you feel better about things. I can't even help you meet Owen Wilson. I'm dead. He's a car now. Life's funny like that.
But my goodness. Twenty-eight points in a quarter. I mean, I know what getting killed by UCLA's like. Least we got it over early. Give up 28 points in the second quarter and it's a rout.
Giving up 28 in the fourth? That's like a bridge deciding it wants to be a dam at the last second and falling into the river. That's a plane changing its mind over water and becoming a failed boat. You know the difference between being a surgeon and a serial killer? Finishing, Aggies. Leave the body on the table and you're just Dexter in overalls, y'all.
And Losing to UCLA is the worst because they don't care. They go back to waxin' their jimmies or caring about their college basketball team. If I wanted to care about something that made that much squeaking noise and disappointed me at every interaction I'd get a guinea pig. Least I can eat that. Peruvians are on to something there and you need to listen to ‘em. Delicious little cattle of the high altiplano.
Don't correct me in the middle of my column. I'm dead but I will still jerk a knot in your little dick, call it a bow, and make you an ugly present for my close personal friend, this hungry woodchipper, you shit-triflin' bilgesnipe.
No, I don't know who I'm talking to right now. It just feels right. I'm dead. I'm just gonna do what feels right. THIS IS MY DEPOSITION.
Anyway, I gotta close this argument. Here goes.
Aggies, you put the ass in pass. Kevin Sumlin wears a visor because even the protection scheme he uses on his head has to have a hole in it. Kyle Field is the only stadium in American where you have to step in horse shit outside in order to watch it on the inside.
You made everyone go to LA to watch a bear eat a dog in the name of entertainment. Good people of Texas can do that at home for free. Some of them do or seven dollars a head on Friday nights at the Armory in Amarillo. It's not a good thing, but I'm just saying that it's done, and done a lot closer to you than Pasadena. Freedom.
The bats in the stadium were the only air attack y'all have. You evicted them two years ago.
Kenny Hill had a good game, though. He plays for TCU now. Thought I should mention that regardless. Kyle Allen didn't get to play because of an act of god. Y'all lost because of an act of dog. Maybe I was wrong. Maybe y'all are a major research university after all. Even MIT hasn't made karma dyslexic, Aggies. That's some science right there.
Y'all have lost more quarterbacks than Florida. You know how hard you have to work to have more missing persons than FLORIDA? You've disappeared more four and five-star field generals than Stalin in his prime. Aggies, all you had to do to beat Josh Rosen was imagine he was an Aggie quarterback. You'd have run him off the field and had him transferring in no time.
Anyway, It's bad, Aggies. It's bad, and ol' Joe's pretty happy about it. If you want to sue me for damages, try it. My insurance coverage is airtight. It's great coverage. Look that up in a dictionary because you sure as hell won't see it at Kyle Field.
Speaking of one, just one other thing you can't have? This column has arrived at its completion.
Hook ‘em,
Joe
p.s. Texas didn't have a game that I'm aware of.
p.p.s. Your football team treats wins like Noah treated people. In the boat there's a max of eight, and any of them could fall overboard at any minute.

PHILADELPHIA (CBS) — Apparently, some Philadelphia police officers need to be sent to a reeducation center to understand Mayor-Elect Jim Kenney's dictums in keeping Philadelphia as San Francisco east when it comes to being a Sanctuary City.
Cops had the temerity to stop an illegal immigrant woman on the way to a Kenney event for people who are here illegally and because she had no license, registration , or insurance , seize the vehicle. This was done under the city's Live Stop program. It should be noted that the woman cannot have any of the above under state law.
When she reached the meeting and told her story in Spanish, Kenney was outraged and swung into action. Well after hours the Parking Authority had to release the car and Kenney's media consultant personally paid for the registration and insurance for the vehicle. This Kenney operative said he did so because his father was an immigrant and had to hitch rides to work. The woman swore she would not drive the vehicle and would get someone to drive her.
So this story has a happy ending in the Land of Oz called Philadelphia. Or does it? It certainly offers a sense of what Kenney will do when he is sworn in as mayor. The message is that even though illegals can't get a driver's license, cops are to let them drive. The message is that Kenney will pick and choose which laws to follow.
There is no word on how long the vehicle is insured for but under Live Stop suspends the vehicle from operation. The media coverage reports that the media consultant only took out several hundred dollars to pay for registration and insurance. That means that the vehicle will be uninsured in the near future.
Remember if you live in the suburbs that Kenney loves to hate, the woman driver is not going to just drive in Philadelphia. In Kenney's mind , the Sanctuary City of Philadelphia is mobile.
Emily and Haley Ferguson are growing up — and moving out!
The 24-year-old twins, who found fame on Ben Higgins' season of The Bachelor, recently relocated from Las Vegas to a new pad in Los Angeles. But they're not exactly prepared for the realities of grown-up living. “We're trying to be adults,” Haley says. And they readily admit, “Our mom used to do all of our laundry and cooking.”
Get push notifications with news, features and more.
To help ease the transition, they called in former flame Higgins and his girlfriend Lauren Bushnell, who he proposed to on his season of the hit show, for reinforcements.
“The Twins are just moving out on their own, and this is their first house on their own,” Higgins tells PEOPLE in the video home tour.

When it came to the décor, Bushnell, along with Madison Modern Home, lent the ladies a hand. One standout is the boho-chic dining area where Bushnell says, “The twins will probably eat many meals that they picked up from a restaurant and brought here.”
Wall art capturing the sisters' positive personality, a large framed photo of Higgins holding the classic Bachelor rose, and other touches of glam truly make the space feel like home. But that doesn't mean they're ready to dive into adulting quite yet.
“We should probably order out for our first meal,” Emily says.

Attackers are actively exploiting a vulnerability in all supported versions of Windows that allows them to execute malicious code when targets mount a booby-trapped USB on their computers, Microsoft warned Tuesday in a regularly scheduled bulletin that patches the flaw.
In Tuesday's bulletin, Microsoft officials wrote:
An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the Mount Manager component improperly processes symbolic links. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could write a malicious binary to disk and execute it. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would have inserted a malicious USB device into a target system. The security update addresses this vulnerability by removing the vulnerable code from the component. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft has reason to believe that this vulnerability has been used in targeted attacks against customers.
The vulnerability is reminiscent of a critical flaw exploited around 2008 by an NSA-tied hacking group dubbed Equation Group and later by the creators of the Stuxnet computer worm that disrupted Iran's nuclear program. The vulnerability—which resided in functions that process so-called .LNK files Windows uses to display icons when a USB stick is plugged in—allowed the attackers to unleash a powerful computer worm that spread from computer to computer each time they interacted with a malicious drive.
When Microsoft patched the .LNK vulnerability in 2010 with MS10-046, company officials classified the vulnerability as "critical," the company's highest severity rating. The classification seemed appropriate, considering the success of the .LNK exploits in infecting large numbers of air-gapped computers. For reasons that aren't clear, Tuesday's vulnerability has been rated "important," Microsoft's second-highest severity rating. Update: As Virus Bulletin researcher Martijn Grooten pointed out, the .LNK vulnerability was remotely exploitable, allowing it to infect millions of people. By contrast, the bug patched Tuesday appears to require a USB stick, a requirement that would greatly limit the scale of attacks. That's the likely reason for the lower severity rating.
In addition to fixing the bug, Microsoft is also releasing software that allows patched computers to log attempts to exploit the bug. That will make it easier for people to know if they were targeted by attackers.
Separately, a word of caution: the installation of Windows language packs will require Tuesday's patch to be reinstalled. Accordingly, before running the update, users should make sure they install any language packs they expect to need in the future.
The fix for the USB vulnerability was one of 14 patch bulletins Microsoft published on Tuesday as part of its monthly update cycle. Microsoft typically identifies by name the person or group reporting the vulnerabilities that get fixed. In this case, however, the company didn't elaborate beyond saying notification came "through coordinated vulnerability disclosure."
INSIDE the boardrooms and bars of Houston, the spiritual capital of America's energy industry, the swagger is back. The oil price may only be at $48, or half the level it was three years ago. But shale fracking—the business of getting oil and gas out of rocks by blasting them with water and sand—is booming once again after the crash of 2014-16. Exploration and production (E&P) companies are about to go on an investment spree. Demand is soaring for the industry's raw materials: sand, other people's money, roughnecks and ice-cold beer.
Shale's second coming is testament to Texan grit. But the industry's never-say-die spirit may explain why it has done next to nothing about its dire finances. The business has burned up cash for 34 of the last 40 quarters, according to figures on the top 60 listed E&P firms collected by Bloomberg, a data provider. With the exception of airlines, Chinese state enterprises and Silicon Valley unicorns—private firms valued at more than $1bn—shale firms are on an unparalleled money-losing streak. About $11bn was torched in the latest quarter, as capital expenditures exceeded cashflows. The cash-burn rate may well rise again this year.

Meanwhile, the prospect of rapidly rising production is rattling global energy markets. In particular it worries OPEC, a cartel of producers led by Saudi Arabia that aims to restrain output and keep prices stable and fairly high. Khalid al-Falih, Saudi's energy minister, warned of “irrational exuberance” on March 7th during an energy-industry conference in Houston.
When oil prices halved in just 16 weeks starting in late 2014, panic hit Texas, followed—for a while—by grim austerity. The number of drilling rigs in America dropped by 68% from peak to trough. Companies slashed investment. Over 100 firms went bankrupt, defaulting on at least $70bn of debt. Shale's retrenchment helped to stabilise the global oil price. Production in the lower 48 states (ie, excluding Alaska and Hawaii), and excluding federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico, has dropped by 15% over the past 21 months, equivalent to 1m bpd, or 1% of global output.
The partial recovery in the oil price, which at one point fell as low as $26, is only one factor behind renewed enthusiasm for shale. Houston's optimists also argue that the full geological potential of Texas's Permian basin has only just become apparent. Some experts think it could in time produce more barrels each day than Saudi Arabia does. That has offset gloom about falling production from other shale basins, such as the Bakken formation in western North Dakota. The industry has also lifted productivity. Drilling is faster, more selective and more accurate, and leakage rates are lower. Wells are being designed to penetrate multiple layers of oil that are stacked on top of each other.
But the fact that the industry makes huge accounting losses has not changed. It has burned up cash whether the oil price was at $100, as in 2014, or at about $50, as it was during the past three months. The biggest 60 firms in aggregate have used up $9bn per quarter on average for the past five years. As a result the industry has barely improved its finances despite raising $70bn of equity since 2014. Much of the new money got swallowed up by losses, so total debt remains high, at just over $200bn.
Oil bosses like to show off their newest wells in the Permian basin, which, they say, can now make internal rates of return of more than 50% over their working lives. But most firms have mediocre wells too, as well as corporate overheads, so their overall efficiency improvement has not been great. For the ten largest listed E&P firms, aggregate cash operating costs per barrel fell by $13 between 2014 and 2016; not enough to offset a $50 drop in the oil price. Because shale-energy fields run out far faster than traditional ones, firms must reinvest heavily to keep production flat.
It is instructive to compare shale with another natural-resources business that has had to cope with a collapse in commodity prices. In 2016 the mining industry's biggest companies ground out profits, produced cashflow after capital investments and made a decent return on capital. Yet despite this unflattering contrast, capital investment by American E&P companies will probably soar over the next year, by perhaps 50% or more.
There are two theories for why this is happening. One is that the way in which executives are paid, together with lenders' incentives, means that Houston is always vulnerable to investment mania. Not one of the ten biggest E&P firms, for example, puts significant emphasis in its pay scheme on how much return on capital it produces. Low interest rates make it easy for shale firms to borrow, and fee-hungry banks cheer on the spectacle. But the only way that the mania will end well is if oil prices rise sharply, bailing out the industry, or if E&P firms are bought by bigger energy firms. That is possible, but companies such as Exxon and Shell are too seasoned to pay a lot for small, unprofitable firms.
Houston, we still have a problem
The second explanation is oil executives' belief in increased output from the Permian, and higher productivity. Most E&P firms reckon they can expand production at an annual rate of 10-20% over the next few years. But to justify their market values, and make an adequate return on their cumulative capital invested, listed E&P firms would over time need to make about $60bn of free cashflow each year. Assuming that both energy prices and capital spending stay flat, that would require them roughly to double production from current levels.
The trouble is that this is a circular argument. If achieved across the whole shale industry it would mean that output would be twice as high as it is now, leading to a 5% increase in global supply, which might in turn lower the oil price. There is something heroic—and baffling—about America's shale firms. They are the marginal producer in a cyclical industry, and that is usually an unpleasant place to be. The oil bulls of Houston have yet to prove that they can pump oil and create value at the same time.
At last, both Republicans and Democrats are beginning to respond aggressively to economic needs. “It has been a tough time,” admits one Washington insider, applauding a new spending proposal that “could help out.”
Unfortunately, he and Congress aren't referring to your tough times. No, no — they're rushing to the aid of the multi-billion-dollar Military-Industrial Complex.
The government, you see, hasn't been getting our nation into enough wars to satisfy the insatiable appetite of Northrop Grumman and its ilk for government money. So those war profiteers have spied a new place they can militarize with their high-tech, high-cost weaponry: The U.S.-Mexican border.
These corporate predators are deploying an army of lobbyists to Congress to target what they see as a booming market. “Border security!” is their battle cry.
These profiteers have already stuffed the Senate's immigration bill with $46 billion for more militarization of the 2,000-mile border. More drones! More electronic gadgetry! More agents needing more weapons! More war toys! There's no shortage of opportunities on our southern border.
A platoon of corporate lobbyists embedded their specific wish lists directly in the Senate bill, mandating brand-name purchases. For example, the bill requires the Border Patrol to buy six airborne radar systems from Northrop at $9.3 million each and 15 Black Hawk helicopters from Sikorsky at $17 million apiece.
What we have here is the emergence of a new hybrid monster: a Border-Industrial Complex pushing a permanent, ever-expanding border war.
How long before they use the cry of “terrorism!” to militarize the Canadian border, too? And after that, my guess is they'll want to seal off those pesky anti-war radicals in places like Vermont.
Microsoft has revealed what's under the hood of its next console and it's packing some pretty impressive hardware. Codenamed Project Scorpio, it's still missing a final name, release date, and, crucially, price—however its specifications certainly suggest it lives up to its "most powerful console ever" billing.
As revealed to Eurogamer's Digital Foundry, the Scorpio's technical specifications include a CPU that has eight custom x86 cores clocked at 2.3GHz. Its GPU has 40 customised compute units clocked at 1172MHz; and the Scorpio boasts a generous 12GB of GDDR5 RAM with a memory bandwidth of 326GB/s—substantially higher than the 8GB and 256GB/s of AMD's RX 480 PC graphics card. Its hard drive is spacious at 1TB, however Scorpio does not come equipped with an SSD.
Here's how all of that stacks up against its other console competition:
Image via Eurogamer.net
If we dig into the specs a bit more, it's pretty clear that Microsoft set out to rectify the Xbox One's second place finish relative to the PS4. It looks like the goal was to beat PS4 Pro on every spec, and by the numbers Scorpio does exactly that.
The CPU is a tuned version of the existing Jaguar architecture, which is supposed to be about 10 percent more efficient (10 percent better IPC) compared to the Xbox One. AMD debuted Jaguar in 2013, and it's since been used in the original PS4 and XB1. Combined with a process shrink from 28nm TSMC planar transistors to 16nm FinFET, this allows Microsoft and AMD to clock the CPU about 30 percent higher, resulting in 40 percent better overall performance.
Anyone thinking Scorpio would get some form of Zen, AMD's latest processor generation, will be disappointed here. The full 8-core Ryzen chip is some 192 mm^2, while the entire Scorpio SOC measure in at 360 mm^2. Most of that space will be put into the graphics side of things, and drawing on the RX 480 8GB comparison, that's a 232 mm^2 chip. But the console didn't really need a completely new CPU architecture, since having a fixed platform allows developers to extract more from the available hardware.
It makes sense to keep with the same CPU architecture, as it means Microsoft won't need a completely different set of optimizations for Scorpio vs. Xbox One / One S. Scorpio's CPU is faster, and it will still benefit from the low power tuning of the Jaguar cores.
Moving over to the GPU side of things, here's where Microsoft really invested a lot of hardware. With 40 compute units (2,560 shader cores), this is a slightly bigger GPU than the RX 480 / Polaris 10. Also keep in mind that AMD's Polaris GPUs are manufactured using GlobalFoundries' 14nm FinFET process, while Scorpio uses TSMC's 16nm FinFET, so there's extra work involved with moving to a different process.
In raw performance, Microsoft and AMD have more than tripled the graphics capabilities of the Xbox One. With 6 TFLOPS of compute power, the chip will also need plenty of bandwidth to run at 4K, and that's where the memory configuration comes into play.
Gone is the 8GB DDR3 + 32MB ESRAM of Xbox One, and in its place is a full 12GB of GDDR5 sitting on a 384-bit bus, clocked at 6.8 Gbps. Working with ESRAM required more effort, and with five times the memory bandwidth it's no longer necessary to have a high-speed ESRAM cache. It looks a lot more like a PC design, which is good news.
Combined with the fine tuning that console software gets for the hardware—they know exactly what to expect and don't need to waste resources on potential alternative configurations—an RX 480 style GPU with 27 percent more memory bandwidth should be a good fit for running 4K native content. Note that Scorpio will also support downscaling of 4K content to 1080p displays (basically supersampling), so even if you don't have a cutting edge display you'll benefit from the hardware.
Microsoft demoed a Forza Motorsports build running at a full 4K locked at 60FPS with all of the settings of the Xbox One is capable of turned on. Xbox One player will no doubt be aware of screen tearing issues due to many games not being able to hit target framerates. Microsoft is claiming that Scorpio will completely solve this. With the Forza demo only utilizing between 60% and 70% GPU resources, there's definitely enough headroom there to ensure framerate targets are hit.
On the audio front, Scorpio will employ Dolby's Atmos system, allowing for true 7.1 surround-sound setups that utilize height effects. That means if you have an Atmos capable home receiver and full Atmos speakers setup, you'll be able to clearly hear airplanes and helicopters fly over you.
Headphone users won't be able to receive true multichannel support, but Microsoft is implementing Atmos for headphones anyway. Think Dolby surround for headphones that you find on many gaming headsets. The effect, while amusing, won't nearly be immersive as using discrete speakers. However, Microsoft is employing HRTFs (head-related transfer functions), that utilize ear and head dimension-modeling to accurately give you realistic 3D sound positioning. Those who have been around long enough to remember Aureal 3D's technology will appreciate how convincing the effect is. The only caveat with HRTFs is that Scorpio will require support baked in to the game.
How does all of this compare to our PC platform? It's a bit apple to oranges, since we have the ability to customize all of our components. The best approximation of the performance offered by Scorpio is our budget PC build, which includes a Core i3-7100, 8GB RAM, and an RX 480 8GB graphics card. It also has a larger case, PSU, and a 500GB SSD, and it costs around $700.
So how exactly does this represent a challenge to high-end PCs? It's all in the semantics and the development environment. PCs have to run a large and complex operating system, and there are as many potential combinations of PC hardware as there are stars in the sky. That makes for an extra level of complexity in the software, and developers can't always count on a specific feature being present. This is part of why PC game releases often have much higher system requirements relative to consoles.
Put another way, the current Xbox One has hardware that looks positively pathetic in many areas. Sure, it has eight CPU cores, but each CPU is about one third the performance of a single i3 core. Eight of them working together might, maybe, match a Core i3 in a few specific workloads. The graphics meanwhile is like an HD 7770, a chip that came out in early 2012 and which would struggle with modern games. But because the platform is fixed, that slow hardware is able to keep up with PCs that are several times faster.
Now triple the performance of the Xbox One, and you can see how this might challenge a desktop PC for gaming prowess. It doesn't have the raw power a PC has, but it makes better use of its power.
Eurogamer guesses Scorpio will sell for $499, which seems reasonable. Take out some of the extras you get from a PC and that's a pretty similar overall price. Today's top-end PC GPUs like the GTX 1080 are still much better suited to 4K gaming at high and ultra settings, and CPUs like AMD's Ryzen and Intel's Kaby Lake are much newer, more efficient architectures. If Scorpio ends up a capable 4K 60 fps gaming machine, that should only mean good things for PC gaming: we should expect all the ports from Microsoft's console to meet that standard on PC, too.
Soon Google could show tablet makers like ASUS, HTC, Lenovo, and Motorola how a real Android tablet is made. During an interview with an Italian newspaper this week, Eric Schmidt, Google's Executive Chairman, mentioned plans “to market a tablet of the highest quality”.
The idea sounds similar to Google's Nexus line of smartphones.
Google typically helms the designs of those devices, and the final products are usually treated as the ideal pairing of hardware with Android software.
Though the often-talkative Schmidt says little else along the lines of confirmed plans, he does give the tablet a six month window.
The rest of the article finds Schmidt waxing on the nature of capitalism and the spirit of competition between Apple and Google, as well as American tech makers taking on new products from manufacturers in Europe and Asia.

The present study of 180,520 paired measurements from 86,037 complete twin pairs in 20 countries revealed that environmental factors shared by co-twins contribute to the inter-individual variation in height from infancy to early adulthood. The relative proportion of common environmental factors was greatest during the first years of life, representing almost half of the variation at age 1, and decreased over childhood and adolescence. The interpretation of these results, however, deserves some caution. It has been questioned whether twin studies are suitable for estimating heritability of height in infancy, since early growth patterns in twins differ considerably from singleton growth patterns25. Prenatal environmental factors can act very differently on MZ twins leading to differences in body size within pairs (the most extreme case is the twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome). This is an important issue because in the classical twin design heritability is estimated by comparing the resemblance of MZ and DZ twin pairs, and thus body size differences in MZ pairs will result in lower heritability estimates. Since children may take several years to fully catch-up after birth, the high proportion of height variation explained by the shared environment in infancy may still reflect these prenatal environmental factors. Among other possible explanations, it might be that the shared environment represents the effects of gestational age or the effects of the higher measurement error (correlated in twins) at earlier ages.
The influence of the shared environment on height variation up to 19 years, which is consistent with previous studies in adolescents19 and adults21 with enough statistical power to detect this component, suggests that adult height variation reflects childhood living conditions. Studies have shown that the secular trend in adult height occurs during the first two years of life mainly due to increases in leg length26. A plausible explanation is that the period of most rapid growth, when the effect of an adverse environment is strongest, coincides with the period when most growth takes place in the long bones of the legs26. Multinational studies analyzing the genetic and environmental influences on body length segments, particularly leg length, are thus needed to disentangle the aetiology of total height variation. The small but considerable effect of unique environment on height variation, very similar across ages, may partly be due to measurement error, which is modelled as part of unique environmental factors. However, it is likely that it also reflects real environmental factors, for example, different exposure to childhood diseases.
A recent and large meta-analysis of twin correlations and variance components for 17,804 traits carried out separately in four age groups (0–11, 12–17, 18–64 and 65+ years) showed that the heritability estimate of height at 12–17 years was considerably greater than at 0–11 years27. Given the rapid growth that occurs in infancy, childhood and adolescence, in this individual-based pooled analysis we analyzed the heritability of height in one year age groups. We found that genetic contributions increase over childhood with heritability estimates in the range of previous studies in children and adults15,16,18,20,21. GWA studies have identified many common genetic variants for adult height. The most recent GWA meta-analysis in 253,288 individuals of European ancestry identified 697 genome-wide significant SNPs in 423 loci that together explained one-fifth of the heritability for adult height10. Further, in a study using whole-genome sequencing data from 44,126 unrelated individuals, all imputed variants explained 56% of variance for height suggesting that missing heritability is negligible for human height28. However, much less is known on the genetics of height in children. Van der Valk et al.29 found that polygenic scores based on 180 SNPs previously associated with adult height explained 2.95% of the variance of infant length, and that of 180 known adult height loci, only 11 were genome-wide significantly associated with infant length.
The pattern of total height variation across ages was largely driven by genetic variance. The most consistent result is the increasing genetic variance with age, reaching its peak at around 13 years in girls and 14 years in boys. After that point, even if mean height continued to increase, genetic variance started to decrease in such a way that in late adolescence the magnitude was similar to that before pubertal events start. Adolescence is characterized by the onset of puberty and the occurrence of growth spurts. Although a secular and population-dependent decline has been observed in the age at onset of pubertal growth spurt and peak height velocity since the mid 1900s30,31, the pubertal height spurt generally begins at age 10–11 years in girls and 11–13 years in boys and reaches peak height velocity at about 12 years and 14 years, respectively13,30. In this study, twins within age groups are at various stages of puberty. In addition to the substantial heritability reported for pubertal timing32, a genome-wide genetic correlation (0.13) between age at menarche and adult height has also been found33. In fact, a genome-wide association meta-analysis showed that five loci associated with pubertal timing impacted multiple aspects of growth, both before and during puberty34. Therefore, it is possible that some of the genetic variance in height at these ages is confounded with genetic variance in pubertal events.
In spite of the largely similar age patterns observed in boys and girls, boys showed somewhat greater heritability estimates and genetic variation, especially in late adolescence. Greater heritability estimates in boys than in girls have previously been reported from birth through 19 years15 and in adulthood21. Moreover, some studies have shown a sex-specific genetic effect on height variation in adolescents19 and adults24. It is clear that both of the sex chromosomes are implicated in determining mean height. Short stature has been demonstrated in females with Turner syndrome who have only one X chromosome35 and taller stature seen in XYY men compared with XY men36. However, sex chromosomes have also been associated with height variation; for example, Gudbjartsson et al.37 identified 27 regions of the genome including a locus on X chromosome that together explained around 3.7% of the population variation in height. In our multinational data, the lowest genetic correlations within opposite-sex DZ pairs were found at 14–16 years of age and again at 18 years, suggesting that sex-specific genes have a role in the genetic variation of height not only during puberty, but also in late adolescence.
Comparison between geographic-cultural regions showed that mean height was greatest in Europe, somewhat shorter in North-America and Australia and shortest in East-Asia, but total variance was largest in North-America and Australia. Accordingly, genetic variation was also greatest in North-America and Australia and lowest in East-Asia. However, the relative proportions of additive and environmental variations were more similar in the different geographic-cultural regions. These results are consistent with a previous comparative twin study which found that the mean and variance of height were larger in Caucasian than in East-Asian populations in adolescence, but the heritability estimates were still at the same level19. An important proportion of the differences in total variances between geographic-cultural regions were attributable to genetic differences. It may be that allelic frequencies and effects of the genes involved in height vary between Europeans, North-Americans and Australians and East-Asians, leading to differences in genetic variation between the three population groups. A recent study across 14 European countries found that many independent loci contribute to population genetic differences in height, and estimated that these differences account for 24% of the captured additive genetic variance38. However, a major part of the differences in genetic variation may also be because of gene-environment interactions modelled as part of the additive genetic component in our model. That is, the higher genetic variation observed in Caucasians could arise because there is a set of genes expressed more strongly in Western environments. For example, a study of adults of Japanese descent living in the United States and native Japanese found that Japanese men and women were shorter than Japanese-Americans, suggesting that environmental factors play a role in physical growth39. Analyzing this question in detail would require collection of twins or GWA studies in unrelated individuals with East-Asian origin living in a Western environment.
The study in Caucasian and East-Asian populations showed that approximately 91% of the differences in the total variance between these two population groups was attributable to genetic variances19. However, our study found that shared environmental variance also differed between geographic-cultural regions. The lower shared environmental variance observed in East Asian girls and greater in North-America and Australia during childhood may reflect cultural differences in terms of nutrition and other environmental resources. It is also important to note that we limited our East-Asian cohorts to affluent East-Asian populations including the Shandong and Guangdong provinces but excluding poorer areas of China. As reported previously, the heritability estimates of height were considerably lower and common environmental estimates higher in the poorer areas40, which may indicate larger differences between families in nutrition and infection history in these areas of China. This emphasizes the need to collect data on twins living under different environmental exposures.
The main strength of the present study is the very large sample size of our multinational database of twin cohorts, with height data from 1 through 19 years of age, allowing a more detailed investigation of the genetic and environmental contributions to individual differences in height during childhood and adolescence than in the previous studies. Twin participants are from 20 different countries, thereby making it possible to stratify the analyses by regions representing different ethnicities and environments. Important advantages of individual-based data are better opportunities for statistical modelling and lack of publication bias. However, our study also has limitations. The equal-environment assumption, upon which twin methodology is based, assumes that MZ and DZ twins are equally exposed to environmental factors relevant to the outcome. If equal-environment assumption is violated, it should be seen as differences in variances between MZ and DZ twins, but we did not find such evidence. In the classical twin design phenotypic assortment increases DZ correlations and thus inflates the common environmental component when not accounted for in the modelling. Assortative mating is well recognized for height, and when the potential underestimation of heritability estimates was corrected using a sample of twins and their parents41, these authors showed that doing so increased the heritability estimates from 0.75 to 0.85. In our database we do not have information on parental height and thus could not take into account assortative mating, which may thus explain part of the shared environmental variation. A recent study showed that increased homozygosity, which is influenced by inbreeding, was associated with decreased height and that the effect sizes were similar across different continental groups and populations with different degrees of genome-wide homozygosity42. These authors thus suggested that homozygosity, rather than confounding as a result of environmental or additive genetic effects, directly contributes to phenotypic variance42. Further, most of the height measures were self-reported43, which are prone to error and can bias our analyses toward lower heritability estimates and higher estimates of unique environmental effects. Finally, countries and/or ethnic-cultural regions are not equally represented, and the database is heavily weighted towards populations following the Westernized lifestyle; even when the large majority of the twin cohorts in the world participated in this project, our data still had limited power for East-Asia especially in adolescence. An even bigger problem is that there are few data available from South-Asia, Middle-East and Africa and no data from South-America. This demonstrates the need for new data collections in these regions.
Our findings provide further insights into height variation during childhood and adolescence in populations representing different ethnicities and exposed to different environments. Worthwhile objectives for future research are to study whether the same genetic and environmental factors contributing to height variation operate throughout time or new genes or new environmental factors start to operate at different ages, and to analyze the heritability of growth in height. Further, a major challenge in future studies with more information on birth and pregnancy related variables is to explore the reasons for the low heritability of height at young ages.
In conclusion, environmental factors shared by co-twins exert their strongest influence on height variation in childhood, but these effects remain until the onset of adulthood. Genetic variation in height increased steadily during childhood and reached its peak at around 13 years in girls and 14 years in boys, which may be confounded with genetic variation in pubertal events. Especially in adolescence, there was a trend toward somewhat greater genetic variation in boys than in girls, and part of the genetic variation of height was sex-specific. Genetic variation of height was larger in North-America and Australia and Europe compared with East-Asia, but the relative proportions of genetic and environmental variations between these three geographic-cultural regions were roughly similar. These findings suggest that, in spite of different ethnicities and environmental exposures, genetic factors play a major role on height variation in adolescence and early adulthood, but environmental factors shared by co-twins are also important.
AS COLLEGE PROFESSORS, my colleagues and I have always enjoyed the enthusiastic students who are eager to learn more. Those who stand out in my memory are those who have requested more reading material. I have taught basic introductory biology, genetics, bioinformatics, courses in high-dimensional genomic and proteomic data analysis, and courses in study design and research ethics – and I always loved the gleam in the eye of students who just want to know.
Paging Dr. Offit!
Dr. Paul Offit earned millions of dollars from the sale of his patent for the Rotavirus vaccine after he voted to have it included in the pediatric vaccine schedule. He also appears to not be familiar with the body of peer-reviewed literature that condemns aluminum as a serious neurotoxin with well-characterized mechanisms of neurological damage.
In his book, “Deadly Choices: How the Anti-Vaccine Movement Threatens Us All” (Basic Books, New York), Offit is irresponsibly and recklessly dismissive of aluminum as a serious threat to the health of nearly all people by falsely reporting that:
“aluminum has been found to be harmful in only two groups of people: severely premature infants who receive large quantities of aluminum in intravenous fluids, and people on chronic dialysis (for kidney failure) who receive large quantities of aluminum in antacids”.
People absorb around very little of the aluminum they eat, but they absorb 100% of the aluminum injected in to their blood stream. [GENEROUSLY OFFERED CORRECTION/DETAILS: From Vaccine Papers, Al absorption from food is about 0.3%, typically within a range of 0.1-1%]. Offit claims, without citation, that aluminum in very quickly cleared from the body. He cites “researchers” (without citations) who studied aluminum concentrations in “blood” before and after receipt of aluminum-containing vaccines, and reports “No difference”.
Offit's book was published in 2011. Unfortunately, it is evident that Offit did not even bother to search of the Pubmed, a wonderful public scientific research literature database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information, the standard resource for researchers who desire to know the latest on research topics in medicine, biology, psychiatry, and many other disciplines. A search reveals over 200 studies or papers on aluminum neurotoxicity before 2011. At the time of this writing (Nov. 2015), there are 393 studies or papers on the neurotoxicity of aluminum.
Some of these studies include direct discussions on the risk of aluminum in adjuvants in vaccines and provide data that demonstrate how aluminum works as a neurotoxin. Others discuss ways to alleviate neurotoxicity of aluminum. Others describe aluminum as a well-known neurotoxin responsible as a causal agent for neurodegenerative diseases.
Surely Offit, an expert placed on the National Vaccine Advisory Committee, the body in HHS responsible for making decisions on changes to the pediatric vaccine schedule, would have bothered to check the literature prior to 2011 while writing his book? If he had, he would have found studies with some compelling titles. The abstracts, and the papers themselves, are damning evidence for the use of aluminum as a vaccine adjuvant.
Here are some titles of the studies available at the time of his book-writing that individuals who are serious about vaccine safety might be interested in. Dr. Offit, for your convenience, I have included the links directly to the Pubmed entry:
“Long-term persistence of vaccine-derived aluminum hydroxide is associated with chronic cognitive dysfunction.” (2009)
“Aluminum hydroxide injections lead to motor deficits and motor neuron degeneration.” (2009)
“Aluminum-induced defective mitochondrial metabolism perturbs cytoskeletal dynamics in human astrocytoma cells.“(2009)
“Role of metal ions in the abeta oligomerization in Alzheimer's disease and in other neurological disorders.” (2008)
“Aluminum adjuvant linked to Gulf War illness induces motor neuron death in mice.” (2007)
“Neurological adverse events of immunization: experience with an aluminum adjuvanted meningococcal B outer membrane vesicle vaccine.” (2007)
“Mechanisms of aluminum-induced neurodegeneration in animals: Implications for Alzheimer's disease.” (2007)
“Inflammation, neurodegenerative diseases, and environmental exposures.” (2004)
“Chronic exposure to aluminum in drinking water increases inflammatory parameters selectively in the brain.” (2004)
“Neurotoxic effects of aluminium among foundry workers and Alzheimer's disease.” (2004)
“Neurological adverse events associated with vaccination.” (2002)
“The potential role of aluminium in Alzheimer's disease.” (2002)
Just in case Dr. Offit is still involved in vaccine research, development or policy, and since he makes statements that appear in news articles on vaccine safety, I have taken the time to create a second reading list of more recent articles as well that Dr. Offit can add to his first reading list. Medical doctors really should keep abreast of new developments in medical research to stay professionally accredited.
But first, I have a hypothesis to share, which is indicated by past studies of numerous types. It came to me during my research for my forthcoming book, “Genetic and Environmental Causes of Autism”.
Is Macrophagic myofasciitis (MMF) Vaccine-Related Adult-Onset Autism/ASD?
A study in 2001 – a full decade before Offit's book – reported central nervous system ailments eerily similar to those found in autism in patients diagnosed with macrophagic myofasciitis, symptomatic demyelinating CNS disorder, hemisensory or sensorimotor symptoms, bilateral pyramidal signs, cerebellar signs, visual loss, cognitive and behavioural disorders, and bladder dysfunction, supratentorial white matter hyperintense signals and corpus callosum atrophy (Authier et al., 2001).
Clinical features of MMF as described by Rigolet et al., (2014) are also strongly reminiscent of autism, including marked cognitive deficits (not related to pain, fatigue, or depression) including dysexecutive syndrome and visual memory impairment, and some cognitive deficits can appear unusually severe. Cognitive dysfunction was found to be stable over time. They also report that “classical therapeutic approaches are usually unsatisfactory making patient care difficult”.
Autism also involves cognitive deficits, executive function issues, memory impairment, and can involve severe cognitive deficits that are recalcitrant to treatment.
Additional Findings Support the Hypothesis
Mice injected with aluminum adjuvant doses equivalent to those given to US military service personnel showed both neuroinflammation and cell loss in the spinal cord and motor cortex, with consequent memory deficits (Petrik et al., 2007).
The cause of MMF has since been identified aluminum hydroxide from vaccines lesions (Gherardi et al., 2001; Authier et al., 2006; Gherardi et al., 2012; Rigolet M et al., 2014). Patients with MMF have an unusually long reaction at the site of injection of aluminum-containing vaccines in their muscle, and biospies show infiltration of muscle tissue by macrophages.
Here is chilling description of the effect of aluminum when used as an adjuvant:
“…poorly biodegradable aluminum-coated particles injected into muscle are promptly phagocytosed in muscle and the draining lymph nodes, and can disseminate within phagocytic cells throughout the body and slowly accumulate in the brain” (Gherardi et al., 2015).
This is important: microglial cells are macrophages with dual roles in the brain: they perform routine surveillance and clean-up of cellular debris, viruses and bacteria. Upon infection, or serious brain damage, however, they become activated, change shape, and go on the attack. Microglial overactivation is a leading candidate for increased apoptosis and neurological damage associated with autism.
The neurotoxic effects of aluminum salts are also apparent: it increases levels of glial activation, inflammatory cytokines and amyloid precursor protein within the brain (Bondy, 2010). Amyloid precursor protein is one of the main culprits for Alzheimer's disease.
The medical community and the public should revisit the issue of whether aluminum is a necessary adjuvant for vaccines. Evidently, for some vaccines that use virus-like particles as opposed to attenuated or live virus vaccines, no adjuvant is needed.
Reading List #2
Here is the rest of Dr. Offit's reading list of studies and papers published after 2010:
“Trace elements in scalp hair samples from patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.” (2015)
“Correlation of aluminum and manganese concentration in scalp hair samples of patients having neurological disorders.” (2015)
“Aluminum-induced entropy in biological systems: implications for neurological disease.” (2014)
“Are there negative CNS impacts of aluminum adjuvants used in vaccines and immunotherapy?” (2014)
“A sudden onset of a pseudo-neurological syndrome after HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvated vaccine: might it be an autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA) presenting as a somatoform disorder?” (2014)
“Elevated brain aluminium and early onset Alzheimer's disease in an individual occupationally exposed to aluminium: a case report.” (2014)
“Prolonged exposure to low levels of aluminum leads to changes associated with brain aging and neurodegeneration.” (2014)
“Administration of aluminium to neonatal mice in vaccine-relevant amounts is associated with adverse long term neurological outcomes.” (2013)
“Aluminum in the central nervous system (CNS): toxicity in humans and animals, vaccine adjuvants, and autoimmunity.” (2013)
“Autoimmune/autoinflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA syndrome) in commercial sheep.” (2013)
“How aluminum, an intracellular ROS generator promotes hepatic and neurological diseases: the metabolic tale.” (2013)
“Aluminum toxicity and astrocyte dysfunction: a metabolic link to neurological disorders.” (2011)
“Aluminum vaccine adjuvants: are they safe?” (2011)
“Metal ions affecting the neurological system.” (2011)
To be clear, Dr. Offit's book could not include the references from the second reading list, as his book was published in 2011. But in the page and a half he takes to uses to claim that aluminum is only a problem for people with kidney failure and premature infants is terribly misleading, and is now also woefully out of date. As he and his profit-driven colleagues saw fit to allow vaccinations in babies between the age of 1 day to 2 years, it is of little reassurance that he knew that aluminum was harmful to premature babies.
Perhaps Dr. Offit was also not aware that the WHO Vaccine Safety Advisory Committee had, long before 2011, reported that there may be a subset of predisposed individuals who may be sensitive to aluminum-containing adjuvant (Authier et al., 2001).
Published scientific knowledge does not appear to play a role in the formation of vaccination policy in the United States.

Sorcerous Origin: Illithid
Your innate magic comes from Illithid blood that flows in your veins. At some point in your heritage, one of your ancestors made a bargain with one of these alien creatures, or perhaps even consummated a relationship with one. As a result, a remnant of the creatures psionic powers manifests in you.
Psionic Bloodline
You gain the following spells as sorcerer spells at the listed sorcerer level. These spells do not count against the number of sorcerer spells you know, and you can cast them without using Verbal, Somatic or Material components.
Bonus Spells
Sorcerer Level Spell 1st Dissonant Whispers 3rd Detect Thoughts 5th Fear 7th Compulsion 9th Dominate person
Mind Link
Starting at 1st level, your alien blood gives you the ability to touch the minds of other creatures. You can communicate telepathically with any creature whose presence you are aware of within 60 feet of you. You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language.
Shielded Mind
Starting at 6th level, your thoughts cannot be read by telepathy or other means unless you allow it. You have resistance to psychic damage, and when a creature deals psychic damage to you, as a reaction you can force them to take the same amount of damage as you do.
Psychic Assault
At 14th level you gain the ability to lash out with your psionic powers, tormenting the mind of one creature. Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with a spell attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through a nightmare-scape. The creature retreats into its mind where it is assaulted by horrific visions. Until the end of your next turn, the target is stunned. At the end of your next turn it takes 8d8 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
Psionic Nova
At 18th level, as an action you can overcharge your psychic powers. For one minute you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed, you become immune to psychic damage, any creature hostile to you that starts its turn within 30 feet of you takes 2d12 psychic damage, and whenever you deal psychic damage, you gain temporary hitpoints equal to the amount of damage done.
Administration officials discussed all of these steps before the presidential election. But the combination of President Obama 's re-election, which has made the White House more willing to take risks, and a series of recent tactical successes by rebel forces, one senior administration official said, “has given this debate a new urgency, and a new focus.”

The outcome of the broader debate about how heavily America should intervene in another Middle Eastern conflict remains uncertain. Mr. Obama's record in intervening in the Arab Spring has been cautious: While he joined in what began as a humanitarian effort in Libya , he refused to put American military forces on the ground and, with the exception of a C.I.A. and diplomatic presence, ended the American role as soon as Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi was toppled.
In the case of Syria, a far more complex conflict than Libya's, some officials continue to worry that the risks of intervention — both in American lives and in setting off a broader conflict, potentially involving Turkey — are too great to justify action. Others argue that more aggressive steps are justified in Syria by the loss in life there, the risks that its chemical weapons could get loose, and the opportunity to deal a blow to Iran 's only ally in the region. The debate now coursing through the White House, the Pentagon, the State Department and the C.I.A. resembles a similar one among America's main allies.
“Look, let's be frank, what we've done over the last 18 months hasn't been enough,” Britain 's prime minister, David Cameron, said three weeks ago after visiting a Syrian refugee camp in Jordan . “The slaughter continues, the bloodshed is appalling, the bad effects it's having on the region, the radicalization, but also the humanitarian crisis that is engulfing Syria. So let's work together on really pushing what more we can do.” Mr. Cameron has discussed those options directly with Mr. Obama, White House officials say.
France and Britain have recognized a newly formed coalition of opposition groups, which the United States helped piece together. So far, Washington has not done so.
American officials and independent specialists on Syria said that the administration was reviewing its Syria policy in part to gain credibility and sway with opposition fighters, who have seized key Syrian military bases in recent weeks.
“The administration has figured out that if they don't start doing something, the war will be over and they won't have any influence over the combat forces on the ground,” said Jeffrey White, a former Defense Intelligence Agency intelligence officer and specialist on the Syria military. “They may have some influence with various political groups and factions, but they won't have influence with the fighters, and the fighters will control the territory.”

Another person who has been consulted and briefed on the administration's thinking about Syria said, “The U.S. won't be able to maintain the position where it's been,” adding, “Whatever we do will be done in close coordination with the allies.”

Senior Congressional officials and diplomats in the region said that they had not been briefed on any impending policy shifts and expressed doubts any would be made until Mr. Obama had selected his new national security team, including new secretaries of state and defense, a new director of the C.I.A. and perhaps more. In recent months, these officials and diplomats said that the administration had kept them updated about its Syria policy.
Until now, the United States has offered only limited support to the military campaign against the Syrian government, instead providing nearly $200 million in humanitarian and other nonlethal aid. In addition, a small number of C.I.A. officers have operated secretly in southern Turkey for several months, according to American officials and Arab intelligence officers, helping allies decide which Syrian opposition fighters across the border would receive weapons.
The weapons, including automatic rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and ammunition are funneled mostly across the Turkish border by way of a shadowy network of intermediaries overseen mainly by Saudi Arabia and Qatar, American officials said. Even that limited effort is being revamped in the wake of evidence that most arms sent to Syrian opposition fighters are going to hard-line Islamic jihadists, not to the more secular opposition groups supported by the West.

American officials say the administration is now weighing whether the United States should play a more direct role in supplying the opposition fighters with weapons to help ensure that the arms reach the intended groups.
“The problem right now is that we don't have much visibility into where these weapons are going,” one senior administration official said recently. “That's the problem with outsourcing the issue.”
On the more immediate concern about defending Turkey, NATO is expected to act on the Patriot missile request next week. On Wednesday night, Mr. Obama's national security adviser, Thomas E. Donilon , told an audience at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard that “we'd be very much in favor of” the Turkish request for Patriot missiles “in terms of protecting the security of our ally.” The Patriot PAC-3 is the most modern air defense system in the American and NATO arsenals.
Cable Prices Increased At 4 Times the Rate of Inflation. Further proof that cable companies are price gouging their customers? According to this report cable prices increased at 4 times the rate of inflation. Have you gotten 4 times the amount of service from your cable service? My guess is you haven't.
Now this isn't entirely on cable providers. Content providers have continued to charge cable companies a greater fee to air their programming as well, ESPN is well known for this sort of over charging. However I can't imagine the rate that content providers charge cable companies has increased as much as the rate cable companies has charged consumers (I wasn't able to immediately find numbers to support this so there is a possibility that I am wrong) so the cable companies are not off the hook for the responsibility here.
This is further proof that the entire business model needs to change. Cable companies need to either force a change in the paradigm so that they can offer Ala Carte cable subscriptions like people want , or they need to be removed from the process altogether so that consumer can buy their content directly from the provider and allow market forced to dictate the price people are willing to pay to get what they want. Few other industries are allowed to raise prices at this rate without feeling the wrath of the market, cable and content providers shouldn't be allowed to either. Keep seeking alternatives to cable tv so we can show these corporations we will not be at their mercy to get what we want. Let's find some alternatives to cable TV.

They are a familiar fixture at our city's busiest intersections — panhandlers. They often carry signs asking for a good deed, money or food and sometimes offering a clever joke.
You see them on the same corner, time and time again. You either scrape up the loose change in your cup holder, avert your eyes, or, simply mouth the word "sorry" as they pass by your vehicle window.
When it comes to actually tracking who they are and how long they have been panhandling, it's not that simple because there is no social service agency or government entity that tracks panhandlers.
They are not necessarily homeless and not included specifically in a homeless census, such as Winnipeg Street Census, nor are they tracked by the Biz Groups in Winnipeg.
Winnipeg police do not keep tabs on who panhandlers are, if they are repeat offenders when it comes to bylaw infractions, or how many tickets they might hand out in any given year to panhandlers. The courts don't even specifically track if these tickets are ever paid.
Panhandlers are a part of our population but never get counted. So when we see the same faces, at the same intersections, at the same time of day, season after season. How do we know who these people really are? Do we want to?
Three of them shared their stories with us.
Brian Minchin
Brian Minchin, 50, has been panhandling for the past decade. He is a familiar fixture at street corners on Osborne Street. 5:21 It's 4:30 in the afternoon. Traffic is picking up. There's construction and a long line of cars. This is peak hour for Brian Minchin. This is his corner — Osborne and Broadway.
A tattered cardboard sign is held humbly. He paces back and forth through the string of cars. His voice is worn, yet calls out to each passing driver with a friendly "hi", dragging out the "i". A few hands reach from inside warm vehicles to offer meagre handfuls of loose change.
Minchin, 50, has been panhandling for the past decade. He is a familiar fixture at that corner. He's out three to four days per week working the afternoon drive home. He makes about $40 to $50 dollars each time. Minchin makes enough money to buy food, a pack of smokes and maybe a Sports Select or two.
Minchin is on social assistance. He hasn't worked a steady job in years. His rent, in a core area rooming house, is covered by social assistance. He gets $125 every two weeks to pay for everything else.
This is the only way to survive. You can't survive on what social services gives you. - Brian Minchin
"This is the only way to survive. You can't survive on what social services gives you," said Minchin.
His phone and cable bill is $80 a month, just another thing that he couldn't afford if he was living strictly off of assistance. "Why should I suffer and not have any luxuries," he says. Brian Minchin panhandles at the corner of Broadway Avenue and Osborne Street 3 to 4 times a week (Holly Caruk)
Minchin has depression and an array of other health problems. He feels he won't be able to get a job because of his criminal record. "Who's going to hire a bank robber?," said Minchin.
In 2008 his son, Michael Langan, died after being shocked by a police stun gun. He was just 17 years old. Shortly after his death, Minchin robbed a bank.
"I wanted to pay for a headstone, I had no money, no way of paying," Minchin says of the crime.
He spent eight months in jail, long enough to save up his disability cheques to help pay for a gravestone.
Christopher Wings
Christopher Wings, 30, has a high school diploma and a carpenters' ticket, but says he's never been able to find work that would pay him what he makes panhandling. He lives on social assistance and in subsidized housing. 4:04
It's 3 o'clock on a Friday afternoon. Christopher Wings' feet shuffle through the gravel along the boulevard as he makes his way down the line of traffic. He works the corner at Stradbrook Avenue and Main Street, or one nearby, nearly everyday. He has been panning for 11 years.
Wings, 30, has a high school diploma and a carpenters' ticket, but says he's never been able to find work that would pay him what he makes panhandling. He lives on social assistance and in subsidized housing.
Earning roughly $15 an hour, and keeping his own hours, Wings is able to get by. He earns enough for food, cigarettes, supplies for his cat and even saves money to buy Christmas presents. Wing owns a gaming system and has cable and a cell phone. All of which would not be possible if he didn't panhandle to make extra money.

Wing doesn't often drink alcohol, though he admits to smoking marijuana daily. He says most who panhandle in this city aren't homeless. "Usually they're all people who have homes and they just want to get drunk that day or high that day. Depends on what their habits are," he says.
Wing says he can get whatever he asks for on his sign, from food, to smokes, to prescription drugs. He says he has never felt unsafe and has only had a few problems with other panhandlers. He says the biggest problem he faces is the attention from the Winnipeg Police Cadets. "They're jealous that I make more in an hour than they do," says Wings.

"They just flash their lights, or they take your sign, or they'll give you a ticket," says Wings, who admits he has received about a dozen tickets but has only paid for two.
"Usually everybody who gets tickets on this corner, they don't pay them" he says.
Mike
Mike has been using a wheelchair to get around for two years. Mike was hit while trying to retrieve cash from a stopped vehicle. 4:09
It's nearly 11 am. It's cold and has rained the night before. Mike's wheelchair is sinking into the mud at the corner of Broadway Avenue and Maryland Street. He's come all the way from the St. James area by bus to panhandle at this corner.
His sign reads "SPARE CHANGE. ANYTHING HELP" He laughs as he says he ran out of room for the "S". He sits patiently, pulling his hoodie up over his ears and waits for cars.
He can't manoeuvre around the cars or leave the curb so he relies on the small number of cars lining up to make a left turn onto Broadway. He wheels up and down the muddy patch of grass to collect the small offerings from waiting cars.
Mike has been using a wheelchair to get around for two years. He can walk when he needs to, but it causes him a lot of pain and his leg often buckles beneath him. His leg was badly broken when he was hit by a car not far from where he is panhandling today. Mike was hit while trying to retrieve cash from a stopped vehicle.
"I was going out to collect a $50-dollar bill and basically some moron came blowing around the corner not paying attention…wiped me across the front of his hood. I basically shattered my leg," he says. Mike has been using a wheelchair for the last two years, after getting hit by a vehicle while panhandling.
Mike, who didn't want to give his last name, lives on social assistance because of his disability. He is 26 years old and admits that he has been panhandling since he was 16.
"I was homeless. I had no money. No food. I was living on the streets. I was in CFS care at the time and I was a runaway," he says.
Mike sees panning as a way to get by. He says while it's different from the average 9 to 5, he still sees it as a job, and a way to survive. "Being in a wheelchair and trying to find a place to work isn't that easy," he says.
If you see someone out here, don't assume that we're all drug addicted losers. - Mike
Mike says finding wheelchair accessible housing is also a challenge for someone on social assistance. He lives in a group home and his rent is paid for by the government.
He gets $242 a month from social assistance for personal spending money. From this, he has to pay for his own food, clothing and transportation. He also buys cigarettes and food for his cat.
"If you see someone out here, don't assume that we're all drug addicted losers. I don't want to be out here. It's not like I wake up in the morning [and think] I want to go panhandle today. No it's not like that. You've got to do what you've got to do to survive," he says.
…and the technical parameters of our sequencing run.
Last week we gave you a brief and general overview of the different technologies that are available if you want to sequence a genome. So, how did we end up selecting Illumina sequencing? Since we're frequently asked about our choice of technology, this post is dedicated to this topic. We'll also discuss some of the technical details of our sequencing run, so if you're interested in these kinds of things, keep reading.
Basically, our choice was an absolutely pragmatic one: We wanted to maximize our chances of finding something. Now, in terms of sequencing probably any of the available technologies would have given us data, but choosing the right one can make a difference when it comes to analyze certain parts of the genome. We decided to work with a method that was well-established in the institute where Daniel and Darío work. Their institute has an excellent sequencing facility, which routinely does Illumina sequencing and lots of complicated analysis, and so we have relied on their help and expertise throughout the hands-on part of the LilBUBome. Hence, why we chose Illumina.
As an added bonus there have been some unexpected benefits:
As you may know, we are doing the LilBUBome as a labour of love, in addition to our regular work. We did not expect, however, that collaborating scientists would do the same. But they did! So we would like to use this opportunity to thank the staff of the Max Planck Institute's Sequencing Facility, who have generously donated their hands and minds to the LilBUBome, completely free of charge! You already know Norbert from previous posts (for example here and here), but the same acknowledgment can be extended to the whole team. You are great!!! After we had completed crowdfunding and were preparing for the actual sequencing, Illumina kindly offered to provide us with free reagents for the sequencing . After some hesitation, we decided to accept the offer. Primarily, because it allowed us to upgrade the technology* – we were able to sequence Lil BUBs genome in more depth and quality, thus increasing our chances of success. In addition, we could use a method and a machine that's much faster than the one we originally wanted to use (20 hours compared to 11 days!!!). And finally, this also means that we can make your donations go even further, to fully verify our findings from the sequencing (stay tuned!) with additional experiments.

Welcome to the McMurdo Dry Valleys, the largest ice-free region in Antarctica and one of the driest places on the planet. Most of the continent is covered in thick ice, but this place is a striking exception. Sheltering mountains and dry winds from the continent preserve a frigid desert that defies all expectations.
It is not barren: Scientists have spent decades studying the extreme environment and the microscopic life that survives there. The Dry Valleys may well be our closest equivalent to a Martian landscape.
Four journalists from The New York Times visited the Dry Valleys in December — summer in the Southern Hemisphere. We also made virtual-reality film based on that flight, along with three other films about the changing continent. Here's some of what we learned.

The answer is "a lot".
That curse thing (right out of Ranma 1/2) could be done without breaking immortal law if she could convince herself the curse was empowerment, but she'd have to honestly believe that. She couldn't just create an argument for it that might convince someone else. Her actual intent would have to be “this is empowering them”, not “if anyone asks, this is empowering them”.
While I don't plan on revealing Hanma's exact age (or am even sure of it myself), it's been suggested to me that she should have last reset during the 90s, and found herself in the middle the explosion of anime popularity that happened in the USA back then. That 100% makes sense to me, and fits with the general canon that she's significantly older than "new" Jerry while not being at an age that would make her overly powerful.
You may have noticed that I said "canon" in the last paragraph in spite of this storyline being non-canon. The storyline's not canon, but Hanma definitely is. She has to be. Just look at that face. She can't be stuck in non-canonville forever. I don't know if she'll have much to DO in canon, mind, but she's out there, somewhere, being all officially canon and what-not.
Well, that, and there can be a canon to the non-canon, if you get my meaning. NONETHELESS, I felt it important to establish that Hanma exists in canon.

BREAKING: Vegas Shooter's Girlfriend Considered a ‘Person of Interest' in Investigation
In a bizarre turn of events, NBC News reported Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock wired $100,000 to the Philippines one week before Sunday's mass murder.
Marilou Danley traveled to Hong Kong from the Philippines last Monday the 25th. Her boyfriend Stephen Paddock went to the Manalay Bay Hotel on last Thursday to prepare for his mass killing at the country music festival.
Police said Tuesday afternoon that they considered Danley a person of interest in the investigation, according to Fox News.
As previously reported, Danley moved into an apartment owned by Paddock in February 2013. Her divorce was finalized in 2015.
Australian media said she was on vacation in the Philippines with three girlfriends.
RGJ reported:
During her divorce, Marilou Danley listed a downtown Reno unit at the Montage on Sierra Street as her address. At the time, the unit was owned by shooting suspect Stephen Paddock. Court records indicated that she started living at the address in August 2013. Paddock sold the condominium in December 2016.
According the ABS-CBN Danley was in Manila, Philippines and then flew to Hong Kong for a short trip.
Bureau of Immigration (BI) officials at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport confirmed that Marilou Danley, said to be gunman Stephen Paddock's girlfriend, arrived in Manila from Hong Kong on Sept. 25 via Cebu Pacific flight 5J 115. Based on immigration records, she had flown from Manila on Sept. 22 for a 4-day trip to Hong Kong via Cebu Pacific flight 5J 108. It remains unclear where she came from before her Manila- Hong Kong- Manila trip.
Now this…
Fox News:
Investigators are looking into whether Paddock sent the cash to Danley amid conflicting reports she's in either the Philippines or Japan, the officials said. In addition, a U.S. government source told Fox News that federal investigators have interviewed an “immediate relative” of Paddock's girlfriend. This relative said the family found Paddock “unstable,” and he made relatives “uncomfortable.” FBI officials declined to comment on this interview. Investigators noted the money crossing hands was a significant amount and authorities were trying to uncover who received the cash and where it currently is. It was not immediately clear when the money was transferred. Senior law enforcement in the Philippines also confirmed to Fox News that they are reviewing a photo that was taken around 2012 or 2013 purportedly showing Paddock in the country. Law enforcement in the Philippines told Fox News that they are looking into Paddock's potential past visits and they have been contacted by the FBI.

Authorities still have no information to share about a possible motive for the shooting.
Image caption The accounts were made public early on Monday morning
Several private Twitter accounts have been disabled after they were revealed to contain indecent images of children.
Some hacking groups are claiming to have unmasked them, the NSPCC said.
Members of the public have reported the accounts to Greater Manchester Police and North Yorkshire Police, while Ceop - the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre - says it is "aware".
The NSPCC asked people to "be vigilant" and report such suspicious activity.
Ceop - the policing unit dedicated to eradicating the sexual abuse of children - said it had had 25 to 30 reports of these accounts.
A Ceop spokesman said Twitter had disabled the accounts and would be reporting the find to the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) - Ceop's US equivalent - which as an American company it was legally required to.
"NCMEC will forward the account details to law enforcement in the countries where the individual concerned is," he said.
It is unclear whether the images were uploaded by a UK user, or a user based abroad.
The NSPCC said the accounts were made public in the early hours of Monday.
"To be honest, it's not a massive surprise. In our experience sex offenders will use whichever mean they can to connect with each other. They are usually quite devious," a spokesman said.
He asked people to be vigilant.
"If you see something, or are aware of something, you should report it."
As for those people storing such content, Professor Alan Woodward, of the University of Surrey's department of computing, said they were increasingly using social media rather than computers.
"If they use the web to keep any pictures then they will be able to claim it wasn't them. The weight of evidence isn't the same."
Twitter is yet to comment.
SK Gaming Heroes of Newerth roster
"HoN has been a vital part of SK Gaming for just over a year now. The game itself has gained immensely on popularity in the e-sports scene, one just has to look at the number of spectators of streams in the prestigious tournaments. Our former roster had problems finding stability even if we had some of the most skilled players in the lineup. They were able to win the Honcast community vote as the best HoN team globally several times which I find extremely special.
What SK Gaming is seeking though is a stable roster that can exist over a very long period of time. The reason behind this is that we are willing to send the team to Europe for larger events, for example Dreamhack Winter in November. I wanted to thank all of our former members, especially Testie and Fogged for always being a vital part of the lineup but also thanks to Cardinal and Tralfamadore. At the same time I would like to welcome our new HoN roster, which until now, has played under the American Evil Geniuses flag. Robert 'Bdiz' Tinnes, who I personally hold in high regard, as well as Steven 'Korok' Ashworth are returning home so to speak! We are looking forward to seeing your first matches for SK!"
"We've had a rough road when it comes to sponsors. Essentially, everyone so far that wanted to sponsor us wasn't used to dealing with American HoN teams. Every tournament was either a costly LAN in Europe or an online tournament - no American LANs that they could afford to send us to. EG wasn't any different.
Considering the only purpose we would even have to sign with a sponsor is to go to LAN events, this was unacceptable. We've now worked out a deal with SK that is more appropriate for HoN, and look forward to being able to proudly represent SK at any big LAN events that S2 Games or any other organization happens to host for the duration of our cooperation."
"I'm a newer guy with the team, and can't speak of the relationship with EG, however I am looking forward to a bright future with the SK Gaming organization. As many of you know, I played for the organization before for quite a long time. SK has always been a very professional and straight forward organization whenever I talked to them in the past about anything, and I'm looking forward to representing SK at LAN events and meeting some of the faces at SK that I know so well!"
The SK Gaming Heroes of Newerth team, despite sporting some of the most talented players in the world, has been plagued by roster issues for a while now.It is mainly because of this that SK Gaming has decided to release the three remaining members of the SK.HoN line-up, consisting of:SK Gaming would like to wish all of them the best of luck in the future and thank them for their accomplishments under the [SK] tag.This, however, is certainly not the end of the SK Gaming Heroes of Newerth division. We are happy to announce the players that previously played under the Evil Geniuses tag, as the new SK.HoN team.SK Gaming's player managerTimothy 'Merusame' Ellersiek released a statement: Orie 'YoDa' Guo of new SK.HoN said: Robert 'Bdiz' Tinnes added:
You can shred the brussels sprouts this recipe in one of three ways: by hand with a sharp knife, using a mandoline's slicing blade, or in a food processor with the shredding disk. The prosciutto is optional, but
it adds a nice salty contrast to mild shellfish.
Seared Scallops with Warm Shredded Brussels Sprouts and Prosciutto
3 Tbs. olive oil
3 garlic cloves, minced
2 thin slices prosciutto, chopped
12 oz. (375 g) brussels sprouts, shredded
Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste
Juice of 1 lemon
1 lb. (500 g) sea scallops, side muscles removed
In a large nonstick fry pan over medium-high heat, warm 2 Tbs. of the oil. Add the garlic and the
prosciutto and sauté until the garlic softens and the prosciutto begins to crisp, about 3 minutes. Add the
brussels sprouts and season well with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring often, until the brussels sprouts
begin to soften and brown slightly on their edges, about 4 minutes. Stir in the lemon juice and cook for
another 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to a platter.
Using a paper towel, wipe out the frying pan and return it to high heat. Warm the remaining 1 Tbs. oil over high heat. Pat the scallops dry with a paper towel and season with salt and pepper. Sear the scallops until medium-rare, about 3 minutes per side.
Arrange the scallops on top of the brussels sprouts and serve immediately. Serves 4.

When protesters in St. Louis decided it would be a great idea to block a freeway in its third straight week of protests surrounding a former police officer's acquittal on murder charges, very bad things happened.
Police arrested more than 120 of the protesters blocking the highway, The Daily Caller reports. Drivers were warned by police about the protest blocking the highway about 7:40 p.m. local time and had the freeway cleared by about 8 p.m.
Demonstrators blocking motorists inside vehicles & some are marching on I-64. Arrests will be made if they do not disperse. #STLverdict — St. Louis, MO Police (@SLMPD) October 4, 2017
Police managed to get the group off the road, ordering them to the ground and systematically handcuffed them and put them in the back of police transport vans for a quick trip to jail.
One of the protesters was State Rep. Bruce Franks, Jr., who was shocked that he got arrested for blocking a public right-of-way.
We're getting locked up! — Bruce Franks Jr (@brucefranksjr) October 4, 2017
This was the second mass arrest since the acquittal of former officer James Stockley in the 2011 shooting death of Anthony Lamar Clark. He was found not guilty on Sept. 15.
On Sept. 17, 130 protesters were arrested in what they called a “kittling” operation – an action that prompted complaints and misconduct lawsuits from the ACLU and others.
Steven Hoffman, a legal observer for the National Lawyers Guild who was there to monitor police behavior, said police didn't use chemical agents while making arrests, according to the Post-Dispatch. The detail is crucial as the ACLU's earlier lawsuit centers on police misusing chemicals like pepper spray during the previous mass arrest.
No retaliatory lawsuits have yet been filed in the wake of Tuesday night's arrests.
The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports the scene:
Protesters were nearing Market Street when they were met by a police line and they moved onto the sidewalk. The protesters chanted: “We don't see a riot here. Why are you in riot gear?” and “Touch one, touch all.” Police ordered protesters to the ground, then began systematically handcuffing them and packing them into about a dozen police vans. After the sweep, police did not release any information on the number arrested or the charges, but St. Louis Alderman John Collins-Muhammad said 126 people were taken into custody. Police spokeswoman Schron Jackson said Wednesday morning that police made 143 arrests of people for blocking traffic. Police were still compiling names, addresses and charges, which were expected to be released later. Outside, a few dozen protesters whose friends were among the arrested spent the night on the front lawn and sidewalk of the Justice Center. They set up eight tents. Some had gone on a snack run before sunup. They said they were waiting to help bail friends out, once charges are filed.
You can expect howls of protest from leftists who will most certainly complain about their mistreatment, but what do people who block an entire freeway expect? What do you think? What is to be done with scores of leftist protesters who refuse to disperse an illegal protest?
Having the police arrest, handcuff them and haul them off to jail en masse is probably better than running them over.

(CNN) -- How much space do we need to live happily?
Tokyo is a very dense city but manages to have plenty of open spaces.
As rates of urbanization increase, especially in Africa and Asia, close attention is being paid to how and where we live in urban environments.
CNN talks to Jonathan D. Solomon, Assistant Professor of Architecture at Hong Kong University about a concept known as "urban densification" which suggests the most socially and environmentally sustainable way to build homes today is to make them more compact and closer together, but can also serve to preserve communities and public spaces.
CNN: Why should we live more densely?
Jonathan D. Solomon: Dense cities use less energy per person than more dispersed suburban equivalents. When you consider a city in relation to its larger region, the ecological footprint per person in a city may be significantly smaller than rural inhabitation.
This fact pushes the city to the forefront of environmental sustainability and makes the question of density a critical one for the 21st century.
CNN: How does packing us in tightly make for environmental sustainability?
Jonathan D. Solomon: It works in two ways. One way is the obvious scale issue. Smaller spaces take less energy to heat and to cool and use fewer resources to fit out. So by and large, the smaller the space, the smaller the waste.
Secondly, bringing resources to human habitation as well as infrastructure all take a tremendous amount of energy. The cost to construct and coordinate supply chains can be made more vastly efficient when people live in dense communities.
CNN: Doesn't "densification" just mean building high rise apartment blocks?
Jonathan D. Solomon: Not necessarily. Tokyo is one of the densest cities on earth but not very high rise. New Jersey is the densest state in the U.S. and it is entirely suburban. Dense doesn't mean higher, it means being better organized.
When you fill in vacant lots around the city with low rise buildings, you increase density and also link broken communities together. In doing so you increase both environmental and social sustainability. We have the ability to build all these different structures.
CNN: Doesn't that mean less private space for people?
Jonathan D. Solomon: When it comes to private space, densification means reducing that, but it also means finding better ways to increase shared space. In short, the answer lies in taking a broader and more comprehensive look at planning in cities.
CNN: Why is it more important to have more shared space rather than more private space?
Jonathan D. Solomon: It creates the fundamental sense of community when you mix different types of people in one place.
In a city like Mumbai you see enclave developments where the rich wall off parts of the city for dense new developments. There is a privatization of the roads and water delivery so you get that densification but no relation to the city around it.
Hong Kong is also a city which is densely developed but where the notion of public space is not present. There is limited mixing ground for people from different economic and cultural backgrounds to share space.
CNN: Where are examples of dense communities that are working in the world?
Jonathan D. Solomon: Tokyo is a very dense city but there is a lot of open space. New enclave developments are scrapping low-rise traditional neighborhoods and building blocks of high rises set in semi-private urban parks.
Unlike similar developments elsewhere, projects like Midtown Tokyo or Roppongi Hills take advantage of private investment to invest back into social space and infrastructure to connect the enclave to the city. The result is a shift in public-private relationships and spatial relationships in the city. But it doesn't affect the strong social sphere which has been there for some time.
CNN: All this takes a lot of investment. Densification may help rich communities, but what about poor ones?
Jonathan D. Solomon: One of the areas we are looking at is the role of public investment and urban infrastructure in the developing world. Fundamentally what is different between densification in the developed and the developing world is resources: wealth, infrastructure, social networks.
This is a major issue in China because of all the people moving into cities there. It's the lack of public investment in that sector of human inhabitation in slums of the world that prevents them from rising up.
Story highlights Captain: The search for a ship that lost communications near the Bahamas will resume Saturday
Hurricane Joaquin is now moving northeast at 7 mph, has 125 mph sustained winds
Hurricane Joaquin may not hit the U.S. East Coast, but heavy rain and flooding is still possible
(CNN) For more than 36 hours, there's been no word from, and no sign of, the U.S.-flagged container ship El Faro.
That means no news on what's happened to the 28 Americans and five Poles aboard, faced with the full fury of Hurricane Joaquin and its up to 150-mph gusts, 30-foot waves and potentially 25 inches of rain.
The U.S. Coast Guard dispatched a cutter ship, an MH-60 Jayhawk rescue helicopter and a C-130 Hercules airplane on Friday. But while the C-130 flew as low as 2,000 feet -- far below the normal 10,000 feet for such a storm -- it was not able to get close to the last known location off the Bahamas of El Faro, which means lighthouse in Spanish, much less spot or communicate with its occupants.
"There's so much wind, thunderstorms and sea spray that it is difficult to see," Coast Guard Capt. Mark Fedor told CNN's Eric Burnett. "But our hope is that they are either on the vessel or on life rafts, and we can identify them."
The search was resumed Saturday morning and was still underway as of Saturday afternoon.

A California attorney said if Kobe Bryant and his wife Vanessa were to continue divorce procedures - though they announced their reconciliation in January - the ultimate divorce would cause the Los Angeles Lakers player $1.36 million a month in child and spousal support.
Andrew L. Botros calculated the figure based on a report by Forbes magazine that estimated Kobe's annual income to be around $53.2 million. The California resident makes approximately $20.3 million in salary/winnings and $32 million in endorsements. Kobe, 34, is also No. 6 on the list of the word's highest paid athletes, according to the publication.
Based in those figures, Botros said that if Kobe and Vanessa ever decide to divorce - and assuming that Kobe would get 50/50 custody of his two daughters - he would pay near $365,000 in child support a month under California law. In addition, he would pay near $1 million a month in spousal support because a prenuptial agreement was not signed before the couple wed in April of 2001.
"Under California law, every penny Kobe earned from basketball or endorsements from the date of marriage to the date of separation is considered community property. It's half Kobe's and half Vanessa's," Botros said. "That also applies to every mansion, car, yacht, or private jet that the other party purchased with community money. "
Botros is an attorney with the Law Office of James D. Scott, a San Diego law firm. The office specializes in high-asset and high-income family law and has dealt with professional athletes going through divorce proceedings in the past, according to Larry Brown Sports.
The $3 million mansion Vanessa and Kobe owned in the gated Newport Beach community of California sold days before the pair announced their reconciliation and the cancellation of their divorce petition, according to Radar Online. It was one of three homes they jointly owned in the community.

Kushner was interviewed by members of the House Intelligence Committee at the end of July. The session, which lasted about three hours, focused on Kushner's role in the campaign and meetings with Russian officials before and after the election.
"I found him to be very smart, very worldly. He's a thoroughbred," Swalwell said Friday. "You know, his family was in the real estate business. He may not have had a political background, but he brought a business experience."
"In his own statement he acknowledged a deep reach into the political, financial and digital communications parts of the campaign," the California Democrat added.
Asked if he thought Kushner had misled investigators, Swalwell declined to say.
"I'm going to withhold judgement on whether he was truthful or not," he said. "I want to test some of what he said."

Lance Stephenson said he wants to be “extra aggressive” and make Dwyane Wade's knee “flare up” during the Eastern Conference finals. The two players do not like each other—jawing between Wade and Stephenson led to an ejection of the latter in the Pacers' 84-83 win against the Heat on March 26. From the Palm Beach Post:
Looking ahead to his matchup with Wade, beginning in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals on Sunday (3:30 p.m., ABC), Stephenson revealed that making Wade's problematic right knee “flare up” is part of his strategy.
“D. Wade — I think his knee is messed up, so I've got to be extra aggressive and make him run and have him running around and make his knee flare up or something,” he said after the Pacers practiced this afternoon. “I'll do anything as much as possible.”
Wade's knee appears to be doing well after a season-long maintenance program to preserve it. He also seems to have fully recovered from the strained hamstring he suffered in late March. He played through an unspecified injury in his right hand in the second round against Brooklyn and says it is a non-issue.
Daniele Rugani has today committed his long-term future to Juventus, renewing his contract for another five years which will keep him with the club until 2021.
Classy, composed, timely in the challange and also among the goals of late, Rugani is quickly developing into an outstanding defender that coach Massimiliano Allegri believes has what it takes to be a key Juventus player for many years to come, and it's easy to see why.
Since signing from Empoli in the summer of 2015, the towering Tuscan has made 29 appearances for the Bianconeri, playing in 26 victories and posting impressive defensive statistics in the process, not least the 37 interceptions made and 123 times he has regained possession – clear results of his intelligent reading of the game, combined with ever increasing physical strength.
Expert in breaking up opposition attacks, Rugani is also becoming a key creative force from Juve's defensive third. His average of 74 completed passes per Champions League match this term is almost double the average for players in his position (38).
Likewise in the league, his average of 20 passes forward per game comfortably beats the average of 16 for Serie A defenders.
If all of that wasn't already encouraging enough, the Italy international, who played his first full 90 minutes for the Azzurri in November, has also added a goal threat to his ever-expanding armoury after finding the net against Cagliari, Atalanta and Dinamo Zagreb.
At the age of just 22, Rugani still has plenty of time on his side to keep growing into the world-class defender he's destined to become and, thanks to today's contract renewal, do so in the colours of Juventus.
CLEVELAND -- LeBron James has signed a two-year contract with the Cleveland Cavaliers, a team he brought back from despair to the NBA Finals in one season.
James agreed to the $47 million deal, which includes a player option for the 2016-17 season, on Thursday and finalized the agreement on Friday shortly before hosting a private screening for the new movie "Trainwreck," in which he has a supporting role.

The deal follows James' plan to keep year-to-year flexibility to take advantage of expected increases in the salary cap.
James, who has been on vacation the past week, didn't talk to any other teams and always intended to re-sign with the Cavs. James met with Kevin Love before free agency started, and they discussed plans for the upcoming season. Love signed a five-year, $113 million deal to stay with the Cavaliers.
The signing comes a day before the one-year anniversary of his return to Cleveland after spending four seasons in Miami.
The 30-year-old has indicated he will play the remainder of his career with the Cavs, who went from a lottery team to Eastern Conference champions in James' first season back.
Cavs general manager David Griffin said James' re-signing is "a reflection and continuation of his strong, personal commitment to help deliver championships to northeast Ohio and Cavs fans everywhere."
The Cavs announced Thursday that they also had re-signed guard Iman Shumpert, who said last week that he intended to re-sign with the team. Sources told ESPN.com that deal was for four years and $40 million.
It had been expected that James would wait to see whether forward Tristan Thompson, who is also represented by agent Rich Paul, would sign before he negotiated with the Cavs. But on the first day teams could sign players, James made his intentions known to the Cavs.
With more experienced players and perhaps a few new ones, there's no reason the Cavs won't be in the title chase again. James' skills have shown no signs of erosion, and owner Dan Gilbert has shown a willingness to shell out major money to keep his biggest star surrounded with quality players.
And while his agreement with the Cavs is not a surprise, it does give him future flexibility and the ability to make more money next summer, when the league's new TV deal kicks in. The salary cap is expected to escalate by millions with the start of the $24 billion package.
James led the Cavs to the Finals in his first season back. Cleveland lost in six games to Golden State despite his stellar efforts.
Forced to carry the scoring load after injuries to All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving and Love, James was brilliant against the Warriors, averaging 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds and 8.8 assists per game -- the best statistical line in Finals history.
James said he is more motivated than ever to bring a championship to Cleveland, which has not had a major pro sports team win a title since 1964.

The Metric Maven
Bulldog Edition
There is a proverbial belief among my friends that metrication in the United States began and ended in the 1970s. Prior to the era of mint green leisure suits, and platform shoes, there was a metrication vacuum it is thought. This assumption demonstrates how easily we in the US succumb to collective historical amnesia. The 1970s was the period in which country after country was embracing metric. There was a metric tsunami and it seemed embarrassing if we didn't at least pretend to go along and become metric—which is all we did.
An interesting prose fossil, from the beginning of the 1970s non-metrication period, is A History of the Metric System Controversy in the United States. It was written by Charles F. Treat for The National Bureau of Standards (now NIST) and published in 1971. It reveals we have taken a long and sorted road to nowhere when it comes to metric adoption.
In his work Treat discusses Thomas Jefferson's efforts with weights and measures, and the well known report given by John Quincy Adams. Adams essentially said it's ok to do nothing for a while.
The metric system was made legal for use in the United States in 1866. This apparently occurred, because at an international meeting of postmasters, the attendeees declared the gram as the international standard for postal rates. In order to even accept any foreign mail, we had to make it legal to accept mail with metric mass values (i.e. grams). 1866 was when the first overly optimistic pronouncement of an expected rapid metric adoption in the US was made, by the authors of the legislation:
The interests of trade among a people so quick as ours to receive and adopt a useful novelty [the metric system], will soon acquaint practical men with its convenience. When this is attained—a period, it is hoped, not distant—a further Act of Congress can fix the date for its exclusive adoption as a legal system. At an earlier period it may be safely introduced into all public offices, and for government service.
A blue ribbon committee was appointed the same year, and it was believed that metric adoption would be a forgone conclusion. Charles Davies, who was the committee chairman, and member Frederick A.P. Barnard, were both from Columbia University. To the stunned surprise of those involved, Davies attacked the metric system with alacrity, rather than promoting it as expected. This disagreement became known to history as the Davies-Barnard schism. In response, metric legislation in 1866 stalled—and then died.
Metric advocates began to organize after this unexpected defeat. Three organizations were created, two for metric adoption, and one opposed. The two in favor were, the American Metrological Society (1873), created by Frederick A.P. Barnard, and the American Metric Bureau (1876) which asserted it was an educational organization. In 1875 the US signed the Treaty of the Meter.
Following the Davies-Barnard schism, and with the renewed momentum from the signing of the Treaty of the Meter, things looked like they were going well and were back on track for metric adoption. The American Society of Civil Engineers endorsed metric. Congress began discussing metric bills. But, then anti-metric forces reappeared. The name of their organization was the International Institute. The group's objections to metric had their basis in “pyramidology.” Charles Piazzi Smyth revealed that he had discovered numerous
numerical relationships in the Pyramid at Giza, from which he derived the “pyramid inch.”
Smyth was convinced this length was the base measurement unit that should be used by everyone. The Institute composed a song in 1883 entitled A Pint's a Pound the World Around. Here are a sampling of the lyrics:
For the Anglo-Saxon race shall rule
The earth from shore to shore
Then down with every “metric” scheme
Taught by the foreign school
A perfect inch, a perfect pint.
The Anglo's honest pound
Shall hold their place upon the earth
Till Time's last trump shall sound!
Now if they would just explain what a Philadelphia Pint of ice cream was, it would settle one more American measurement mystery for me. This unit of volume is described in a promotional short called The Selling Wizard. (see 5:21 of this link). A product is described as holding 930 Philadelphia Pints of ice cream. Are they perfect pints? Another strange irony in the song is that the metric system is “Taught by the foreign school.” The metric system was conceived by an Englishman, Bishop John Wilkins in 1668, so its origin is from the same country as the Anglo-Saxon barleycorn inch, the yard and the mile. I guess they also need to explain what they mean by foreign so I can better understand their point of view..
Charles Treat then observes:
“The Institute also left a written record of one of the most unusual approaches to the
question of weights and measures of any day or age. And yet, considering the spirit of
contemporary America [1971], proud and belligerent, the Institutes philosophy may not have been as strange as it now seems.”
In 1896 the US House of Representatives passed a bill which would have finally implemented the metric system, but then immediately voted to reconsider. A second vote was taken, and the bill was then “unpassed.” According to Treat: “This was as close to achieving legislative endorsement as the metric system was to come in this country.” … “Congress came within an eyelash of approving a measure to adopt the metric system.”
The Mendenhall Order of 1893 was needed to patch-up the considerable lack of legislative action by congress, so the country would have some policy on weights and measures that worked. The standards offered by the British were unusable. Mendenhall had no practical option. The metric system standards would be used to define our imperial weights and measures. The definition of the “Anglo's honest pound” would now be with respect to prototype kilogram number 20, which is still the mass reference used by the US to this day. (K20 is the standard and K4 is the check).
In the 56th Congress, adopting the metric system was again raised as an issue. Three Congressmen came forward: James H. Southard of Ohio, Lucius N. Littaure of New York and John F. Shafroth of Colorado. John Shafroth would become one of the most fervent advocates for the metric system in Congress. Mr. Shafroth's metric bill was recommended for passage with some small changes. The bill stated “…the weights and measurements of the metric system shall be the legal standard weights and measures of and in the United States.” This would be enforced as of January 1, 1903. From that date forward the metric system would be required for all Government business, and two years later business was to follow. The House didn't see any urgent reason to adopt the metric system, so the legislation never made it to the floor, and with the adjournment of Congress, became extinct.
From 1888 to 1902 it was believed the metric system was inevitable and superior as a system. But in 1902 there began a backlash against it, which became more pronounced as time passed.
One of those dissenting voices was Mr. Fredrick A. Halsey, the associate editor of The American Machinist magazine. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers also weighted in against metric. Mr Halsey went further and published a book entitled The Metric Fallacy which was published in 1904. Historian Treat describes Halsey's prose thus: “His writings and correspondence reveal a broad hostile streak in his personality.” Halsey would testify before the committee using The Metric Fallacy as a framework. The book claimed that of the 43 countries that legislated metric, none had adopted it—it was all a ruse. He attacked the idea of the superiority of decimal arithmetic. Unfortunately, this Don Quixote-like figure, managed to bag his windmill. The metric system was again derailed.
Mr. Shafroth presented a metric bill on the first day of the 58th Congress in 1903. It was identical to those of the previous sessions, but with effective dates of January 1, 1905 for the government to adopt metric, and January 1, 1906 for the entire nation. New Hearings were scheduled to allow more anti-metric testimony. Unfortunately John Shafroth resigned from the Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures in 1904. As Treat put it: “Others on the Committee did appear to favor the metric bill, but none of them was as ardent or knowledgeable an advocate as Mr. Shafroth had been.” The Shafroth bill died.
Charles Treat refers to the period between 1914 and 1933 as “The Great Metric Crusade.” Treat summarizes at the beginning of his Chapter on the era:
“Consequently, the movement again went “underground” for awhile, surfacing on the eve of America's entry into World War I. The next campaign was launched in 1916, blossomed after the armistice, reached peaks of furious activity in 1921-22 and 1925-26, and burned itself out in the early years of the great depression. During these years the metric issue became a full-fledged public controversy. Nurtured by an entirely different sort of campaign than any that had gone before., the metric movement and the opposition to it became almost totally “institutionalized” in that the battles were fought by organizations and interest groups rather than by individuals alone.”
In 1916 The Metric Association was formed, to promote the metric system and educate the public. The World Trade Club was created in 1919 to also advocate for the adoption of the metric system.
The anti-metric American Institute of Weights and Measures, was pragmatic, and effective. It was fathered by Frederick A. Halsey and Samuel S. Dale in 1916. They had been quiescent since the collapse of the 1906-07 pro-metric campaign. The pair were reawakened when pro-metric discussions for a new drive to adopt the metric system came to their attention. The metric advocates did their best, but in the end, as Historian Treat would put it: “…the American Institute of Weights and Measures had accomplished what it had set out to do in 1916. As a consequence, the metric issue was again laid to rest for over 25 years.”
The metric advocates tried to compromise with bills that would gradually introduce the metric system. This was referred to as gradual compulsion by detractors. Treat points to one publication that acted as the guiding light for the successful anti-metric campaign:
“Without question however, the American Machinist was the outstanding anti-metric publication of this era. The magazine's policy over the years had been dictated largely by the preferences of its editors-in-chief, as indicated by the fact that it had sometimes been silent on the matter when the debate was at its hottest. But under Fredrick Halsey from 1907 until 1911 the magazine had been officially anti-metric, and under Ethan Viall from about 1916 to 1925 the American Machinist would again be a leading anti-metric spokesman. Between January, 1920 and December 1922, for example, no less than 50 anti-metric articles were featured in the pages of American Machinist, the majority of these (35) occurring from January-June 1920.”
There were attempts from 1923-1933 to legislate the metric system, but they were all swan songs. An Associated Press report in 1929 stated: “the legislatures of California, Illinois, Tennessee, North Dakota and Utah have asked congress to enact legislation providing for the adoption of the metric system.” The issue was quashed and then ignored. From 1933 to 1958 the metric question remained dormant.
In late 1957 America suffered collective shock from the launching of Sputnik into orbit. In May of 1959 the question of US adoption of the metric system emerged again. The newly appointed Secretary of Commerce Admiral Lawrence L. Strauss took an interest in promoting metric system adoption. The adoption of metric by many large American industries was hard to ignore. The Admiral saw “the uniformity of measurement systems between Russia and most of the world, including Western Europe, is an enormous advantage to the Soviets and a handicap to us.” In 1964 The American Society of Mechanical Engineers again voiced its opposition to metric adoption.
Never a country to rush when the metric system is involved, it was in 1968 that a comprehensive study was authorized to look into the matter. Senator Clayborn Pell became a leading advocate for metric. His experience in the Foreign Service, where he had directly experienced its use on a daily basis, had convinced him that metric adoption would be of great utility to the US. Charles F. Treat's history ends at this point–in 1971. The study A Metric America: A Decision Whose Time Has Come was released in 1971. During the 1970s, non-binding voluntary metric legislation was discussed and passed during the Ford administration. Discussion continued during the Carter administration. The politicians agreed that metric should be voluntary. There was the formation of a small poorly funded Metric Board in the 1970s to aid the voluntary transition, and its termination in 1980 by Ronald Reagan—for cost savings.
Treat refers to the period from 1933 to 1958 as “The Doldrums.” This was a period of 25 years. I guess we can call the current 32 year period from 1980 to 2012, “The Doldrums II.” Yes, the use of roman numerals is meant to be symbolic.
About three years ago I was sternly lectured about metric adoption by an aid to my Congresswoman. I was told to “forget it, that ship sailed in the 70s and it's never coming back.” So far, she's proven correct. The last time I checked, there is no legislation before congress concerning metric system adoption, and hasn't been for decades. Only on the television series The Big Bang Theory, do I see the metric system toasted by Sheldon Cooper. Only in a fictional comedy series, is the serious issue of US metrication mentioned in 2012. Unfortunately, Sheldon assigns the blame for the lack of the metric system in the US, to President Carter. As you can see after reading my historical summary, the problem started just after the American Civil War in the 19th Century, and continues to this day in the 21st Century. There are many to blame, over many years, for this egregious situation in the US. President Carter was but a minor player in this tragedy.
As David Byrne of the Talking Heads said in the song Once in a Lifetime: “Same as it ever was, same as it ever was…..” And so it is.

FILE - In this May 16, 2012, file photo, the Facebook logo is displayed on an iPad in Philadelphia. Facebook says a Russian internet agency posted more than 80,000 pieces of content during and after the 2016 election, and that content was distributed to an estimated 126 million users. The company plans to disclose the new numbers to Congress in testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, Oct. 31, 2017, according to a source familiar with the testimony. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File)
WASHINGTON (AP) — Major tech companies plan to tell Congress Tuesday that they have found additional evidence of Russian activity on their services surrounding the 2016 U.S. election.
Facebook, for instance, says a Russian group posted more than 80,000 times on its service during and after the election, potentially reaching as many as 126 million users. The company plans to disclose these numbers to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the testimony. The person declined to be named because the committee has not officially released the testimony.
Twitter plans to tell the same committee that it has uncovered and shut down 2,752 accounts linked to the same group, Russia's Internet Research Agency, which is known for promoting pro-Russian government positions.
That number is nearly 14 times larger than the number of accounts Twitter handed over to congressional committees three weeks ago, according to a person familiar with the matter. This person requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the new findings ahead of the hearing on Tuesday.
And Google announced in a blog post that it found evidence of “limited” misuse of its services by the Russian group, as well as some YouTube channels that were likely backed by Russian agents.
THREE HEARINGS IN TWO DAYS
The companies are set to testify at three hearings Tuesday and Wednesday as part of congressional probes of Russian election interference.
Colin Stretch, Facebook's general counsel, plans to tell the Judiciary panel that 120 pages set up by the Russian agency posted repeatedly between January 2015 and August 2017. The company estimates that roughly 29 million people were directly “served” posts in their news feeds from the agency over that time. Those posts then spread widely on Facebook, although Stretch's prepared testimony makes clear that many of the 126 million people reached this way may not have seen the posts.
These “organic” posts that appeared in users' news feeds are distinct from more than 3,000 advertisements linked to the agency that Facebook has already turned over to congressional committees. The ads — many of which focused on divisive social issues — pointed people to the agency's pages, where they could then like or share its material.
On Twitter, the Russia-linked accounts put out 1.4 million election-related tweets from September through Nov. 15 last year — nearly half of them automated. The company also found nine Russian accounts that bought ads, most of which came from the state-backed news service Russia Today, or RT.
Twitter said last week it would no longer accept ads from RT and Sputnik, another state-sponsored news outlet. It will donate the $1.9 million it has earned from RT since 2011 to support external research into political uses of Twitter.
Google said that two accounts linked to the Russian group spent $4,700 on ads its platforms during the 2016 election. The company also found 18 YouTube channels likely backed by Russian agents. Those channels hosted 1,108 videos with 43 hours of material, although they racked up just 309,000 views in the U.S. between June 2015 and November 2016, Google said.
PREEMPTING REGULATION
A bill unveiled earlier this month would require social media companies to keep public files of election ads and require companies to “make reasonable efforts” to make sure that foreign individuals or entities are not purchasing political advertisements in order to influence Americans.
The companies haven't commented on the proposed legislation, but say they're at work on the problem. Last week Facebook said it will verify political ad buyers in federal elections and build transparency tools to link ads to the Facebook pages of their sponsors. Twitter has also said it will require election-related ads for candidates to disclose who is paying for them and how they are targeted.
Google announced on Monday that it will also verify the identity of election-related ad buyers and identify these advertisers publicly via an ad icon. It will provide a public database of election ads detailing who purchased each one, and will publish a transparency report on election ads as well.
The companies have been under constant pressure from Congress since it was first revealed earlier this year that Russians had infiltrated some of their platforms. Facebook has already spent more than $8.4 million lobbying the government this year, according to federal disclosure forms.
All three firms are expected to face questions about what evidence of Russian interference they found on their services, as well as why they didn't find it earlier. They will almost certainly do what they can to convince lawmakers that they can fix the problem on their own, without the need for regulation.
BEYOND ADS
The issue goes far beyond ads. Fake news, fake events, propaganda and other misinformation spread far and wide on social media services in 2016 without the need for paid advertisements. But regulating online speech would be more difficult for U.S. lawmakers.
In addition, analysts and online speech advocates have warned that policing internet election ads is not the same thing as doing so in print newspapers or on TV. Automated advertising platforms allow basically anyone with an internet account and a credit card to place an ad with little or no oversight from the companies.
Facebook has said it is building machine learning tools to address this issue, but didn't provide details.

Ortutay reported from New York. Ryan Nakashima in Menlo Park, California, contributed to this story.
When Hurricane Sandy struck the east coast in late October 2012, the "superstorm" disrupted traffic in New York City for more than five days, but the evacuation proceeded relatively efficiently with only minor delays, according to transportation researchers at the University of Illinois. The largest Atlantic hurricane on record, Sandy offered a chance for Illinois researchers to try out a new computational method they developed that promises to help municipalities quantify the resilience of their transportation systems to extreme events using only GPS data from taxis. (View a 3-minute video showing how traffic affected New York City during Hurricane Sandy.
Dan Work, an assistant professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) and Brian Donovan, a graduate student in CEE's Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure Systems program, analyzed GPS data from nearly 700 million taxi trips -- representing four years of taxi travel in New York City -- to determine the city's normal traffic pattern and study the variations during extreme events like the hurricane and snowstorms. The data, routinely recorded by taxi meters, shows travel times and the metered distance for various trips around the city at different times of the day and night. The researchers' method works by computing the historical distribution of pace, or normalized travel times, between various regions of a city and measuring the pace deviations during an unusual event.
"The first step was to figure out from the data what is normal," Work said. "There is a heartbeat pattern to the city every single day. In the middle of the night when traffic is light, you can get from one side of the city to another very quickly, and every morning during rush hour the roads are congested. The data shows us the typical heartbeat, and then we look for the arrhythmia."
A visualization comparing GPS data from New York City taxis in the days surrounding Hurricane Sandy with the same data under normal traffic conditions.
A resilient transportation system is one that can weather an extreme event with only minimal damage or service disruption and bounce back to normal relatively quickly, Work said. When cities know how their traffic systems respond to extreme events, they can examine ways to improve them. For example, an unexpected effect of Hurricane Sandy was that the longest traffic delays occurred as people returned to the city to resume their normal activities immediately after the storm, Work said.
"That was the one surprising piece to us," Work said. "A lot of literature on disasters has been very much focused on how to get people out of the city quickly and safely. It makes sense. But the re-entry process is also important, because you don't want your first responders stuck in gridlock."
There is still work to be done to translate this research into improved infrastructure resilience, Work said, but now there is a way to quantify the progress at a city scale.
"Importantly, this project shows us that the period immediately following the disaster should be the focus of additional research, with the ultimate goal of enhancing post-disaster transportation management and policy," Work said.
The researchers obtained the taxi data through Freedom of Information Law request to the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, which already collects it routinely. This gives it advantages over traditional methods for monitoring traffic that rely on sensors in the roadway or video cameras; that equipment can be expensive to deploy throughout a city, Work said.
"Although the taxi data isn't primed for traffic monitoring purposes because it is so coarse, with the right processing, you can still see things about the city-scale performance that you would expect to observe from a dense network of traditional traffic sensors," Work said.
"One thing that I think is kind of cool about this project," Donovan said, "is that taxis are designed to just get people from point A to point B, but this is a second use for them. The taxis themselves act as sensors to tell you what's going on in the city."
With 700 million records, the size of the data set creates its own set of challenges. One of Donovan's significant contributions to the project involved optimizing the efficiency of the calculations to speed up the analysis, Work said.
"One of the major challenges when you're dealing with a large data set like this is that you don't want the program to run for 24 hours. In a disaster, that's too long to wait; you need an answer immediately. So you have to design the algorithms appropriately," Donovan said.
Donovan, who earned his bachelor's degree in computer science, was drawn to the master's program at Illinois because of the opportunity to work on multi-disciplinary projects like this one, he said. The combination of computer science and transportation systems knowledge is the key to the success of a project like this, Work said.
"Our background in transportation engineering helped us choose the dataset, clean it, and determine the performance metrics to study," Work said. "At the same time, we needed the right computational tools to be able to process this much data and turn it into actionable information.
A paper on this work, "Using coarse GPS data to quantify city-scale transportation system resilience to extreme events," will be published in the Conference Proceedings of the Transportation Research Board in January 2015.

The American importer of the famed Russian-made AK-47 rifle announced that it plans to set up a U.S.-based factory later this year to build the guns here. Sanctions imposed last summer by the Obama administration against the gun's Russian manufacturer had effectively kept new AK-47s from reaching American buyers.
RWC Group, the licensed importer for the Kalashnikov company, revealed at the popular Las Vegas gun exposition known as SHOT Show on Jan. 20 that it would form a new company known as Kalashnikov USA to manufacture the weapon, Thomas McCrossin, RWC Group's CEO confirmed to Marketwatch. The company is currently negotiating with three U.S. states to locate a production plant, with the semi-automatic rifles, as well as shotguns, rolling off the lines in the second quarter of this year, McCrossin said in a statement sent to Marketwatch on Feb. 2.
“Shooters can expect extremely high-quality firearms at competitive price points, with supplies uninterrupted by import issues,” RWC (which stands for Russian Weapon Company), is located in Tullytown, Pa., said in the January statement. While AK-47 parts and knock-off versions of the famed weapon have been manufactured and available in the U.S. for some time, this is the first time the Russian weapon will be made entirely in the U.S. by the Kalashnikov firm.
Kalashnikov's Russian manufacturer, State Corporation of Russian Technologies, or Rostec, signed a two-year agreement in January 2014 with RWC Group at that year's Las Vegas SHOT Show saying they hoped to sell 200,000 Kalashnikov products a year in the U.S. The U.S. market constituted about 90% of its export sales in 2013, according to Pavel Kolegov, Kalashnikov's deputy chief executive for sales and marketing, in a statement at the time. As of last summer, Russian-manufactured AK-47s were selling in U.S. gun shops for between $800 and $1,050 each.
But last July, the U.S. slapped sanctions on Rostec, along with other Russian defense companies, in response to suspected Russian involvement in the shoot-down of a Malaysian passenger jetliner over Ukraine. The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said at the time that U.S. owners and dealers of the weapons could still own them and resell them at gun shows, so long as they or their dealers didn't make any payments to the Russian parent company.
New transactions with the Kalashnikov company were prohibited after July 16, 2014. That was expected to hurt U.S. gun dealers, who wouldn't be able to import any new Kalashnikov models (or models from the related Izhmash and Saiga brands). Only about 100,000 of the guns had been delivered to the U.S. at the time of the ban.
In a July 18 posting on its website, Rostec said that the U.S. market is one of “high demand” for the company and that “the sanctions of the United States government against Kalashnikov Concern go against the interest of American consumers.” On its own website, RWC said that it only had a “limited supply” of the weapons and that “there will be no more Saigas for the foreseeable future.”
Kalashnikov — named for Mikhail Kalashnikov, a World War II Red Army tank veteran who developed the “Avtomat Kalashnikova” rifle in 1947 — is the largest firearms producer in Russia. During Soviet times, the original plant in Izhevsk, two hours' flight time east from Moscow, churned out 600,000 rifles a year for the military. Now, it's down to a fraction of that, which made the U.S. deal a critical addition to the firm's sales.
The rugged AK-47 was developed from the Nazi-era Sturmgewehr 44, the world's first assault rifle, that was used in World War II by the German Army and SS troops, especially on the Eastern Front, where it impressed the Soviet Army enough to develop its own version. The AK-47 made a “distinctive sound,” as it fired a powerful 7.62mm round.
It was widely used by Soviet bloc countries during the Cold War and by aligned countries such as North Vietnam, Syria and Egypt. While the assault rifle version was difficult to control on full auto, it was praised for being resistant to sand and mud, compared to the early versions of the U.S. M-16 used in Vietnam, which fired a lighter 5.56mm round but was known for jamming regularly in-country if not well-maintained.
It has also been favored by insurgent and terrorist groups such as the Viet Cong, al Qaeda (Osama bin Laden's own AK-47 now hangs in the CIA's museum), Che Guevara's ill-fated Bolivian revolutionaries and the Palestine Liberation Organization. More than 70 million have been produced, according to the Kalashnikov website. Mikhail Kalashnikov died in December 2013, at the age of 94.
Building a production line in the U.S. for the Soviet-era rifles could ease a shortage of the popular guns for American consumers. In July, after the sanctions were announced, Atlantic Firearms of Bishopville, Md., a dealer that exclusively trades in Kalashnikov-related weapons, noted on its website that “due to the recent Import Ban on Russian Based AK firearms we are experiencing heavy order volumes.” At the time a Russian-made AK-47 model listed for between $849 and $1,049 on the Atlantic Firearms site. At press time, none were available, though less-desired Polish, Romanian and other Eastern bloc–made copies of the Kalashnikov still are available for $649 to $839. On its Facebook page, Atlantic Firearms reported at the time that it sold over 400 weapons the day after the ban was announced.
A representative from Atlantic Firearms didn't respond to email and phone messages.

The headline alone is terrifying: “Surveillance cameras made by China are hanging all over the U.S.” Scarier still, it's true — the Chinese government owns a 42 percent stake in Hikvision, one of the world's largest manufacturers of cameras and other video surveillance equipment. Its products are used at public sites and private companies around the world, including multiple U.S. government facilities.
It's easy to extrapolate some bleak scenarios based on this information: could the Chinese government be building “back doors” into Hikvision systems to facilitate state-sponsored snooping on sensitive American sites? The company vigorously denies this possibility, though it brings up echoes of 2012 when Chinese tech firms Huawei and ZTE landed in hot water for potentially threatening U.S. national security.
But while cyberespionage will always grab headlines, there's a quieter, more pervasive security threat at play here.

China is still the engine behind global tech hardware manufacturing, an industry which continues to boom as internet-connected devices become an increasingly common part of our daily lives. The so-called “internet of things” is growing exponentially, including everything from the surveillance cameras Hikvision makes to your fitness tracker or smart thermostat. These devices collect a wealth of information on the environment and users with which they interact, and communicate that data with various digital service providers. By some estimates, there will be 200 billion connected devices by 2020, and 95 percent of those devices will be manufactured in China.
Simply put, we're all going to be using Chinese technology and devices as a critical component of our connected lives moving forward. How consumers, companies, and governments effectively manage that reality will have widespread implications for digital security and privacy protection.
As a first line of defense, consumers and companies alike need to develop a greater awareness of the unique security vulnerabilities IoT devices can present. Malicious actors can leverage weak security settings to either take over a particular device, or use that device as part of a broader network attack. For example, Chinese-made cameras were a primary vector for the Mirai botnet that enabled unprecedented distributed denial-of-service attacks that crippled Twitter, Netflix, and Paypal, among other companies in 2016. That incident exploited weak default passwords for connected devices (think “123456” or “password”), allowing hackers to use the device as a bot to attack other systems. This wasn't the first IoT-based cyberattack, and it certainly won't be the last. New methods of adapting a world of connected gadgets for malicious purposes are emerging daily.
In many cases, however, these risks can be mitigated by simple good cyber hygiene. Since many people don't see their camera or FitBit as a security risk, they're less likely to keep these connected devices updated with the latest software upgrades or security patches. Running outdated software or firmware means devices are more likely to be affected by a broader array of attacks. If a connected device can't be updated, it shouldn't be used.
In addition, many companies and individuals don't bother changing the username and password from factory defaults. That's how Mirai was able to spread so quickly – it simply tried common username and password combinations. It guessed, and far too often, it was right. As a prerequisite for connecting a device to the internet, users should change the passwords to a unique, strong phrase. Passwords are by no means foolproof security mechanisms in the digital age, but for now they're critical to IoT security.
The conversation about China's role in building the world of connected devices is bigger than just the threat of spying, and it starts with getting the basics right. To protect our digital privacy, we all need to be more critical consumers of connected devices and practice better cybersecurity fundamentals when it comes to getting our gadgets online.

If Donald Trump wants to be a serious candidate for president, we deserve to know more about his business with mass murderers whose plunder of public and private funds added up to billions.
Donald Trump is running for president. Many believed or hoped that the Donald's latest foray into national politics was nothing more than a public-relations move, not a serious attempt to reside at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
But now that Trump holds the lead in national polls, as well as polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, it's time to take his campaign seriously. Media outlets like Huffington Post and the Wall Street Journal, which are covering Trump's run as an entertainment story, not a news story, are making a mistake. If Trump wants to be a serious candidate for president, and has the numbers to back it up, he must be vetted like a serious candidate for president. A good place to start is to take a hard look at Trump's ties to Philadelphia and New York organized-crime families.
Donald Trump's Connections to Organized Crime
Trump was building his eponymous empire of hotels, casinos, and high rises in the early 1980s in New York City and Atlantic City. In both places, the construction industry was firmly under the thumb of the mafia. And in both places there are literally concrete connections between La Cosa Nostra and Trump's lavish projects. Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist David Cay Johnston, who has covered Trump for decades, has written a very useful list of questions for Trump. Many focus on his ties to the mob. In addition in his 1992 book, “Trump, The Deals and the Downfall,” author Wayne Barrett lays out a slew of suspicious dealings and associations.
The Atlantic City story starts with Trump's purchase of a bar, at twice its market value, from Salvatore Testa, a made man in the Philadelphia mafia and son of Philip “Chicken Man” Testa, who was briefly head of the Philly mob after Angelo Bruno's 1980 killing. Harrah's casino, half owned by Trump, would be built on that land, and Trump would quickly buy out his partner, Harrah's Entertainment, and rename the casino Trump Plaza.
Author Wayne Barrett lays out a slew of suspicious dealings and associations.
Trump Plaza's connection to the mob didn't end with the land purchase from Testa. Nicademo “Little Nicky” Scarfo (who became boss after the elder Testa was blown up) and his nephew Phillip “crazy Phil” Leonetti controlled two of the major construction and concrete companies in Atlantic City. Both companies, Scarf, Inc. and Nat Nat, did work on the construction of Harrah's, according the State of New Jersey Commission of Investigation's 1986 report on organized crime. In addition, Scarfo, whose reign as head of the Philly mob was one of the bloodiest in history, controlled the bartenders union, which represented Trump's workers in Atlantic City, according to George Anastasia's book, “Blood and Honor.”
One more link to organized crime lurks in Trump's past Atlantic City dealings. He had a close association with Kenny Shapiro, an investment banker for Scarfo. According to secret recordings of then Scarfo attorney Robert F. Simone, Shapiro was intimately involved with bribing Atlantic City Mayor Michael J. Matthews, whose term would end in 1984 with a conviction on extortion charges. On the tapes, in 1983, Simone, talking about Leonetti, states: “He's a nice-looking boy…Nicky's nephew, he can sit with the…mayor. Ah, and Kenny's (Shapiro) got the mayor through this kid Phillip.”
The Connections Don't End in Atlantic City
Trump's association and business dealings with known mafia figures was not limited to his Atlantic City projects. In New York City, several of his buildings were built by S&A Concrete Co., a concern partly owned by Anthony “Fat Tony” Salerno, the boss of the Genovese crime family. In addition to this business relationship, Trump and Salerno were both represented by high-power attorney Roy Cohn. In his book, Barrett cites an anonymous source who confirms that on at least one occasion Trump and Salerno had a sit-down in Cohn's apartment. Trump has denied this claim in the past.
How can the candidate who promises to secure the border and bring good jobs back to America explain having farmed out good-paying jobs to a bunch of illegal immigrants?
Is it reasonable to assume that Trump had no idea that S&A was run by Salerno's Genovese borgata when Trump's own attorney was so closely linked to that organization? After all, if Trump (who likes to point out that he has “one of the highest IQs”) is as smart as he would have everyone believe, how could he have been so naive?
Another issue that needs to be addressed in Trump's New York operations is the use of undocumented Polish workers to demolish the Bonwit Teller building, which made way for the Trump Tower. Only a handful of union workers from Housewreckers Local 95 were employed on the site, the vast majority were illegal Polish alien workers, toiling under inhumane conditions, and wildly underpaid. Trump and his associates were found guilty in 1991 of conspiring to avoid paying pension and welfare fund contributions.
Two questions arise from this. First, how did Trump get away with using such obvious scab labor without raising the ire of local 95? More importantly, how can the candidate who promises to secure the border and bring good jobs back to America explain having farmed out good-paying jobs, legally entitled to American workers, instead to a bunch of illegal immigrants? When the rubber hit the road Donald Trump didn't walk the walk, he lined his pockets and sold out American workers.
Is it possible that Trump was simply involved in an industry which in the early 1980s was so infiltrated by the mafia that he couldn't help but have tangential ties? Could this myriad of associations, points of contact, and shared affiliations with known mobsters just be the price of doing business in that business at that time? Sure. And if Trump were just a private citizen, businessman, and reality TV star, he would be under no obligation to explain any of this. But he isn't. He is the frontrunner for the Republican nomination for president of the United States.
Donald Trump Has Explaining to Do
As one of a handful of people within reach of the most powerful office in the world Donald Trump must explain why so much of his early career is peppered with appearances by powerful underworld figures. Had Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, or Scott Walker bought so much as a used car from a known mafioso, it would be front-page news. Trump bought a piece of land for $1 million from the son of Philadelphia's former mafia Don, and used it to launch a gambling empire.
The major investigative news outlets in this country with the resources and wherewithal to seriously scrutinize Trump's ties to the mob need to start doing so.
It isn't only Trump who has a responsibility here. The news media, which is enjoying his playful romp through electoral politics, needs to wake up on this story. Trump isn't just fooling around this time. He wants to play in the big leagues, and in the big leagues they play hardball. The major investigative news outlets in this country with the resources and wherewithal to seriously scrutinize Trump's ties to the mob need to start doing so, sooner rather than later.
Former mafia members need to be interviewed. Transcripts of wiretaps and interviews with the major players in Atlantic City and New York crime syndicates need to be reviewed. The work of Barrett and Johnson, among others over the past decades that show Trump's underworld connections, need to be re-examined. Gary Hart and John Edwards learned that a serious run for president exposes all the dirty laundry, Trump needs to know that truth applies to him, too.
It's time to stop treating Trump as a sideshow. He is being treated with kid gloves because nobody thinks he can win. Everybody is simply waiting for him to implode under the pressure of his own enormous ego and unfiltered motor mouth. But rather than plunging his run into chaos, his racist ramblings about immigrants and undignified digs at John McCain's military service have excited some supporters. They think he speaks truth to power. They think he is the only honest man in politics. And no degree of exasperation from level headed news people and party officials seems to tamp his populist surge.
Being a loudmouth bigot, the Archie Bunker of 2016 who says what people are too afraid to say, is working well for Donald Trump. But it's time to hold his feet to the fire. This is a man who did a significant amount of business with mass murderers whose plunder of public and private funds added up to billions. What did he know about them? Maybe more importantly, what do they know about him?
We need to welcome Donald Trump to his new place in serious national politics with a cold, hard look at the crooks, conspirators, and criminals who peopled his early career. Either the Donald will attempt to weather such scrutiny, or he will disappear from the race under it. Either way, that scrutiny needs to start now.

Tips For Dealing With Information Overload
“What are your top tips for dealing with information overflow?”
(with formatting partly adjusted, omissions within quotes indicated with dots)
I sent a couple of people the following question:Here are some of their answers. Please add your own tips and approaches in the comments.
Niniane Wang, Google: «I like the time-honored tradition of responding to emails or archiving them as soon as I read them. (Like this one.) I've also found it helpful to maintain a to-do list that I reference every hour. Everything goes on the list or in my calendar, so that I don't have to remember it.»
Paul Buchheit, FriendFeed (formerly Google): «Drop packets. Systems that work have some kind of flow-control. . . . It's basically one of the big flaws in email – people expect reply. One of the nice things about FriendFeed is that you are free to ignore it when you get too busy or fall behind.»
Kevin Fox, FriendFeed (formerly Google, Yahoo): «Honestly my method isn't highly structured. I have several streams of data of varying signal:noise and rates (twitter, FriendFeed, Google Reader, email, voicemail, etc.). My strategy is to make sure I see at least the title of everything, and then pluck the important stuff out of the stream, either replying to it immediately or marking it in some way so I can 'get back to it'.
In reality “get back to it” usually means “recognize that it was important when it comes around again a second time”. This is usually most relevant with stars in Gmail. When something is both starred and unread it means that I indicated that it was important, and it's come back for more. That's usually my highest priority.
Beyond that, it's mostly about realizing that communication is falut-tolerant, and recognizing the rare cases where it's not: where it's important and you'll only get one notice, and where if you don't act on it immediately you never will. This is pretty rare.»
Jeremy Zawodny, Yahoo: «I try to prioritize . . . and watch Inbox Zero every couple of months to get re-inspired.»
Inbox Zero, a tech talk by Merlin Mann given at Google.
Andy Baio, Waxy.org: «In Google Reader, I separate feeds into “mustread,” “maybe,” and “everything else” piles with tags, so that I make sure I don't miss my essential reads. For everything else, I just liberally ignore and/or delete. More a defense mechanism than “dealing with information overflow."»
Noam Chomsky, MIT: «I wish I could answer sensibly. I just can't. You should see the room in which I'm working. Piles of books, clippings, manuscripts, notes,... All sorts of lost treasures buried in them.»
Louis Gray, LouisGray.com: «The big tip is to be selective in what you consume. I don't write about everything, so if, for example, I do get e-mail pitches that aren't in my areas of interest, it can be clear right away. Similarly, while it can be popular to sign up to every RSS feed under the sun, it makes sense to only select the very best ones that repeatedly have good content.
Also, reading fast, clicking fast, and having a quick yea/nay trigger can make things much more manageable. I do read upwards of 500-800 articles a day on Google Reader. Criteria that impacts just what I'll read more thoroughly or respond to include the headlines, the source, and whether it's new data or more rehashing that's already been covered somewhere else.
Taking on the information overflow means doing so in approachable chunks. I read e-mail, feeds, Twitter and FriendFeed first thing in the morning, just after feeding the dog. :-) Hitting each spot every few hours throughout the day means that work doesn't pile up. It's also just as important to get all the items to zero before going to bed, so there are no loose ends.»
Matt Cutts, Google: «At the beginning of the day, write down the 1-2 things you really want to accomplish that day. That will help keep you on track.
I've started exercising in the morning and I do email while I exercise. That lets me clean out my inbox early in the morning.
In Gmail I write a reply to some emails, but then save them as drafts and let them sit for a few hours or more. That prevents me from getting into a vicious loop of email back-and-forth.
Empty out your inbox by selecting all your email and (say) making those emails starred – then archive that email. Once your inbox is empty, it's much more motivating to keep it empty.
Sort your RSS feeds by priority into folders, and hit the most important folder first.
Use a tool like FeedRinse to subtract recurring RSS items that you know you aren't interested in for a given feed.»
Steven Hodson, WinExtra.com: «When it comes to RSS I tend to do two things. When I start my morning read I will skim over the posts. If they are only partial posts they usually get passed over as I don't want to waste time by having to go the site to read the item. Same thing to those sites like CNN and Wired who only publish headlines they get ignored as well. As well I am a lot more selective in what I will finally end up reading during that first run through in the morning – if I get the sense by looking at the first few lines that this isn't something that I would normally write something about two things can happen. I'll either totally skip it or I'll save it to one of my predefined Clippins folders in FeedDemon.
For the rest of the day I do something similar when the feeds get refreshed. That being short posts are generally read in full and longer posts recieve the same treatment as above. In both cases once I have gone through the feeds that have arrived I will go through the ones that were saved to the clippings folder.
Email is a little different in that I really don't get that much right now (but I am seeing that change slowly) but notification from FriendFeed and the such get left most of the time until I have a bunch to do all at once. Personal emails are usually held until I have a quiet moment so that I can concentrate on them. Pitches are fairly easy – I give them a quick glance and any that are of the stupid type or boilerplate crap get tossed. Other ones that catch my interest are tagged to deal with at a later point in the day.»
«Triage (pronounced /ˈtriːɑːʒ/) is a process of prioritizing patients based on the severity of their condition so as to treat as many as possible when resources are insufficient for all to be treated immediately. The term comes from the French verb trier, meaning “to sort, sift or select.”»
- Wikipedia
Elinor Mills, CNet: «Triage. I scan email and see what needs immediate attention, set aside things that can wait and then go back to them in order of importance, hoping that none of them expires in the meantime. ;) I scan the RSS and iGoogle headlines several times a day. It is overwhelming the amount of information that gets thrust at you every day all day, especially in the daily news business. I also make a lot of lists of ideas to pursue and stories I'm working on to try to stay on top of it.»
Shelley Powers, Burningbird.net: «Frankly, the people who are having problems with information overflow are people who want the information overflow. We're all big boys and girls here. We don't need specialized technology or social gurus to tell us when we've subscribed to too many feeds, or are on too many social networks. We don't need calendaring software to tell us when we've taken on more work than we can handle. What we need to do is prioritize the demands on our attention, and when we find ourselves overwhelmed, lop off the bottom distractions.
In all honesty, people who talk about how “noisy” their lives are one moment, while extolling the virtues of Twitter for FriendFeed the next would be the first distractions to go, and easily. Other distractions may be more difficult to drop, but if we want to be known for something other than “she gave great Twitter”, we have to make the decision, and live with the loss.»
Seth Finkelstein, Infothought blog: «Unfortunately, I don't think I'm very good at dealing with information overload. If I were better, I think I'd get much more done. This cartoon has already become a classic . . .
I think mail-sorting is important. I like text-based command-line tools, since they are FAST – the waiting time to try to move rapidly through web-based GUI interfaces irritates me.»
Tony Ruscoe, Google Blogoscoped: «[B]y reducing the amount of information. So, for FriendFeed, I originally subscribed to quite a lot of people. Once they introduced the “friend of friend" type of sharing, I couldn't handle the amount of information so I started pruning my subscriptions (since FriendFeed doesn't have the option to just block “friends of friends”).
My lifesaver with regards to feeds is Google Reader. I add a tag/label/folder for every single feed to which I subscribe. That way, I can prioritise my reading effectively. When I'm using Google Reader for Mobile, I'm a lot more ruthless as to which posts I mark as read without even reading them. When I'm in the standard browser version, I use the “expanded view” rather than the “list view” but very quickly skim read posts, continuously pressing j or k to move back and forth between them. Quite often, if I'm pushed for time, I'll simply star an item after skim-reading it and read it properly later when I have more time – particularly if I'm using Google Reader for Mobile.»
Dave Winer, Scripting.com: «I don't know – I don't have information overload. I keep wanting more. More! I want more! :-)»

Stimulus plan very similar to Coalition proposal to create special economic zones that was derided as 'crazy talk' by Labor
Kevin Rudd has backed a 20% company tax rate for the Northern Territory – 10 percentage points lower than the rest of the country – as part of a northern economic plan very similar to a Coalition strategy labelled "wacky" and "crazy" by Labor ministers earlier in the year.
Rudd said a re-elected Labor government would work with the territory government to reduce the tax rate by creating a special economic zone by 2018 which would also include more lenient territory-specific rules for foreign investment and "streamlined" environmental assessments.
"I think it would be great to have a company tax rate here one-third lower than the rest of the country … the explicit objective is to attract more direct investment to the territory for territory-based businesses," he told reporters in Darwin.
He said there were no costings for the policy because "we're working all this through".
Special economic zones and differential tax treatment were a key part of the Coalition's "northern Australia 2030 vision" released in February, which was condemned by Labor as pandering to the interests of mining magnate Gina Rinehart.
The then prime minister, Julia Gillard, said they were "ideas that actually don't even pass the laugh test" and the Assistant Treasurer, David Bradbury described the Coalition plan – which suggested relocating some government agencies to the north – as "an absolute disaster" and "a plan to divide the nation". The Human Services Minister, Jan McLucas, said it was "crazy talk" and the former trade minister Craig Emerson called it "wacky".
Rudd said the key difference between his plan and the Coalition leader Tony Abbott's was that his had concrete details and Abbott was proposing "a plan to have a white paper".
"Rather than just bleat about it, I think we should just do something about it … I believe in the territory, I love the territory," he said, standing next to his candidate for the marginal seat of Solomon, Luke Gosling.
Abbott said Rudd had "entirely changed his tune".
Another difference between the major parties appears to be Labor's willingness to consider more favourable foreign investment rules for its northern special economic zone to attract agri-business investors.
"The special economic zone will be able to take advantage of simpler rules on foreign investment that will make investment more attractive," a factsheet on the Labor policy says. "These simpler rules will help streamline the application process, while at the same time protect local and national interests."
The simpler rules could involve different thresholds for foreign investment screening, or for the screening of joint ventures between foreign businesses. The factsheet is clear that the rules would not apply to residential property and would not be extended to the rest of the country.
Investments in the zone would also be eligible for "streamlined" environmental assessments under the federal Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.
Also included in Rudd's "plan for northern Australia" is $10m to help the third stage of the Ord irrigation system by settling a native title claim and 20-year growth plans for northern cities including Darwin, Cairns, Townsville and Mackay – with strategies to increase trade, investment and employment developed by Infrastructure Australia.
The northern Australia policy comes as both the main parties are engaged in important preference negotiations with the north Queensland MP Bob Katter and Katter's Australia party, with Senate preference deals to be concluded by
Saturday.
The order in which Katter advises his supporters to number the parties on his "how to vote" cards for the House of Representatives and "below the line" list of parties for the Senate could be crucial for Labor or the Liberals in a number of Queensland seats.
Katter appeared unimpressed with the offerings of both sides on Thursday.
"We get this hot air about northern Australia every election, it's the usual guff they put out in campaigns," he told Guardian Australia.
"To be honest, I'll be judging them on their history, on what they have actually done. Under John Howard we had 12 years when the north got absolutely nothing ... under Labor we've got the NBN and CopperString, which were both good, and the live cattle decision, which was very, very bad ... so I'll make my decision by Saturday."
Labor always criticised special economic zones with different tax rates as being potentially unconstitutional.
Rudd said he was proposing the lower company tax rate for the territory because it presented fewer constitutional problems than if it was proposed for the states. "If there is a court challenge I'll be the first one out there making sure we defend that in the high court," he said.
The Coalition's policy promised to consider "the efficacy and targeting of current relocation incentives and personal and business tax incentives" in an effort to attract more people to northern cities including Darwin, Cairns, Townsville and Karratha.
It also promised to "consider" asking Infrastructure Australia to "conduct a comprehensive audit northern infrastructure and to devise a 15-year rolling priority list of projects of various scales, guided by cost-benefit studies".
Rinehart has strongly advocated northern special economic zones and development plans in her book Northern Australia and Then Some.
Katter said both major parties had promised to fund his CopperString project for transmission lines, with $350m pledged by Labor during negotiations to form a government in 2010 and maintained since then, despite the original plan falling over.

Jabrill Peppers 2017 NFL Draft Profile
There isn't any disputing the versatility and athletic ability Michigan Wolverine Jabrill Peppers brings to a football field. In his three seasons at Ann Arbor, Peppers has been lined up as a safety, running back, cornerback and this past season a linebacker. If that wasn't enough, Peppers was also the Wolverines primary punt and kickoff returner. If there was something to be done, Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh looked to Peppers to do it.
But even with arguably being the best athlete on the field every time he took the field, Peppers production didn't match his natural ability. As a defensive back, primarily as a safety, Peppers only had one interception in his Michigan career. Knowing how athletic Peppers is, that statistic is mind blowing.
That isn't the only statistic, or lack thereof, that draws the attention of NFL scouts when looking at Peppers. As a returner, Peppers only had one touchdown return, a punt, and that didn't occur until this past season. Peppers most productive position while at Michigan was at running back, a position that he isn't projected to play at the NFL level. Lining up in the backfield this past season Peppers had 167 yards rushing and three touchdown carries.
The lack of production could be linked to Michigan not finding him a permanent home on defense. This past season, Peppers lined up as a linebacker, a position that he has no chance of playing at the next level. In his sophomore season, Peppers lined up primarily at safety and before that, he lined up at both safety and cornerback as a freshman. In Peppers' three seasons at Michigan, he never settled in at just one position. Many believe that if Peppers was allowed to focus on just one position, he would have thrived.
Count Daniel Parlegreco of DTPDraftScout as one who believes that. Parlegreco projects Peppers as a strong safety in the NFL, playing near the line of scrimmage so he can be closer to the football. He believes that Peppers has the natural ability to be eventually compared to Arizona Cardinals safety Tyrann Mathieu or former Pittsburgh Steelers standout safety Troy Polamalu. Parlegreco has Peppers listed as a top ten player for the 2017 NFL Draft.
Strengths
Superior athletic ability;
His ability to lineup at different positions on the defensive side of the ball;
Proven return ability, on punts and kickoffs;
If deemed a safety in the NFL, he has great size for that position.
Weaknesses
Lack of experience at one defensive position;
Production doesn't match his athletic ability, only one interception during his Michigan career;
Won't be a plug and play type of player on an NFL defense, will need time to learn;
Doesn't have experience defending NFL types of passing offenses.
NFL Comparison: A larger Tyrann Mathieu
Teams with Need at Position: Indianapolis Colts, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Detroit Lions, Seattle Seahawks, Dallas Cowboys
Projection: mid to late first round
Bottom Line
Peppers' lack of experience at just one position might cause him to fall on day one of the draft. But it is hard to believe that he will completely fall out of the first round. You can't teach talent, and Peppers has a lot of it. If he were to fall to a team who has an established defensive backfield coach, it might be the best situation for Peppers.
If Peppers takes to coaching, the sky could be the limit for Peppers. At this point, his NFL career is comparable to a blank canvas and if he lands with the right team, his career might turn out to be a masterpiece.
After her multiple apologies, Hyosung stepped on stage to apologize yet again.
She stood on stage at KAIST University, one of the universities that hadn't canceled their invitation for SECRET to perform.
Before the girls started their performance, she said, "Before we perform, I want to apologize." The majority of the crowd was supportive of her, shouting, "Don't! You don't have to! It's okay!"
Their support made Hyosung tear up, and she had to swallow back tears before she continued, "I'm really sorry that I worried you because of my rash words recently.

When thick smog recently hit, Londoners were advised to avoid exercise, while Parisians got free public transport. Which is the best solution?
When a thick cloud of air pollution settled in over London last week, experts warned those with health problems to avoid strenuous exercise. The advice to Londoners essentially boiled down to this: breathe less.
Meanwhile, as Paris suffered a similar pollution episode – its worst in a decade – officials swung into action, waiving charges for public transport and restricting the number of cars allowed on roads, alternately barring those with odd and even licence plates.
At the same time Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo joined officials from Madrid, Athens and Mexico City in announcing plans to get all diesel vehicles off the roads by 2025. Diesel is highly polluting, emitting far greater amounts of dangerous nitrogen dioxide and tiny pollution particles than petrol, and can cause cancer to heart attacks.

Despite the health damage it wreaks, governments across Europe, including Britain's, have offered motorists tax incentives that effectively encourage the use of diesel, on the assumption – now being questioned – that it produces less planet-warming carbon dioxide than petrol.
Doctors Against Diesel, a group formed last week to urge tougher action, says both the national government and London mayor Sadiq Khan must move quickly to protect Britons' health.
“If you're going to design something that would effectively deliver a toxic substance into the lungs, you couldn't do better than the diesel soot particle,” says Jonathan Grigg, a consultant paediatrician at the Royal London Hospital and professor researching pollution's effects on children at Queen Mary University of London. “We need to get the current polluting, toxic diesel fleet off our roads as soon as possible.”

Last week, Khan rolled out a new system of air quality alerts at bus stops, Tube stations and roadsides, warning those who experience symptoms from air pollution to reduce strenuous activity. The London Air Quality Network, based at King's College University, said vulnerable people, such as those with heart or lung problems, should consider limiting activity too.
The mayor also announced a doubling of funding for reducing pollution. He plans measures including charges for the dirtiest diesel cars entering central London from 2017, an acceleration and expansion of the Ultra Low Emission Zone, tighter standards for heavy vehicles and a cleanup of buses.
But he does not have the legal authority to institute a ban, and has demanded the government take urgent action, including a diesel scrappage scheme.
Cities around the world are confronting problems similar to London's. Some have been more aggressive than others, but overall, their experience shows that concerted steps to improve air quality do work, and they save lives.
Berlin is a notable exception to the story of the diesel disaster gripping much of western Europe. It has cleaned up its own fleet, installing pollution filters on buses and garbage trucks, and imposed tough rules on heavy goods vehicles. A strict emission zone bars older diesel vehicles, and rates of car use, which are already among the lowest in Germany, have dropped even further in recent years. Public transport is efficient and easy to use, with a two-hour pass costing just €2.70 (£2.25).
As a result, levels of the tiniest, most dangerous particles, known as ultrafines, fell 70% in just three years, says Axel Friedrich, former head of transport and noise at the federal environmental agency, and an adviser to government and advocacy groups. Next, environmentalists are pushing for a plan, now under court review, to require diesel cars to meet even stricter standards to enter Berlin and other German cities, he says.

Kraków has the worst air in Poland – one of Europe's most polluted countries. Every winter, heavy smoke wafts out of chimneys and blankets the city as residents burn coal in low-tech stoves to keep their homes warm.
After a long legal fight, the city is now moving forward with a ban on burning coal for home heating, to take effect in September 2019.
New York has also targeted heating systems. After an analysis found that 1% of buildings burning the dirtiest kinds of fuel oil were producing more soot than all the city's traffic, officials made plans to gradually ban their use and to help landlords convert.
The changeover is already credited with saving hundreds of lives each year. It's just one piece of New York's air quality strategy, which also aims at slashing greenhouse gas emissions 80% from 2005 levels by 2050, says Mark Chambers, director of the mayor's Office of Sustainability.
“Air quality is one of those things, you have to address it systemically,” he says. “You have to really be thoughtful and intentional about looking at all sources for pollution and addressing them with whatever means you can.”
Los Angeles, the city where American car culture reached its zenith, has also pushed hard to clean up its air. While it is still among the country's worst, the smogs that once tightened Angelenos' chests and made their eyes water are a thing of the past.
“We've made incredible progress, we can see the mountains in Los Angeles, when those of us who grew up here never could when we were young,” says Joe Lyou, president of California's Coalition for Clean Air. Back then, in the 1960s and 70s, “you couldn't go outside, you couldn't breathe”, on the worst days.

The dramatic improvement is the result of the most stringent air quality regulation in America. Inspectors even check the shelves of DIY stores for paints that are banned because the chemicals that drift off them contribute to smog. A statewide crackdown on dirty diesel lorries and a push to expand use of zero-emission vehicles are also a big part of the story.
In addition to the decades of regulation that have made American cars 99% cleaner than they were 40 years ago, cities like New York and LA have benefitted from American motorists' distaste for diesel, which accounts for only about 2% of cars in the US.
Even China, whose atrocious air the World Health Organisation says killed more than a million people in 2012, has begun to confront its crisis. Beijing has used licence plate restrictions to limit the number of cars and set out plans to keep the oldest and most polluting vehicles off roads when air is especially bad. More importantly, the government has harnessed public anger over pollution to plough billions of dollars into wind and solar power, becoming the world's biggest investor in renewable energy. Officials have even begun cancelling plans for new coal-fired power stations – a move with repercussions for the health of those living in Chinese cities, and for the planet.
India, with air that is perhaps even worse, has been less aggressive. Prime minister Narendra Modi's government blames the Congress party that preceded him for letting pollution fester. But despite promises to clean up, the official response has been ineffectual.

Last month, Delhi's 20 million people suffered through the worst smog episode in 17 years, according to the Centre for Science and Environment. Officials temporarily shuttered a coal-fired power plant, halted all construction and demolition work and shut down many diesel power generators.
In a sign that Delhi has begun to acknowledge the problem – if not to solve it – officials also closed 1,800 schools for three days, as particulate levels soared to 28 times the recommended maximums.
Tehran did the same when officials said a heavy blanket of smog had killed 412 people in 23 days. In fact, Iran is home to the city that currently tops the WHO's most polluted list for PM2.5s: Zabol, near the border with Afghanistan.
So what does it feel like to live in a city where the air doesn't make you sick? “It's nice,” Berlin's Friedrich said with a laugh, adding that his neighbourhood in the south-western quarter is one of the cleanest. “My air quality is like the countryside.”
Beth Gardiner's book on air pollution will be published by Portobello Books and the University of Chicago Press in 2018.

Netflix added 7.05 million new subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2016, handily beating expectations for the period and setting a quarterly record, driving shares to new all-time highs in after-hours trading Wednesday.
For the last three months of 2016, historically a strong quarter for Netflix, the company added 1.93 million U.S. streaming subscribers, and 5.12 million international subs. Analysts had forecast net U.S. streaming subscriber adds of 1.44 million and a gain of 3.74 million international subs.
In after-hours trading, Netflix shares popped more than 8%, after the stock has hit record highs in recent days.
Overall, Netflix posted revenue of $2.48 billion for Q4 2016, in line with Wall Street analyst expectations of $2.47 billion, with net income of $66.7 million (15 cents per share) beating the Street's estimates of $58 million (EPS of 13 cents).
Netflix — which this week is marking the 10-year anniversary of its U.S. streaming video debut — said global streaming revenue grew 41% year over year to $2.4 billion, while contribution profit rose 74% year over year to $470 million (with a 20% margin).

Netflix now counts 93.8 million streaming subscribers across the globe as of the end of 2016, comprising 49.4 million in the States and 44.4 million overseas.
In its quarterly letter to shareholders, Netflix reiterated that in 2017 it plans to spend over $6 billion on content (on a P&L basis), compared with $5 billion in 2016. The company said it expects a “greater membership impact” from its content slate in the second half of 2017, with new seasons of popular returning shows like “Orange Is the New Black,” “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” and “Master of None.”
For the first quarter of 2017, Netflix projects 5.2 million net adds (1.5 million in the U.S. and 3.7 million internationally). In the U.S., that would represent a decline from 2.23 million net adds in Q1 2016, which the company said “reflects a difficult comparison in the year-ago quarter where we exceeded our net adds forecast by 27%.”
Regarding speculation that the FCC's net neutrality laws will be weakened or dismantled under incoming President Donald Trump, Netflix said any change — if it happens — “is unlikely to materially affect our domestic margins or service quality because we are now popular enough with consumers to keep our relationships with ISPs stable.”
That said, Netflix added that “strong net neutrality is important to support innovation and smaller firms. No one wants ISPs to decide what new and potentially disruptive services can operate over their networks, or to favor one service over another.” The company added, “We hope the new U.S. administration and Congress will recognize that keeping the network neutral drives job growth and innovation.”
Netflix touted its original programming, calling out “The Crown” — which won the 2017 Golden Globe for best TV drama series and star Claire Foy won for best actress in a TV drama series — “Marvel's Luke Cage,” and season three of “Black Mirror” as continuing to “generate excitement and excellent viewing all across the world.” The company said “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life” debuted in the top 10 in every territory, and Guillermo Del Toro's “Trollhunters” from DreamWorks Animation, which launched in December, is tracking to be its most-watched kids original ever. (Netflix notoriously does not disclose specific viewing metrics.)
Internationally, Netflix said it is continuing to invest in local programming. “We are focusing on local content that travels pan-regionally or across multiple territories, such as Japanese anime and Turkish dramas,” the company said in the letter, citing its recent long-term pact with Red Chillies Entertainment, the film production company of Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan.
On the competitive front, Netflix cited numerous rivals — noting that Amazon last month launched Prime Video in 200 countries — “which presents both challenges and opportunities for Netflix as we strive to earn screen time.” It said the BBC has become the first major TV network that plans to release new seasons with a “binge-first” strategy (with all episodes available at once a la Netflix) and added: “We presume HBO is not far behind the BBC.”

Destructive Power C Speed A Range E Durability B Precision B Developmental Potential C A B C D E Destructive Power Speed Range C A E Durability Precision Developmental Potential B B C
( マニック・デプレシオン , Manikku Depureshion)
Contents show]
Appearance
is the Stand of Massimo Volpe , featured in
Manic Depression is a cadaveric looking humanoid creature less than 1 meter tall. Its arms and chest are partially wrapped in bandages. With the exception of its swollen stomach and large skull-like head, the rest of its body is fairly lanky and skeletal.
It can produce thorns from its body and has an umbilical cord-like protrusion coming from its stomach.
Abilities
Neurochemical Manipulation: Manic Depression is able to increase the biological functions of organisms by piercing them with its thorns. This technique can be used to increase the heart rate (causing it to explode), force irregular stomach digestion, or increase one's physical attributes for a couple of minutes, after which the body breaks down.
It also has the power to convert salt into a powerful opiate, allowing it to be injected for a drug-like effect. The drawback is that the drug formed from the salt only exists for a total of two weeks before reverting back into salt.
Trivia
Massimo's stand appears to have abilities opposite of his brother, Tonio's. While Pearl Jam focuses on targeting diseases and issues within the body and heals them, Manic Depression's main purpose is to directly affect neurochemical processes and health with uncertain and negative results.
The European Commission announced today that it has reached a tentative agreement with Google to end a three-year antitrust investigation into how the company displays search results. Under the proposed agreement, Google will display search results from three of its competitors alongside results promoting its own services. Over the coming weeks, the EC will determine whether to make the agreement legally binding, after consulting with Google competitors. By settling with the EC, Google would presumably avoid paying a fine of up to $5 billion, or 10 percent of its 2012 revenue.
European regulators began investigating Google in 2010, amid concerns that the search giant uses its market dominance to promote its own services while burying search results from competitors. Google has made several settlement offers over the past year, including three since October, when EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia deemed the company's proposal unacceptable. Today, Alumnia said Google's latest proposal would be more effective in protecting consumer choice and competitiveness.
"it provides users with real choice between competing services."
"I believe that the new proposal obtained from Google after long and difficult talks can now address the commission's concerns," Alumnia said. "Without preventing Google from improving its own services, it provides users with real choice between competing services presented in a comparable way; it is then up to them to choose the best alternative. This way, both Google and its rivals will be able and encouraged to innovate and improve their offerings."
"Turning this proposal into a legally binding obligation for Google would ensure that competitive conditions are both restored quickly and maintained over the next years," he added.
Google's promoted search results would feature an "Alternatives" section featuring rival services under the proposed antitrust agreement with the European Commission. (European Commission)
Under the agreement, Google would label search results from its own services, differentiating them from normal web results, and would "display prominent links" to services from three rival companies. These rival links would be selected "in an objective manner," and displayed in a way that's comparable to results from Google services.
Google's local search results on mobile would feature a similar "Alternatives" section featuring rival services under the proposed antitrust agreement with the European Commission. (European Commission)
Google has also agreed to allow third-party companies to opt out of its search services without impacting their standing in search results. The company's compliance with the proposed rules would be monitored by an independent body over the next five years. According to Alumnia, the proposed changes would only affect European users.
Today's announcement comes more than a year after Google struck a similar settlement with the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), bringing a 19-month antitrust investigation to a close.
Recent Russian military exercises in the Baltic region has left some European countries rattled.
NATO has responded by beefing up its defences in the Baltic states and Poland. In Rome, Secretary-General Stoltenberg spoke of the alliance's concerns.
“In recent weeks Russia has deployed missile systems close to alliance borders that could carry nuclear weapons. […] Allies are deeply concerned about this behaviour, we will continue pursuing our policy of strong defence combined with political dialogue.”
The Italian Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni announced that 140 Italian troops will be joining a NATO mission in Latvia, although he played down the significance of recent events, saying the decision was taken six months ago and was not connected.
Italy will lead an ultra-rapid action force in Latvia, equipped to intervene in an emergency situation within five days, Stoltenberg told Italian media. Under a deal made in July, NATO pledged to move four battalions of up to 3,000 to 4,000 troops into northeastern Europe on a rotating basis.
Russia responded to the news with the foreign ministry spokesperson saying that NATO is building new dividing lines in Europe. While the leader of the Five-Star Movement said Russia is a partner, not an enemy.

Sharply polarized Hong Kong electorate hands Beijing a stinging setback
Radical activist candidate Eddie Chu Hoi-dick (right), celebrates after winning a seat at the legislative council elections in Hong Kong (Macau Daily Times)
Pro-democracy or “localist” candidates won 27 seats out of 70 in Sunday's elections for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong (LegCo). Although these are not enough seats to push through new legislation, they are enough to veto important legislation that pro-Beijing factions had hoped to pass into law.
The 27 localist seats are even more significant when you consider that only 35 seats are directly elected by the voters. The other 35 seats are for “functional constituencies,” which are elected by elite voters in particular professions or trades, such as accounting, finance, medicine and fisheries, most of which support Beijing because their members have close ties to China's Communist elite on the mainland.
China's thuggish policies in Hong Kong have apparently backfired spectacularly, as the election handed a major setback to Beijing. Beijing had hoped that more seats would go to pro-Beijing candidates, but the opposite happened instead.
The turnout was almost as significant as the output. Some 2.2 million people voted, much more than in past elections, indicating increased polarization and an intense interest in both sides to “send a message.”
The term “localist” is new this year. It does not mean “pro-independence,” because being pro-independent is illegal. But it means more than “pro-democracy,” because the latter refers mostly to election rules, while “localists” advocate much more self-government, and much more independence from Beijing.
Before Sunday's election, the pro-Beijing camp held 43 seats, and had hoped to increase that number to 47, giving them the two-thirds majority needed to pass constitutional reform, including laws that would give Beijing much more control over Hong Kong. Instead, the pro-Beijing camp now has only 40 seats, and the localists can veto any attempts at constitutional “reform” that would give more power to Beijing.
A statement from Beijing emphasized that any talk of “Hong Kong independence” was against the Constitution of China, the Basic Law, and relevant laws of Hong Kong. The statement accused “certain organizations and candidates” of publicly advocating for “Hong Kong independence,” and it called on the Hong Kong authorities to punish these individuals and “to mete out penalties according to law.” South China Morning Post (Hong Kong) and Macau Daily Times and Xinhua and BBC
China's relations with Hong Kong and Taiwan set to become more tense
During Mao's bloody Communist Revolution, Hong Kong was a British colony, and many people fled to Hong Kong in the late 1940s to escape Mao's atrocities. Many remained in Hong Kong, while many others continued on to the island of Formosa, now known as Taiwan. As the survivors of Mao's revolution have died off over the decades, and younger generations have come of age, the populations of both regions have become more polarized and more tense.
In the past few years, we have seen China become increasingly nationalistic and militarized. In the South China Sea, China is building artificial islands and military bases in waters that a United Nations court recently ruled were the territorial waters of the Philippines. China is making it clear that it does not recognize any international authority except its own self-interest, and that it will use its increasingly powerful military to crush any opposition.
So in China's mainland, young people are increasingly demanding military action against Hong Kong and Taiwan, while on Hong Kong and Taiwan, young people are increasingly demanding complete independence from China.
China has suffered major electoral setbacks in both regions this year. In January, Taiwan's pro-independence party won an overwhelming victory, and now on Sunday, Hong Kong's localist activists have won a very significant victory.
In both Taiwan and Hong Kong, “independence” is a forbidden word, and Beijing has said it will violently crush anyone who even talks about it. But pro-independence sentiments are growing in both regions, while nationalist sentiments are growing in China's mainland. Anyone can see that this won't end well.

A small sprinkle of salt will suppress bitterness – and in some cases it can benefit the overall coffee flavor. I've tried it with an espresso and somehow it works, but it's difficult to describe the flavor.
I prefer my coffee black, and politely decline when offered milk and sugar. However, if offered salt I would probably smile and say “Yes, please!” Salt???! It turns out that adding salt to coffee is not as weird as it may sound at first. There is a tradition for adding a pinch of salt to coffee in Northern Scandinavia, Sibir, Turkey and Hungary. And when available, such as in coastal areas where fresh water from rivers mixes with the salt sea, one would simply use brackish water when preparing coffee. This water typically has a salt content of 0.5-3%, which is lower than the average 3.5% in seawater. This results in a more intense taste and more foaming. And if living far from the sea, the Swedish food blogger Lisa Fí¶rare Winbladh let me know that in Northern Sweden one would deliberately add salt if using melt water from glaciers for making coffee. But tradition aside, is there a scientific explanation of this widespread tradition of preparing coffee with addition of salt?
The first thing that comes to mind is that salt reduces bitterness. And to be more precise it is the sodium ion (Na+) that interferes with the transduction mechanism of bitter taste. But interestingly the mechanism behind this is not fully understood! One of my very first blog posts was about tonic water and how one by adding salt can suppress the bitter taste and make tonic water more or less sweet. It's a fascinating experiment that you should try at home. Expect to use about 1,5-2 g salt for a glass with roughly 1,5 dL (150 g) of tonic water. It's a good idea to start with a little salt and taste it as you go.
Try adding a little salt to tonic water – the effect is quite surprising: The characteristic bitterness from the added quinine disappears!
Bitterness is an important flavor in coffee, but under less-than-optimal extraction conditions it can be too dominant. Generally bitter tasting compounds are less water soluble than other coffee flavors, hence the bitter compounds are extracted towards the end of the brewing. High temperatures (close to boiling) and long extraction times also favor bitterness. In that respect the coffee percolator is known to produce rather bitter, over-extracted coffee due to near boiling temperatures, and such coffee would most likely benefit from a little salt! And before the percolator came the ground coffee was just put into the boiling water and then left to settle. I can really imagine how brackish water could actually benefit
But the salt need not be reserved for over-extracted coffee. I've tried using salt both in a drip coffee maker and in the filter basked when pulling an espresso. The tests were very un-scientific, but the tiny amount of salt does dampen bitterness and change the coffee taste (but the coffee does not have a salty taste). Since I lack cupping experience, I certainly lack the language to describe how salt influences the taste, so I leave it up to you to try it out! And maybe some baristas with cupping experience can fill me out on this and do some tests?
In stead of just using plain salt with coffee, cured ham would signal rafinesse if served in central Europe, whereas in Northern Sweden there is a tradition for serving dried meat with coffee. The Swedish author Mikael Niemi describes this in his novel Popular music from Vittula:
“… and then the pií¨ce de résistance among all the sweetmeats: a hard, brown lump of dried reindeer meat. Salty slices were cut and placed in the coffee, chunks of coffee-cheese stirred in, and white sugar lumps were held between the lips. And then, fingers trembling, we all poured the coffee mixture into our saucers, and slurped our way to heaven.”
With cured ham, apart from the salt-coffee interaction, one also has the combination of meat and coffee. From previous flavor pairing rounds TGRWT #1 and #5 (chocolate/coffee and coffee/meat respectively) we have seen that coffee and meat in some ways approach each other and are actually a good combination. A secret tip BTW is to add a little coffee to your beef stocks for extra depth and richness – this works because coffee shares many impact flavors with browned meats due to the Maillard reaction.
Now I'm curious – are you aware of coffee-salt combinations in your own country? Please tell me about it! And if you try a pinch of salt in your coffee – how did it taste?
Update: Read about my tests of coffee with salt at Tim Wendelboe's coffe shop

Ubisoft's newest Tom Clancy IP is not being solely developed in Sweden – UK studio Reflections is co-developing the title, Develop can reveal.
The partnership between the Newcastle-based developer and Malmö's Massive Entertainment will see both teams collaborating on upcoming online shooter Tom Clancy's The Division, which is in development for Xbox One, PS4 and PC.
Reflections MD Pauline Jacquey told Develop that "about 40 per cent" of her studio is working on The Division and this is bigger than some of the firm's contributions to previous Ubisoft games such as Watch Dogs, Just Dance and Far Cry 3.
"We're working on all of the game's systems: main characters, enemies, RPG pillars, building Manhattan, online components, and so on," she said.
"It gives us a very broad and wide input on the game, but it's not as limited as the naval battles on Assassin's Creed III."
Jacquey added that while the initial conception of the game was handled by Massive, Reflections has already been working on The Division for a few months now.
"We've brought a very good design and technological strength to The Division," she said. "Massive's team is bigger, but ours is still significant, and its competency in art, technology and design is really showing.
"There's so much love for this game at Reflections. Our guys are absolutely crazy about it. So for some of them it's a life achievement being able to participate in the development of the game."
The Reflections boss vehemently denied that the partnership with Massive was not a sign of development troubles for The Division – something that has proven to be the case when other studios have been brought on board in the past.
"That's absolutely not the case," Jacquey said. "This is part of a global model that Ubisoft has been deploying in the past seven or eight years.
"It's also classic team size management. You don't want your team to be too big when you're in the initial phase of conception, when you need a lot of agility. But when you're in full production – and given that the game's scope is gigantic – it needs a big team behind it."
Jacquey added that the partnership actually came from Massive and Reflections' desire to work together, rather than instructions from the Ubisoft group and that this has been planned as a long-term partnership.

Dejan Lovren considered his goal against Crystal Palace the ideal response to make amends for a mistake at the other end moments earlier.
Just two minutes after Liverpool had taken the lead through Emre Can at Selhurst Park, the centre-back's short pass allowed James McArthur to steal in and equalise with a header.
But Lovren promptly restored his team's advantage by meeting a Philippe Coutinho corner and planting a header of his own underneath the goalkeeper.
The visitors went on to triumph 4-2 and maintain their position alongside the Premier League's early pace-setters on 23 points.
“It was a tough game,” Lovren told Liverpoolfc.com post-match.
“The first half was ups and downs, with a couple of mistakes and my mistake. But, to be honest, I was sure we would come back.
“And thank God I scored also – I managed to say sorry for the mistake. It was a good performance. The most important thing is the three points.
“If you want to be in the top four, you need to have the winning mentality – even when you make mistakes. Keep your head up and forget about them. Everyone did that well. We showed big character.”
Lovren's partner in central defence, Joel Matip, was also on the scoresheet with a powerful header from a corner – and the No.6 was pleased with their contribution.
He said: “We knew that they are really dangerous at set-pieces, they are a really tall team. But we scored from two, perfect crosses from Philippe and great headers.”
And added: “Everyone up front was on fire, especially Philippe and Roberto [Firmino]. [Sadio] Mane had a couple of chances he could have scored in the first half. We just need to keep working hard and go step by step.”
Seven Seas Entertainment is thrilled to announce the license acquisition–both print and digital–of the manga The Voynich Hotel, the heavily requested title by fan-favorite creator Seiman Douman!

As he settles into his weird new life, this darkly comedic manga winds through plots both nefarious and romantic, delving ever deeper into the island's witchy–and sometimes demonic–strangeness.
Seven Seas will publish the manga The Voynich Hotel for the first time in North America in print and on digital platforms as single volume editions. Volume 1 will be released on June 26, 2018 for $12.99 USA / $14.99 CAN.
Luis Severino began his season in April pitching against the Double-A Akron Rubber Ducks at Canal Stadium in Ohio. He threw five scoreless innings, striking out eight and walking none. Since then, he has only gotten better. It has gotten to a point that Severino very well could make a playoff start in October if the New York Yankees make it to a divisional series.
Severino, who begins the Yankees' 10-game homestand on the mound Friday against the Tampa Bay Rays, is probably a favorite to start a division series game. Severino is 2-2 with a 2.17 ERA. If he had any run support, his record might be 4-0. (The Yankees scored just once in each of his losses.)
As it stands, the Yankees would be the wild card, which, if they were to win the elimination game, would basically guarantee they need to use four starters in the playoffs. But even if they win the division and go right into the divisional mix, they would figure to need four starters. Severino is clearly in the top four.
If we were handicapping how Brian Cashman and Joe Girardi would order the Yankees' rotation, it would be, as of now, as follows:
1) Masahiro Tanaka
2) Michael Pineda
3) Nathan Eovaldi
4) Severino
That would leave Ivan Nova and CC Sabathia on the outside looking in. Nova, coming off Tommy John surgery, has been inconsistent, going 5-7 with a 4.50 ERA in 12 starts. Sabathia has had a year to forget. He will try to come back from his latest knee setback, but there is still no evidence he can be consistently healthy and effective because of the injury.
That leaves the dynamic Severino, standing tall as a playoff starter, which has been in the back of the Yankees' minds for some time. The Yankees have mapped out Severino's innings, beginning at the end of last season, so his odometer would still have October playoff miles to use. Unlike the Mets with Matt Harvey, the Yankees have put no limitations on Severino here at the most crucial part of the season.
Severino is not giving the Yankees' length, but he is giving them quality. After going five innings in his debut, he has pitched six innings in each of his subsequent four starts. He has allowed three runs once, two once, one twice and his last time out he went six scoreless. So, besides his debut -- one of the two-run outings and the only one he went just five innings -- he has thrown what is considered a quality start each time out.
However, forget the numbers for a moment, here is the gut question the Yankees and their fans must ask themselves: Whom do you feel the most confident in on the mound? Severino tops Sabathia and Nova, for sure, and it is close with Tanaka, Pineda and Eovaldi.
The fact that Severino is 21 shouldn't bother anyone. He has handled the hype, the large media contingent and being a Yankee with relative ease. This year, the discussion is if he should be in the playoff rotation. He should.
By next year, the discussion might just be: Who should start Game 2 after Severino?
Young people, job creation and taxation have all been at the centre of the federal election campaign; yet almost nothing has been said about one of the sleeper issues these have in common - the cash-in-hand economy.
Youth unemployment is typically twice the national unemployment rate. Millennials are finding it harder to secure full-time work after leaving university. Shockingly, Australians aged 15-24 are at the highest risk of hospitalisation following a workplace accident.
However, there is another risk young people face that we know surprisingly little about.
A rose by any other name?
“Cash-in-hand” is a familiar phrase in our economy. Like most shady dealings, it goes by many names: unreported employment, the informal economy, or a grey labour market. Whatever we call it, it is used to circumvent Australian workplace and taxation legislation.
This should not be confused with being paid in cash. For example, let's say an employer wanted to reduce their expenditure on transaction fees. They could add up an employee's hours, calculate wages for the week minus tax, superannuation and other deductions. The adjusted wages could then be paid straight from the till, accompanied by a payslip.
The tell tale signs of a “cash-in-hand” job are a lack of formal employment paperwork, such as signed contracts, weekly payslips or a group certificate at tax time.
There are obvious downsides. These jobs are unlikely to pay the correct minimum wage, penalty rates, or super contributions. A greater concern is these jobs aren't covered by workers compensation. Considering the previously mentioned risk of hospitalisation, cash-in-hand jobs become a serious concern.
Who, what and why?
The most concerning aspect is that so little data is being collected about these jobs.
A 2012 survey found that one in four young workers had recently done cash-in-hand work. While no concrete data exists on where these jobs are being offered, we can make some educated guesses.
The figure above was created by selecting the top five jobs where the average age of employees was between 15-21. This gives us the most common industries for young Australians: fast food, hospitality, and retail.
Australian Institute of Health and Welfare analysis of ABS 2015
If we look at the orange portion of Figure 2, we can see that 29% of young Australians are combining work and study. This is especially relevant when we consider Student Visas, Youth Allowance and Austudy payments.
We know that approximately 899,000 young people are both working and studying. However, 229,900 are receiving study payments, at a maximum rate of $216.60 per week with the ability to earn an additional $216.50. This puts the maximum payment as $433.10 - just over $30 above the poverty line. Let's use some hypothetical examples, and say that “Julie” and “Ravi” are two of these student workers.
Julie is 18 and works casually at a local cafe in Brunswick while studying at the University of Melbourne. To maximise her earnings, she works 13 hours during the week at $16.61 an hour. This gives her $215.80, combined with her Austudy payments for a total of $432.40 per week.
She shares a three-bedroom house in Brunswick and pays $200 a week in rent. Her average weekly expenses are $104 on food, $10 for her mobile phone, $19.50 on her public transport, and $34 a week on utilities. This leaves her $64 per week for other expenses.
Ravi is a 21 year old international student. He is studying for his Masters at Deakin University and works at a supermarket in Burwood, near the house he and his brother share. His rent and expenses are comparable, but he cannot receive Austudy. His Visa states that he can only work 20 hrs a week, giving him a maximum income of $459.64 after tax. After accounting for expenditure, Ravi is a little better off with $92.13 to cover other expenses.
Neither example accounts for business cycle/seasonal demands, parental income affecting payments, unexpected expenses, legal fees, health costs, or textbooks. Basic living costs account for 80-87% of their entire wage.
If either student faces costs that can't be met by their usual wages, they may consider “cash-in-hand” work the only viable alternative. Julie will still get her Centrelink payments, and Ravi won't breach his visa requirements.
What we don't know could hurt us
The risks of this informal economy extend well beyond young workers. Professor Christopher Bajada estimates that cash-in-hand jobs make up a informal economy equivalent to 15% of Australia's GDP. Similarly, in 2004 the government estimated the informal economy between 3-15%.
Even if we take the lowest estimate of 3% of GDP, that's approximately AUD$48.6 billion outside our economy. A 2012 comprehensive report produced by The Australia Institute estimates a staggering $3.3 billion of revenue is being lost to cash-in-hand working arrangements. Given that taxation, debt and public spending have become key election battlegrounds, this lost revenue is potentially game changing.
PHOENIX — Students at a Phoenix high school walked out of class on Tuesday to protest President Donald Trump's decision to remove the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
News helicopters captured what appeared to be hundreds of students marching out of South Mountain High School near Seventh Street and Roeser Road.
The march ended outside of a Phoenix Police Department station, though some students later were taken by volunteers to a different protest outside Immigration and Customs Enforcement's downtown Phoenix office.
The students walked out of a parking lot entrance and went west on Roeser Road. They then turned south at Seventh Street, essentially walking the perimeter of the school and surrounding neighborhood.
The crowd was led by students carrying a banner that read “What side are you on? DACA and no cops or Trump?”
The students primarily stuck to the sidewalk and bike lane, though a few ran into the street. Cars and buses slowed while passing, with some drivers seemingly waving and showing support.
Several Phoenix police cars shadowed the group.
At least one bystander gave the students water.
Students at at least one other high school also walked out on Tuesday.
Trump's decision to end DACA was met with mixed reactions by lawmakers in Arizona. Numerous officials said ending the program put a lot of pressure on Congress to come up with a permanent solution.

Action Bronson and 'Kidz Bop 28' also debut in the top 10.
Kendrick Lamar scores a second week at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart with To Pimp a Butterfly. It's the first album to spend its first two weeks atop the list since Taylor Swift's 1989 last November. (To Pimp a Butterfly and 1989 are the only albums with multiple weeks at No. 1 in that span of time -- 1989 racked up 11 nonconsecutive weeks in the penthouse.)
The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week based on multi-metric consumption, which includes traditional album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA).
How Do Kendrick's First-Week Album Sales Stack Up Against Other Rappers?
To Pimp a Butterfly -- which was released through Top Dawg/Aftermath/Interscope Records -- moved 123,000 equivalent album units in the week ending March 29, according to Nielsen Music (down 66 percent). Traditional album sales accounted for 107,000 of that figure (down 67 percent). The album was released earlier than expected, and gave the rapper his first No. 1 on both the Billboard 200 and the Top Album Sales charts.
Lamar's set is also the first R&B/hip-hop album with multiple weeks at No. 1 since Beyonce's self-titled effort racked up three weeks at No. 1 in late 2013 and early 2014 (on the charts dated Dec. 28, 2013-Jan. 11, 2014).
The TV soundtrack to Empire stays steady at No. 2 with 61,000 units (down 44 percent), logging its third straight week in the top two rungs. That makes it the first soundtrack to spend its first three weeks in the top two since 2007, when High School Musical 2 spent its first four weeks at No. 1.
Taylor Swift's 'Style' Hits No. 1 on Adult Pop Songs
The Fifty Shades of Grey soundtrack rises a slot to No. 3 (54,000 units; down 10 percent). With two soundtracks in the top three, it's the first time the feat has occurred since the Aug. 30, 2014-dated chart, when Guardians of the Galaxy was No. 1 and Frozen was No. 3.
Sam Smith's In the Lonely Hour climbs 9-4 with 53,000 units (up 15 percent) while Taylor Swift's 1989 is stationary at No. 5 with 52,000 units (down 7 percent). Ed Sheeran's x moves 7-6 with 50,000 units (up 2 percent).
Rapper Action Bronson launches at No. 7 with his first full-length album for a major label, Mr. Wonderful. The Vice/Atlantic Records set bows with 49,000 units in its first week, and follows his No. 63-peaking EP Saaab Stories Produced by Harry Fraud in 2013.
Drake's former No. 1 If You're Reading This, It's Too Late slips 6-8 with 44,000 units (down 15 percent) while Maroon 5's V rises 10-9 with 42,000 units (down 6 percent).
'Kidz Bop 28': 10 Funniest Lyric Changes
Closing out the top 10 is the latest release from the long-running Kidz Bop series: Kidz Bop 28. It debuts at No. 10 with 40,000 units. It marks the 21st top 10 effort from the Kidz Bop franchise, which offers kid-friendly covers of contemporary pop songs. The first top 10 for the Kidz Bop franchise came in 2005 with the No. 7-peaking Kidz Bop 7. All of the brand's numbered albums since then (except for Kidz Bop 17) have reached the top 10. (In addition to the regular numbered releases, the Kidz Bop franchise has spawned themed sets like Kidz Bop Christmas, Kidz Bop Halloween Hits and Kidz Bop Party Hits.)
Over on the Top Kid Albums chart, which is devoted to children's music exclusively, Kidz Bop 28 enters at No. 1. It's the 30th leader for the series in the chart's history, and the 50th entry for the line overall.

Disney and Lucasfilm have yet to formally announce if an Obi-Wan Kenobi movie is going to happen, but Sideshow Collectibles is more than happy to give us a sneak peek of what the character might look like if the film gets made.
The company has just officially revealed a new 1:6 scale Obi-Wan Kenobi figure based on what the Jedi Knight may have looked like between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope. It's called Mythos Obi-Wan, and here are a few photos courtesy of StarWars.com.

The figure, which was first teased back in July before making an appearance at San Diego Comic-Con, is based on a long sold out statue of the same name, which you can see below.
This new figure, available to pre-order on September 21, has a ton of cool little details that place him specifically in the post-Sith, pre-Hope, Rebels/Rogue One timeline. He's got some old Clone Wars armor, he's holding onto Qui-Gon's lightsaber, he's got Anakin's lightsaber, and much more.

Basically, if and when this Ewan McGregor/Stephen Daldry Obi-Wan movie happens, this is what he's very likely going to look like. The designers even sculpted the face with both McGregor and Alec Guinness in mind.

Most of us know Ontario electricity bills are set to rise again. But did you know they're going up in May, July, November, then again on Jan. 1, 2016?
My Thursday column about Ontario's bloated and over-priced electrical system got a lot of feedback, including a note from an energy expert who offered to walk me through the coming increases.
Bruce Sharp is a mechanical engineer of 25 years experience who works for Aegent Energy Advisors, a small consulting outfit. They advise commercial energy users how to cut costs.
Not everyone will see the same increases, says Sharp, who lives in Milton. Rural users who buy their power from Hydro One will be socked a lot harder than city dwellers.
An average EnWin customer in Windsor should count on seeing increases of at least $231 by Jan. 1, or about $19.33 per month. Average rural users like me – I'm a Hydro One customer who uses about 800 kilowatt hours per month – should expect increases of $369 by Jan. 31, Sharp calculates.
In both cases, all of the increases will be dictated by the province, NOT the local utilities which collect the bills. Ontario's sneaky Liberal government has been hiding behind that bit of confusion for years now, letting little companies like EnWin, E.L.K and Essex Power Lines take the blame for all of their increases.
But no matter how much your bill is going up, the sheer number of individual increases we're facing over the next nine months will be shocking to some people — and difficult to swallow for those on tight budgets.
It's also devilishly difficult to explain or to understand Ontario's rate structure, which is just how politicians like it when they're trying to smoke one past you.
In Manitoba, there are only two parts to the bill, and they add up to only $81.09 per month. The basic monthly charge is $7.28, and there's a flat rate for power: 7.381 cents per kilowatt hour, according to Ontario opposition MPP Randy Hillier (C-Lanark-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington), whose staff compiled the figures.
Manitoba householders pay $73.81 for 1,000 kWh. In Ontario, we pay $92.80 for the same amount of power. But our total average bill comes to a whopping $188.13. How the price gets there is criminal. Or should be.
Ontario has three rate levels. The lowest charge is 7.7 cents per kWh, the highest 14 cents. The basic monthly charge here is $24.07.
But Ontario consumers also pay a bewildering array of other charges with confusing names: $11.19 for “line loss charge,” 79 cents for the “smart meter entity,” $7 for debt retirement” plus $5.95 for regulatory charges.
On top of all that comes $33.90 for the average monthly distribution charge, plus $4.99 for “transmission connection;” plus $7.19 per month for the “transmission network;” plus another “smart meter entity charge” of 25 cents per month.
Confused yet? Or just angry? Either way, it's about to get worse on May 1 when we'll see two or more increases rolled into one, Sharp warns.
One of the May 1 increases will be to the cost of power under Ontario Power Generation's Regulated Price Plan. A second one will be an increase to rural delivery charges. Some other increases might be rolled in, too.
The size of the RPP price increase will be announced in mid-April by the Ontario Energy Board. But some increases linked to nuclear power are also due to come in July. They might be split up and rolled into the May 1 and Nov. 1 increases, Sharp warned.
The nuclear charges are mostly to cover pension shortfalls among staff plus unforeseen cost increases in the refurbishment of nuclear power stations. Both are referred to by the industry (they say this with a straight face) as “unfavourable account variances.”
“They have some pretty hefty account variances,” Sharp said rather drily. I just bet they do.
The rate increase coming Nov. 1 could be larger than the one in May, Sharp warns, because “we have a lot of wind (turbine capacity) coming in, in particular in the next 18 months, and that's going to add some costs.” But that's very vague and fuzzy and it can't be calculated yet.
Then on Jan. 1, the vote-buying Clean Energy Benefit of about $19 per month disappears, and the new welfare rebates kick in, adding $120 to average bills.
The above are all the “common costs” that every customer in Ontario will share, Sharp says.
Hydro One customer will pay an extra $7 per month. “They've got probably the highest salaries and non-salaried costs of any of the distributors,” Sharp points out.
They also have long transmission lines and spread out rural customers. So some distribution costs in rural areas are going up about 10 per cent more to pay for that (and all the sunshine listers on staff).
There's been “a lot of talk” about raising peak rates during daytime hours, too, Sharp says. But this is what we know is coming. So brace yourselves.

Story highlights Supporters condemn haste with which Sen. Leila de Lima ordered arrested
De Lima has consistently denied involvement in the illegal drugs trade
Manila, Philippines (CNN) One of the fiercest critics of Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, Senator Leila de Lima, was arrested Friday morning.
She is accused of having abetted the illegal drug trade in the New Bilibid Prison when she was justice secretary from 2010 to 2015.
Police arrived at the doorstep of her Senate office minutes before 8 a.m. local time, as demonstrators waved banners in her support reading "one for Leila."
"I will go with them voluntarily," de Lima told reporters. "It is my honor to be jailed for what I am fighting for," she added, as her supporters shouted "laban Leila (fight Leila)" in the background.
"If they think that by jailing me, I will turn my back on my principles, they are mistaken. Instead, they have encouraged me more to pursue truth and justice," de Lima said in a statement.
Leonard Nimoy On The ‘Fringe' Season 4 Finale: William Bell “has become a world of his own”
This morning, Leonard Nimoy spoke to a few people of the press during a conference call about the very highly anticipated second part of the Fringe fourth season finale, which airs tomorrow, May 11 at 9pm on FOX.
Nimoy reprised his role as William Bell in last week's episode of Fringe “Brave New World” which made it clear that the character's intensions are less than good. Between sacrificing his own man, David Robert Jones, and his men shooting Astrid, whose fate is still unknown, everyone is wondering what is Bell really up to.
So what did Leonard Nimoy had to share about the second part of “Brave New World,” he gave us this clue, “You're going to see some interesting activity on the part of William Bell in this last episode. He has become a world of his own. Take that as a hint.”
He continued to explain that this episode is probably the most interesting of it all. In his own words, he described Bell as becoming “very exotic.” So expect him to do some “very strange and fantastic things.”
The best way to put it, as shared by Nimoy, is that William Bell was a very smart and rational character in the previous season, but now, while he's still very smart, he is not quite so rational anymore and we'll see that come to life in tomorrow night's episode. According to Nimoy there is quite a dramatic shift in the character and he described Bell's actions in tomorrow night's episode as “quite extraordinary.”
Finally, in terms of William Bell possibly coming back for the fifth season, Nimoy explained that he hadn't heard anything yet, but indicated that he would probably be talking about that soon.
I don't know about you, but that sounds all very exciting and mysterious. So don't forget to tune in to Fringe for its season finale tomorrow night at 9pm on FOX.
And to conclude let me leave you with a final quote from Leonard Nimoy about Fringe:
“I'm excited about the show, I'm proud to be connected with Fringe.”

CLOSE Police in China are investigating claims of sexual molestation and needlemarks on children at a Beijing kindergarten run by pre-school operator RYB Education Inc. Time

China's official Xinhua news agency joined a social media storm Friday, saying police were checking allegations that pre-school children had been "reportedly sexually molested, pierced by needles and given unidentified pills."
Reacting to the latest in a series of scandals over alleged supervisory lapses in China's booming private childcare sector, the education ministry urged officials nationwide to "take warning from these types of incidents."
Apology from operator
RYB Education apologized for the "serious anxiety this matter has brought to parents and society," saying the kindergarten's principal had asserted that the center was the victim of a frame-up by an "individual."
Three teachers had been suspended, said RYB, part of a fast-growing sector fulfilling a growing middle class' parental wish for high-end educational services.
It provides 1,300 daycare centers — some under franchise — and nearly 500 kindergartens in 300 Chinese cities, according to its website.
'Naked male'
Parents converged Thursday and Friday outside the Beijing kindergarten (pictured above), demanding answers.
Some said their children, as young as three, had spoken of a naked male adult conducting purported "medical check-ups" on them while they were also unclothed.
"We need clarification,” said a father who gave only his surname, Wang. A mother also present described the allegations as "unforgivable."
One father said he had canceled his son's enrolment and demanded a refund.
A Beijing mother whose children do not attend RYB schools, Zhang Yang, said the allegations were alarming because they were being made against a well-known private institution.
Independent verification was not available on the molestation claims against RYB, which was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in September.
Previous scandals
Earlier this year, RYB said it had found "serious mistakes” at another of its Beijing locations and asked its principal to step down.
In 2015, a court in Jilin province found two teachers guilty of physically abusing children at a kindergarten in the city of Siping.

The Brazilian came out of retirement to race for the team for a fourth year in 2017 after Valtteri Bottas replaced Nico Rosberg at Mercedes during the winter.
Massa scored 43 points for the team and was in contention to win the Azerbaijan Grand Prix before he suffered a technical problem.
Lowe said Massa was consistent throughout the year, which in turn meant rookie Lance Stroll always had strong benchmark to judge his performance.
"He was a great reference for it [performance of the car]," Lowe told Motorsport.com. "You always need a good reference somewhere in the garage.
"Sometimes you don't always find it on one side, you look for it on one or the other with two drivers.
"But Felipe has provided that reference at every race actually and that's been really valuable.
"There haven't been days where he's been lost, and not been able to give a reference for Lance and I think that's also quite remarkable."
Massa was in contention to retain his seat for a fifth season, but essentially ruled himself out because he asked for a decision before the Brazilian Grand Prix, which was something the team could not commit to.
"The selection of the drivers is a very complicated process and there are lots of different factors we're taking into account," said Lowe.
"With the timing of it all, Felipe needed a decision before Brazil, and we weren't able to. He was still in the running and was a strong candidate but we weren't able to make that commitment at that point.
"So we agreed that he would drop out of considerations and retire from the team."
BOSTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge rejected on Friday a request for a new trial for convicted Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, saying the issues his attorneys raised had been resolved prior to his trial last year.
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is pictured in this handout photo presented as evidence by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Boston, Massachusetts on March 23, 2015. REUTERS/U.S. Attorney's Office in Boston/Handout via Reuters
Tsarnaev was sentenced last June to death by lethal injection for his role in the 2013 bomb attack, which killed three people and injured more than 260.
The judge also ordered Tsarnaev to pay more than $101 million in restitution to victims.
U.S. District Judge George O'Toole said the court had already resolved some factors Tsarnaev's attorneys raised in seeking a new trial, such as their argument that it was impossible to seat an impartial jury in Boston due to intense publicity surrounding the attack.
“There is no reason to think that if the trial had been moved to another district, the local media in that district would not also have given it attentive coverage,” O'Toole wrote in his 37-page ruling.
He also noted that defense attorney Judith Clarke admitted in her opening statements that Tsarnaev, along with his older brother Tamerlan, carried out the attack, saying “It was him.”
The defense had focused on trying to spare Tsarnaev the death penalty, rather than prove his innocence.
The judge also rejected defense arguments that a new trial was justified by a Supreme Court decision, reached two days after Tsarnaev's sentencing, that a U.S. law stiffening sentences for crimes committed while in possession of a gun was overly broad.
Tsarnaev, 22, is being held at the “Supermax” high-security prison in Florence, Colorado, while his attorneys appeal his death sentence.
He was last seen in public on June 24, when he said he was “sorry for the lives I have taken.”
His older brother, Tamerlan, who participated in the April 15, 2013 attack, died following a gunbattle with police three days after the bombing.
The two were inspired by al Qaeda's militant ideology and used instructions from a magazine produced by the group to build their bombs, according to evidence presented at trial.
Martin Richard, 8; Chinese exchange student Lingzi Lu, 26, and restaurant manager Krystle Campbell, 29, died in the bombing. Three days later, the Tsarnaevs shot dead Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier, 26.
Legal wrangling over Tsarnaev's fate could play out for years or even decades. Just three of the 74 people sentenced to death in the United States for federal crimes since 1998 have been executed.
Dr. Dietz said the data probably reflected increased awareness of the obesity problem, especially among women, “who buy food, prepare it and see it, and they're making changes for themselves that they're also making for their kids.” He also cited a reduction in “less healthful foods” at school.
Some experts, though, were not optimistic that the leveling off was a result of improved eating and exercise habits.
“Until we see rates improving, not just staying the same, we can't have any confidence that our lifestyle has improved,” said Dr. David Ludwig, director of the Optimal Weight for Life Program at Children's Hospital Boston.
Dr. Ludwig said the plateau might just suggest that “we've reached a biological limit” to how obese people could get. When people eat more, he said, at first they gain weight; then a growing share of the calories go “into maintaining and moving around that excess tissue,” he continued, so that “a population doesn't keep getting heavier and heavier indefinitely.”
Furthermore, Dr. Ludwig said, “it could be that most of the people who are genetically susceptible, or susceptible for psychological or behavioral reasons, have already become obese.”

The numbers, published in The Journal of the American Medical Association, are based on national surveys that record heights and weights of a representative sample of Americans. People are considered obese if their body mass index — a ratio of height to weight — is 30 or greater. Someone five and a half feet tall is obese at 186 pounds; a six-foot person is obese at 221 pounds.
Even though the data show an overall plateau for obesity rates, they indicate an increase from 1999 to 2008 in the heaviest boys, ages 6 to 19, primarily whites. Experts speculated that heavy children in environments of unhealthy food and physical inactivity might simply be shifting into the top weight categories because their situation had not improved.
African-American adults have the highest obesity rates — 37 percent among men and nearly 50 percent among women. For Hispanic women, the rate is 43 percent. Hispanic and black children have higher rates than non-Hispanic whites.

Federal health officials had set a goal a decade ago that no more than 15 percent of people would be obese in 2010.
“We aren't near that, and we haven't moved in that direction,” said Cynthia L. Ogden, an epidemiologist at the National Center for Health Statistics and an author of the reports.
In addition, 68 percent of adults and nearly one-third of children are considered at least overweight, with a body mass index of 25 or higher. For a 5-foot-8 person, that would be 164 pounds.
Dr. Dietz said he hoped the obesity data would follow what happened with smoking rates, which leveled off before declining. But he said obesity was difficult to address because while “tobacco is a single source, obesity is both physical activity and diet.”
Experts like Steven Gortmaker, a Harvard public health professor, said obesity would decline only with new policies, like penalties and incentives to promote healthier foods and exercise.
“If you look at the reversal of the smoking epidemic,” Dr. Gortmaker said, “substantial change didn't really happen until there were bans on advertising and limits on consumption through things like taxation. We have to make some substantial changes.”
Just 12 per cent of NSW voters believe the $16.8 billion WestConnex motorway project will be a bad outcome for Sydney once it is completed in three stages over the next eight years, an exclusive Fairfax Media poll shows.
While the construction of the new motorway has been highly controversial in Sydney's inner west, the poll of 1600 voters shows almost 48 per cent believe WestConnex will be good for the city. About 40 per cent of voters is undecided.
The results of the ReachTEL poll commissioned by Fairfax Media came as the state government confirmed that tolls will be reintroduced on a 7.5-kilometre section of the M4 in the first three months of next year following its widening as part of WestConnex.
Under the distance-based pricing for the project, motorists will be charged up to $4.21 for a one-way trip on that section of the M4.
MEXICO CITY -- Mexican marines had barely faced down .50-caliber sniper guns and a loaded grenade launcher to recapture the world's most notorious drug lord when the calls started coming: Extradite Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman to the United States. And soon.
The Greatest Escape
Mexico's leaders avoided talk about extradition following Guzman's capture early Friday, but even if they decided to send him to the U.S., the process likely would not be fast. For now, they have sent him back to the Altiplano maximum-security prison from which he escaped in July.
Sources tell CBS News that the tip that led to Guzman's arrest came from U.S. law enforcement, CBS News correspondent Ben Tracy reports. Guzman is wanted in six states in the U.S.
Guzman, head of the powerful, international Sinaloa Cartel, was presented late Friday in dark blue athletic clothing. He was frog-marched to a helicopter by marines, who stopped mid-transit and turned his expressionless face toward the media for a clear view.
The calls for his quick extradition were the same as after the February 2014 capture of Guzman, who faces drug-trafficking charges. At the time, Mexico's government insisted it could handle the man who had already broken out of one maximum-security prison, saying he must pay his debt to Mexican society first.
Then Guzman escaped a second time last July 11 under the noses of guards and prison officials at Mexico's most secure lock-up, slipping out a tunnel so elaborate that it showed the country's depth of corruption while thoroughly embarrassing the administration of President Enrique Pena Nieto.
In celebrating Guzman's latest capture, Mexican officials showed none of their bravado of two years ago, though they made clear that the intelligence building and investigation were carried out entirely by Mexican forces. They did not mention extradition.
"They have to extradite him," said Alejandro Hope, a security analyst in Mexico. "It's almost a forced move."
U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican presidential candidate, echoed that sentiment, demanding that Guzman be immediately turned over to U.S. authorities. "Given that 'El Chapo' has already escaped from Mexican prison twice, this third opportunity to bring him to justice cannot be squandered," Rubio said.
"El Chapo" in custody, again
Pena Nieto went on Twitter to announce the capture: "Mission accomplished: we have him."
Guzman, a legendary figure in Mexico who went from a farmer's son to the world's top drug lord, was apprehended after a shootout between gunmen and Mexican marines at the home in Los Mochis, a seaside city in Guzman's home state of Sinaloa.
Apparently Guzman thought his story was worthy of Hollywood. Part of the reason authorities tracked him down to a house in an upscale neighborhood in a coastal city was because he wanted to film a biopic, Attorney General Arely Gomez said late Friday at the airport ceremony where the prisoner was shown off to the press.
"For that he established communication with actresses and producers, which became a new line of investigation," she said.
Revisiting El Chapo's daring 2015 prison escape
Friday's operation resulted from six months of investigation and intelligence-gathering by Mexican forces, who located Guzman in Durango state in October, but decided not to shoot because he was with two women and a child, she said. After that he took a lower profile and limited his communication until he decided to move to Los Mochis in December.
Gomez said that one of Guzman's key tunnel builders led them to the neighborhood in Los Mochis where authorities did surveillance for a month. The team noticed a lot of activity at the house Wednesday and the arrival of a car early Thursday morning. Authorities were able to determine that Guzman was inside the house, she said.
The marines decided to close in early Friday and were met with gunfire. Five suspects were killed and six others arrested. One marine was injured.
"You could hear intense gunfire and a helicopter; it was fierce," said a neighbor, adding that the battle raged for three hours, starting at 4 a.m. She refused to be quoted by name in fear for her own safety.
Gomez said Guzman and his security chief, "El Cholo" Ivan Gastelum, were able to flee via storm drains and escape through a manhole cover to the street, where they commandeered getaway cars. Marines climbed into the drains in pursuit. They closed in on the two men based on reports of stolen vehicles and they were arrested on the highway.
The troops took them to the roadside hotel Doux, where they awaited reinforcements, Gomez said.
In 2014, Guzman evaded capture by fleeing through a network of interconnected tunnels in the drainage system under Culiacan, the Sinaloa state capital.
"The arrest of today is very important for the government of Mexico. It shows that the public can have confidence in its institutions," Pena Nieto said later in a public address. "Mexicans can count on a government decided and determined to build a better country."
What happens now is more crucial for Guzman, whose cartel smuggles multi-ton cocaine shipments and marijuana and manufactures and transports methamphetamines and heroin, mostly to the U.S.
The United States filed requests for Guzman's extradition last June 25, just days before he escaped from prison. In September, a judge issued a second provisional arrest warrant on U.S. charges of organized crime, money laundering, drug trafficking, homicide and others. But Guzman's lawyers already had filed appeals and received injunctions that could delay the extradition process for months or even years.
At the home in Los Mochis, marines seized two armored vehicles, eight rifles, one handgun and a rocket-propelled grenade launcher at the home in Los Mochis, the navy's statement said.
Photos of the arms seized showed that two of the rifles were .50-caliber sniper guns, capable of penetrating most bullet-proof vests and cars. The grenade launcher was found loaded, with an extra round nearby. An assault rifle had a 40-mm grenade launcher and at least one grenade.
"The arrest is a significant achievement in our shared fight against transnational organized crime, violence, and drug trafficking," the Drug Enforcement Administration said in a statement.
After his first capture in Guatemala in June 1993, Guzman was sentenced to 20 years in prison. He reportedly made his 2001 escape from the maximum security prison in a laundry cart, though some have discounted that version.
His second escape last July was even more audacious. He fled down a hole in his shower stall in plain view of guards into a mile-long tunnel dug from a property outside the prison. The tunnel had ventilation, lights and a motorbike on rails. Construction noise as a digger broke through from the tunnel to his cell was obvious inside the prison, according to a video of Guzman in his cell just before he escaped.

Robert Sarver: Takeover bid rejected
Rangers have rejected an £18m takeover offer from American Robert Sarver, the club has announced to the Stock Exchange.
It emerged on Sunday night that the owner of NBA side Pheonix Suns wanted to buy a controlling stake in the crisis-hit Ibrox outfit.
But the recent purchases of significant shareholdings by Dave King and the Three Bears group – wealthy fans Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor – made any such move highly unlikely.
And now the club's directors – who are still looking for emergency cash, despite announcing a £500,000 loan from football board chairman Sandy Easdale on Monday – have confirmed they have knocked back Sarver's offer, which they consider too low.
However, they have encouraged him to work with other supporters to help find a solution to Rangers' financial problems,
In a 7am statement to the London Stock exchange, the board announced: "The proposal by Mr Sarver comprises a placing of 100 million shares at 18p ("Placing") which, if approved by shareholders at a general meeting, would be immediately followed by an unconditional offer at 18p pursuant to Rule 9 of the Code. The Placing would give Mr Sarver control of Rangers.
The Rangers board have rejected an £18m takeover bid from the American financier Robert Sarver The Rangers board have rejected an £18m takeover bid from the American financier Robert Sarver
"While the Directors welcome Mr Sarver's approach, they believe that, notwithstanding the current financial difficulties, the proposal does not adequately value a controlling interest in the Company and accordingly the resolution to approve the placing is unlikely to achieve the 75% majority required. The Directors do not intend to hold the General Meeting which would be necessary to implement the proposal.
"The Company is managing its cash resources carefully and will require further funding before the end of January. The Directors are in discussions with Rangers' significant stakeholders with a view to arranging finance for the Club.
“This is likely to comprise loans in the short term and possibly equity in the medium term. The board has invited Mr Sarver to consider participating in a similar discussion alongside other supportive shareholders."
Sarver made his offer just after Christmas after being encouraged to take a look at the ailing Glasgow giants by former Ibrox defender David Robertson - now a successful youth football director in Phoenix, Arizona.
In a separate Stock Exchange notice, the CEO of New York Stock Exchange-listed Western Alliance Bancorporation said: "My three sons all play soccer for Davie's club.
"Initially, I'd had some of my advisors examining potential investments in teams in the English Premier League and in Spain, but Davie encouraged me to take a close look at Rangers.
"Like all Rangers fans, he's really upset about how far the club has fallen in recent years and the more we spoke, the more interested I became. I'd be the first to admit that I'm not a lifelong Rangers supporter, but anyone who knows me is aware that I'm a genuine sports fanatic and owning two major basketball franchises for the past decade has been an enormous privilege."
Robertson added: "I've known Robert for several years. He has been very supportive of our local club and has a very good reputation in the US.
"When he said he was looking to invest in football in Europe, I told him right away that Rangers could really be doing with someone with his track record. I explained how far the club has fallen, but that there was huge potential to rebuild it.
"Even though I'm now based over here, I always watch really closely how things are going at Ibrox and it's tragic to see how a club which was once a force in Europe has been brought so low.
"I can tell every Rangers fan in Scotland and abroad, if Robert Sarver is successful in becoming part of the club, he'll not rest until they are back on top again."
Ivan Klasnic: Former Bolton striker has joined Mainz on a one-year contract
Former Bolton Wanderers striker Ivan Klasnic has signed a one-year contract with Mainz after being linked with Deportivo La Coruna and Liverpool.
Klasnic was available on a free transfer after leaving Bolton at the end of last season following the club's relegation from the Premier League.
He was mooted as a target for Queens Park Rangers and Sheffield Wednesday over the summer, while reports in Spain claimed Deportivo were hoping to snap up the Croatian.
Speculation also suggested Liverpool were considering Klasnic as an option to strengthen their attack following the failure to bring in a replacement for Andy Carroll before the transfer deadline.
However, the former Werder Bremen forward has opted for a return to the Bundesliga after agreeing a season-long deal with Mainz.
Flattering
"I had a bunch of enquiries, but the chance to play in the Bundesliga for Mainz was the most flattering from my point of view," Klasnic told the club's official website.
"Moving to Mainz will also be a boost for me in my private life as it will enable me to have a shorter distance to my daughter. My daughter lives in Hamburg.
"I will soon catch up my fitness deficit with regular training. I will be ready to play regular first-team football for Mainz as soon as possible."
Meanwhile, Mainz have allowed Nigerian striker Anthony Ujah to join relegated Cologne on a season-long loan deal after he scored just twice last term.
Scrawny spear squid have size where it matters—in their sperm.
A new study shows that the smaller males—called sneaker squid—pack heftier sperm than big spear squid. Also, the sneakers' sperm is tailored for a completely separate sperm reservoir, near the female's mouth, researchers found.
Female spear squid mate willingly only with big males, which court the females with natural, multicolored, pulsating lights—bioluminescent mating displays that the smaller males don't exhibit.
Once the female selects a male, he holds her above him and inserts his arm, holding a sperm packet, into her oviduct, a passage through which his sperm travels to her ovaries. He'll then watch over her until she spawns to try to ensure no other males fertilize her eggs.
Yet just as the female begins to lay her eggs on the seabed, a smaller squid, a sneaker, may dart over and mate with her head-to-head. (See squid pictures.)
A female is typically "willing to accept sneaky matings, as she has a specific sperm storage organ near [her] mouth for sneaker males," study first author Yoko Iwata, a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Tokyo, said by email.
Though the larger males end up fertilizing most of the eggs, the sneaker males' behavior ensures that the smaller squid still have a chance at fathering some of the offspring.
Bigger Sperm Matters
For the experiment, Iwata and colleagues dissected commercially fished squid, collecting sperm from the males and from the females' two sperm storage sites.
The team then measured the sperm cells under the microscope and discovered that the larger males' sperm—deposited inside the female—was an average of 73 millionths of a meter long. The sneaker male sperm averaged about 99 millionths of a meter.
The scientists also collected eggs from live female squid and artificially inseminated the eggs, confirming that both sperm types were fertile.
What's more, the two types of sperm swam at the same speed, suggesting that the bigger sperm don't have an edge in competition with the smaller sperm.
Rather, the sneakers' bigger sperm likely evolved to suit the females' sperm reservoir and the surrounding seawater.
In other words, each of the female's two sperm receptacles, and waters around these receptacles, may have varying characteristics—such as pH, salinity, or concentration of gases and nutrients—that favor the one sperm size over another.
The results are the first evidence of two different-size male types of the same species producing different-size sperm and using different sexual positions, according to the study, published recently in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology.
And there is likely an evolutionary benefit in all this, Iwata added: The sneaker sperm makes her offspring more genetically variable―and thus fitter in the long run.
How Does a Sneaker Become a Sneaker?
Still a mystery, however, is how baby spear squid males become sneakers or bigger males in the first place. Scientists don't know whether sneaker status is a genetic trait passed down by parents or if environmental factors, such as water temperature or food availability, turn a baby male into a sneaker.
But research in other squid species, at least, suggests the environment may be an influence.
William Gilly, a squid expert at Stanford University, said that young jumbo squid—also called Humboldt squid—completely change their lives cycles during years of El Niño, a warming of tropical waters in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean.
The warmer water somehow triggers young jumbo squid to begin breeding at six months of age, when their bodies are only about 8 inches (20 centimeters) long, not including arms and tentacles. Usually the squid breed at full maturity, when their bodies are up to 3 feet (1.8 meters) long.
Bus and cycle lanes on Northbourne median considered by Canberra Liberals
Updated
Northbourne Avenue could have dedicated bus and cycle lanes carved out of its median strip, under options being considered by the Canberra Liberals in their push against the Government's light rail project.
The party has pledged to cancel the $800 million Gungahlin-to-Civic line, arguing the cost provides little benefit.
Opposition spokesman Alistair Coe said a newly-released options paper set out an alternative vision.
"We're very keen to have a genuine discussion with the community about what the public transport options are for Northbourne Avenue," he said.
The paper puts forward three options, with buses either travelling in a dedicated lane in the centre median or through priority lanes at major intersections between Antill Street and Barry Drive.
"At present, whether you're on a bus or in a car that can take as much as 15 or 20 minutes," Mr Coe said.
"With a bus lane going down the median of Northbourne Avenue that journey time could be as short as five or six minutes."
That lane would travel in only one direction, with express buses heading southbound in the morning peak and northbound in the afternoon.
The Opposition has costed the cheapest option at $20 million, with the most expensive at more than $100 million.
"Whilst it is fairly expensive, it is still a fraction of the cost of light rail and it also doesn't have the operating expenses," Mr Coe said.
The Liberals have called on both the Government and wider community to give feedback on the paper.
"The Government did a deal with the Greens in order to get light rail off the ground, but that's not going to be the genesis of our transport planning," Mr Coe said.
"Our transport planning is going to be based on genuine options, genuine cost-benefit analysis and genuine consultation with the community."
Cost of tearing up light rail contracts not included, minister says
But Minister for Roads Mick Gentleman said light rail addressed the critical issue of congestion, which is predicted to worsen as Canberra's population expands.
"We need to reflect on the Infrastructure Australia report showing that the cost of do-nothing or similar approaches that we're doing now will cost us over $700 million per year in congestion by 2031," he said.
"This is why we're taking this active role in moving to light rail transport."
Mr Gentleman also questioned the costings in the report.
"We're concerned that that does not cover the cost of ripping up the contract for light rail," he said.
He said the ACT Government's strategy for urban renewal would be out shortly for public comment.
"We know by 2050 the population of the city and north Canberra is anticipated by more than 80 per cent. We need to respond to these emerging challenges," he said.
The ACT Government is set to begin construction of light rail next year, and Capital Metro Minister Simon Corbell has maintained the project will be a huge improvement for transport in Canberra.

The flat, dry pitch in Adelaide was expected to challenge the durability of fast bowlers from both teams with only three recovery days between the second Test finishing today and the battle resuming on Friday.
But the fact that England's batsmen succumbed so meekly in the first innings in Adelaide, coupled with the short spells in which captain Michael Clarke rotated his quicks, led to a cautious clean bill of health being issued by the Australian brains trust immediately after play today.
However, while Ryan Harris, Peter Siddle and Mitchell Johnson appear to have pulled up well after their productive Adelaide stint, auxiliary quicks Nathan Coulter-Nile and Doug Bollinger will remain with the squad to cover all possible contingencies.
And left-arm seamer James Faulkner, 12th man in both the opening Tests, will also come into calculations should Australia lean towards their previously favoured option of playing four fast bowlers on the traditionally lively Perth pitch.
"I think when we get to Perth and, as we do every Test match, every player will be assessed by our medical staff and if they are fully fit and able to perform at 100 per cent they will be available for selection," Clarke said.
"The selectors will pick what they think is the best 11 - that (policy) hasn't changed for a long time.
"If guys aren't 100 per cent fit to perform and help the team win they won't be selected.
"(But) from the information I have now, everybody has pulled up fine - batters included."
Clarke was at pains to keep all options open following his team's 218-run in Adelaide which gave them a two-nil lead in the five-match series.
He talked up the contribution of off-spinner Nathan Lyon in Brisbane and Adelaide and refused to commit to playing four quicks at a ground where England has won just once in an Ashes Test – back in 1978 against an Australian team ravaged by World Series Cricket.
"It's obviously exciting that we're going to a ground that we feel so comfortable playing at, but in saying that I've also experienced some defeats in my career in Perth," Clarke said today.
"I don't think it matters the conditions that we play in as long if we continue to play the brand of cricket that we've played.
"I think we would have to see the wicket first but I think Nathan Lyon deserves a lot of credit for the job he's done in this series as well.
"There was a lot of talk before the Gabba Test about playing four quicks and the selectors went with Nathan and he did a fantastic job."
Australia coach Darren Lehmann acknowledged that while the Perth pitch was likely to see a return to the short-pitched bowling tactics that his team employed in Brisbane, the WACA had also shown itself to be a good batting strip in recent years.
Another factor that might come into play is Perth's summer weather, with sunny days of 36C forecast for at least the first three days of the third Test.
"I think it will be a lot tougher than everyone is saying in the press," Lehmann said. "Obviously there will be some bounce and carry and it will be hot but it's been a good wicket this year so we'll have to play well.
"We just have to make sure we adapt to the Perth conditions.
"As you've seen, we adapted really well from Brisbane to here (Adelaide) and now we go back the other way.
"So we have to make sure we do that well."
I ran into Syrian Kurdish Democratic Union Party leader (PYD) Salih Muslim at a well-protected hotel in a Stockholm suburb. Our previous meeting had taken place some six months ago in Iraqi Kurdistan's Sulaimaniyah when I had asked him whether it was true that the Americans were encouraging the PYD to operate east of the Euphrates and advance toward Raqqa, despite Turkey's pressures not to let the Syrian Kurdish forces move to the west of the Euphrates. "Before attacking Raqqa, we must retake strategically located Manbij from Daesh [the Islamic State, or IS] to terminate the logistical support provided by Turkey to the Syrian capital [Raqqa] of the Islamic State,” Muslim responded then. “If Americans are serious about the liberation of Raqqa, they have to support us to cleanse Daesh from Manbij.”
Raqqa is on the east bank of the Euphrates, but Manbij is to the west of the river, northwest of Raqqa.
Months later, following three months of fighting, Americans provided air support to the Syrian Democratic Front (SDF) forces, which predominantly consist of the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), although it does have an Arab component. The fall of Manbij to the SDF prompted the Turkish military incursion into Syrian territory. Syrian opposition elements supported by Turkey calling themselves the Free Syrian Army (FSA) moved into Jarablus on the Turkish border and secured a 50-kilometer-wide (31-mile) stretch of land, pushing IS westward to al-Rai.
Recently, Dabiq, a town believed to have an important psychological importance for IS, was also taken by Turkish-supported forces.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, buoyed by Turkish and Turkish-supported Syrian opposition military advances and apparently uneasy about the ongoing American commitments to the PYD and the YPG (which he sees as terrorist organizations, and also always mentions in tandem with the Kurdistan Workers Party and Daesh), on Oct. 27 openly declared Turkey's aim of moving farther south to capture al-Bab and then to head east to Manbij to kick out the Syrian Kurdish forces there before finally marching farther east to liberate Raqqa from IS.
However, the SDF announced Nov. 6 that an operation to liberate Raqqa had begun. The same day, the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, Joseph Dunford, rushed to Ankara for a 4½-hour meeting with his Turkish counterpart.
And on Nov. 7, I was with PYD leader Muslim to hear his views on the rapidly developing situation in northern Syria. Was he worried about Turkey's hostile stance against the PYD and the YPG and also its professed military aim vis-a-vis al-Bab, Manbij and Raqqa?
He wasn't. He ruled out any possibility of Turkish military action targeting al-Bab. He said that while Turkish and Turkish-supported Syrian opposition forces are nearly 20-25 kilometers away, the Syrian regime's army and its allies, ranging from Hezbollah to Iranians, are as close as 12 kilometers from al-Bab. Salih said that al-Bab is a very strategic location for Aleppo and that it will be nearly impossible for Turkish forces to move into it unless the Turkish government risks a tough military showdown. He did not predict that it will.
Next I asked about Manbij. Was he worried that the Turkish army, which is fairly close to Manbij, will attack it to oust the SDF, or rather the YPG force, seizing that strategically positioned town on the road to Raqqa?
Muslim responded briefly and bluntly. “No way!” He has usually been reluctant to speak on thorny military issues concerning the fight against IS in northern Syria.
Why was he so confident? “Because we are there. We [implying the Kurdish YPG] are in Manbij,” he said.
He sounded adamant that the Kurdish forces and their Arab allies in the SDF will not concede Manbij without putting up a fight.
Erdoğan unequivocally and persistently had stated that the United States should put aside its alliance with the Syrian Kurds and rely on Turkey for the liberation of Raqqa. What if Turkey moves in — for example, from Tell Abyad on the border — to retake Raqqa from IS?
Muslim retorted in an apparent irony: “How will they do it? Jump over us?”
The implication is not mind-boggling. As the operation to liberate Raqqa has already started with cooperation between the Americans and the SDF, Turkey is already on the sidelines. Was there any connection between the date of the beginning of the Raqqa operation and denying Turkey a role in it?
He neither denied nor affirmed this, evading the question. He said the first task will be to undertake the siege of Raqqa. The encirclement and ultimately the liberation will take some time.
“We are moving from the north and the west and southwest." He said that taking part from the east of Raqqa will be the Arab forces of Ahmad Jarba (a former opposition Syrian National Council chairman and a leader of the powerful tribal confederation of Shammar), and to the south, Arab tribes of the Deir ez-Zor region. The Americans are said to be organizing a local Arab force from the town of Raqqa itself.
But Dunford's statement in Ankara following his meeting with his Turkish counterpart suggested that the United States may not be endorsing any role for the PYD and the YPG in Raqqa, while seeing one for Turkey.
“We always knew the SDF wasn't the solution for holding and governing Raqqa,” Dunford said. “What we are working on right now is to find the right mix of forces for the operation. [The operation needs] a predominantly Arab and Sunni Arab force,” he said. “And there are forces like that. There is the moderate Syrian opposition, the vetted Syrian forces and the Free Syrian Army forces, and there is some initial outreach to forces in Raqqa proper.”
The meeting reinforced the long-held promise that the coalition would not move ahead with the seizure phase in Raqqa “without incorporating the Turks and their perspective into our plans,” Dunford said. “They will be helpful in identifying the right forces to do that.”
When I brought up Dunford's statement, Muslim smiled. For him, it was more of a “declaration of intent” on the part of the Americans rather than a firm commitment toward Turkey that it will have a part in shaping Raqqa's future.
My last question to Muslim was whether he was worried — also given his ideological background — about an American sellout of the Kurds. If history guides us, he has to be concerned. The Kurds tasted that in 1975 with the Algiers Agreement between Iraq and Iran, which was actually engineered by then-US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.
“No,” responded Muslim. He is not worried. Not because the Americans have become more trustworthy after 40 years, but because the conditions are different. He claimed that the Kurds in Iraq under the leadership of Mullah Mustafa Barzani were not self-reliant in the 1970s but mostly dependent on Iran and other elements. “We are much better structured now,” he said. “We have been exercising self-rule on our territory since some time. And we proved ourselves as the best fighting force against Daesh. We did not knock on the doors of the Americans. They saw how we are on the battlefield and they allied with us. Their support with their air power is very important, but without us on the ground, it would not be as effective.”
He is very confident about solid cooperation with Washington. “Otherwise, the operation for the liberation of Raqqa could not begin,” he said.
All this was a day before the Nov. 8 election of Donald Trump as president of the United States of America. What lies in the near future for Syria, the Kurds and Turkey is now a huge question mark.

The search for a Traverse City man who police say made a threat to 'blow up a mall' ended Wednesday afternoon when he turned himself in.
Police said they were made aware of the threat after a family member called police.
This is not the first time police have dealt with 27-year-old Joseph Horger.
They've had multiple run-ins with him during the past few weeks.
It was just after one o'clock when Joeseph Horger turned himself in and ended a very tense morning for Traverse City Police, state police and the Grand Traverse Sheriff's Office.
"He assured us on the telephone with the detective that he was not wearing bombs, and he assured that he would not have weapons," said Chief Jeff O'Brien, Traverse City Police Department. "His hands were readily accessible. We felt pretty comfortable doing what we're doing."
Deputies said Horger said he was going to kill the first police officer he saw, and that he had a bomb on him and was going to blow up a mall and go out with a bang.
The Grand Traverse Mall and the Cherryland Center in Traverse City stayed open because police didn't think he was at or near the malls.
"We did not have a real concern at that point that Mr. Horger had left that area," said Undersheriff Nate Alger, Grand Traverse Sheriff's Office. "However, we did want to take precaution and notify the malls of the threat and take whatever efforts we could do to make sure that if he did slip though that net so to speak that we would have resources at the malls to take care of the situation. If it presented itself."
Late Wednesday after Horger was in custody investigators searched a Traverse City home where he has been staying.
"As we speak, we're taking that search warrant and looking for any type of explosive device, weapons, possibly narcotics," said Chief O'Brien. "We are in the process of clearing the residence right now."
Horger has not been charged in Wednesday's incident but is being held on a warrant for home invasion.
Horger is expected to undergo psychiatric evaluation while in jail.
Saudi officials denied that the missile hit the military camp near al-Mazahimiyah and it has not been possible to independently verify this fact.
No local residents have reported hearing an explosion on social media.
The Houthi rebels announced the successful launch of a Scud-type ballistic missile at around 8pm GMT.
Saba News agency quoted a Houthi spokesperson announcing the attack as a "successful test-fire of a precision, long-distance ballistic missile."
"We stress that the capital of [expletive] Saudi Arabia is now in the range of our missiles and, God willing, what is coming will be greater," a statement from the Houthi government said.
The Saudi minister of defence, Mohammad bin Salman, was at a meeting with Yemeni president Hadi at the time of the attack.
This is the second alleged Houthi Scud missile attack on Saudi soil in one week and the latest attack since Yemen started stockpiling missiles in summer 2016.
On 31 January, a Borkan-1 missile reportedly killed 80 coalition soldiers on a Saudi-UAE military base on Zuqar Island in the Red Sea. This attack was never confirmed or denied by the Saudi-led coalition.
International indignation erupted in November last year after a Houthi ballistic missile was shot down near the holy city of Mecca.
A video released on YouTube on Sunday night appears to show a large underground stockpile of Houthi missiles on lorries.
In 1858, hundreds of residents of Oberlin and Wellington, Ohio—many of them students and faculty at Oberlin College—surrounded Wadsworth's Hotel, in Wellington, in which law enforcement officers and slavehunters held a fugitive slave named John Price, under the authority of the Fugitive Slave Act. After a brief standoff, the armed crowd stormed the hotel and overpowered the captors. Price was freed and transported to safety in Canada (that's a photo of some of the rescuers in the courtyard of the Cuyahoga County Jail, below and to the right). I know these details because my son recently borrowed from the library The Price of Freedom, a book about the Oberlin-Wellington Rescue, as the incident is called (PDF). My wife and I used it as a starting point for telling our seven-year-old why we don't expect him to obey the law—that laws and the governments that pass them are often evil. We expect him, instead, to stand up for his rights and those of others, and to do good, even if that means breaking the law.
Our insistence on putting right before the law isn't a new position. I've always liked Ralph Waldo Emerson's sentiment that "Good men must not obey the laws too well." That's a well-known quote, but it comes from a longer essay in which he wrote:
Republics abound in young civilians, who believe that the laws make the city, that grave modifications of the policy and modes of living, and employments of the population, that commerce, education, and religion, may be voted in or out; and that any measure, though it were absurd, may be imposed on a people, if only you can get sufficient voices to make it a law. But the wise know that foolish legislation is a rope of sand, which perishes in the twisting ...
Rope of sand the law may be, but it can strangle unlucky people on the receiving end long before it perishes. John Price could well have ended up with not just the law, but a real rope, around his neck, just because he wanted to exercise the natural freedom to which he was entitled by birth as a sapient being.
John Price ended his life as a free man because he was willing to defy laws that said he was nothing but the property of other people, to be disposed of as they wished. He got a nice helping hand in maintaining his freedom from other people who were willing to not only defy laws that would compel them to collaborate in Price's bondage, but to beat the hell out of government agents charged with enforcing those laws.
Emerson would likely have approved. His son reported years later that, upon learning that his children were writing school compositions about building houses, he told them, "you must be sure to say that no house nowadays is perfect without having a nook where a fugitive slave can be safely hidden away."
Much influenced by Emerson, but more down to Earth, Henry David Thoreau went to jail (however briefly) for refusing to pay tax to support the Mexican War. In an essay now known as "Civil Disobedience," he wrote:
Must the citizen ever for a moment, or in the least degree, resign his conscience to the legislator? Why has every man a conscience then? I think that we should be men first, and subjects afterward. It is not desirable to cultivate a respect for the law, so much as for the right. The only obligation which I have a right to assume is to do at any time what I think right.
This is the same essay in which Thoreau famously stated, "that government is best which governs not at all." Government was not an institution he held in high regard. He fretted that soldiers, police, and other officials "serve the state thus, not as men mainly, but as machines" and that "in most cases there is no free exercise whatever of the judgment or of the moral sense; but they put themselves on a level with wood and earth and stones."
Ours being a more academic and less poetic age, Thoreau's sentiments are likely to be captured these days as embodying the divide between Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development. Specifically, they mark the difference between conventional thinkers who believe the law is due obedience because somehow it defines morality, and post-conventional thinkers who believe that higher principles take precedence over the law.
Yeah, I prefer Emerson and Thoreau, too.
Personally, I would say that I love liberty more than any other value, and I don't give a damn if my neighbors or the state disagree. I will be free, and I'm willing to help others be free, if they want my assistance. Screw any laws to the contrary. I don't think social psychologist Jonathan Haidt would be surprised at my attitude. According to him, that's what makes libertarians tick. And that's what my wife and I are trying to pass on to our son.
Slavery and the Mexican War are, thankfully, dead issues in this country, but that doesn't mean there's any shortage of objectionable restrictions and mandates laid upon us by law and the government. Taxes, nanny-state restrictions, business regulations, drug laws ... All beg for defiance. The Fugitive Slave Law may no longer command Americans to do evil, but "safety" rules would have physicians and mental health professionals snitch on their patients. And there's always another military adventure, someplace, on which politicians want to expend other people's blood and money.
I sincerely hope that my son never has to run for his freedom in defiance of evil laws, like John Price. I also hope, at least a little, that he never has to beat the stuffing out of police officers, as did the residents of Oberlin and Wellington, to defend the freedom of another. But, if he does, I want him to do so without reservations.
If all my son does is live his life a little freer than the law allows, then we've done some good. A few regulations ignored and some paperwork tossed in the garbage can make the world a much easier place in which to live. Better yet, if he sits on a jury or two and stubbornly refuses to find any reason why he should convict some poor mark who was hauled in for owning a forbidden firearm or for ingesting the wrong chemicals. Jury nullification isn't illegal (yet), but it helps others escape punishment for doing things that are, but ought not be. No harm, no foul is a good rule for a juror, no matter what lawmakers say.
And, if he wants to go beyond that, and actively help people defy the prohibitions and authoritarian outrages of the years to come, he'll be cheered on by me, his mother, and perhaps even (depending on your views on the matter) an approving audience of spectral ancestors. Our family has long experience with scoffing at the law. Purveying the forbidden or conveying the persecuted are honorable occupations, whether done for profit or out of personal commitment.
As I think our son has already come to appreciate, making the world freer is always right, especially when the law is wrong.
In January 2009, the U.S. ambassador in Rome cabled Washington to raise an alarm. Russian President Vladimir Putin, the diplomat wrote, had cultivated a troubling relationship with the country's prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi.
“Berlusconi admires Putin's macho, decisive, and authoritarian governing style, which the Italian PM believes matches his own,” wrote the ambassador, Ronald P. Spogli. “From the Russian side, it appears that Putin has devoted much energy to developing Berlusconi's trust.“
Story Continued Below
The ambassador noted with concern that the brash Italian billionaire, who was driven from office by scandal in 2011, was openly challenging U.S. policy toward Russia and echoing Putin's views on issues from NATO expansion to Kosovo to missile defense.
And he shared reports from opposition party contacts of a more “nefarious” factor: talk that “Berlusconi and his cronies are profiting personally and handsomely” from business ties to Russia.
Seven years after that cable, disclosed by WikiLeaks, the Berlusconi-Putin bromance has acquired a new resonance, as foreign policy analysts and even some U.S. officials see unsettling echoes in the recent long-distance kinship between the Russian leader and Donald J. Trump.
It may even suggest that Putin is applying a specific method to the GOP nominee. In recent years Putin has befriended several major Western European politicians, including former leaders of France and Germany, who openly challenge U.S. and European policies toward Russia, including NATO's buildup in Eastern Europe and economic sanctions punishing Putin's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.
But Trump is most frequently compared to the 79-year-old Berlusconi. Both men are wealthy populists known for their expensive tastes, outrageous rhetoric, relationships with women and all-around showmanship. Like Berlusconi, Trump has demonstrated an unusual affinity for Putin — along with notable dissent from confrontational U.S. and Western European policies toward Russia.
Putin's friendship with the Italian may simply demonstrate that the Russian leader has a natural chemistry with a rich, politically incorrect businessman.
To some, however, it hints at something more.
“The parallels with Trump are a little too disturbing,” says a U.S. government analyst who closely tracked Russia's relationship with Europe when Berlusconi was in office. “Putin is very strategic. He would focus on people's vulnerabilities — whether their vanity or greed or financial needs.”
That view echoes the analysis of former deputy CIA director Michael Morell, who recently wrote in The New York Times that Putin, drawing from his background as an intelligence officer, had made a “calculated” overture to Trump early in the presidential campaign, “playing upon Mr. Trump's vulnerabilities by complimenting him,” and turning Trump into an “unwitting agent” of Russia.
Asked about Trump in December, Putin described the New Yorker as “bright and talented,” words that clearly pleased Trump: “It is always a great honor to be so nicely complimented by a man so highly respected within his own country and beyond,” the mogul told reporters soon after. Since then, Trump has praised and defended Putin — including against the charge of having Russian journalists killed — and has pledged to establish better relations with Moscow.
Though Trump, in recent interviews, has downplayed his affinity for Putin, the Republican nominee has also taken several policy positions that echo the Kremlin line. He has questioned the relevance of the 67-year-old NATO alliance, called for U.S.-Russian cooperation against the Islamic State, and questioned U.S. and European sanctions imposed on Moscow after Putin's forcible March 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula.
Berlusconi, who remains close to the 63-year-old Putin, has offered similarly Putin-friendly views over the years. During a September visit to Crimea with Putin, Berlusconi called a 2014 referendum there in favor of Russia's forcible annexation of the strategic peninsula “democratic” and “valid,” even though the U.S. and European Union have denounced the vote as invalid. Trump also recently cited the referendum as evidence that Russia's claim on Crimea may be legitimate.
But Trump's relationship with Putin — whom Trump says he's never even met — remains embryonic compared to the extraordinary kinship between the Russian leader and his Italian chum.
Putin and Berlusconi bonded in the early 2000s, soon after each took office — Putin in 1999 and Berlusconi, who served one term asprime minister in the mid-90s, in 2001. Berlusconi holidayed at Putin's dacha on the Black Sea, while the Russian stayed at the Italian leader's villa in Sardinia. Even as Putin's international reputation darkened, they hit the slopes in Sochi and dined in a tent on a wildlife reserve in giant fur hats.
They even became merry pranksters. During one Berlusconi visit to St. Petersburg, Putin jokingly startled his Italian pal: “Putin hid behind the pillar, and did ‘coo coo' to me from behind!” he told the BBC in a 2014 interview.
U.S. officials suspected the friendship went beyond innocent antics. An October 2009 cable from the U.S. embassy fretted that Berlusconi had recently skipped a state visit by Jordan's King Abdullah, claiming illness the day before a planned three-day visit with Putin. U.S. ambassador David Thorne wrote that Berlusconi had “left the impression that … he was husbanding his flagging energies for a blow-out party at Putin's dacha.”
As the January 2009 cable noted, the officials also suspected that illicit money might be fueling the friendship. One October 2008 U.S. cable from Rome noted that “many (including his own party officials) suspect [Berlusconi] has a personally and financially enriching relationship” with Putin's oligarch allies.
In recent weeks, allies of Hillary Clinton have fanned rumors and speculative press reports suggesting that Russian investments in Trump business ventures have influenced his views. Trump and his son Donald Jr. have made numerous trips to Russia exploring business deals there, and in 2008 Donald Jr. told an audience that Russian money makes up a “disproportionate share” of the family company's assets. Trump has denied having financial ties to Russia, though his refusal to release his tax returns makes that impossible to verify.
The U.S. official said that, like Trump, Berlusconi — who left office in 2011 under a cloud of legal charges, including tax fraud and sex with a 17-year-old prostitute (for which he was cleared) — often took a friendly line toward Russia under the guise of his nation's self-interest. “He seemed to be providing a very rational approach to Russia, but it was always on Russia's terms,” the official said.
At various times Berlusconi defended Putin's military incursion into the republic of Georgia, which the U.S. and much of Europe strongly denounced. He praised Putin's leadership style. And after a fall 2008 meeting with Putin, Berlusconi echoed the Kremlin line that the U.S. had “provoked” Russia by backing independence for Kosovo, moving forward with missile defense systems in Eastern Europe and wooing Ukraine and Georgia closer to NATO. In a cable at the time, a senior U.S. diplomat in Rome wrote that the Italian leader wanted to “lobby the incoming U.S. President to take a softer line on Russia.”
“In reality, what he was doing was pushing Putin's agenda with no real guarantee that Putin would ever compromise on our agenda,” says the U.S. official, who spoke to POLITICO. “I see a similar trend with Trump."
Other members of Berlusconi's government often expressed surprise at the prime minister's views, the official said — a view backed up by a diplomatic cable reporting that an unnamed Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs official told U.S. diplomats in Rome that “she had no insight whatsoever as to what had animated” Berlusconi's remarks on Kosovo and missile defense.
Putin, for his part, returned his friend's praise — and even defended Berlusconi from the charge he'd had sex with underage girls at his notorious "bunga bunga" parties.
"Berlusconi faces trial for bedding women," Putin said in September 2013. "If he was gay, no one would ever lay a finger on him."
Measuring the precise effect Berlusconi's views had on U.S. or European policy toward Russia is difficult. Samuel Charap, a former State Department official now with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, noted that "Italy, generally speaking, is one of the more Russia-friendly countries in Europe."
But Putin has also courted other prominent European leaders of his generation. After leaving office, the former German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder joined the board of the Russian energy giant Gazprom, and in 2014 he attended a lavish 70th birthday party thrown for him by a Gazprom subsidiary in St. Petersburg at which Putin was in attendance. Schroeder has reportedly infuriated his successor, Angela Merkel, with his comments downplaying the severity of Putin's incursions into Ukraine.
A recent visit to Moscow by former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, meanwhile, raised eyebrows in Paris and Washington, after Sarkozy — who may run for president again next year — warned against a new Cold War and spoke in favor of lifting sanctions on Russia.
U.S. officials bridle at the way such talk muddles their carefully orchestrated message of U.S.-Europe unity against Putin's aggression. And they say Berlusconi, who remains close to Putin, still does his share of the troublemaking.
During an October 2014 international summit in Milan, the Russian dropped in on Berlusconi's villa for a nightcap at 1:30 a.m. that reportedly lasted beyond 3 a.m. On a trip to Rome the next year, Putin again dropped in on his Italian friend, who pledged to use his enduring political influence to push for an end to European sanctions against Russia — and later publicly pledged to help “convince our American friends that the return to the atmosphere of the Cold War is inadmissible.”
Most memorably, perhaps, the two men paid a joint visit in September to Crimea — itself a political statement, given the landmass' disputed status. While touring a winery, the two men were shown several bottles of a dust-covered 1775 vintage wine imported during the reign of Catherine the Great.
Berlusconi asked whether it was possible to drink the wine; it was. Though it's unclear whether the men had more than "a taste," as the Italian later put it, some reports had them polishing off an entire bottle, priced at more than $100,000. Crimea's top prosecutor threatened criminal charges over what he called the violation of "the heritage of all Ukrainian people."
Berlusconi, for his part, was unfazed by both the political and oenophilic controversies.
"You should see the love, the gratitude and the friendliness that welcomed Putin" in Crimea, he told reporters, calling Putin the world's "No. 1" political leader. "Women threw themselves into his arms saying, 'Thank you, Vladimir. Thank you, Vladimir,'" he added.
As for the wine, Berlusconi pronounced it "delicious."
TransCanada, the energy company behind the Keystone XL pipeline, was ordered by the Texas State Supreme Court last week to submit information on its use of eminent domain—an action that keeps a key landowner lawsuit alive.
Keystone opponents celebrated the move as a small victory in a larger battle against the company's seizure of private property that has united left and right in Texas.
The paperwork will be used by state Supreme Court justices to decide whether to hear a case by Julia Trigg Crawford, a farmer who is arguing that TransCanada illegally used eminent domain to take over part of her land to build its pipeline.
At issue are the legal rights of landowners to prevent corporations from condemning private lands to build oil and gas infrastructure projects. The Keystone XL is being constructed to carry oil from Canada's tar sands mines to Texas, and its 485-mile southern leg from Oklahoma to near Houston was completed this month. Depending on the outcome of Crawford's case, TransCanada possibly could be forced to dig up the section of the pipe that runs through her property. The northern segment still needs State Department approval because it crosses an international boundary.
TransCanada's takeover of private land has been a thorny issue in Texas and has brought together unlikely bedfellows. They range from environmentalists who largely oppose the project out of safety, water and climate change concerns to Tea Party members who see TransCanada's power to seize people's property as an abuse of eminent domain and government overreach.
Crawford's case has been making its way through the court system since 2012, with lower courts ruling that TransCanada was in the right to use eminent domain. The state Supreme Court's decision on Jan. 7 to force the company to submit information about its use of eminent domain is "promising news," said Renea Hicks, an Austin-based lawyer who has worked on land-use issues, but is not involved in this case.
"That they want more information means they are at least considering hearing the case," he said. "Historically, in 70 percent of the cases they do decide to hear, they reverse the lower courts' decision."
TransCanada has until Feb. 6 to file the information.
Shawn Howard, a spokesman for the company, said TransCanada isn't worried about the request.
"The court has simply requested a response to her claim as part of the Texas Supreme Court process," he said. "We are preparing and filing our response shortly."
If the state Supreme Court decides to hear the case and rules in favor of Crawford, it would set a legal precedent for the handful of other similar eminent domain cases underway in the state against TransCanada, according to Hicks. The pipeline is scheduled to begin transporting oil next week.
However, if the justices decide not to hear the case—or if they hear the case and uphold the lower courts' rulings—TransCanada's power of eminent domain would be allowed to stand and the pipeline could stay where it is.
Crawford, a third-generation farmer in Lamar County, filed her lawsuit after TransCanada was given permission to seize a 50-foot wide parcel of her 650 acres against her will. The company was granted eminent domain by the state's Railroad Commission, which regulates the oil and gas industry, on grounds that the Keystone XL is a "common carrier." The designation means the pipeline will be used for the good of the Texas public, among other things, and it gives the company a greenlight to condemn property using eminent domain, even if a landowner objects.
One of the only ways for landowners to challenge TransCanada is to prove that the project is not a common carrier, which is what Crawford and her lawyers are trying to do by arguing the pipeline doesn't have any "on-ramps" in Texas, meaning it can't service Texas companies.
"TransCanada has repeatedly demonstrated that it qualifies for common carrier status in the State of Texas," Howard said.
'It Could Ruin the Farm'
Crawford told InsideClimate News that TransCanada first approached her father in 2008 about using a section of her family's farm for the Keystone XL. Her father refused the company's initial financial offer of $7,000. When Crawford took over management of the farm in 2010, TransCanada was still trying to obtain access. In 2012, the Canadian company made a final offer of $21,000. When she rejected the deal, the company filed for eminent domain with the Texas Railroad Commission and was granted rights to the land. Crawford immediately appealed the approval.
While the case was in appeals, TransCanada laid pipe on her stretch of land.
Crawford said that to access her property the company had to run the pipeline under a creek that borders her land. She said she uses the water to irrigate approximately 400 acres of corn, soybean and wheat crop.
Pointing to an ExxonMobil oil pipeline spill in an Arkansas neighborhood last year, and to a much larger spill in Michigan that is still being cleaned up more than three years later, Crawford said the risks are too high.
"Between what happened in Michigan and Arkansas, we know how disastrous it is when tar sands spill into water," Crawford said. "I already talked to my insurance company and they won't cover my crop losses if the pipeline leaks. It could ruin the farm."
For now, Crawford said she is pleased that she might have a shot at getting heard by the highest court in the state.
"Even just hearing that they are interested [in hearing the case] makes us optimistic," Crawford said. "It is a little win in a much bigger battle."
Republicans have been tight-lipped so far about Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's surprise offer of $2.7 trillion in spending cuts — and no tax revenue — to raise the debt limit through 2012.
There are a few reasons for that. First, as Red State's Erick Erickson subtly pointed out, Republicans were not expecting to wake up to headlines noting that Reid's offering more immediate cuts than House Speaker John Boehner's proposing. Second, because about a trillion of those dollars comes from the expected wind down of military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan — a source of savings Republicans have recently opposed but, oops, voted for in the House GOP budget.
But another reason, according to one senior GOP aide is that Reid decided to go it alone pretty abruptly, and they haven't seen his proposal yet.
“The Speaker, Sen. Reid and Sen. [Mitch] McConnell all agreed on the general framework of a two-part plan,” the aide says. “A short-term increase (with cuts greater than the increase), combined with a committee to find long-term savings before the rest of the increase would be considered. Sen. Reid took the bipartisan plan to the White House and the President said no.”Reid's staff disputes this version of events. In their telling Reid and his aides pursued a range of options at both the staff-level, and at a principals level, through the weekend. Reid was willing to accept budget cuts in two phases, but would not agree to a short-term debt limit extension if it just meant replaying this fight all over again several months from now. Boehner wouldn't (or couldn't) bite. Reid left a Saturday evening meeting angry, said no short-term deal, and began contemplating the one-step approach, which leaked Sunday afternoon, and that he ultimately settled on Sunday night.
Republican and Democratic staff continued to pursue a two-step solution to the problem on Sunday, while Dem staff began worked separately on the one-step plan on their own. By Sunday evening, the two separate debt hikes remained a sticking point, and at a White House meeting last night, Reid presented Pelosi and President Obama both frameworks. All agreed that that the single-step process was the way to go — really the only bright-line Dems have drawn in this entire debate — and that's why things ended as they did late last night.
The conflicting narratives suggest there isn't a whole lot of good will left between the interested parties. But whether or not they feel they got tripped up by the Dems' decision, the big question now is whether Republicans will accept the offer on the grounds that it's, well, pretty much everything they've asked for. We'll learn more in the coming hours.
As part of my compiler project, one of my imminent decisions is what object model to use, and sine I like Ruby it seemed a good time to go through Ruby and look at the guts of the Ruby object model. If you've dabbled in meta-programming etc. for Ruby this post probably doesn't contain much new stuff for you. If you're a beginner you may want to look at a tutorial instead.
If you're somewhere in between, hopefully there may be some insights here and there - especially if you're interested specifically in how things work "under the hood" rather than just what is visible to Ruby.
The information in this post is based largely on the Ruby 1.8.x interpreter (you'll see it referred to as MRI as well - Matz Ruby interpreter - to distinguish it from other Ruby implementations), and we'll look at code fragments, as well as a diagram or two to illustrate.

The Ruby object model can make you go insane. _why has a great article that illuminates the particular hairy beast that is meta classes
Ruby Objects
Conceptually, Ruby objects consist of the following:
A reference to the objects immediate class - the MRI interpreter stores this in a field named "klass" and you may see the term "klass" show up in Ruby-land a lot for that reason. For an object that has an meta-class this is a pointer to the meta-class
is a pointer to the meta-class A hash table of instance variables
A set of flags (taint etc.)
MRI "cheats" in that objects of the built-in classes Class, Float, Bignum,Struct, String, Array, Regexp, Hash and File are not real Ruby objects: They don't have the hash table of instance variables. Instead they have a fixed structure. You can still set instance variables for these objects, but behind the scenes MRI 1.8.x at least will then create an instance variable hash table and store that hash table in a hash mapping from the object. This saves a little bit of space if (as is usually the case) most objects of these built in classes don't have instance variables besides the "hardcoded" ones - for small objects like Float in particular this can be a significant saving.
(The following is updated per comment from Rick DeNatale below:)
For some other classes, there's not even a pointer. MRI takes advantage of the fact that there are certain values the object pointer won't take. When MRI determines the class of an "object" it follows the following procedure:
If the least significant bit (bit 0) is set to 1, the object is a Fixnum. This works since the object pointer will point to an address that's aligned in memory, and so never will have bitten 0 set.
If the value matches 0, it's class is FalseClass, 2 = TrueClass, 4 = NilClass, 6 = undefined.
If the lowest byte of the value matches 0x0e, it's a Symbol, and the Symbol is determined from the top 3 bytes.
Ruby Classes
"Real" classes.
Meta-classes or "eigenclasses" as they are often called. MRI also refers to them as "virtual" classes.
This use of part of the value to indicate type is often called a "type tag" - some language environments will use more bits or more complicated schemes to avoid having to allocate full objects.There are two types of Ruby classes:A meta-class is for all practical purposes an actual class. It is an object of type Class. The only thing "special" about a meta-class is that it is created as needed and inserted in the inheritance chain before the objects "real" class. So inside the MRI interpreter object->klass can refer to a meta-class, that has a pointer named "super" that refers to the next class in the chain. When you call object.class in MRI, the interpreter actually "skips" over the meta-class (and modules) if it's there.
The diagram below shows the actual inheritance of Object, Module and Class in MRI as visible from C. If this doesn't make sense to you, read the section on #send below, but particularly keep in mind that:
Classes are objects. So they are also instances of another class.
A class object is NOT an instance of it's superclass. [some class object].class denotes "instance of", [some class object].superclass denotes "inherits from".
To find out which method implementation is called for any object, you go "out and up". That is, you find the objects "klass", and then follow the "super" chain up until you find a matching method. This gets confusing for classes because they are also objects: You do NOT follow super for the first step for classes - they behave exactly like objects.
In the diagram below, "normal" classes are green, and meta-classes are blue. The dashed lines represent "instance off" (the "klass" pointer), and the solid lines represent "inherits" (the "super" method):
So, for example, when sending a message to the object Class, you step out, to the meta class "Class" (in blue), and look for it there, if you don't find it, you follow the solid arrows until you do. This in turn will get you: the Module meta class, the Object meta class, Class, Module, Object, Kernel (since classes in Ruby are open, you might also find someone has reopened the class and caused additional modules etc. to get inserted into the inheritance chain).
Because Ruby's #class method skips metaclasses, you will get "Class" returned if you do Class.class - it's following the same chain as above, but skipping the blue boxes (and any included Module's)
To explore the class/metaclass inheritance in Ruby, you can use this minimal extension to see what values MRI actually operates on:
#include "ruby.h" VALUE real_super ( VALUE self ) { return RCLASS ( self ) -> super ; } VALUE real_klass ( VALUE self ) { return RBASIC ( self ) -> klass ; } void Init_inheritance () { rb_define_method ( rb_cClass , "real_super" , real_super , 0 ); rb_define_method ( rb_cClass , "real_klass" , real_klass , 0 ); }
Put the above in "inheritance.c" and create extconf.rb:
require 'mkmf' extension_name = 'inheritance' dir_config ( extension_name ) create_makefile ( extension_name )
To use it do "ruby extconf.rb ; make", and then:
p Object . real_klass p Object . real_super
Conceptually a Class object consist of:
A reference to the objects immediate class (as for a "real" Ruby object) - this would normally be the class "Class"
A set of flags (taint etc.)
A hash table of instance variables (for the class)
A hash table of methods
A reference to the superclass, i.e. the class this class has inherited from.
Ruby Modules
Taint, Frozen and other flags
A Ruby Module is an object that acts as a placeholder for methods and constants. Module is actually the superclass of Class. The main distinction is that you can't create instances of a module, but you can (obviously) create instances of a class.Internally in MRI the structure of a Module and Class objects is the same.
MRI defines the following flags for an object:
Singleton
Mark
Finalize
Taint
Exivar
Freeze
A number of "user" flags.
"Singleton" is set on objects of type Class that are meta-classes.
Mark and Finalize are used by the garbage collector. "Taint" is used for the "taint mode" - depending on the security level, some objects may be marked as "tainted" and thus unsafe, and certain operations may be disallowed.
"Exivar" is used for objects of the "fake" builtin classes to indicate that this instance has an external instance variable hash table that must be looked up elsewhere.
"Freeze" prevents an object from being modified.
Of these, only Singleton, Taint and Freeze represent behavior that are "observable" from inside Ruby, as opposed to when delving under the hood of MRI.
Send
Identify the class to start at. "Objects" of class Fixnum are treated specially since they're not actually objects at all. nil, true and false are also special cased. For other objects this means grabbing the "klass" pointer.
The method cache is checked, to avoid complex lookups of the method on repeated calls.
If not in the method cache, the method is searched for. This is done by lookup up the method in the "klass", and if not found replace "klass" with "klass->super" and try again, until the top of the inheritance chain is found (in which case the method doesn't exist). The result is put in the cache.
If the method is not found, method_missing is called in roughly the same way.
private/protected access checks are carried out
Access checks are done in case the safe level is set to trigger exceptions for unsafe operations.
The arguments are prepared
A "stack frame" is prepared - MRI maintains it's own "Ruby stack"
If the method is a C function various special setup is done.
If the method is an attribute getter/setter (attr_accessor/attr_read/attr_write), the appropriate built-in MRI functions are called rather than executing a method body. Same with methods consisting of "super"
The method is finally called.
Send is perhaps the most vital concept in the Ruby object model beyond classes and objects. Almost all actions in Ruby at least conceptually boils down to sending a message to an object.Send operates roughly like this (lots of details omitted):
This makes MRI method calls extremely expensive. The method cache alleviates some of it, but the remaining work still has a huge cost compared to C++ for example, where the worst case runtime overhead is a virtual method in a multiple-inherited class, which consists of an indirect pointer lookup and a call to a "thunk" function that fixes up the object pointer (a couple of instructions at most) so the method can access the right data, and jumps to the real method, and the typical cost is an indirect pointer lookup and a call instruction. Some of this overhead is avoidable in a more streamlined implementation, but quite a bit of it is extremely hard or impossible to get rid of within the required semantics of Ruby.
method_missing
In MRI, relying on method_missing is even more expensive than #send, as the method first needs to be looked up and then method_missing itself causes another looup, but the method cache makes it a reasonable choice for dynamically "adding" methods to objects as "send" is short-circuited early in loops etc., so after the first call the cost is fairly low. A brief benchmarks surprisingly shows that defining a new method using #define_method is actually slower than relying on method_missing. Here's the benchmark:
#!/bin/env ruby require 'benchmark' class Foo def test1 end def method_missing sym if sym == :test2 end end end Foo . class_eval do define_method :test3 do end end n = 1000000 f = Foo . new Benchmark . bmbm ( 20 ) do | x | x . report ( "test1" ) { n . times { f . test1 } } x . report ( "test2 (method_missing)" ) { n . times { f . test2 } } x . report ( "test3 (define method)" ) { n . times { f . test3 } } end
And here are the results from one of my machines:
“From a pure strategy standpoint that is logically where you would go,” Brabender said. “That is the only way you could survive this.”
Charlie Sykes, a former conservative talk radio host, said Republican voters have been conditioned over years of right-wing media consumption to reflexively reject any news that challenges their worldview. “These alternative-reality silos—not only do they reinforce an ideological message, but they can be impenetrable,” he said.
Sykes admits that he was once part of the problem. When he hosted his popular Milwaukee-based radio show, he routinely devoted airtime to bashing the press—calling out perceived partisanship, and telling listeners that they couldn't get the full story by reading the papers. While Sykes stands by many of his critiques, he eventually grew alarmed by the hyper-skepticism his audience began to exhibit. By the middle of last year's election, he said, he couldn't even cite stories from The New York Times or The Washington Post on the air without listeners dismissing them as untrustworthy.
In Alabama, Sykes said, a “nightmare scenario” is unfolding. “You have credible journalism being attacked and ignored amid a flood of misinformation and bizarre propaganda,” he said, adding that his compatriots in the conservative media who are horrified by Moore need to grapple with their own culpability. “I think we should be horrified by the monster we helped create.”
Of course, conservatives have been complaining about bias in the news media for decades. "You have to remember the 1964 GOP convention—Goldwater delegates screaming at the media—to get a little sense of how deep and how long the hostility legacy exists," said Newt Gingrich. "It has just gotten steadily worse and can be seen as a deepening chasm."
But in recent years, conservatives' culture war on the press has escalated dramatically—culminating in 2016 with Trump winning the nomination while ridiculing journalists by name from the stump. "The war between Trump and the news media, and his willingness to take them head on more than anyone since Goldwater, has solidified his base while making it harder to reach moderates who are fed a daily diet of hostility by the media,” Gingrich said.
Trump's rise brought right-wing mistrust of the media to new heights, as Trump first mocked the media on the stump as a candidate, then kept the reporters covering his campaign in press pens at rallies, and now calls any story he doesn't like “fake news.” There has been a shift—once, the media was just biased; now, many Republican base voters believe it is actually fabricating stories. A Politico/Morning Consult poll last month showed that 46 percent of all voters believe the media makeup stories about Trump, including 76 percent of Republicans.
“The trust in the media was already at a low point and by Trump constantly going after the media, it's further eroded faith in the media and has actually activated people to be against it,” said the Republican strategist and former RNC spokesman Doug Heye. “That's part of the tribalism we see in our politics, the erosion in all capital-I institutions.” Heye recalled being at a George H.W. Bush rally in 1992 and seeing a bumper sticker that said “Annoy the media, vote Bush”—a message that seems almost quaint now.
Sallie Mae has dropped its membership in the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) after a student-led campaign demanding that the nation's largest student loan lender cut ties with the controversial organization. Sallie Mae is the 50th corporation to publicly drop its ALEC membership in the past year-and-a-half as the organization has come under increasing public scrutiny.
"It's a terrific victory for the students, community members, and unions members that were involved," said Chris Hicks, Student Debt Campaign Organizer at Jobs With Justice. "It's no accident that Sallie Mae has decided to leave ALEC -- from the shareholder meeting in May and the meeting students and graduates had with CEO Jack Remondi in June to the nearly 15,000 petition signatures gathered in August, students have shown Sallie Mae they are serious about their demands and are not going away."
Many students and young people were outraged that a company that profits from student debt would use their loan payments to fund ALEC, which (among other things) works to make the education system a for-profit endeavor and advances laws that make it harder for many college students to vote.
In August, before ALEC's Annual Meeting in Chicago, organizers with the Student Labor Action Project, Jobs With Justice, and the United States Students Association gathered nearly 15,000 signatures on a petition demanding Sallie Mae drop its ALEC membership. A few months earlier, in May,at least 200 student activists protested outside Sallie Mae's annual shareholder meeting, demanding that it end its relationship with ALEC and increase transparency about its other lobbying and political activities. CEO Jack Remondi agreed to meet with students the following month, but at the time appeared to reject their demands.
The announcement that Sallie Mae dumped ALEC came quietly, in a September 7 article in the Delaware News-Journal.
"The noise level was distracting from the original business purpose," Martha Holler, a senior vice president at Sallie Mae, told the News-Journal. "We will pursue other venues in which to share our collections expertise with state and local governments, and hopefully now our discussions with students ... can focus on what matters most to us all, the success of our education loan customers."
"There is much more work to be done, but this is definitely a first step to hold Sallie Mae accountable for their business practices that we can all celebrate," Hicks said.
ALEC Increasingly Focused on Higher Education
For decades, ALEC has promoted the privatization of K-12 education through voucher programs that re-route taxpayer dollars to for-profit schools. But it has increasingly focused on imposing the same privatization agenda on higher education, with bills like the "College Opportunity Fund Act" that essentially create a taxpayer-funded voucher for for-profit and religious schools.
And, ALEC has adopted several bills to impose a standardized testing regime on public colleges and universities, which on the K-12 level has altered the classroom dynamic and interfered with teaching, for example with "The Collegiate Learning Assessment Bill," which was considered at ALEC's August meeting in Chicago.
ALEC still counts among its members Corinthian Colleges, a for-profit college chain that operates campuses under names like Everest, Heald, and WyoTech. Corinthian has become notorious for aggressive recruiting practices and leaving students unprepared for the job market and saddled with massive student loan debts. Nationally, over 40 percent of Corinthian's students default on their loans, and only 60% of students complete their coursework.
Perhaps not surprisingly, ALEC has a "Resolution in Support of Private Sector Colleges and Universities."
Youth Activists Focus On ALEC
Student opposition to ALEC is not limited to its role in higher education.
ALEC has helped advance the strict voter ID laws that have swept the country in recent years, which make it harder to vote for many young people who don't have the forms of identification required under the laws. Student activists have also singled-out ALEC's opposition to living wage standards, which makes it more difficult to work through school, and bills that make young people (particularly young people of color) less safe, such as Stand Your Ground laws and bills like the "Campus Personal Protection Act" that promote guns on college campuses.
The Dream Defenders occupied Florida Governor Rick Scott's offices for weeks earlier this summer demanding a repeal of the state's ALEC-approved Stand Your Ground law. And that group and others involved with the Got Next coalition marched on ALEC's offices on August 23, the day before the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington.
"We're tired of how [ALEC] has manipulated the legislative process, and we want to let them know we won't continue to stand by," said Kim Moore, an activist and organizer with We Got Next.
With the departure of Sallie Mae, at least 50 corporations and six nonprofits have publicly cut ties to ALEC since the Center for Media and Democracy launched ALECexposed.org in 2011 (although Wells Fargo has recently begun funding the group again).
Ask those corporations that still support ALEC to stop underwriting the group's extreme agenda.

Posties may not even get the chance to walk off the job before Canada Post locks them out: CUPW | Canada Post
Canadian businesses might need to start making alternative arrangements to snail mail and Canada Post parcel delivery as the prospect of a July shutdown of national postal services looms.
Canada's postal workers will be in a legal strike position on July 2, but a union leader says posties might not even get the chance to take a strike vote.
“Every indication is that they're looking toward locking us out in July,” said Mike Palecek, national president of the Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW), which represents 50,000 postal workers. “Canada Post has come to the table demanding major cuts to everything from benefits to pensions to job security.”
The last lockout in 2011 followed rotating strikes before postal workers were legislated back to work.
Each time there is a strike or a lockout, Canada Post loses business customers, sometimes for good, said Richard Truscott, western Canadian vice-president for the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB).
“Canada Post and its workers are shooting themselves in the foot.”
Many small businesses rely on Canada Post for parcel delivery, billing, invoicing and other services. Truscott said CFIB member surveys show 61% of respondents say Canada Post delivery services are very important to their operations.
But when the service becomes unreliable, Canada's national mail service loses business customers to couriers and electronic billing and invoicing.
“It seems every time Canada Post operations are suspended, or there is a strike, that the corporation bleeds a little bit more, that fewer and fewer small businesses are using their services,” Truscott said. “They vote with their feet, and once they experience a different way of doing business, some of them stay. That means Canada Post is losing long-term customers to other service providers.”
The main bones of contention in the current round of collective bargaining include job security, proposed changes to pension plans and pay equity among urban and rural carriers. CUPW is framing the last as a gender pay equity issue.
Rural carriers are paid less than their urban counterparts, Palecek said. He added that while 70% of urban postal workers are male, 70% of rural carriers are female.
“This is a predominently female bargaining unit. They make about 28% less than the predominently male bargaining unit doing the same work. We let them [Canada Post] know that they're in violation of Canada's pay equity legislation on this.”
As for pensions, Canada Post wants to move from a defined pension plan for its workers to a defined contribution plan. Defined pensions assure workers of predetermined pension benefits; benefits under a defined contribution plan are based on the pension fund's market performance. Truscott said defined pension plans are expensive and unsustainable.
“There are two elephants in the room. One is they need to deal with their unfunded pension liabilities and the overall cost of the labour, and at the very least not be increasing the price for some of their services.”
A lockout could raise the public's interest in an ongoing federal government review of Canada Post operations. Among the issues being reviewed is door-to-door mail delivery. Under the Stephen Harper Conservatives, Canada Post had begun converting residential customers from door-to-door service to community mailboxes.
Those conversions, which were expected to save Canada Post $400 million to $500 million annually, were halted by the new Liberal government.
Whether it will be permanently halted is just one of the questions being addressed through public consultation.
But Palecek said more conversions to community mailboxes are not needed.
“Canada Post is making profits. It just reported a first-quarter profit of $44 million. We really don't see the need to make any cuts given that we continue to make healthy profits.”
But profits are up, in part, because of the conversions that have already taken place. A total of 830,000 homes had been converted to community mailboxes by the end of 2015, netting Canada Post a savings of $80 million.
Annual financial statements also paint a different picture than the most recent quarterly financials about Canada Post's longer-term financial position. In 2015, Canada Post's before-tax profits were down 67.5%, from $194 million in 2014 to $63 million, and the Canada Post group of companies' profits were down 50%, from $269 million in 2014 to $136 million .
While its parcel delivery business is growing, thanks to e-commerce, Canada Post's traditional mail service is in long-term decline.

When speaking to blacks we encourage you brush up on Ebonics and to use catch phrases like "we be for you my brothers" Ima bustin my ho's vjay tonightynight" (You are having sex with your wife/girlfriend) "Whassup" (What are you doing) I like Hominy and Grits wit my fried chicken whatbout yall" (hominy is a swollen corn) and Im down wit that my brother" (I am on board with what you are saying, doing etc)
It is a good practice to have a pack of Kool Cigarettes (commonly refered to as Double O Bro's on the street and prison) in a visible place like front pocket, those people are notorious about taking liberty with them but for a measly 12 buck, the cost of a pack of cigarettes in D.C. it's worth the milage. In some respects they remind me of the american indians, so easily purchased, (you know the story, Manhattan for some beads and all) Haha
I once conveniently (wink wink) dropped a sales receipt out of my hand to Jims Rib Haven while talking to BLM thugs, I mean people, and it went a long way when they have seen I was eating some sole food or what ever they call it, check the spelling on that by the way it may be "soul"
Refrain from carrying cash or wallet for that matter when meeting with BLM, they often ask for cash which we can do but it needs to go through the proper channels, George S really gets cranky about keeping track of his cash.
Last but not least do not go alone, we have a few Hatians The Clinton Global Initative managed to bring back as speciments when they were down there doing business deals after the earthquake. They work for Mrs. C doing manual labor on the New York residence. We will pay their bus fare to your location just don't let them near the pets if you need to take them back to your place, Lisa M made that mistake and when she got back to her apartment from getting take out they had sacraficed her bird and cat in the middle of her living room, it was a goddamn mess and she has yet to re-join us on the trail, needs more time I guess.
Ta ta for now

A few days later, reflecting on his reception at the agency,
But while the president was clearly delighted with himself, some intelligence professionals had a very different reaction. The Washington Post Update: Price is scheduled to talk to Rachel about his perspective and experiences on tonight's show.] To hear Donald Trump tell it, he and the intelligence community get along swimmingly. The Republican president, who's repeatedly questioned intelligence professionals' integrity and professionalism, told the CIA on his first full day in office that the media “sort of made it sound like I had a feud with the intelligence community.” The truth, he added, is “exactly the opposite.”A few days later, reflecting on his reception at the agency, Trump added , “I got a standing ovation. In fact, they said it was the biggest standing ovation since Peyton Manning had won the Super Bowl and they said it was equal. I got a standing ovation. It lasted for a long period of time.”But while the president was clearly delighted with himself, some intelligence professionals had a very different reaction. The Washington Post published a piece overnight from Edward Price, a former CIA analyst and spokesperson for the National Security Council, who intended to spend the rest of his career at the CIA, where he's worked for over a decade. But his plans changed last week after Price, who worked for presidents from both parties, “reluctantly concluded” that he simply couldn't be part of Donald Trump's team. [: Price is scheduled to talk to Rachel about his perspective and experiences on tonight's show.]
I watched in disbelief when, during the third presidential debate, Trump casually cast doubt on the high-confidence conclusion of our 17 intelligence agencies, released that month, that Russia was behind the hacking and release of election-related emails. On the campaign trail and even as president-elect, Trump routinely referred to the flawed 2002 assessment of Iraq's weapons programs as proof that the CIA couldn't be trusted – even though the intelligence community had long ago held itself to account for those mistakes and Trump himself supported the invasion of Iraq.
Trump's actions in office have been even more disturbing. His visit to CIA headquarters on his first full day in office, an overture designed to repair relations, was undone by his ego and bluster. Standing in front of a memorial to the CIA's fallen officers, he seemed to be addressing the cameras and reporters in the room, rather than the agency personnel in front of them, bragging about his inauguration crowd the previous day. Whether delusional or deceitful, these were not the remarks many of my former colleagues and I wanted to hear from our new commander in chief. I couldn't help but reflect on the stark contrast between the bombast of the new president and the quiet dedication of a mentor – a courageous, dedicated professional – who is memorialized on that wall. I know others at CIA felt similarly.
I was going to twitlonger this, but then I said, “Hey, I have a blog.”
I'm not the first to notice this. Bryce touched on it back in December, and he probably wasn't the first either. But the most widely underappreciated aspect of Neoreaction, and by this fact the source of much confusion about its nature vis-à-vis Plain Ol' Reaction, is that it is successful at turning the mechanism of progressive meme propagation against itself. This may be the first time in history since that his been accomplished. (Please bring any other near competitors for this prize to my attention—they will be GREATLY appreciated.) In fact, I'd go so far as to say that this occult ability within its memeplex is the sine qua non of Neoreaction. Without it, indeed, you have just Plain Ol' Paleo-conservative Reaction with a lot of Rayban-wearing, cigarette-toking hipsters pretending it's all new and cool. Your confusion is understandable if you fail to grasp this: Neoreaction's Dark Art.
Progressives are open-minded by definition. Of course, they are not fully so (nor is anyone), but they fancy themselves so, and would rarely admit to a sub-rational bedrock of ideological assumptions—a pale beyond which they will not willingly go. Now in the bright light of day, this set of ideological assumptions is incoherent, full of logical holes, with many axioms unprovable at best and provably false at worst. Anybody who's rubbed a few skeptical neurons together knows this. But none of that really matters. This is due to the fact that the Progressive wears this set of assumptions as a moral pose. For status. He no more cares whether it's logical than a peacock cares whether his tailfeathers are logical. And if he's a True Believer™, i.e., ignorant of cognitive dissonance and rational doubts, this is only to his benefit as he may signal all the stronger, and be rewarded by the power structure with tiny additional epsilons of power.
This is key: The Garden Variety Progressive adopts a moral posture, believes what he believes, to obtain social status in a power regime that rewards moral posturing; but he thinks it is all merely goodness and rationality. In other words, he drinks the kool-aid provided for him. He will be open-minded, so long as the ideas he entertains do not resemble certain patterns.
Canada geese can be driven away by a real dog or a real wolf. They can also be driven away by wooden cutouts of a dog or wolf shape placed near where they are grazing. Their tiny goose brains have circuitry that says, “Dog (or dog shape). Danger!” They are not driven away by squirrels… or cars, in the latter case often to their peril. Squirrels and cars do not trigger flight responses. (The squirrel might trigger fight response, and if so, my bet is on the goose.)
Even with a substantially more sophisticated brain, the Progressive may be likened to the goose when it comes to ideas: Long, long ago things like kings and czars, slave-holders, white-hooded optimates (and later white-hooded white trash), wife-beaters, brown-shirts, skinheads, and such like variously opposed or harmed or suppressed his kind. When he sees stuff that looks remotely like this, his memetic immune system activates. He will not listen to anybody who remotely looks white nationalist. Probably because he will be screaming epithets at him. (Did you know geese hiss when they're mad? (Which they are. Often.)) The Progressive's brain is protected from any idea that such a person might utter no matter how rational or principled or heart-wrenching or correct it might be, because he sees the shape of the klansman or the brown-shirted thug, which registers viscerally as low-status loser.
Now the Neoreactionary propagandist—an alchemist of fine memetic poisons—knows this defense mechanism. This is not least because he was born Progressive, took Progressive milk from his mother's breast, was trained by Progressive teachers in his Progressive school, consumed 6 hours of Progressive propaganda per day for 20 years. Everyone knows Progressivism, in keeping with his stature and position in life, just as everyone also knew Catholicism in 14th Century Italy.
Neoreaction defeats the natural defense mechanisms of the Progressive by not looking remotely white nationalist. Or Nazi. Or even remotely working class. Neoreaction may even have gay or Jewish friends. He might have gone to Ivy, or been so privileged he didn't need to. These ideas might be a bit odd, vaguely libertarian, but older and far more exotic, and oh-so interesting, and such high verbal IQ, and (therefore) quite clearly harmless. This is how our Neoreactionary Alchemist strikes, he puts these carefully crafted, putatively harmless memes into the Progressive while his defenses are down. Moldbug was the first and greatest master of this. What would our Martian visitor think of FDR? Just what was Time reporting on so deliciously in 1942? So what does this NYT reporter mean by African “freedom” and “independence” that he considers them so much more important than “roads” and “malaria suppression”? Etc.
The Progressive may even be fancying himself the moral superior here: “Just being fair and open-minded.” “I'm purely rational, he's purely rational, what harm could a little mental taste do? “I value honest and open-discussion!” “I must represent his views honestly!” “I'm certainly no Rush Limbaugh.” And once he does that, the honest and open-minded Progressive is putting at risk virtually everything he's ever believed about God, about himself, about power, about society, arguably about belief itself.
Neoreaction is the first known memeplex that effectively attacks the very heart of Progressivism, bypassing its otherwise impenetrable adapted defenses, worming its way into the executive routines, and shredding it's internal rules-based order. The Progressive may not turn to the dark side, but he will forever be damaged. All other anti-progressive mechanisms rely on power: to close or open doors, to demand loyalty and obedience, to demand silence, to reward orthodoxy and disincentivize dissent. Such mechanisms worked great in conservative plutarchic or monarchic regimes, when power was hard to divide and even harder to get.
But now, after the spectacular rise of the bourgeoisie, nearly all such regimes have fallen, and power-based means are useless at combating Progressivism. You can found conservative institutions and set up barriers that prevent entry all you want, but Progressives will just take their toys and go elsewhere. And since they own 98% of elsewhere and 99.3% of the fashionable toys, that doesn't leave much space for genuinely conservative institutions. They might be allowed to exist, but they'll have power in inverse proportion to the square of their conservatism.
Neoreaction is a—perhaps the—answer to this conundrum. It's a method of actually turning Progressives to the Reactionary Side. As such, it's a method of turning elites or would-be elites. Turn enough of them, make it fashionable to hold a different set of values, then there's no telling how small the piece of straw might be that finally breaks the Cathedral's back.
None of which should be construed to mean that we Reactionaries (Neo- and otherwise) should not be very much about building genuinely conservative institutions, with a positive visions for social order and immune to progressive entry and takeover. We absolutely should. But Neoreaction stands as a second front to attack the enemy and simultaneously recruit members, both elite and ordinary, to fill those institutions.
Scientific papers are faked sometimes. That's obviously dangerous, especially when the researcher works for the pharmaceutical industry or has a clear agenda. But we've never seen anything quite like this: a Japanese anesthesiologist named Yoshitaka Fujii has been found to have fabricated a hundred and seventy-two papers over the course of 19 years, more than even Joachim Boldt, who fabricated 90.
As reported by Science Insider, Fujii's work included 126 instances of completely fabricated studies and trials. (Of his other work, only three papers were proven legitimate; 37 could not be proven either way.) Some scientists listed as co-authors on his work were never even consulted, and their signatures forged. Patients were invented. The whole thing is nuts. "It is as if someone sat at a desk and wrote a novel about a research idea," wrote a panel set up by the Japanese Society of Anesthesiologists. You can read their report here.
The papers aren't of massive public importance, which is partly how they snuck under the radar for so long. Sample titles: "Antiemetic efficacy of low-dose midazolam in patients
undergoing thyroidectomy" and "Low-dose propofol to prevent nausea and vomiting after
laparoscopic surgery." But Fujii did personally benefit, receiving public funding, grants, and a professorship.

That Italian TV show was a fucking struggle. The miming I don't mind, it's the interview.
You have an actual person in front of you asking questions in Italian and a phantom in your ear translating them into English. It can be, and usually is, very awkward.
Here is but one example of what I mean...and bear in mind I'd been kissing the sky with Nancy until 5am the previous.
"Noel...you say that you don't take yourself seriously and that you live only for the moment. I also hear you say you refuse to overthink anything that you do in as much as you let the people decide what is and what is not...but what we would like to know is how do you come to such enlightenment at such an age?"
"..........Erm....Si?"
"I'm sorry but you have to give me an answer.."
".......Erm...I don't know?"
(Huge round of applause).
I started to do a little sweat.
After about 6 months we left the TV studio and were taken out to some swanky restaurant, which was indeed a night club, which was indeed the preferred hang out for yer Milanese footballer.
All the women (and there were a LOT of women) looked like Mick Jagger when Mick Jagger looked like an Italian woman (1965-1969!). Nice enough gaff...Nancy would have loved it.
Flew to Berlin the next day. Met some nice German fans on the plane. They'd been to the gig in Milan see? Very polite. Lovely kids.
I'm sat on the plane waiting for lift off and who should amble on last but my old drug buddy Evan Dando!!!! What the fuck??? I hadn't seen him in years. Fucking love that guy.
Had a bit of a kick about waiting for my band to rehearse with the latest brass section. I hadn't had a kick about for a long time...years. I think it's fair to say the old touch hasn't deserted me... You never lose it see?
The gig was wünderbar!! Excellent! In fact there was a minor fracas down the front at one point and the security team vaulted the barrier and got in amongst the crowd to fucking sort some shit out.
There was a bit of pushing and shoving and the security team reappeared with a girl in a headlock!!!! She was kicking and screaming like a fucking wild cat!!! I saw her later outside and asked her what she'd been thrown out for and she replied... "Just crying"... and all this took place during The Dying Of The Light!! Germans eh? You gotta love 'em!
Just had my first overnight on the bus to Copenhagen.
Horrible...I hate the bus...it is a cunt.
Keep it livid.
ONWARDS.
GD.
PS: Today I have been mostly listening to That's The Way by The Kit Kats...get on it!

Facebook still available in country despite being given Tuesday deadline to remove content deemed insulting to monarchy
Thai authorities appear to back down on threat to block Facebook
Authorities in Thailand appear to have backed down on a threat to block access to Facebook after they said the social media company had agreed to remove “illegal” content, including posts critical of the monarchy.
The government threatened Facebook with legal action last week unless it removed 131 “illicit” pages by 10am on Tuesday morning. Hours before the deadline, internet providers said they were under pressure to shut down access to Facebook in Thailand.
The brinkmanship appeared to have worked, with the secretary general of the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission announcing after the deadline that Facebook was cooperating.
“We found Facebook did not block the remaining 131 posts because it has yet to receive the original court orders to block them,” Takorn Tantasith said. “After Facebook received the original court orders, it blocked them within 24 hours.”
The Bangkok Post reported earlier that the Thai Internet Service Provider Association (Tispa) may disconnect access to Facebook's servers.
Thailand threatens Facebook with legal action over anti-monarchy posts Read more
It cited an email purportedly sent from Tispa to the managing director of Facebook Thailand warning that if the company did not remove all 131 pages, “concerned authorities will request that we shut down” access to the site.
“This action may affect the entire delivery services of www.facebook.com to customers in Thailand,” Tispa wrote, according to the Bangkok Post.
The Guardian was unable to immediately corroborate the report and Facebook did not respond to queries related to the incident.
A Facebook spokesperson said the company reviewed requests by governments to restrict access to content. “When we receive such a request, we review it to determine if it puts us on notice of unlawful content.
“If we determine that it does, then we make it unavailable in the relevant country or territory and notify people who try to access it why it is restricted.”
The Thai government has not publicly released details of the posts it wanted removed.
Several images and a video appearing to show the Thai king, Maha Vajiralongkorn, 64, wearing a crop top and covered in tattoos have been published on social media in recent weeks.
Facebook opened an office in Thailand in 2015 and is the biggest social network in the country.
The military-run administration briefly cut access to Facebook after it launched a coup on 22 May 2014.
The royalist junta has ramped up online censorship, especially any posts or comment perceived to violate the country's strict lese-majesty laws, which make it a crime to criticise, defame or insult members of the royal family.
Sensitivity to public criticism of royal affairs was heightened after the much-loved king Bhumibol Adulyadej died in October and his son took power.
With each offence punishable by up to 15 years in jail, more than 105 charges have been raised during the junta's tenure, several of them related to sharing online posts.
Lese-majesty laws force media operating in Thailand to frequently self-censor.

In a season of mixed results thus far for Sporting Kansas City – nine points through seven games and a tie for fifth in the Western Conference standings – one player may have separated himself as an early team MVP and MLS Best XI candidate.
Midfielder Benny Feilhaber sits atop the league's assist chart with five, at least two more than any other player. His latest set-up came in Sporting KC's last-minute defeat to LA Galaxy on Saturday night, when the 30-year-old veteran one-timed an entry pass from Dom Dwyer into the path of Krisztian Nemeth for a first-half equalizer.
From a playmaking perspective, Feilhaber is off to one of the best starts in club history. On Saturday, he became the second fastest player to reach the five assist mark, doing so in his seventh league appearance of 2015. Feilhaber's role in Krisztian Nemeth's 22nd-minute strike also marked the second time in Sporting KC history that one player has assisted five of the team's first seven goals in a season.
The only other player to accomplish these feats? Winger Graham Zusi, who needed just four games to reach five assists in 2012 and also set up five of the club's first seven goals that year.

With 27 regular season matches still to play in 2015, Feilhaber is two assists shy of equaling his career-high, set in 2011 during his first MLS campaign with the New England Revolution.
Not surprisingly, the MLS assist leader ranks near the top in chances created through Week 7. Feilhaber has also shown ball-winning combativeness in the center of the pitch, ranking in the top seven among MLS midfielders in recoveries, duels won and tackles won.

Making the Belgrade: Serenaded by Serbia with folk songs, Roman ruins (and £1 a pint)
Visiting Serbia in 2012, it is easy to forget that this welcoming and very beautiful country only recently emerged from a ferocious armed conflict.
But the republic, part of the former Yugoslavia, has a lot to offer the adventurous tourist. Its energetic capital, Belgrade, caters to all kinds of visitor, from history buffs who want to explore its vast archaeological history, to committed party animals.
Yet while Belgrade is a perfect destination for those in search of a city break, venture further into Serbia and you will find a country almost entirely untouched and, for the most part, off the tourism trail.
Night light: Belgrade has emerged as a destination known for its vibrant nocturnal scene
It is staggeringly good value for money, too, particularly when it comes to food and drink. A pint of beer costs about £1 and it is possible to eat a decent meal out for not much more than a fiver.
Landing at Belgrade's Nikola Tesla airport on a blisteringly hot late September afternoon, the short drive into the capital offers the first glimpse of a country forging its way ahead.
First, we pass through the brutal communist-era architecture of New Belgrade, a region that didn't exist until after the Second World War, and is now, our tour guide Srdjan informs us, home to much of the capital's population and legions of office blocks.
We then enter the old city on a bridge over the River Sava, which marks the point where central Europe becomes south-east Europe and the Balkans begin.
Elegant: The Knez Mihailova Street offers shopping surrounded by historic buildings
Lots to do: Visitors can explore the mighty Kalemegdan fortress (left) or hit the cobbled streets in the arty Skadarlija district
It is markedly different. In place of cold highrises are curvaceous streets filled with weathered buildings. The ruins of structures bombed by Nato in 1999 remain, a seemingly defiant reminder of the not-so-distant past.
Belgrade is a cosmopolitan city filled with restaurants, bars and galleries. Take a walk through the pedestrianised Knez Mihailova Street, home to some of Belgrade's most famous buildings, which leads directly to Kalemegdan fortress and park.
Overlooking the confluence of the River Sava and the Danube, Kalemegdan offers spectacular views of New Belgrade and the Ada Ciganlija island, overgrown with vegetation and open to all. Free entry ensures Kalemegdan is popular with locals and tourists alike.
Nearby, the historic streets of the bohemian Skadarlija neighbourhood, a long-established home to artists and poets, are filled with the city's oldest restaurants, some of which have been standing for two centuries.
Getting the point: Graham (left) at the monument which marks the centre of Belgrade in Knez Mihailova Street and beautiful people dance the night away in one of the city's numerous clubs
It is a beautiful quarter in which to enjoy an evening stroll followed by a meal to the live sounds of traditional Starogradska folk music. The good news is that Serbians enjoy their food, so expect huge portions.
Many cities boast of having the best nightlife in the world, but Belgrade, with its huge variety of clubs and hidden bars, lays a better claim than most.
The permanently-moored river clubs dotted along the banks of the Sava and Danube attract the young and beautiful each weekend. Lined up, these hugely popular pleasure barges blast out music until dawn.
For those not so keen on dancing the night away, there are plenty of bars to prop up, all serving Serbia's national drink, rakia. A great place to sample the various potent delights of this fruit brandy is the Rakia Bar in the Dobracina district.
Off the tourist trail: Nis is located in southern Serbia near the Bulgarian border
The Museum of Yugoslav History offers an insight into how the region fared in the decades following the Second World War until the death of Josip Broz Tito in 1980. It contains his mausoleum and a fascinating collection of artifacts dating back to the 15th century, including the world's oldest rifle.
It takes three hours to drive to Nis, Serbia's third largest city, which lies 150 miles south and is within striking distance of both Kosovo and Bulgaria.
It quickly becomes clear that it has a more traditional Balkan flavour, thanks to its status since ancient times as a gateway between East and West.
The city was the birthplace of Constantine the Great in 272 AD and is filled with monuments, museums and archaeological sites.
Chief among This is the fortress, built by the Turks in the early 18th century on the site of an ancient Roman settlement, and littered with ruins.
Making use of the old: The former Roman baths at Nis have been turned into facilities for visitors
Facing the past: The Skull Tower (left) is a reminder of a brutal past while history in this region dates back thousands of years
Due to a lack of investment, these extensive remains are, incredibly, completely open to the public 24 hours a day. This is both tantalising and extremely sad – clambering over the ruins is commonplace and graffiti is widespread. The authorities have even permitted cafes to be built in the remains of the Roman baths.
In spite of this lack of care, against which archaeologists are fighting a hard campaign, the ruins are awe-inspiring.
For a taste of Nis' more recent history, visit the grisly Skull Tower. A structure made out of the skulls of Serbian revolutionaries killed and decapitated by the Ottomans in the early years of the 19th century, it is a graphic nod to a violent past.
The city's nightlife is a more relaxed affair than in Belgrade with an emphasis on live music.
There are many rural stop-offs between Belgrade and Nis that are worth making, too. While heading south, we spent a delightful hour wine-tasting at the Podrum Radovanovic winery in the village of Krnjevo, in the heart of the country.
If walls could speak: The Manasija monastery is contained within a fort
A motel in the small town of Despotovac, 80 miles to the south-east of Belgrade, proved an ideal base from which to visit the Veliki Buk waterfall.
The nearby Manasija monastery is spectacular, too, featuring a church contained within a fort that houses wonderful frescoes.
Equally impressive are the remains of Viminacium, the Roman capital of the Moesia Superior province, located near the small town of Kostolac on the Danube. Among the finds dotted around this vast site are a 1.5 million-year-old mammoth skeleton discovered in 2009.
Bizarrely, this area of archaeological importance is dwarfed by a power station, built in the mid-1970s in the middle of the remains.
It seems a strange decision, and makes for a perfect metaphor for Serbia as a whole - the dialogue between the past and the present.
The Serbian authorities have only recently awoken to the possibilities of Western tourism but what is assured is that this is a nation on the cusp of change and now is a great time to visit.

Democratic freshmen in the House have launched a robust push to engage the entire class of 2013 in fundraising for the party's campaign committee, an effort spurred by the rallying call: “Bring back our endangered classmates in 2014!”
The effort began two weeks ago among a few dozen freshman Democratic lawmakers, over a meal of barbecue and macaroni and cheese catered by Hill Country BBQ at the DCCC offices on Capitol Hill.

The group, led by Reps. Dan Kildee (Mich.) and Lois Frankel Lois Jane FrankelDems call on Trump to fire Acosta Lawmakers wear white to State of the Union to show solidarity with women Trump will give State of Union to sea of opponents MORE (Fla.), set a goal of 100 percent participation in donations or dues — which range from $125,000 to $300,000 — from the freshman class within the first reporting quarter of the 2014 cycle.
A committee source at the dinner described the push as “incredibly rare and very aggressive,” and noted that the rate of giving from the class of 2013 has already been higher than usual.
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Steve Israel (N.Y.) was “impressed and excited” by the initiative, the source said.
“As a whole, you make a much bigger impact than individually, and this commitment — and your leadership — will make a huge difference for the DCCC,” Israel said, according to the source.
The DCCC spent more than $60 million in independent expenditures in 2012 on both offense and defense, ultimately helping to elect 49 freshmen. Twenty-six of the newcomers flipped control of their districts.
Democrats face a significant challenge in taking control of the House in 2014: redistricting has emphasized partisan control and narrowed the number of swing districts in the nation. That complicates the party's efforts to net the 17 seats it needs to regain the majority.
But President Obama has indicated an interest in taking back the House, and the freshman Democrats' pledge offers the DCCC another boost in what looks to be a difficult cycle.
Kildee said the caucus is already on board with the effort, and that “most folks were committed to doing this anyways.”
“It's just really a matter of communicating with one another, and sort of reinforcing the mutual obligation to one another” to keep colleagues on track, Kildee told lawmakers at the dinner, according to the DCCC source.
Republican freshmen, too, are stepping up to the plate for their campaign committee, the party says.
Daniel Scarpinato, spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, said that the committee has had strong participation from its freshman members.
“At the NRCC, we always strive for 100 percent participation from our members, and as a member-driven organization, we have already placed freshmen in key leadership roles to work with their colleagues on hitting their goals,” Scarpinato said.
He cited Rep.

Among Democrats, a number of freshmen have stepped up to support Kildee and Frankel, including Reps. Joaquín Castro (Texas), Michelle Lujan Grisham (N.M.) and Donald Payne, Jr. (N.J.). They have all volunteered to help collect dues from their freshman colleagues.
Castro and Frankel have both hosted events with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) that brought in $100,000 or more for the committee, while Rep. Mark Pocan Mark William PocanHannity decries Green New Deal as 'economically guaranteed-to-be-devastating' Ocasio-Cortez unveils Green New Deal climate resolution Trump's AIDS turnaround greeted with skepticism by some advocates MORE (Wis.), who is co-chairman of the DCCC's labor council, has raised more than $150,000 from the labor community for the committee.
In the month of January, Rep. Jared Huffman (Calif.) gave $50,000 in dues, while Kildee gave $25,000.
Kildee drew a contrast between Democrats and members of the House Republican Conference, which has fractured over multiple controversial votes on tax and spending deals in Congress.
Kildee, an assistant Democratic whip and freshman representative to the Democrats' Steering and Policy Committee, says that freshman Democrats “have been talking about trying to stay together, stay unified.”
And one of the ways they plan to stay unified, Kildee said, is to come back whole after 2014.
It will be a challenge for the Democratic freshmen; 21 of them won their election by less than 10 percentage points.
“We feel we can make a difference, but one of the things we have to do is to be here in order to do that,” Kildee told the Democratic freshmen.

New Rochelle, NY, September 8, 2016--Homosexual, bisexual, and transgender youth tend to have a higher risk for suicide-related thoughts and behaviors, but research on interventions to prevent suicide among sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth has been limited. New research should focus on interventions specifically targeted to SGM youth and their unique and diverse challenges, including health needs, according to a study published in LGBT Health, a peer-reviewed journal from Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers. The article is available free to download on the LGBT Health website until October 8, 2016.
Kimberly McManama O'Brien, PhD and colleagues from Simmons School of Social Work, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, and The Fenway Institute, Boston, MA, and Norfolk State University, VA, emphasize the importance of strengthening family support and acceptance as part of a positive intervention. In the article entitled "Sexual and Gender Minority Youth Suicide: Understanding Subgroup Differences to Inform Interventions," the authors suggest that research on suicide prevention strategies take into consideration factors such as race and ethnicity, which may affect suicide-related outcomes.
"One's racial, ethnic, and religious minority status is usually shared with one's parents who can buffer the impact of related stigma and discrimination. SGM status, however, usually is not shared with parents and is often concealed from them," says LGBT Health Editor-in-Chief William Byne, MD, PhD, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY. "Further, families may contribute to, rather than buffer against, SGM-related stress. The article by Dr. O'Brien and colleagues is on target in pointing out the critical need for an intersectional approach to suicide prevention research in SGM youth with a focus on building family support."

SAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif. (MarketWatch) — Yes, 2014 is coming, fast, now dubbed the “Year of the Boom.” Bulls roaring. Hot race to the New Year. Then beyond into a booming, bullish 2014 rally. Yes, the Great Gatsby's spirit is back in America. Top billing. Let the good times roll. Come join the party.
Leonardo DiCaprio in “The Great Gatsby.”
Great shot of Leonardo DiCaprio as the Great Gatsby over on Business Insider. Dapper in a classy tuxedo, handing you a glass of Dom Perignon bubbles. His infectious, irresistible smile. You can even hear Judy Garland singing: “Forget all your troubles. C'mon get happy. Shout hallelujah. Chase all your cares away. Get ready.” Yes, ready for the 2014 boom.
The markets are living in a timeless Roaring Twenties exuberance. There are five huge reasons it'll accelerate past a New Years rally into 2014. Yes, you can make some real money. This year. And next. Don't miss it. Listen to the revelers toasting all over the ballroom. Confetti flying. Strobe lights flashing. Jazz band tapping a snappy Charleston. Madcap dancing. Get ready, jump into the festivities, get on this new bandwagon.
Even old grumpy Dr. Doom, celeb economist Nouriel Roubini, recently began humming a happy tune for investors, all over national television: “A global recovery is going to occur, so you might want to be marginally overweight in equities.” Marginally? From Dr. Doom that's damn bullish. Sure got my feet tapping, reminding me of my March 2009 column where I one-upped the Great Roubini in “6 reasons I'm calling a bottom and a new bull.” Great call, last four years the market's more than doubled.
Time again. Get on the floor. Back in the game. Dance the night away. Bets on the tables.
Please don't miss it, ride this rally past New Years into 2014
Yes, folks, 2014 really is the “Year of the Boom.” That's the hot, breathless, engraved- invitation-to-the-party thrust of Matthew Boesler's Business Insider column, “Here comes the final melt-up for the one percenters,” a fascinating summary of 2014 market predictions made by the great Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist over at Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research. Yes, 2014 is his big “Year of the Boom.”
The Super Rich are staying in the game, piling on the chips, betting big on one roaring hurrah, the final race to the finish line for America's wealthiest. One last all-in bet by Forbes 400 billionaires, day traders and all the hotshot high-frequency traders gambling in the too-big-to-fail banks and out in the shadowy $650 trillion global derivatives casino.
So why the happy days music from the big players? Why a final melt-up for the one percenters. Not tapering, the new Fed chairwoman won't turn off the cheap money machine. In fact, Merrill Lynch's Hartnett says “Wall Street's boom will likely continue until Main Street's recovery becomes visible and tightening starts.”
Could be a while, given all the political infighting. Till then, investors, politicians and all Americans are smoking the same old irrational exuberance weed that got us in trouble times before. As Hartnett put it:
“We believe the opiate of investors for the moment remains central bank liquidity. The degree of stimulus since 2007 has been unprecedented: $13 trillion of FX reserve accumulation and financial asset purchases by central banks and 560 central bank rate cuts. And the ‘bulls' appear to remain driven by ‘liquidity' ... ‘Bernanke-care' may have truly cured all known investor concerns” for 2014.
Surprise 2014 for investors, growth driving a new market rally?
So Hartnett's definitely in the Roaring Twenties groove, singing, dancing and answering his own biggest economic question: “Where's the growth? ... We think stronger growth, perhaps much stronger U.S. growth, will be the investor surprise in the next 12 month ... with a successful asset price reflation” generated by five powerful engines driving our recovery ... “significant monetary stimulus ... a booming housing market ... an inexpensive dollar ... record corporate cash balances ... and increasing energy independence.”
Get it? Surprising growth for the markets. And he's a true believer: “If the U.S. economy does not significantly accelerate in coming quarters, we think it is difficult to say when it ever will.” Yes, it will grow. That's why 2014 is the “Year of the Boom,” time for rallies and recovery, a Roaring Twenties sequel, coming well before a crashing market.
The sense you get from tracking all this happy talk about 2014 as the “Year of the Boom” and a “Final Melt-Up for the One Percenters” is that our pundits aren't really calling this the final days before a crash, like the fall of 1929 when Yale economist Irving Fisher proclaimed “the nation is marching along a permanently high plateau of prosperity.”
In fact, pundits may not even see a bear market separating the last bull and the next. A new normal? Read the new Wall Street Journal report, “Top bear's bullish tilt has followers growling.” After many years as a permabear, former Merrill Lynch chief economist David Rosenberg surrendered, a turncoat. Clients weren't happy. Roubini's likely getting similar criticism.
Still, they're bowing to the facts. They see happy days for 2014.
6 reasons to jump back in, dance to the new Roaring Twenties spirit
Back in 2009 when we beat Roubini to the punch, “calling a bottom and a new bull,” the Dow was 6,547. Recently it hit a new record 15,676. More than doubled. If it doubles without a bear pause, guess what ... the Dow could be pushing 24,000 by 2017. So where's the risk?
Here's an update of the six reasons we gave investors for jumping back in when the Dow was crashing, dropping into 6,547:
1. Stocks make big money sudden, fast, then go to “sleep”
Several years ago Journal columnist Jason Zweig reported on some fascinating research: “History shows that the vast majority of the time, the stock market does next to nothing. Then, when no one expects it, the market delivers a giant gain or loss — and promptly lapses back into its usual stupor.” Well, this time some actually expect a 2014 boom.
2. The stock market always turns before the economy bottoms
The stock market is a leading indicator. Stocks historically kick into action earlier than the economy recovers, often six months ahead of the economy's bottom.
3. Forget market timing, you can't predict big or small moves
Markets are notoriously unpredictable. Not by Main Street. Certainly not by Wall Street. In his classic “Stocks for the Long Run,” Wharton's Jeremy Siegel studied all the big market moves between 1801 and 2001. He found that 75% of the time there was no logical reason for big moves in stocks up or big moves down.
4. Famous media darling pundits inevitably flame out
Former Journal science columnist Sharon Begley once wrote a piece in Newsweek, “Why pundits get things wrong.” Her opening: “Pointing out how often pundits' predictions are not only wrong but egregiously wrong — a 36,000 Dow! euphoric Iraqis welcoming American soldiers with flowers! — is like shooting fish in a barrel, except in this case the fish refuse to die. But no matter how often they miss the mark, pundits just won't shut up.”
5. Even the most respected expert can make massive errors
Over a decade ago a BusinessWeek title said it all: “What do you call an economist with a prediction? Wrong.” A few years later, in “So I was off by a trillion,” BusinessWeek reported how Gregory Boskin, former chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, publicly miscalculated future tax payments on withdrawals from tax-deferred retirement accounts. Later, others rechecked his numbers; he had to admit his $12 trillion in savings was bogus. Too often political ideologies trump “objective” economists pronouncements.
6. Paradoxically, Washington's political drama is good for the stock market
In the short run the government shutdown was a $24 billion disaster. But over in the Journal, E.S. Browning sees a stock “silver lining” in a Ned Davis Research “good news” comment: “This is the best environment for stocks right now ... economy kept growing ... don't have rising interest rates ... don't have inflationary pressures ... do have earnings growth ... and the turmoil is widely expected to keep the Fed” printing cheap money.
Plus, “the most positive indicator,” says the Davis team, “is that unemployment is a high 7.3%, but declining.” And history tells us “when the unemployment rate is above 6% and falling, that is the best situation for the stock market.”
And that's six great reasons 2014 is the “Year of the Boom,” a great time for a Roaring Twenties jazz band party ... and for investing in a bullish, booming stock market. So place your bets. Time to drink a case of your favorite intoxicating bubbly irrational exuberance! You earned it.
Real Madrid emerged victorious in the Clásico, after coming back from being 16 points down courtesy of a tremendous fourth-quarter display at the Palau. The Whites, led by Sergio Rodríguez (15 points and a PIR of 31) and the brilliantwho produced his best scoring performance in the white of Real Madrid (25 points and a PIR of 26) - ensured a repeat of the result the last time the two teams met at the Blaugranas court.The game got off the sort of rip-roaring start which is typical of a Clásico showdown. The fourth meeting of the season saw both teams trade baskets in the opening minutes. Ayón and Tomic battled for supremacy in the paint, but Barcelona racked up a +10 (22-12) thanks to Abrines' shooting accuracy on three-pointers (3 from 3). Carroll made the first three-pointer of the day for the Whites to reduce the arrears at the end of the first quarter (26-17).Real Madrid were struggling to win the battle on rebounds (20-10) and Barcelona capitalised on this, with Tomic starring (8 points and 7 rebounds). The Whites relied on good spells from Sergio Rodríguez (8 points) and Thompkins (7 points, 2 three-pointers) to reduce the +16 advantage which the Azulgranas had racked up. Rudy posted from the 6.75m line to bring the curtain down on the second quarter (52-43).
Newer online tools & webapps allow developers to create rapid websites without manually writing each individual line of code. Frontend development is one area that has seen a lot of growth in the way of frameworks & code libraries.
But many developers also forget about code generators and their value in building websites. The following resources are completely free webapps that can generate CSS3 code for patterns, gradients, or even browser prefixed properties. If you write frontend code then these resources can save you a lot of time and offer repeatable snippets for future project work.
One of the most-loved web applications for code generation is CSS3 Generator. It has different pages for each type of code generator including RGBa, transform, flexbox and a whole lot more. Plus each code generator includes icons that explain which browser versions fully support the property.
For a more dynamic application check out the Enjoy CSS website. It's meant to be a full code generator for live projects that might need custom input fields or CSS3 buttons. It offers customized code for transforms and transitions along with pre-built items for common page elements like CSS3 buttons.
Unless you know your way around Photoshop it can be tough to make patterns from scratch. Thankfully Patternify is a free tool that generates everything you need for tileable CSS patterns.
The background is generated using base64 code added into CSS. You can draw your own patterns with raw pixel data or even select from a collection of pre-built patterns. Photoshop is definitely a better choice but Patternify is a great option if you don't have access to PS or another graphic design program.
CSS3 gradients are some of the most complex features in the language. They're pretty easy to make but the code requirements are surprisingly verbose. ColorZilla's gradient editor is a free generator for CSS3 background gradients.
The setup is very similar to Photoshop or another color picker interface. You can set multiple breakpoints for a myriad of colors in one gradient, and you can choose output options from HEX code to HSL or RGBa.
Another free multi-tool webapp is CSSmatic. I call this a “multi-tool” app because it generates 4 different CSS properties: gradients, rounded borders, box shadows and BG noise. The whole site is completely free and will hopefully see more properties added in the future.
It's easy to forget about typography when it comes to design but it's one of the most important aspects of any webpage. Resets often take care of type but sometimes you'd rather automate the process. CSS Type Set does exactly this by previewing live text properties and offering CSS code to copy into your own site.
Every developer knows the pain of writing custom prefixes to handle all web browsers. Thankfully standards have come a long way and not all prefixes are needed – but many still are. Prefixr is a free tool that updates your CSS code to include all required prefixed properties.
An alternative to Prefixr is the more recent Pleeease Play webapp. It's another CSS prefix generator which can also perform other advanced CSS3 updates. Most notably you'll find backwards-compatible updates for CSS3 opacity, filters, and pseudo elements, among other neat effects. Plus the interface is super easy to use which makes it a fun choice for developers who wish to double-check their code.
Traditional buttons and input elements were always limited to the operating system's default style. Now it's easier than ever to customize unique buttons – the biggest problem is translating your design from Photoshop/Sketch into CSS3.
Once you learn all the CSS properties it does get easier but you still need to write many lines of code. CSS Button Generator is a free tool used for customizing button styles and label text. The code is generated automatically and updates whenever you modify a setting.
An alternative for button code is the Best CSS Button Generator. This is also completely free to use and comes with a simple interface. Best of all you can select from pre-built buttons and use those as a template for your own design. And if you're a Chrome user check out the free browser extension that can be accessed outside the website.
The more you practice with CSS the easier it'll get. But at some point you'll reach a level of proficiency where automation is truly a saving grace.
Use these tools as required and do everything in your power to make frontend development the simplest part of your project cycle.

The National Capital Commission's latest plan for replacing a heritage building on Clarence Street appears to have won over critics who loudly opposed the initial design.
CEO Mark Kristmanson and architect Anthony Leaning met Monday with about two dozen people to unveil three new proposals for 7 Clarence, which housed Memories restaurant until it was forced to vacate the building last year.
The NCC subsequently concluded the building has reached the end of its life cycle and asked the city's permission to tear it down.
That request was approved in April, but the city sent the NCC back to the drawing board after its original design — described as a glass box — was widely panned.
Kristmanson says the new proposals all bring down the size of the building, remove a side patio and incorporate more stone and wood — construction materials far more common in the ByWard Market than opaque glass.
“We've moved from a glass box with a very modern feel and a high degree of transparency and light emission to a building that's much more respectful of the original stone building of 7 Clarence,” he said.
Many of the changes are the result of three public meetings the NCC held to seek the public's input and have enriched the design, Kristmanson said.
“This design process is leading to a really fine new building.”

The NCC's 'Option 2' for the soon-to-be-demolished building at 7 Clarence St.
Liz MacKenzie of the Lowertown Community Association's heritage committee applauded the NCC for its engagement efforts.
“It really makes it clear the NCC is coming to the community and it's something that everybody appreciates,” she said.
Of the three designs proposed, MacKenzie and others in the room preferred the second option.
It features a mix of windows and limestone panels at the front and a rubble stone wall along the courtyard, similar to what is currently there. The design also incorporates wood beams and has a street friendly feel, some said.
Despite the warm feelings, Sylvie Grenier of the Lowertown Community Association's planning committee said she remains concerned that the building's future tenant could be a restaurant or bar — something she says the Market doesn't need any more of.
“We want to see diversity,” she said, adding some fear small retailers are being pushed away and the market is losing its traditional function.
“It's not interesting to only have one kind of use,” Grenier said.
Kristmanson acknowledged that there is resistance to this type of future use for the building — even though it has been a restaurant for years — and noted one of the reasons the new designs feature less glass is to attract other potential tenants.
“We would favour some kind of diversified use of the building,” he said.
Kristmanson said Leaning will take the comments he received Monday and create a final design, which will eventually be filed to the city for site plan approval.
In the meantime, the current building will be demolished in July or August and construction will ideally begin next spring.

No state has more electric vehicles on the road than California, where 46 percent of the nation's plug-ins have been sold since late 2010. Although it's the most robust EV market in the country, California is at risk of failing to meet its EV goals.
By 2025, 1.5 million zero-emissions vehicles should be on California roads, if Governor Jerry Brown's goals are realized. However, a recent analysis by the Natural Resources Defense Council suggests this goal may be too optimistic.
"The program is in dire need of a tuneup," Simon Mui, director of the NRDC's clean car efforts in California, told the San Francisco Chronicle. "It won't be delivering as many vehicles as the state wants." California will likely see just 1 million vehicles on the road by the deadline, the analysis estimates.
Meanwhile, the California Air Resources Board is thinking of making changes to the state's zero emissions program. It will discuss the program at a hearing scheduled for December. Until then, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has some critical words for the regulatory agency.
"The California Air Resources Board is being incredibly weak," Musk told Wall Street analysts on a conference call, adding the agency "should be damn well ashamed of themselves."

On Friday, July 25, in the city of Zaria, a procession of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria came into conflict with Nigerian army troops. The procession had gathered for the occasion of Quds Day, the last Friday in Ramadan, to protest against the Israeli invasion of Gaza. Some 35 people were killed. Three of the dead were sons of the movement's leader, Ibrahim al-Zakzaky. The incident has received little coverage in the global media and it is still shrouded in mystery in Nigeria.
To understand the incident one needs to look at the movement's origins and development, and at Nigeria's complex connections with the Middle East.
The origins of the movement go back to a period of civilian rule in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Its' founder, Ibrahim al-Zakzaky, was a leader of the student movement at Ahmadu Bello University, the first modern university founded in the predominantly Muslim region of northern Nigeria. Many students at ABU were looking for a modern vision of Islam that promoted economic and technological progress and rejected Western domination. They were inspired by the triumph of the Islamic revolution in Iran. Zakzaky himself became a Shi'ite, and the movement has ties to Iran, but it is not formally a Shi'ite organization. He was a critic of military rule in Nigeria. As a result, he was imprisoned by the military authorities for nine years in the 1980s and 1990s.
The Islamic Movement in Nigeria is not the country's only connection to Shi'ism. Lebanese, some of them Shi'ite, have been coming to Nigeria, and to other countries in West Africa, since the late 19th century to pursue commercial ventures. They are an important source of foreign investment in Nigeria outside of the oil sector, the only more important one being China. The Shi'ite segment of this community grew after Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 2006 as Shi'ites sought security by joining relatives in Nigeria. Zakzaky's ties to Lebanese Shi'ites can be seen in the fact that he sent one of his sons, Mahmud, to study at al-Mustafa International University in Beirut, an institution with strong Iranian ties. His other dead sons, Ahmad and Hamid had returned to Nigeria for Ramadan from their technology studies in China. This reflects how Zakzaky's vision included not only Shi'ism but also technological advancement, and support of a Third World vision opposed to Western domination.
Some Nigerians, particularly the Igbo, a mainly Christian ethnic group in southeastern Nigeria, feel a strong connection to Israel. Stories have been circulating about the Igbo being descended from the lost tribe of Israel at least since the time of Olaudah Equiano, an Igbo who was taken to America as a slave, then set free by his owner, a British naval officer, in 1765. He gained a good education, and became a prominent advocate for the abolition of slavery. Some Igbos practice Judaism.
Goodluck Jonathan, Nigeria's president since 2010, who comes from a small ethnic group in the Niger Delta region, has warm feelings toward Israel. In October 2013, he led a group of prominent Nigerian political figures on a pilgrimage to Israel, and had meetings with Israel's political leaders. The Israeli government has put important efforts into developing its ties with sub-Saharan African countries, working to promote economic development and to improve security. One of Israel's concerns has been to prevent the shipment of arms by Iran to African countries.
Two incidents relate to this concern. In 2010, Nigerian authorities seized a cache of arms on an Iranian ship passing through Lagos. Then in May 2013, in the city of Kano, the commercial hub of northern Nigeria, police found arms buried under a house belonging to a Lebanese Shi'ite. Israeli sources claimed that the arms were to be used in attacks on Israeli targets in Nigeria.
Nigerian police arrested three Lebanese Shi'ites who, they claimed were members of Hizbullah. But at the trial, the police were unable to produce convincing evidence that these men were involved in a terrorist plot, nor could they provide a clear story of who was involved in bringing in the arms—which were rusty–and when they did so. The defense lawyer argued that sympathizing with Hizbullah was not a crime. It was also pointed out that the men had been harshly interrogated by agents of Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency. Two of them were acquitted, but one was found guilty.
The incident on Quds day in Zaria was preceded only two days earlier by bomb attacks in the nearby city of Kaduna targeting a likely rival of Goodluck Jonathan in 2015 elections, retired general Muhammadu Buhari, and a leader of the Tijaniyya Sufi order, Dahiru Bauchi, who had led an unsuccessful effort to negotiate a truce between the government and Boko Haram in 2012.. Both of them survived but 82 other people were killed. Suspicion naturally fell on Boko Haram, but there were rumors that government officials were manipulating Boko Haram in pursuit of their own goals.
Ibrahim al-Zakzaky was an advocate of such conspiracy theories, and this would help explain the anger that military authorities felt toward him. They probably suspected that he supported Hizbullah's alleged schemes in Nigeria. But Zakzaky was also strongly opposed to the arbitrary violence pursued by extremist movements such as Boko Haram, or by authoritarian governments. He supported dialogue with groups such as the Christian Association of Nigeria.
But in the atmosphere of high tension created by the crisis in Gaza, Zakzaky's Islamic Movement is easily seen as a group posing a violent threat to Israeli and western interests. Hopefully, a Nigerian courtroom can become the scene of an open discussion of what happened in Zaria, how to punish those responsible, and how to prevent the incident from further undermining Nigeria's stability.

PressTV: “Nigeria commemorates killed Quds day protesters”
Three days of clashes between tribes in the southern Libyan town of Sabha have killed more than 70 people, a Libyan government spokesman has said.
"It is regrettable that more than 70 people have been killed and more than 150 have been wounded" since Monday in the desert town of Sabha, Nasser al-Manaa told a news conference in Tripoli on Wednesday.
"We announce the reactivation of the Toubou Front for the Salvation of Libya to protect Toubou people from ethnic cleansing. If necessary, we will ...work towards the creation of a state, as in South Sudan." - Issa Abdel Majid Mansur,
Toubou chief
Local officials said the fighting pitting the African Toubou tribe against Arab tribes in Sabha had eased and efforts to secure a truce were underway, although the Toubou claimed they were facing a "massacre."
"There are still clashes but not as intense," in Sabha, said Abdelmajid Seif al-Nasser, a town official who quit his post on Tuesday from the ruling National Transitional Council in protest over the violence.
"The national army and a committee of elders has entered the town in a bid to secure a truce," Nasser, who represented the NTC in Sabha, told AFP news agency.
But Toubou tribesmen said Arab tribesmen from Sabha were "surrounding" them in the Tayuri and Al-Hijara neighbourhoods and shelling them since the early hours of the morning.
"Al-Hijara is surrounded from all sides. All the Arab (tribes) are against us. They are bombarding us using all sorts of rockets indiscriminately. It is a real massacre," said Karima Jaber, a Sabha airport employee.
‘Ethnic cleansing'
Toubou chief Issa Abdel Majid Mansur said earlier this week that 40 members of his tribe had been killed, and accused Libyan authorities of using warplanes and tanks against his community.
Speaking to AFP, Mansur denounced what he said was a plan to "ethnically cleanse" his people, and raised the threat of a separatist bid.
"We announce the reactivation of the Toubou Front for the Salvation of Libya [TFSL, an opposition group active under the former regime] to protect the Toubou people from ethnic cleansing," Mansur said.
"If necessary, we will demand international intervention and work towards the creation of a state, as in South Sudan," he said.
Ali al-Dib, a former rebel, said the clashes erupted in the city centre when the Toubou refused to hand over to local authorities one of their men accused of killing a member of the Bussif tribe.
The Toubou are black oasis farmers by tradition who also have connections beyond Libya's borders.
They live in southern Libya, northern Chad and in Niger, and have previously denied having separatist ambitions.
SINGAPORE - Crowds formed in front of the Apple Store on Orchard Road on Thursday night (Sept 21) to queue for the anticipated 8am launch of the iPhone 8.
Those hopeful of buying the phones, which are limited to two per person, were given numbered wristbands that would allow them to leave the queue and return within an hour to retain their place.
By 11pm, when those with wristbands were ushered into the barricades set up outside the store, about 50 people had gathered.
Mr Amin Ahmed Dholiya, 43, was first in the queue, having arrived at the store at around 7pm.
He said he flew in from India specially to buy an iPhone 8 Plus for his daughter as a wedding gift.
"I will buy two, one for my other daughter. This is my first time queuing overnight for something - I am feeling good now but it will be hard to stand all night," said the businessman, who will be returning home on Friday (Sept 22) night.

This is the first major product launch since Singapore's first Apple Store opened along Orchard Road in May.
The iPhone 8 retails for $1,148 (64GB) and $1,388 (256GB), while the iPhone 8 Plus retails for $1,308 (64GB) and $1,548 (256GB).
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A lawsuit by a former Northrop Grumman employee alleges that the defense contractor defrauded the U.S. government over a contract to provide commercial airliners with a missile defense system.
The suit, which was originally filed in 2009 by Leo Danilides, was unsealed in federal district court in Chicago on Thursday. The U.S. Justice Department said in a separate filing it was not joining in the action.
The suit was filed under the False Claims Act, which lets people collect rewards for blowing the whistle on fraud against the government.
Northrop spokesman Randy Belote said the company typically did not comment on litigation matters.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security contract involved an effort called the Counter-MANPADS program, designed to protect civilian airliners after an unsuccessful shoulder-fired missile attack against an Israeli airplane taking off from Mombasa, Kenya, in 2002.
Northrop received a contract in 2006 to provide improvements for work it had done in two earlier phases of the project “and “create a commercially feasible system,” according to the lawsuit. It said the plaintiff, Danilides, had worked on the program “for many years.”
The suit alleged that during the Phase III part of the project, for which it said the company was paid $62 million, “Northrop pretended to be exerting its best efforts when it was doing virtually nothing to improve the design and reliability of the Counter-MANPADS system.”
“Northrop failed to perform critical tasks, and then profited by keeping the money that was supposed to have been spent doing that work,” according to the allegations.
“Far from providing its ‘best efforts' as required, Northrop was providing no efforts,” the suit alleged.
The contract ended in 2008 and government funding for the project was later canceled.
On Saturday morning, voting for the NHL All-Stars closed and votes were tallied. Not surprisingly, the Chicago Blackhawks DOMINATED the ballot box and the Hawks fans pushed for their players to earn five of the top six spots on the opening roster. However, people all over Twitter were extremely pissed about this because it was supposedly “unfair, ” even though they won fair and square.
The All-Stars
As you can see, Zemgus Girgensons of the Buffalo Sabres is the only player that beat out the five Blackhawks to take the reigns of top vote-getter thanks to his Latvian family and fans.
Patrick Kane, Jonathan Toews, Brent Seabrook, Duncan Keith and Corey Crawford were all the top vote-getters for each of their respected positions (Center, Right Wing, Right Defense, Left Defense, Goaltender). This will be the first All-Star game for Brent Seabrook.
The ButtHurt Fans
Plenty of people took to Twitter on Saturday to lash out their hurt feelings for their team not being represented in the top six. Take a look:

What Some People Might Not Know
The original voting for fans only determined the first six players that are definitely going to the All-Star game. They are not necessarily the starters. They are the first players named to the pool that will be selected in the All-Star fantasy draft. The full roster of players will be determined by the National Hockey League and we'll have to wait until Jan. 10 for the NHL to reveal who will fill out the rest of the All-Star roster.
Most people are freaking out because their favorite players aren't being represented, but that is yet to be determined, they need to calm the hell down.
The European Union has struck a "behind the scenes" pact to take in half a million refugees directly from camps in Turkey , Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister, has claimed.
The deal, which wasn't part of an official agreement between Turkey and the EU at the weekend to reduce the flow of asylum-seekers to Europe , would be announced within days, Mr Orban said on Wednesday.
“Beyond what we agreed with Turkey in Brussels there's something that doesn't figure in the agreement,” Mr Orban told a meeting of ethnic Hungarian leaders.
“We'll wake up one day – and I think this will be announced in Berlin as soon as this week – that we have to take in 400,000 to 500,000 refugees directly from Turkey.”
The EU on Sunday agreed an aid package of €3 billion (£2.1 billion) for refugee camps in Turkey in exchange for the country's help slowing the influx of asylum-seekers to Europe.
It also agreed to reopen the way to eventual Turkish EU membership.
• Brussels to ease visa restrictions on Turkey in exchange for taking back deported migrants
Angela Merkel the German chancellor, categorically denied a newspaper report along similar lines to Mr Orban's accusations at the weekend talks.
A report in Frankfurter Allegemeine Sonntagszeitung claimed a small group of EU countries were prepared to accept 400,000 refugees direct from Turkey in exchange for Turkish cooperation.
“Nothing that was written in that newspaper report came up in our discussions,” Mrs Merkel said.

Mr Orban claimed the proposal had been raised at an EU summit in Malta last month and dropped after several countries including Hungary threatened to veto it.
“There'll be tremendous pressure on us if somebody already agreed to this – and to avoid causing a diplomatic tussle by naming the country I'm not going to say where Berlin is – that we shouldn't just take them in but distribute them according to binding quotas,” he said.
“This nasty surprise is still waiting for Europeans.”
The outspoken Mr Orban, who has refused to allow any asylum-seekers into Hungary and fenced part of the country's border to keep them out, has been a leading opponent of EU plans to distribute refugees among member states.
Under the plans, backed by Mrs Merkel and Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commissions president, refugees would be shared by quota. The UK is exempt from the plan because it has an opt-out.
"There'll be tremendous pressure on us if somebody already agreed to this – and to avoid causing a diplomatic tussle by naming the country I'm not going to say where Berlin is – that we shouldn't just take them in but distribute them according to binding quotas" Viktor Orban
Meanwhile a senior German minister has said his country expects all EU member states to contribute towards the new aid package agreed for Turkey.
“All member states should contribute to financing a total of €3 billion,” Jens Spahn, parliamentary state secretary at the finace ministry, told Süddeustche Zeitung newspaper.
The EU “as a whole” had an interest in a reliable agreement with Turkey, he said.
“That is a question of European solidarity.”
The European Commission wants member states to raise the money out of a new fund, with contributions based on the size of their comparative economies. The UK has already volunteered to pay some £250 million into the fund.
According to German press reports, Mrs Merkel's government has largely given up on persuading Hungary and other central European member states to participate in a quota-system for refugees, but is determined they should bear their share of the cost of the Turkish aid package.
The Islamic State terror group is operating a camp in the northern Mexican state of Chihuahua, just eight miles from the U.S. border, Judicial Watch reported Tuesday.
Citing sources that include a “Mexican Army field grade officer and a Mexican Federal Police Inspector,” the conservative watchdog group reported that the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, is organizing only a few miles from El Paso, Texas, in the Anapra neighborhood of Juárez and in Puerto Palomas.
Judicial Watch sources said that “coyotes” working for the notorious Juarez Cartel are smuggling Islamic State terrorists across the U.S. border between the New Mexico cities of Santa Teresa and Sunland Park, as well as “through the porous border between Acala and Fort Hancock, Texas.”
“These specific areas were targeted for exploitation by ISIS because of their understaffed municipal and county police forces, and the relative safe-havens the areas provide for the unchecked large-scale drug smuggling that was already ongoing,” Judicial Watch reported.
Mexican intelligence sources say the Islamic State intends to exploit the railways and airport facilities in the vicinity of Santa Teresa, New Mexico.
“The sources also say that ISIS has ‘spotters' located in the East Potrillo Mountains of New Mexico (largely managed by the Bureau of Land Management) to assist with terrorist border crossing operations,” Judicial Watch reported. “ISIS is conducting reconnaissance of regional universities; the White Sands Missile Range; government facilities in Alamogordo, NM; Ft. Bliss; and the electrical power facilities near Anapra and Chaparral, NM.”

Mexican authorities, however, disputed the Judicial Watch findings.
“The government of Mexico dismisses and categorically denies each of the statements made today by the organization Judicial Watch on the alleged presence of ISIS's operating cells throughout the border region, particularly at Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua - El Paso, Texas,” Ariel Moutsatsos-Morales, Mexico's minister for press and public affairs, told The Washington Times.
“The relevant authorities operating in the region have also confirmed the inexistence of these activities with their US counterparts, with whom they will continue to work closely and to exchange information at our common border,” Moutsatsos-Morales added.

Game developer Valve Corporation has yet to make an official statement regarding the development of its multiplayer zombie shooter game “Left 4 Dead 3,” but the highly-anticipated video game is getting a boost from recent incidents, all seemingly pointing to the fact that the game is possibly on the development phase.
First came the revelations made by an anonymous former employee of Valve Corporation who said that the game development company will develop “Left 4 Dead 3” ahead of the first-person shooter video game “Half Life 3.”
Apparently, the former Valve employee decided to speak up because he was commiserating with the fan woes for lack of news or updates regarding the two upcoming games on the company's stable of upcoming video game titles.
Recently, leaks started coming out saying that Valve Corporation was already remaking several “Left 4 Dead 2” levels using the Source 2 Engine, which is consistent with reports that “Left 4 Dead 3” will be developed using Steam's new engine.
The remaking of several levels of “Left 4 Dead 2” is a good indication that Valve is now possibly working on the development of the successor video game using the Source 2 Engine. Getting a dry run or test run of the new engine using the predecessor video game may actually mean that the developer is making a prototype for “Left 4 Dead 3,” notes the Latinos Post.
Virtual reality mode coming?
In addition to news about the game using Source 2 Engine, there were also reports saying that Valve is actually considering the use of virtual reality (VR) technology for both “Left 4 Dead 3” and “Half Life 3.” Assuming those reports are true, then it is likely another reason why the development of both games has been taking so long.
As fans and gamers of the multiplayer zombie shooter game “Left 4 Dead 3” and the first-person shooter video game “Half Life 3” have been kept in the dark regarding updates on the games' respective development by game developer Valve Corporation, one former employee of the company has decided to come out in public and shared what he knew.
Consistent with previous reports over the past few months, the ex-Valve employee confirmed that the game developer is indeed working on the two video games. He also validated the recent report that came out saying that Valve will be releasing “Left 4 Dead 3” ahead of “Half Life 3.”
While there are no official release dates yet for both “Left 4 Dead 3” and “Half Life 3,” reports have it that “Half Life 3” could possibly hit gaming shelves either late in 2017 or early 2018, which means that “Left 4 Dead 3” could come out in the video game retail markets either in early 2017 or late in 2016.
The same former employee of Valve also revealed that “Half Life 3” is not in active development at the moment because the company wants to focus and release “Left 4 Dead 3” first.
Four survivors, six gameplay campaigns
The source also revealed “Left 4 Dead 3” will be a prequel-sequel of “Left 4 Dead 2” and it shall actually take place one month after the infection has begun to spread. Accordingly, the game shall also have four new survivors and six campaigns.
The four new survivors include Irvin, a black gangster guy, Katherine, a stereotypical 24-year-old Caucasian woman, Keenan, a black guy who is a comic book nerd, and Garrett Jr., a buffed-up guy who is a famous Kenpo fighter in the “Left 4 Dead” franchise.
“Left 4 Dead 3” shall also have six campaigns, namely: Crash-land, Impasse, Inquisitor Land, Early Destination, Cliff-Hanger and No Mercy.
The former employee of Valve also disclosed that the “Left 4 Dead 3” is also going to get a backpack system that allows each character to carry a specific item only.
Game developer Valve Corporation has been making an excellent living and profits by releasing multiplayer video game titles and also banking on its internet-based gaming platform called Steam.

Noam Galai/AOL Executive producer Melissa Rosenberg and actress Krysten Ritter at AOL's Build Series with moderator Ricky Camilleri Monday afternoon.
Netflix's next Marvel show “Jessica Jones” debuts Friday on the streaming network, but there was a time when it nearly had a different home.
Executive producer Melissa Rosenberg actually began developing the series over at ABC years ago when “Breaking Bad” was still on the air, she said during a taping for AOL's Build Series Monday afternoon.
Moderator Ricky Camilleri was taken aback and commented that “Jessica Jones” must have been in development for three or four years.
In actuality, the series has been in development since 2010, long before ABC's “Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.” series. The then-titled “AKA Jessica Jones” was set to debut in fall 2011. However, that time came and went. The network later passed on the show in May 2012.
Finally, in 2013, Marvel and Disney made a deal with Netflix to make four exclusive live-action series, including hit “Daredevil” and Rosenberg's long-shelved “Jessica Jones.”
I saw the first episode at New York Comic Con in October, and it's not a big shock that ABC passed on the series. Rosenberg previously said she had “toned it down for the network.” As fans will see, it's basically an R-rated Marvel adaptation made for the small screen. It's dark, it's gritty, and it's really mature — the series deals with themes like rape and PTSD — but it's really good.

It's been a long, arduous journey for Rosenberg to get the series on screen, but it seems like the wait was well worth it and enabled the producers to get the cast they wanted.
“With David Tennant, he had been the person we wanted for [the villain] Kilgrave, but he wasn't available at the time,” said Rosenberg. “So we went through all the lists and we talked to all different people and then by the time I actually came around to shooting it, he was available again so we jumped on him like mad people.”
Kilgrave, also known as the purple man, can be likened to a stalker who's obsessed with Krysten Ritter's lead character, Jones.

Rosenberg explained that in the many years while the future of the series was up in the air, head of Marvel television Jeph Loeb, who brought the idea of “Jessica Jones” to her, would call every three to four months with an idea on how to make the series potentially work. This went on for a while, according to Rosenberg.
“Finally, whenever we got the greenlight, he calls me and says, ‘OK, if the press contact you tell them you don't know anything,'” she recalled. “I said, ‘No problem!' And that's when I found out it was going to be at Netflix.”
“Had I fantasized about the perfect place for it [Jessica Jones], it would have been Netflix,” Rosenberg added.
All 13 hour-long episodes of “Jessica Jones” will be available to stream November 20.

Emperor Akihito declared his resolve to fulfill his role as the symbol of Japan to ensure a smooth transition of the monarchy until his abdication on April 30, 2019.
Speaking at a news conference Dec. 20 ahead of his 84th birthday on Dec. 23, Akihito said, “I am truly grateful that numerous people have put their thoughts and efforts into the matter in their respective roles.
“Over the remaining days, as I continue to carry out my duties as the symbol of the state, I would like to make preparations for passing the torch to the next era, together with the people concerned.”
The emperor first indicated his desire to abdicate in summer 2016, citing his age and health.
Under the schedule set by the government for the first abdication of an emperor in 200 years, Akihito's eldest son, Crown Prince Naruhito, will ascend the Chrysanthemum Throne on May 1, 2019.
During the news conference held at the Imperial Palace, the emperor also touched on his travels in and out of Japan over the past year. He visited Vietnam and Thailand as well as municipalities in Fukuoka and Oita prefectures devastated by heavy downpours, along with remote islands in Kagoshima Prefecture.
In addition, he spoke of his granddaughter Princess Mako's engagement to Kei Komuro, Mako' classmate from her university days, saying, “This gives me much joy, and I pray for their happiness.”
The emperor greeted an estimated 45,900 well-wishers through a veranda of the Imperial Palace on Dec. 23, along with his wife Empress Michiko, Naruhito and his wife Crown Princess Masako. Akihito's other son, Prince Fumihito, his wife Princess Kiko and their daughter Princess Mako also joined the imperial couple.

Earlier this month, Damon Albarn bummed a lot of people out with a Guardian interview in which he claimed that Blur and Gorillaz, his two most successful musical projects, were probably pretty much done. More recently, though, Albarn gave another interview in which he claimed that this was not necessarily the case. If you needed any further proof that Damon Albarn operates on whim alone, there you have it.
Talking to Metro, Albarn calls the Guardian interview “an interesting take on a very long conversation.” He'd said that Blur had no future planned out after their show in London's Hyde Park this August, but he tells Metro, “I don't know how we'll feel when we play Hyde Park. Some days I feel one way and other days I feel the other. If you don't see something as a career but as an important part of your life, you don't know how you're going to feel about it. We want to put on a great performance, but nothing's been said between us about the beginning or the end.”
As for Gorillaz, a group that seemed doomed because of some beef between Albarn and co-creator Jamie Hewlett, Albarn says, “When Jamie [Hewlett] and I have worked out our differences, I'm sure we'll make another record… We've been through too much together for it to be that big of a mountain to climb. We've just fallen out like mates do sometimes. I'm not the only person to fall out with mates and then make up again — everyone does it.”
Later in the interview, Albarn says that the biggest misconception about him is “that everything that comes out of my mouth is serious.” So there you have it: Never believe anything that comes out of this man's mouth, ever.

Event is first since Taiwan ruled in favour of gay marriage but some activists are frustrated by slow progress of legalisation
A sea of rainbow flags and glitzy costumes filled downtown Taipei as tens of thousands marched in Asia's largest gay pride parade, the first since Taiwan's top court ruled in favour of gay marriage.
The island looks set to become the first place in Asia to legalise gay marriage after the constitutional court said in May that laws preventing same-sex unions violated the guarantee of freedom of marriage. It gave the government two years to implement the decision.
The anticipation was felt in Saturday's parade, as dancing crowds in colourful wigs and sequined outfits made their way through the capital's centre alongside vans blasting music.

Many spared no effort in dressing up, from a man posing in a sweeping bridal dress and a tiara to another in an inflatable dinosaur costume.
But behind the celebrations, some are frustrated at the lack of progress in changing the marriage laws since the court ruling.
“A lot of people cannot afford to wait two years,” said Joseph Wu, 46, dressed in a matching kilt and rainbow turban with his partner of six years. “We just want the same things heterosexual couples have. We also do our military service, we pay the same taxes, so why can't we have the same thing?”
Hino Chen, 29, said: “We are the same. We also want to start our own families.”

Gay rights activists expressed frustration last month when a Taipei administrative court rejected a request from a lesbian couple to marry, saying they could only register when relevant laws were in effect.
Still, Taiwan is seen as one of the most progressive societies in Asia when it comes to gay rights.
For Benny Chan from Hong Kong, it was worth travelling there just for the parade. He was dressed as a Chinese empress in a strapless full-length gold gown, which he says he would not dare to wear in Hong Kong.
“Hong Kong is more conservative, maybe because of China's influence,” said Chan, 35. “Only when I'm in Taiwan can I dress like this and not be afraid to express myself.”
Brenda Konkel and her partner Robert Bloch didn't expect to be rewarded for their decision to open up their front porch to any homeless person who needed a place to rest or store their belongings, but the last thing they could have imagined was that their good deed would go punished.
According to the Madison Capital Times, for the past 18 months the couple have let homeless Madison residents secure their stuff in the dozen lockers they put on their front porch. And when someone needed a safe place to rest at night, Konkel and Bloch welcomed them to stay.
But their selflessness could soon meet an abrupt end after a neighbor complained about the presence of homeless people at their home. The city agreed with the neighbor. According to the zoning code, only people who “are part of a dwelling unit — who have access to and share the interior for housekeeping services — can legally elect to sleep outside of a dwelling unit,” Zoning Administrator Matt Tucker told the Capital Times.
If the couple doesn't get rid of the lockers this week, they could face fines of as much as $300 per day. The deadline for evicting the porch-dwellers is mid-October.

Homelessness is a growing problem in Madison. A citywide count in 2013 found 831 homeless people living in the city, an increase of 47 percent since 2010. Among those 831 homeless residents were 110 families with children.
Konkel estimated on Facebook that she and her partner have helped more than 60 people over the past year and a half. She noted that many of those they'd helped “were working, but just can't afford to house or were between homes.” What especially surprised her, though, was how many people they'd helped who were either under 25 years old or over 50.
Just recently, in fact, a 59-year-old man and a young man who was kicked out of his parents' house had stayed on their porch, Bloch told the Capital Times. “They can go to sleep and not worry that all their stuff will be gone when they wake up, or they'll be forced to move by police, or that they'll be hurt in some way,” Bloch said.
People being threatened or assessed with fines for helping the homeless is becoming a trend recently. Earlier this year, a Florida couple was fined $746 for feeding homeless people, while a Birmingham pastor was prevented from doing so because he didn't have a $500 permit. Even church groups based in St. Louis and Raleigh have been blocked and threatened with arrest for handing out meals to their homeless neighbors.
Serving the homeless isn't a new cause for Konkel and Bloch. Konkel, who used to serve on the Madison City Council, currently works as the Executive Director of the Tenant Resource Center, a non-profit that seeks to promote tenants' rights. She has been deeply involved in Occupy Madison, recently earning notoriety for her work helping develop tiny homes for homeless Madison residents.

Though the couple have not publicly declared what they will do about the threatened fine, their underlying beliefs remain. “These are human beings,” she told the Capital Times. “If the city and the county aren't doing this, why prevent us from doing it?”

Exit Theatre Mode
An ex-Rare employee has revealed details about a prototype game the studio was developing for the Kinect called Savannah.
In an interview with NotEnoughShaders, Donnchadh Murphy spoke about the project the studio was working on until it became Microsoft's Kinect Sports team.
“ Rare was renowned for their diverse portfolio, so to not be involved in making mature games was a real blow.
Savannah was planned to take place in a realistic savannah environment (shockingly) and would task players with raising a lion cub from birth to adulthood. Along the way, you would have to teach the animal the social and survival skills it would need to succeed in the wild.
"We knew of the Kinect coming out but we had no real info on how good it was, but the plan was to try and use that technology in Savannah," Murphy explained.
"It was an interesting concept and it was fun to work on, we really tried to push the technology of the 360 to get the most out of the graphics. The lions and hyenas were using a custom shell system for the fur, and with the help of a great programmer called Cliff Ramshaw, I think we got some of the nicest looking in-game fur I've seen.
"It was only ever a prototype, and it never got a green light."
Murphy also went on to explain the hurdles the former Nintendo developer experienced once it was purchased by Microsoft. He revealed that the company was strongly demoralised by Microsoft's decision to have them target younger audiences, which led to the cancellation of a more realistic Kameo sequel as well as several ideas from Conker's Bad Fur Day creator Chris Seavor.
“ At first it seemed that [Microsoft] wouldn't interfere much, but it was soon clear that they were more interested in using Rare to help aim at a younger market.
He explained, "At first it seemed that [Microsoft] wouldn't interfere much, but it was soon clear that they were more interested in using Rare to help aim at a younger market. This stifled a lot of creativity, Rare was renowned for their diverse portfolio, so to not be involved in making mature games was a real blow.
"There [were] numerous projects that were put forward that I believe would have been huge hits, but Microsoft rejected them one after the other. I remember seeing a couple of prototypes that Chris Seavor had designed and was working on that looked amazing, but alas they got shelved."
Also among the casualties following the Microsoft takeover was Killer Instinct 3, as it didn't fit the brief Microsoft assigned to the company.
"We all wanted to make Killer Instinct 3, but Microsoft [was] more interested in broadening their demographic than making another fighting game," Murphy concluded. "So it never got made, I doubt it ever will."

Researchers at cybersecurity firm FireEye have warned that the same hacker or hacking group who previously targeted Canadian casinos and mining companies is now looking for new targets and planning more attacks.
Dubbed FIN10, the hacker or hacking group is believed to be behind corporate breaches in the past, breaking into and stealing gigabytes of sensitive company data before holding them for bitcoin ransoms. The devious hacker also publicized the stolen information by contacting bloggers to spread knowledge of stolen company data.
FireEye claimed FIN10's previous operational successes have made campaigns in the future to be “highly probable”. While no details of its previous victims are revealed, it is believed that the attacks struck the world's third-largest gold miner by market cap, Goldcorp, a smaller gold miner called Detour Gold and the Casino Rama Resort in Canada, according to Reuters.
The security firm claims that FIN10 wend with the moniker Angels_of_Truth at least once during its attacks. The hacker group reportedly chose its Canadian targets following sanctions by Canada against Russia. AS mentioned earlier, the hackers contacted databreach web resource databreaches.net between April and June 2015 to take responsibility for the Detour breach. Databreaches.net also reported the Goldcorp breach in April 2016. A separate tech blog, the Daily Dot, published details of Goldcorp's breach before the company confirmed the attack.
Since those attacks, Canadian miners have formed an industry group to share information on cyber threats. Vancouver-based Goldcorp has also bolstered its network defenses and increased its security protocols while revamping its IT processes. In its effort to be more secure, the miner is also educating its staff about cyberattacks and ways in being alert against the threat of phishing scams and more.
Charles Carmakal, vice president at FireEye's Mandiant, further revealed that FIN10 is still keeping communication with some if victims. He added that more targets are likely to “become aware of the threat in the coming weeks or months.”

BIRMINGHAM, Alabama -- Did late jazz great Dave Brubeck play the first integrated concert at the University of Alabama? A letter in the digital archives at Brubeck's alma mater, the University of the Pacific, says he did, despite threats from the Klan.
Brubeck, a pianist who was known for using unusual time signatures and for his accessible style, died Wednesday, a day before his 92nd birthday. He was an iconoclast in the jazz world, and apparently in the world of civil rights, as well.
The letter, dated February 1967 and addressed to Brubeck at a Connecticut address, is from Wilbur Rowand, then chair of the Department of Music at the University of Alabama. It is printed on letterhead from the UA College of Arts and Sciences. In it, Rowand refers to a conversation he and Brubeck had on a plane, and apologizes for not writing him sooner (Rowand was in the hospital, he said). Then he cuts to the chase:
"I wanted to put in writing what I stated to you on the plane: that the Sunday afternoon program presented by you and your musicians was the first time that the box office at our main auditorium had been integrated," Rowand wrote. He was referencing a concert played in 1964, a year after Alabama Gov. George Wallace's famous "Stand in the Schoolhouse Door," when UA was in the midst of an integration fight.
Rowand continues:
"We had a number of colored people at that program in spite of the fact that there was considerable threat on the outside by representatives of the KKK. I am pleased to report to you that we have had no unpleasant incident since that day and all of our concerts, lectures and public attractions have been integrated. This year, we have Shirley Verrett on our Concert-Lecture Series (in April) and I am sure we will have a good representation of students from Stillman College across town."
Stillman is a historically black liberal arts college located in Tuscaloosa.
"In my opinion, the reception given you and your trio, including the Negro musician, was so enthusiastic that it took the minds of the worried few off the problem of admitting for the first time Negro patrons."
The letter, which you can read here, also contains some other information.

National Radio considers the Australian helmet laws "The law here are that cyclists must wear helmets, but in Europe it is not mandato read more ...
How much are helmet laws justified?
This commentary refers to: Criteria to justify a helmet law
This commentary assesses the evidence for each of the criteria that should be satisfied before a helmet law is introduced. These criteria are summarised here.
There must be clear evidence that cycling is especially dangerous, compared with other common activities
People who cycle regularly live longer and experience healthier lives than people who do not cycle (Andersen, Schnohr, Schroll and Hein, 2000). Cycling cannot therefore be more dangerous than other common activities. Data from France shows that cyclists are less likely to be killed than other road users (BHRF, 1129). In the UK and other countries, cycling is safer than walking (Wardlaw, 2002). When the health benefits of cycling are taken into account, cycling is safer than any other mode.
There must be evidence that cycling is unusually productive of head injuries
The risk of head injury to children when cycling is only slightly greater than the average for all activities. The risk when walking is significantly higher than the average (Franklin and Chapman, 2005). In France, cyclists are less likely to suffer head injury than other road users (BHRF, 1129). As cyclists live longer, on average, than non-cyclists, their risk of head injury cannot be exceptional.
The injuries that might be mitigated by a helmet must be of genuine concern
The great majority of head injuries are minor and have no lasting effect. As such, they are of no more concern than minor injuries of any kind.
There must be a high level of scientific evidence that bicycle helmets are effective in reducing the rate of injury to cyclists
Although small-scale case-control studies claim to demonstrate that helmets are effective in reducing head injuries, large population studies, based on more diverse data sources, show no such benefit. Furthermore most pro-helmet studies have been criticised for fundamental methodological errors. There is thus no net scientific consensus that cycle helmets are effective. See: Contradictory evidence about the effectiveness of cycle helmets.
The benefits to society and others of mandatory helmets must be convincingly demonstrated
In societal terms, helmet laws means less cycling which leads to poorer public health. The costs to society of illnesses such as heart disease, which result in part from a more sedentary lifestyle, greatly outweigh the costs of the relatively few head injuries that cyclists sustain. The loss of choice in transport modes for people that do not wish to wear helmets is another disbenefit.
There must be widespread agreement that the potential benefits of compulsory cycle helmets outweigh the infringement of personal liberty and other disbenefits
When surveys have been undertaken, there has often been found to be a majority of the public in favour of helmet laws. However, this is against a background of information about helmets that is almost entirely one-sided and often exaggerated and emotional in its support for helmet wearing. Also, people are more often in favour of helmets for other people than for themselves. Public opinion must be better informed to be a valid instrument for decision making on such a controversial issue.
There must be good evidence to suggest that compulsory helmet wearing will not make the public health and safety benefits of increased levels of cycling harder to obtain
The overwhelming evidence is that enforced helmet laws lead to very much less cycling, particularly for utility journeys and amongst young people. See: Survey of existing laws. This leads to a loss of health benefits for those who no longer cycle and to society as a whole.
Moreover, just as cycling becomes safer the more people who do it (Jacobsen, 2003), so less cycling leads to reduced safety for those who continue to cycle. Helmet laws are equally bad for those who choose to wear a helmet without a law, since they can achieve no additional benefit but along with everyone else will be at greater risk in traffic due to erosion of the safety in numbers effect.
Where the same solution has been tried elsewhere, there must be unambiguous proof that it has worked
The survey of existing laws shows no case where there is good evidence that the rate of head injury has fallen relative to cycle use. In all cases where laws have been enforced, cycle use has declined, usually by more than the increase in helmet wearing.
There must be no evidence of harmful side-effects from helmet use, such as a greater likelihood of being involved in a crash or an increase in the severity of some types of injury
Many claims are made by helmet wearers that their helmet has 'saved their lives'. The number of such instances seems well in excess of the number of head injuries suffered by bare-headed cyclists. More research is needed to clarify whether helmeted cyclists are more likely to crash, but there is already some evidence that helmeted riders are more likely to hit their heads if they do fall.

New Zealand Privacy Chief Backs $1 Million Fines for Breaches
Cites EU, Australian Moves to Impose Stronger Penalties
New Zealand's privacy commissioner is recommending new civil penalties against companies of up to NZ$1 million (US$718,000) for a "serious" data breach to keep up with sterner penalties adopted by Australia and the European Union.
See Also: Sunset of Windows Server 2008: Migrate with Docker
"In light of international trends and current conditions, privacy enforcement sanctions no longer appear adequate to deal with serious breaches," writes Privacy Commissioner John Edwards in a 27-page recommendation to the government. "Additional civil enforcement sanctions for serious breaches of privacy are needed."
The country's Privacy Act, which went into effect in 1993, contains possible breach-related criminal penalties of either $2,000 or $10,000. But those types of cases are intensive for the government to prosecute due to complex criminal process rules, and the fines are relatively low, Edwards writes.
New Zealand has been considering revising its Privacy Act for many years. Parliament has yet to pass legislation, but it is expected to act this year. The largest change would be a requirement that organizations report data breaches to regulators and the public (see Australia, New Zealand Still Mulling Data Breach Laws).
Edwards' review includes five other recommendations covering data portability, compliance, anonymized data, a narrowing of defenses against accusations of a breach and new rules concerning already-public data, such as electoral rolls and land registers.
The country's Law Commission published a lengthy review of the Privacy Act in 2011, but Edwards writes its suggested reforms aren't keeping pace with rapidly evolving data-driven business models.
"This new environment is revealing or confirming gaps and pressure points that add to those identified or considered in previous reviews," he writes.
Steeper Penalties
Edwards' recommendations would give his office the power to apply to the High Court for civil penalties of up to $100,000 on an individual and $1 million for a corporation for a very "serious" breach or repeated violations.
Under the draft legislation, "serious" breaches would be those that pose a risk of harm, such as loss, injury, significant humiliation or adverse effects on rights or benefits.
The proposal for larger fines reflects an expanding view worldwide that data breaches should come with more serious financial consequences, Edwards writes.
The European General Data Protection Regulation, which comes into force in May 2018, gives authorities the power to impose noncompliance penalties of 20 million Euros (US$21 million) or up to 4 percent of a company's global revenue, whichever is greater (see Mandatory Breach Notifications: Europe's Countdown Begins).
"The international context has also seen significant developments," Edwards writes. "These should now be taken into account in preparing revisions to New Zealand's privacy law."
Five years ago, Australia amended its Privacy Act to increase civil penalties. The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner can apply to the Federal Court for fines up to $1.7 million for violations.
Data Anonymization
Governments are increasingly seeking to release large data sets to the public for external analysis and transparency. But those well-intended efforts have sometimes resulted in significant privacy lapses.
The dangers of data that has been inadequately anonymized are well known. Australia ran into trouble when its Department of Health released a 30-year sampling of pharmaceutical benefits claims Australians made under Medicare, the country's public health service (see Australian Health Breach Exposes Danger of 'Anonymous' Data).
Researchers showed it was possible to decrypt codes that identified service providers. They were unsuccessful, however, in decrypting patient IDs.
As a result, last year the Australian government proposed a change to the Privacy Act that would make it an offense to de-anonymize data sets. Although well intended, it's questionable in an age of anonymous public data dumps whether such a measure would prove an effective deterrent.
Edwards proposes that New Zealand's Privacy Act should have a provision that requires entities holding personal data to take adequate steps to anonymize it before public release. Also, the public "should have a means of redress if they suffer harm as a result of being re-identified from supposedly anonymous data," he writes.

The first person diagnosed with the Ebola virus in the U.S. wasn't appropriately treated for suspected infection until after a relative personally called the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, his nephew told NBC News on Wednesday night.
Health officials have acknowledged that Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, was initially sent home from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas when he showed up on Sept. 26 complaining of fever and abdominal pain. He had to return two days later in an ambulance.
That was the day "I called CDC to get some actions taken, because I was concerned for his life and he wasn't getting the appropriate care," Duncan's nephew, Josephus Weeks, told NBC News on Wednesday night. "I feared other people might also get infected if he wasn't taken care of, and so I called them to ask them why is it a patient that might be suspected of this disease was not getting appropriate care?"
Weeks added that he hoped "nobody else got infected because of a mistake that was made."
Configure Jupyter Notebook on Raspberry PI 2 for remote access and scala kernel install
Hi,
This is a continuation of the previous article regarding Jupyter Notebook (http://log-it.ro/2017/09/02/installing-jupyter-notebook-raspberry-pi-2/) Let's start with my modification in order to have an remote connection to it. It first needs a password in the form of password hash. To generate this pass run python cli and execute this code from IPython.lib import passwd;passwd(“your_custom_password”). Once you get the password hash, we can list the fields that i uncommented to activate minimal remote access:
c.NotebookApp.open_browser = False #do not open a browser on notebook start, you will access it by daemon remotely c.NotebookApp.ip = '*' #permite access on every interface of the server c.NotebookApp.password = u'[your_pass_has]' #setup password in order to access the notebook, otherwise token from server is required (if you want it this way you can get the token by running sudo systemctl status jupyter.service
You can also add them at the bottom of the file as well. In order for the changes to take effect you will need also to perform a service restart with sudo systemctl restart jupyter.service.
You have now the basic steps to run Jupyter Notebook with the IPython 2 kernel. Now lets's ger to the next step of installing the scala kernel(https://www.scala-lang.org).
The steps are pretty straight forward and they are taken from this link https://www.packtpub.com/mapt/book/big_data_and_business_intelligence/9781785884870/9/ch09lvl1sec65/installing-the-scala-kernel , what i tried is to put it end to end. I am not 100% sure if you need also java 8 but i installed it anyway, you will find the steps here https://www.raspinews.com/installing-oracle-java-jdk-8-on-raspberry-pi/ but what you really need to install is sbt.
The catch here is that you don't need to search for sbt on raspberry, just drop the default one, it will do the job. The steps are listed here http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Installing-sbt-on-Linux.html. Once it is installed you can return to the link listed above and just run the steps:
apt-get install git git clone https://github.com/alexarchambault/jupyter-scala.git cd jupyter-scala sbt cli/packArchive
Sbt will grab a lot of dependences, if you work with proxies i am not aware of the settings that you need to do, but you can search it and probably you find a solution. Have patience, it will take a while until it is done, but once it is done you can run ./jupyter-scala in order to install the kernel and also check if it works with jupyter kernelspec list.
Restart the Jupyter Notebook to update it, although i am not convinced if it's necessary 🙂
In my case i have a dynamic dns service from my internet provider but i think you can do it with a free dns provider on your router as well. An extra forward or NAT of port 8888 will be needed but once this is done you should have a playgroup in your browser that knows python and scala. Cool, isn't it?
Cheers
Okay, hypocrisy time. After I called out that Pink Dolphin Ferrari 458 Italia as the worst Ferrari paint job ever, you might think I also hate that EDM producer Deadmau5 wants to wrap his 458 in Nyan Cat livery. Except I don't because this is AMAZING.
As first reported over at Zero2Turbo, the Canadian purveyor of house music has indicated on his Instagram account that he is designing a 458 Italia wrap that will pay homage to one of the Internet's greatest memes, Nyan Cat, also known as Pop Tart Cat.
Maybe I'm biased because your Jalopnik staff listens to Nyan Cat on 10-hour repeat throughout the workday, and studies say that starts to kill brain cells after the eighth week or so, but I think this is great and I really, really hope he goes for it. It's ridiculous, immediately recognizable, and totally subversive. An Italian exotic painted up with a rainbow pop tart cat meme on the sides and hood? This absolutely needs to happen.
Do it, Deadmau5! Do it and send us the pictures when you're done!
Hat tip to Michael!
Sen. Rand Paul recently published a poll on Twitter asking, "Should the U.S. be selling $1.15 billion in arms to our unreliable 'ally' Saudi Arabia?"
This comes on the heels of a State Department announcement that the U.S. will be selling over $1 billion worth of tanks and other weapons to the U.S.'s ally in the Middle East.
Should the US be selling $1.15 billion in arms to our unreliable "ally" Saudi Arabia? — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) August 10, 2016
The poll concluded with 52,525 votes; 73 percent voted "Yes," and just 27 percent voted "No."
Many popular Saudi accounts urged their followers to vote in the poll, which dramatically shifted the results.

Morelia.— Don Leopoldo lleva 15 días retenido en uno de los puntos que integrantes de la Coordinadora Nacional de Trabajadores de la Educación (CNTE), normalistas y comunidades indígenas utilizan como trinchera y paradero de vehículos que se han apoderado para presionar a autoridades estatales y federales ante una posible solución al problema magisterial por la reforma educativa.
Desde el 26 de junio el número de vehículos retenidos en tres comunidades de la Meseta Purépecha llegó a 200, de los cuales cinco son pipas cargadas con material peligroso, reconocieron autoridades estatales.
Leopoldo no se queja por maltrato; extraña a sus hijos y se siente intranquilo, pues no le ve el fin a este conflicto. Don Polo —como lo llaman sus amigos— escucha música y nostálgico sabe que algún día regresará a casa: cuando decida abandonar su unidad o cuando este conflicto termine.
Las cifras oficiales precisan que cinco de las unidades retenidas contienen material peligroso; 142 son camionetas y vehículos de empresas privadas, agencias automotrices, ayuntamientos y gobierno estatal; hay un camión con cemento, dos madrinas (tráileres que transportan automóviles nuevos), contenedores de carga y 50 autobuses.
Entre ellos está el autobús de don Polo, de 45 años, quien se alimenta de lo que le ofrecen los profesores de la CNTE. Duerme en su camión, donde se la pasa gran parte del día.
Esto es parte de un plan de acciones —señala la CNTE— en contra de la reforma educativa y de la decisión “autónoma” de las comunidades indígenas y del Consejo General de Normales locales de sumarse a su lucha.
Este fin de semana jóvenes encapuchados, armados con piedras y palos, despojaron con violencia de sus vehículos a (dos) choferes de empresas privadas y a uno más de un camión para transporte de materiales.
Los agresores, que se identificaron como normalistas, interceptaron los vehículos sobre la carretera Pátzcuaro-Uruapan, donde días atrás habían incendiado tres autobuses, y bajaron de las unidades a los choferes. Tras la movilización policial, los abandonaron kilómetros adelante, en la comunidad de San Juan Tumbio.
Los normalistas se niegan a hablar. Tampoco dejan tomar imágenes del motín en Turícuaro, donde se han atrincherado bajo el escudo de la comunidad indígena de ese poblado.
Los estudiantes y habitantes de ese lugar boscoso han incendiado autobuses como sucedió el pasado 19 de julio sobre el kilómetro 21 de la carretera libre Pátzcuaro-Uruapan; ambos grupos también han tomado la Autopista Siglo 21 como campo de asalto. Reiteran haberse sumado a la lucha magisterial que encabeza la Sección 18.
Durante un recorrido por dos de los puntos, se constataron datos que autoridades revelaron a EL UNIVERSAL.
Tan sólo en Arantepacua, municipio de Nahuatzen, hay 85 vehículos retenidos; 101 en Turícuaro y 14 en Carapan, municipio de Chilchota. A pesar de que también aceptaron las autoridades que en la comunidad de Caltzontzin hay más unidades, dicen no tener las cifras aproximadas.
Maestros indígenas en la lucha. En Arantepacua, uno de los coordinadores del sector noveno del movimiento magisterial de educación indígena aceptó que como parte de su estrategia, detuvieron unidades de empresas nacionales y transnacionales.
Indicó que cerca de 45 comunidades indígenas respaldan estas movilizaciones que iniciaron a la par del plan de acciones general de la CNTE, porque consideran que la reforma educativa atenta en su contra.
El docente de profesión —que omitió su nombre— reiteró que las 45 comunidades indígenas son quienes financian sus movilizaciones y están dispuestas a levantarse en armas contra la aplicación de la reforma.
El representante magisterial dijo que hay una tregua con las autoridades hasta el próximo martes, cuando se reanude la mesa de diálogo CNTE-Segob; sin embargo, advirtió que radicalizarán sus movilizaciones en caso de no llegar a acuerdos, pues no permitirán que aplacen las soluciones a sus demandas; principalmente la abrogación de la reforma educativa.
Just a small update here based on feedback so far, there's a few changes/comments we'd like to make before going into beta. Several other issues are still being considered, but there's nothing new to share yet.Please do remember, this is an interim build where we're only taking balance changes with at most a small technical impact. Discussions on the overall direction/technical mechanics of engineers can be interesting and we do take them onboard, but they're not going to get done in this kind of build!We agree that beams have a limited set of good blueprint options, having fixed some related issues they're now getting Efficient and Overcharged available to them.The effect of Short Range reducing projectile speed and damage falloff wasn't really intended and we're taking the opportunity to correct that. Projectile velocity and damage falloff start will no longer be reduced (Long range continues to work as it does now and scales both of these values up). Short range is also getting a 5% damage increase so that its peak DPS is near-identical to Overcharged and Rapid Fire, you're just paying different tradeoffs.There have been some valid comments that we're somewhat repurposing Focused by removing the range modifier. We're aware this change might be a problem for players who crafted a Focused weapon specifically for the range increase. We're investigating what we can do with our existing tools to compensate players, but to help us gauge the scale of the problem we'd ask that anyone who currently has a Focused weapon who would now prefer Long Range to get in touch with Customer Support via a dedicated help topic: https://support.frontier.co.uk/open.php?topic=212 (please note that this is only for that one very specific issue and not general requests or other Blueprints). I can't make promises yet but we are looking into it.This one is worth re-stating, the goal here is NOT to force people to craft new modules. Unless you choose to explore the new options, which should never be a requirement. Yes we're reducing the power of Overcharged and Rapid Fire, but they're still the joint kings of DPS, there's no necessity to switch to another blueprint unless you now want something markedly different. On this subject the quality of feedback is paramount to getting good results. If there are modules that you feel you're gong to be forced to re-craft then please be specific in the feedback - for example useful information would be:Which Blueprint do you have now?What aspect of that blueprint does what you were after?On which base module?And most crucially - Which blueprint forces you to upgrade to it and why?
Here's the progress on the room system I've been making. This system splits up the map into different sections based on how they are connected. Here's the system artificially turned into colors so it can be seen in action:
.
There are still a few bugs. As you can see, the system thinks these two rooms are one room when connected by an angle piece. I must have some error in the fill algorithm which finds the boundaries of each room:
.
The system doesn't understand the big airlock doors yet, either.
As I mentioned in a previous post, this system will be used for several ships simulation features. I think my goal for this next update is going to be the ability to blow the airlock, exposing the ship to hard vacuum and blasting out its atmosphere. That seems like a fun feature, and it will also mix well with the fire – no oxygen means no combustion!
A couple who planned for a wedding after living together for five years, discovered they were brother and sister when their families met, The Daily Mail reported.
The woman in her ninth month of pregnancy is in a desperate state after learning that the father of her child is her brother, it reported.

The couple in South Africa met at university and were going to introduce themselves to their parents before they got married.
But when their families met, the two found out that they were brother and sister who had been separated when they were kids.
"Their parents separated when the woman was eight months old and the man was two years old," Sowetan Newspaper, one of the country's English newspapers, said.
"The man's father said he dumped his wife in 1983 because she was cheating on him. The girl was raised by her mother, while her brother was raised by his father," it added.
However, the couple said they had decided to end the relationship after hearing the news.
The Daily Mail reported that the tragic couple may have fallen in love due to the power of genetic sexual attraction.
"Genetic sexual attraction is a term that explains the phenomenon of sexual attraction between close relatives, such as sibling, first and second cousins or a parent and offspring who first meet as adult," The Daily Mail reported.
CHICAGO (CBS) — Eight people were killed and at least 43 others were wounded in shootings across Chicago between Friday evening and Monday morning, including a west suburban man fatally shot on a sidewalk near Millennium Park.
The downtown killing happened about 7:30 p.m. Saturday at the corner of Michigan Avenue and Monroe Street in the Loop, where 54-year-old Peter Fabbri was walking with two other people when he got into an argument with another male, who pulled out a gun and shot him in the head, according to Chicago Police and the Cook County medical examiner's office. Fabbri, a Berwyn resident, was taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where he died at 5:53 p.m. Sunday, authorities said. The shooter took off on a bicycle but was arrested nearby, police said. Detectives were still questioning him Sunday.
A person of interest is also in custody for the weekend's most recent homicide, which happened about 4:30 a.m. Sunday in the South Side Calumet Heights neighborhood. A 28-year-old man was shot in the neck in the 9200 block of South Colfax and pronounced dead at Trinity Hospital at 5:04 a.m., according to police and the medical examiner's office. The shooting was thought to be gang-related, but police have not released details on the circumstances.
About 7:25 p.m. Saturday, a 22-year-old man was shot to death in the Englewood neighborhood. He was outside looking at a vehicle in the 1500 block of West 56th Street when shots rang out and he was struck multiple times, police said. He was taken to Stroger Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Authorities have not released his name.
Earlier Saturday, a man was shot to death in the East Garfield Park neighborhood on the West Side. Officers responding to a call of a person down about 2:30 a.m. found the 37-year-old dead in the 2600 block of West Wilcox, police said. He was shot in the head and pronounced at the scene. His name has not been released.
Less than 30 minutes earlier, a man was killed and a woman wounded in Gage Park on the Southwest Side. They were outside at 2:10 a.m. in the 2200 block of West 50th Street when a vehicle pulled up and a gunman got out and opened fire, hitting 20-year-old Jose Vizcarra in the head and a 24-year-old woman in the foot, according to police and the medical examiner's office. Vizcarra, of the 400 block of North Hamlin, was dead at the scene, authorities said. The woman was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital in fair condition.
Friday night, a 19-year-old man was killed and a 20-year-old man critically wounded in another Englewood neighborhood shooting. A gunman walked up to them about 8 p.m. in the 5600 block of South Racine and opened fire, hitting Izael McKenzie in the head and the older man in the back, authorities said. Both were taken to Stroger Hospital, where McKenzie died at 8:44 p.m. He lived in the 5600 block of South Throop. The other man was in critical condition, police said.
About 5:35 p.m. Friday, 21-year-old Joaquin Gonzalez was shot in the chest and pronounced dead at the scene in the 2600 block of West Haddon in the Humboldt Park neighborhood on the West Side, authorities said. Police have not provided details on the circumstances of the shooting, but an autopsy ruled Gonzalez's death a homicide. He lived in the 7700 block of South Peoria.
The weekend's first fatal shooting came 10 minutes before that in the Auburn Gresham neighborhood on the South Side, where someone chased 56-year-old Carl Jackson into his apartment building in the 1000 block of West 77th Street and shot him repeatedly, authorities said. Jackson died at the scene.
The most recent nonfatal shooting happened about 3:30 a.m. Monday in the Wicker Park neighborhood. A 23-year-old man was sitting in the back seat of a vehicle in the 2000 block of West Pierce, when he heard gunfire and felt pain, police said. He was shot in the right side of his torso and taken to Stroger Hospital, where his condition was stabilized.
At least 40 more people were shot in other city attacks between 4:15 p.m. Friday and 11:30 p.m. Sunday.

Something is wrong at Newsweek, and whoever is in charge over there needs to get a handle on the situation.
Its most recent misstep occurred this week when its social media team tweeted this misleading headline: "Fact check: No, the Clintons were not paid millions by Russia."
The accompanying article proves nothing of the sort.
The supposed fact check comes in response to a tweet this week from President Trump that read, "Russia sent millions to Clinton Foundation."
.@foxandfriends "Russia sent millions to Clinton Foundation" — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 19, 2017
He is not wrong, and the Newsweek article acknowledges as much.
It acknowledges that former President Bill Clinton received a generous $500,000 speaking fee in 2010 from a Kremlin-linked bank with ties to Uranium One, a Canadian uranium company that had mines in the U.S. The Newsweek article also acknowledges a separate New York Times report that showed Uranium One's chairman donated approximately $2.35 million to the Clinton Foundation in four separate installments as his company was being acquired by a Russian nuclear energy firm called Rosatom.
There's more from the Times report, and none of it reflects well on the Clintons:
As the Russians gradually assumed control of Uranium One in three separate transactions from 2009 to 2013, Canadian records show, a flow of cash made its way to the Clinton Foundation. Uranium One's chairman used his family foundation to make four donations totaling $2.35 million. Those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons, despite an agreement Mrs. Clinton had struck with the Obama White House to publicly identify all donors. Other people with ties to the company made donations as well.
The only thing the Newsweek fact check disputes is whether the millions paid had anything to do with Rosatom's successful efforts to secure approval from the State Department to acquire Uranium One. The U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment gave the go-ahead in October 2010, handing the Russian state-owned nuclear agency control of 20 percent of the uranium in America.
It's unclear whether the Russian cash given to the Clinton Foundation had anything to do with Bill Clinton's attempts in 2010 to facilitate meetings with Rosatom executives. It's also unclear whether the payments had anything to do with his decision to meet privately with Russian President Vladimir Putin that same year.
But this is still a long way off from, "Fact check: No, the Clintons were not paid millions by Russia."
Aggravatingly enough, the headline that appears on Newsweek's website is evenhanded and reasonable. It reads simply, "Did Russia Send Money to Bill Clinton's foundation like Trump says? Fact-checking the president's claim." It's the social media version of this headline that's atrocious.
That said, like the tweeted headline, the body of the fact check also makes claims that it can't quite back, including, "president is stretching the truth about the Clinton Foundation and money it received."
Well, perhaps. But the Clinton Foundation did take in millions from the Russians. That's what the president tweeted.
Here's how the Newsweek fact check concludes, "Yes, the foundation received money and Bill Clinton was paid to give a speech, but there's no evidence the Clintons were paid by Russians to push through the uranium deal."
This is correct, and it'd probably be devastating were it a thing the president actually said. But he didn't quite say that.
He implied it, sure. But what's the use of fact checking things that haven't been said?
Note: Author of this article is Jiang En, president of the Dogecoin Chinese Association.
We all want Dogecoin to be a success, but are you willing to donate your time and effort to promote the usage of Dogecoin?
I always notice three common traits that makes someone extraordinary. They set a clear goal, they act without hesitation, they put time and effort.
Likewise, a successful coin must have its own unique features.
Firstly, it needs a clear goal. The Dogecoin community focuses on tipping culture and charity and wishes to improve the well-being of human life.
Secondly, we must act! Each and every Dogecoin fan should work to combine his or her own line of business with Dogecoin and promote its usage in everyday life.
Thirdly, promote with a plan. At present, there is no “legal” room for the cryptocurrency industry and the general public tend not to accept something that is not legally recognized. I attended a conference this June in Shanghai and found it hard to believe that only about 1% of the attendees have heard of crypto. Sadly, for those who know something about tokens, all they know is that the country has banned tokens and they are absolute no-nos.
Many crypto holders alienate themselves from the rest of the community in the belief that one coin is far superior to another. But they fail to realize that there are only several million people hold crypto in the world. The number of industrial players of any business could surpass that number. And among these holders, how many of them are dedicated to promoting the usages of cryptocurrency? I'd say most of them are just speculators and blind followers. They wish price go high when they hold a coin and curse a coin when price go down.
The cryptocurrency is a big family. If you don't like the community, you are welcomed to leave. The ecosystem is still in its infant stage. It could THRIVE or CRASH. If you only care about money, then don't blame others when you lose. Some people are really sick. They spread good news when hold Dogecoin in hopes of price going up. But when they lose money, they spread all rumors and negative news to short Dogecoin.
I hope everyone can realize that Dogecoin has its own culture and it cannot be replaced. I will push myself harder to talk Dogecoin to people outside the community and reach out to the world. I know that I will meet people who have doubts, who hold different opinions. But none of them are unconquerable. We cannot use money to bribe strangers or beg them to use Dogecoin. We could only use our charisma and passion to let them believe we are doing something big here. And there will always be a small part of people choose to believe us and recognize our effort to change the world for better.
If you sincerely love the community like I do, please donate your time and effort to join us.
What a day for Bitcoin.
24 hours ago the cryptocurrency was trading below $3,700. About an hour ago it surged passed $4,000 and has no signs of stopping. It's now trading around $4,135.00. For reference, a week ago Bitcoin hit an all-time high as it passed $3,000 for the first time.
Check out the chart below to see what the price has done in the last 24 hours.
So the million dollar bitcoin question is…why now?
Without wasting too much of your Saturday night with detailed analysis, here are a few possible reasons you can tell your friends during brunch tomorrow.
Two weeks ago Bitcoin went through a hard fork, and came out essentially unscathed. Sure, a bitcoin-clone called Bitcoin Cash was created, but it's gotten a lot less attention than most people expected. A few days later Bitcoin locked in SegWit, a code modification that fixes malleability issues and frees up space in blocks, allowing for more transactions to be stored in each one.
These two code-related developments have helped boost conference in Bitcoin's future.
Another reason – the ICO frenzy. The amount recently raised via initial coin offerings have now (at least temporally) topped amount raised via early stage venture capital. Just last week Filecoin raised $180 million in a few hours. Most investors have to convert fiat currency to bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to participate in ICOs, which could be driving up the price (and providing some investors with their first taste of bitcoin).
Another reason – Wall Street's new obsession is bitcoin. You can't watch CNBC for five minutes without seeing a trader or analyst give their opinion – which is usually something insanely bullish like “it's going to be the best performing investment of the year”. For better or for worse, statements like these are getting non-technically inclined investors interested in bitcoin, some of which are definitely buying coins for the first time.
So what happens next? No one knows. Bitcoin could crash 50% to $2,000 tomorrow or spike to $5,000 – and I don't think anyone who truly knows crypto would be surprised at either option. Everyone has a different opinion – some say the bubble is oversized and should have popped months ago – others think that bitcoin is currently just a fraction of what it could eventually trade at.
Whichever camp you fall in, here's one friendly reminder: don't invest more than you can afford to lose – because if you ask anyone who's spent more than a few months in the cryptocurrency world they'll tell you it's a roller coaster.
Nintendo released an enhanced GamePad battery in Japan a few weeks ago. How does it perform? Japanese publication Game Watch put the new battery to the test earlier this month
The original GamePad battery was sitting at 1500mAh, but the new large-capacity battery pack is about 1.7 times stronger at 2550mAh. And whereas the original had an operating time of about 3-5 hours, the new one is said to last between 5-8 hours.
Game Watch set the GamePad's brightness to the highest point, all power-saving methods were turned off, vibration was turned on, and Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate's opening movie was played on full blast. In this state, Dengeki measured the amount of time until the controller powered down from a complete depletion of battery life.
The results were pretty encouraging, as the GamePad lasted 5 hours and 12 minutes. Previously, the original battery would last about 3 hours in this state.
We should mention that the size of the battery pack is about 1.5 times bigger than the original, so where the original sits vertically in the back of the GamePad, the newer and bigger battery fits perfectly sideways. It just barely fits into the back of the controller.

Maine lawmakers were hoping to give their state an official day of spring cleaning — this Saturday, in fact. But their notoriously irascible governor was having none of it.
In a simple, one-sentence bill, Republican Rep. Nathan Wadsworth proposed that the first Saturday of each May be designated “Maine Community Litter Cleanup Day.” The governor would also issue a proclamation encouraging residents to do something like pick up trash off the side of the road.
Seemed easy enough. The bill quietly passed in both the Maine House and Senate last month with overwhelming bipartisan support. Then it reached the desk of Gov. Paul LePage.

LePage vetoed the bill.
The Republican governor has never been shy about flaunting his unparalleled record of, as he sees it, protecting taxpayers from bad legislation. But his veto message Friday went to particular lengths to slap down the proposed litter cleanup day as “unnecessary” and “not practical.”
According to LePage, the melting snow would wash away trash in the spring anyway. But first, he had a broader point to make about the very real issue of creeping commemorative days.
“During my many years as Governor I have noticed that there are around 50 commemorative days on the Maine calendar many of which seek to force to issue proclamations,” LePage wrote.
Indeed, LePage does not like issuing proclamations, according to Wadsworth, the litter cleanup day bill's lead sponsor.
“He feels like it's busy work that cuts into his time,” the Hiram lawmaker told Boston.com in an interview Tuesday.
But that wasn't LePage's only criticism.
“Frankly, I think this bill is unnecessary,” the governor wrote. “I do not believe that Mainers need me to proclaim a special day for them to understand that it is good citizenship to not litter, and to clean up their communities.”
Furthermore, even if he was in favor of a litter cleanup day, LePage said he thought it would be better timed for the fall “before the arrival of snow and its subsequent thaw.”

“During the thaw, litter is known to be washed away,” he wrote. “Because of this, I do not think that that [sic] the bill is practical.”
Wadsworth says the bill was timed to correspond with Vermont and New Hampshire, which already observe statewide litter cleanup days on the first Saturday of May.
As for the governor's claim that the winter thaw will take care of litter in the spring, Wadsworth said that isn't quite how it works.
“Clearly it doesn't” he said, adding that the snow or wind only moves the trash into a different location. The only way litter is truly addressed, he said, is by people.
The Maine House voted to override LePage's veto Tuesday by a vote of 109-36.
The Senate is expected to vote on a possible veto override Thursday, according to Wadsworth. If at least two-thirds of legislators approve in the upper chamber as well, LePage will be forced to proclaim Saturday the first annual “Maine Community Litter Cleanup Day” — whether he likes it or not.

So, what's up with Europe?

What is the State of the Union speech?
European Commission President José Manuel Barroso has delivered a State of the Union speech similar in style to that of the US President for the past three years. Addressing the European Parliament the Commission President talks about his visions for Europe and reveals new action plans for the year ahead.
When is the State of the Union speech?
The fourth State of the Union speech will take place at the European Parliament in Strasbourg at 9 am CET. The address is then followed by a general debate on the political State of the Union.
Follow JM Barroso's live interview and Hangout here
Why is this State of the Union speech significant?
EU institutions have been accused of being undemocratic, unrepresentative and disconnected from European citizens. The speech and ensuing debate in the European Parliament is meant to help counter that perception, enhance transparency and add a certain level of accountability to the Presidency. The debate in parliament gives MEPs a chance to publicly grill Mr Barroso on his past or intended actions. This year's speech is particularly significant as it is likely to be President Barroso's last and for many will be held as an assessment of his time in office. It is believed unlikely that he will run for a third term – if he does not his mandate will run until October 2014.
What's at stake this year?
With the EU still flailing in the throes of an economic crisis the speech has not made for easy listening. But finally, this year, there are a few silver linings: some much-needed reforms in the wake of the crisis have been implemented and Europe's economies are showing tentative signs of a long-awaited return to growth. But there is still plenty to be worried about, not least long jobless queues with the young facing a particularly worrying future as well as a sustained crisis of confidence in the EU as a whole.
Who is President José Manuel Barroso?
Though President José Manuel Barroso may not be a household name, he is arguably one of the most influential people in Europe. The former Portuguese Prime Minister determines EU policy and legislative proposals, has the power to hire, fire or reshuffles his Commission and as one of the main European players can represent the EU abroad. He has been at the helm of the European Commission since 2004.

The Danish government has decided to withdraw seven F-16 fighter jets, which took part in an operation of the international coalition against the Islamic State terrorist group in Syria and Iraq.
The Danish authorities intend to withdraw seven F-16 fighter jets, which took part in an operation of the international coalition against the Islamic State (IS) terrorist group in Syria and Iraq, the RIA Novosti news agency reported.
A military commission, which investigated incidents of the US, reported that Danish aircraft participated in an airstrike of the coalition on September 17, when a number of Syrian soldiers were killed.
Danish Foreign Minister Anders Samuelsen and Defense Minister Claus Hjort Frederiksen decided to withdraw the fighter jets after publication of these data. Reportedly, the aircraft will return to the country in mid-December.
At the same time, the Danish government announced that it is going to expand its assistance to Iraq in counseling on engineering and construction works, which will be carried out by about 150 specialists.
As it is known, warplanes of the Danish Air Force started to carry out airstrikes on IS terrorists in Syria and Iraq within the framework of the operation of the US-led coalition in August of the last year.
On September 17, fighter jets of the international coalition bombed Syrian troops, who were surrounded by IS terrorists in the area of the Deir ez-Zor airport. As a result of the four airstrikes, 83 soldiers were killed, while more than 100 others were wounded.

The controversy at an exclusive Maryland country club over whether to allow President Obama to join took a new turn when a member resigned Monday.
Jeffrey Slavin, a local mayor, dropped his membership on Martin Luther King Jr. Day because of the controversy, saying he could “no longer belong to a community” with such “intolerance.”
“I can no longer belong to a community,” Slavin wrote in an email to the general manager of the club.
“Where Intolerance is accepted, Where History is forgotten, Where Freedom of Speech is denied, And where the nation's first black president is disrespected,” said Slavin, the mayor of Somerset, Maryland.
Slavin thanked the club for “many great memories” and signed his email, “Stay Woke.”
A copy of the email was obtained by the Washington Post.
As first reported by the New York Post, the controversy at the Woodmont Country Club, a predominantly Jewish club, stems from Obama's controversial positions and actions regarding Israel, which have angered many members, including liberal Democrats.
A number of members have moved to block the president's entry — with some threatening legal action if he's admitted.
Membership to Woodmont is pricey — $80,000 to be initiated and nearly $10,000 in annual fees.
The final results from the latest Talk Business & Politics-Hendrix College Poll indicate strong support among Arkansas voters for medical marijuana.
The issue was on the 2012 ballot, but narrowly failed. In 2016, there may be competing medical marijuana proposals in the November general election. In the latest survey, conducted June 21, 2016 among 751 likely Arkansas voters, respondents were asked:
Q: In November, a proposal to allow the use of medical marijuana may be on the Arkansas ballot. It would provide Arkansans the ability to use medical marijuana for serious debilitating medical conditions with a doctor's recommendation by allowing patients to purchase their medicine at a regulated not-for-profit dispensary. If the election were held today, would you vote to allow for medical marijuana sales?
58% Support
34% Oppose
8% Don't Know
ANALYSIS
Dr. Jay Barth, professor of political science at Hendrix College, helped craft and analyze the latest poll. He offered this analysis of the poll results:
Going back to the 2012 election cycle when medical marijuana first popped up on the policy agenda in Arkansas, we have polled the issue a number of times. Polling this week reiterates that Arkansans appear ready for the medical use of marijuana to become public policy in Arkansas as the survey shows a comfortable lead (58% to 34%) for such a measure. This survey asked about the broad concept of a medical marijuana ballot measure and describes the creation of dispensaries to distribute the regulated marijuana. Support for such a ballot measure is generally strong across demographic, political, and geographic groups. Certain groups of voters are especially supportive of the measure. Democrats (74% support), African-Americans (73% support), Second Congressional District residents (65% support), and those aged 30 to 44 (73%) are all disproportionately supportive. Still, the concept leads among all groups of Arkansas voters with only one exception: the state's Republican voters. Even with that group, the proposal is tied (45% support and 45% opposition). It is noteworthy that a chunk of voters seems concerned about making laws at the ballot box at all; our survey last September showed an even larger 84% of Arkansans agree that adults should be allowed to use physician-prescribed marijuana. While these numbers would seem to bode well for medical marijuana advocates, the challenge is that there are two competing measures moving towards the fall ballot. Thus, the next few weeks will be crucial as petition signatures are counted for both an initiated act that includes a “grow your own” provision (up to 10 plants) for those living over 20 miles from a “cannabis care center” and a constitutional amendment that lacks that component. Although either (or both) may not get over the hurdles (having the sufficient number of valid signatures, etc.) to get there, both achieving the ballot would likely cause problems for the concept of medical marijuana because they would not only have to compete with one another, but would also have opposition from groups like the Arkansas Family Council that have already spoken out against the broadening of access to marijuana. Moreover, national groups interested in supporting medical marijuana in Arkansas might well be stymied by having to choose between the competing measures.
POLL METHODOLOGY
This survey was conducted on Tuesday, June 21, 2016. The poll, which has a margin of error of +/-3.6%, was completed using IVR survey technology among 751 Arkansas frequent voters statewide.

The majority of German citizens believe their security and finances are threatened because of the current refugee crisis, the German magazine Focus Online writes.

The German population is becoming increasingly skeptical toward Germany's policy of open doors. Every second German believes that the refugee crisis cannot be overcome, while 48 percent of the population stated they are afraid of refugees, a recent ARD survey reveals.
In 2015 more than one million refugees entered Germany, fleeing violence and poverty in their home countries. Despite overburdened municipalities and crowded refugee facilities, German Chancellor Angela Merkel optimistically repeated her credo: "We can do this".
However, the most recent polls reveal that this optimism in Germany is decreasing. 51% of Germans believe that their country won't be able to resolve the current refugee crisis, Focus Online writes.
The skepticism among the population has especially risen after the massive attacks on women on New Year's Eve in Cologne and other German cities. Hundreds of women were reportedly robbed, threatened and sexually assaulted by small groups of aggressive men, allegedly mostly of Arab and North African origin.
Besides security concerns, 85% of Germans are afraid that they will lose material wealth because of the current migration crisis, a recent survey conducted by the consulting firm Ernst & Young showed.
"The refugee crisis has been the main subject in the debates and the media coverage in this country for several months," EY representative Thomas Harms told the German magazine Focus. As a result, this issue becomes more important for people than in fact it should be, the expert claimed.

The current financial situation in the country seems to be stable. Low unemployment rates, low inflation, rising salaries and cheap energy prices demonstrate positive changes in the socioeconomic field compared with the previous year.
Despite this, German consumers access their own financial situation for 2016 as pessimistic. Many of them don't fear job losses, small pensions or illness. However, they remain anxious about more global issues such as the economic slowdown, environmental pollution, the debt crisis in Europe, and the current refugee crisis, which was assessed by the European Commission as the worst migration crisis since WWII.
Gawker reported yesterday, with a clear intention to make the reader think the whole thing is silly, that AlternativePAC, an uncoordinated PAC supporting the Libertarian Party presidential campaign of Gary Johnson and William Weld, spent $30,000 on "internet web memes."
The PAC has, as of its last legal filing at the end of June, pulled in $530,100, with $500,000 of it from California tomato magnate Chris Rufer.
Matt Kibbe, who runs the PAC, stresses that what they were paying for with that $30,000 is more like short viral-ready internet videos than "memes" in the common internet sense of poster images with slogans. He defends that tactic for PACs trying to run lean, nimble, and most importantly meaningful campaigns in the modern age of social networking.
"The way social media works is to microtarget audiences and test things," Kibbe said in a phone interview today. That $30,000 Gawker called attention to will result in "dozens" of such short videos over the next few months, using different imagery and different messages for different audiences, from "disaffected Sanders voters on war to disaffected Cruz voters on rule of law."
AlternativePAC's strategy will be to "leverage social media and make sure would-be libertarians in social space know Gary Johnson is on the ballot and understand what libertarianism is about. It doesn't make any sense to run TV ads to connect to that audience" and it is that audience his PAC wants to reach, Kibbe says. "People who report on media buys" as if it's still the 20th century and imply that mere "internet memes" are silly or pointless "don't quite get that," he says.
While Gawker claimed no such product yet existed, Kibbe directed me to his PACs website, where two of them can be found.
And here they are on YouTube, the first one saying a vote for Trump or Clinton puts blood on the voters' hands:
The second has no specific policy point to make, but analogizes the major party choices to just two narrow flavors, and points out there is a third choice:
UPDATE: And what can videos on the internet win you? Why, the support of actress Melissa Joan "Sabrina/Clarissa" Hart. (Though not either of these specific AlternativePAC vids.)
China continues to be a significant military and cybersecurity threat that will require the United States to adapt and change to counter such threats.
Those were but a couple of the conclusions from the Department of Defense 's wide-ranging "Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China 2012" annual report to Congress about the status of China and its burgeoning power to influence world events, for better or worse.
In the news: The SpaceX blast into history
In the world of cyber espionage and cyber warfare the report stated: "In 2011, computer networks and systems around the world continued to be targets of intrusions and data theft, many of which originated within China. Although some of the targeted systems were US government-owned, others were commercial networks owned by private companies whose stolen data represents valuable intellectual property. In the hands of overseas competitors, this information could diminish commercial and technological advantages earned through years of hard work and investment."
Some of the more interesting observation from the report included:
Authoritative writings and China's persistent cyber intrusions indicates the likelihood that Beijing is using cyber network operations (CNOs) as a tool to collect strategic intelligence.
In parallel with its military preparations, China has increased diplomatic engagement and advocacy in multilateral and international forums where cyber issues are discussed and debated.
Beijing's agenda is frequently in line with Russia's efforts to promote cyber norms under a UN framework. In September 2011, China and Russia were the primary sponsors of an Information Security Code of Conduct that would have governments exercise sovereign authority over the flow of information in cyberspace. China has not yet accepted that existing mechanisms (such as the Law of Armed Conflict), apply in cyberspace. However, China's thinking in this area may evolve as its own exposure increases through greater investment in global networks.
Chinese actors are the world's most active and persistent perpetrators of economic espionage. Chinese attempts to collect U.S. technological and economic information will continue at a high level and will represent a growing and persistent threat to U.S. economic security. " The nature of the cyber threat will evolve with continuing technological advances in the global information environment.
Sensitive U.S. economic information and technology are targeted by intelligence services, private sector companies, academic/research institutions, and citizens of dozens of countries. China is likely to remain an aggressive and capable collector of sensitive U.S. economic information and technologies, particularly in cyberspace.
China's influence in space was also targeted in the report: "China is expanding its space-based surveillance, reconnaissance, navigation, meteorological, and communications satellite constellations. China continues to build the Bei-Dou (Compass) navigation satellite constellation with the goal of establishing a regional network by the end of 2012 and a global network by 2020.
In other news: The fantastic world of steampunk technology
Again, some of the more interesting observations included:
China launched the Tiangong space station module in September 2011 and a second communications relay satellite (the Tianlian1B), which will enable near real-time transfer of data to ground stations from manned space capsules or orbiting satellites.
China continues to develop the Long March V rocket, which will more than double the size of the low Earth and geosynchronous orbit payloads that China will be capable of placing into orbit. In parallel, the PRC is developing a multidimensional program to limit or deny the use of space-based assets by adversaries during times of crisis or conflict.
In addition to the direct-ascent anti-satellite weapon tested in 2007, these counter-space capabilities also include jamming, laser, microwave, and cyber weapons. Over the past two years, China has also conducted increasingly complex close proximity operations between satellites while offering little in the way of transparency or explanation.
China's space and counter-space programs are facing some challenges in systems reliability. Communication satellites using China's standard satellite launch platform, the DFH-4, have experienced failures leading to reduced lifespan or loss of the satellite. The recent surge in the number of China's space launches also may be taking its toll. In August 2011, in the third satellite launch in seven days for China, a Long March 2C rocket (carrying an experimental Shijian 11 satellite), malfunctioned after liftoff and failed to deliver the satellite into orbit.

The days of Pres. Obama being called the "Deporter-in-Chief" are long over. Overall removals are way down and removals of illegal aliens from the interior by Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) agents are down 70% from the early years of the Administration.
Why such a decline?
A Senate panel heard the answer Thursday from Thomas Homan, Executive Associate Director for ICE's Enforcement And Removal Operations. He said the decline is a result of both the Administration's executive actions issued in 2012 and 2014 and the existence of sanctuary jurisdictions.
"There are a number of reasons why the numbers are down," Homan said and listed them.
"Sanctuary cities"
"Jurisdictions not honoring my detainers"
"The Trust Act [2013 California law limiting holds on illegal aliens]"
"In 2012, John Morton, the Assistant Secretary of ICE, issued a policy in who we issue detainers on. Virtually took Level 3s off the table. This is a law-abiding society, so most crimes are Level 3."
" Executive actions. Executive actions have narrowed my target pool down."
EXECUTIVE ACTIONS RESPONSBILE
Then, there was this exchange between Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) and Homan.
SESSIONS: Isn't it true that ICE gets calls every single day from police officers all across America that are not Sanctuary Cities and you're not responding to them because they don't meet the guidelines or the priorities established by the President? HOMAN: That is true. SESSIONS: So it's not true then that the reason your numbers are down is because you don't have people to deport. You have them to deport, but you have policies that tell you not to deport whole categories that are here unlawfully. Isn't that correct? HOMAN: That's a factor, yes sir.
Homan made it a point to praise the men and women of ICE, and their commitment to the "mission". Of course, he's not allowed to comment on his opinion of Pres. Obama's policies, so we don't know where he, a career ICE agent stands, but morale among ICE agents is among the lowest of all federal employees, which would lead one to believe that the agents don't necessarily agree with the Administration's policies.
UNION CHIEF SAYS BORDER PATROL RELEASES ALMOST EVERYONE
Border Patrol Union President Brandon Judd also testified and shed further light on the Administration's policies, specifically its catch-and-release policies. According to Judd, the Border Patrol releases almost every illegal alien it comes into contact with -- even if the alien has a criminal history.
"The second part of the catch-and-release program is releasing people without NTAs [Notices to Appear]. This is actually the most disconcerting part. We can actually arrest somebody with an actual criminal arrest record here in the United States, and if it does not meet these priority guidelines, we have to walk them out the door if they've been here since, if they claim to have been here (his emphasis), since January of 2014, we have to walk them out our door. And we don't even issue them an NTA. In effect, we're saying stay in the country as long as you want."
Judd went on to say that anyone caught crossing the border illegally who is not from Mexico is released by the Border Patrol and that approximately 80% of Mexicans who are caught crossing the border illegally are released. Again, all of this is not a reflection on the men and women of the Border Patrol or of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. It's all under the direction of the Obama Administration.
Civil Rights icon and Chair of the last bipartisan Commission on Immigration, Barbara Jordan, once told Congress, "Credibility in immigration policy can be summed up in one sentence: those who should get in, get in; those who should be kept out, are kept out; and those who should not be here will be required to leave."
The Obama Administration has sent a message to the world that unless you're convicted of a violent crime, you'll never be required to leave.

FORTUNE—I was wholly uninterested in Twitter. Frankly, I thought it was dumb. It was November 2006, and I had gone to interview Ev Williams.
Already a serial entrepreneur, Williams had become something of a Silicon Valley rebel. He was speaking publicly about turning his back on venture capitalists. Bruised by the failure of his latest startup, Odeo, Williams put his money were his mouth was and did something unheard of: he dipped into his pocket to buy back Odeo from its venture investors to the tune of $2 million (Williams had sold his earlier company, Pyra Labs, to Google, for a much larger sum). Williams renamed it the Obvious Corporation and said he would use it incubate “sustainable” companies. Mostly free from investor pressures, he said such companies would be more fun and allow for more creativity.
MORE: What Twitter is worth today
Williams' rebuke of the Valley's entrepreneurship model had made him something of a cause celebre and I wanted to write about that for The New York Times, where I worked at the time. Williams greeted me at the door of his South Park offices in San Francisco, and took me upstairs to discuss his thoughts on entrepreneurship. As we talked, he insisted on showing me Twitter, one of Obvious' first projects. Spawned at Odeo, Twitter's assets returned to Williams' control when he repurchased the startup.
I kept asking Williams to talk about his ideas for Obvious. He kept coming back to Twitter, which he thought had potential. He pulled out a feature phone to show me how it worked. I was unimpressed. The number of users — I believed it was in the thousands — was unimpressive, even for a service that was only a few months old. And anyway, why would anyone need a new way to communicate online?
MORE: Twitter's $1 billion question
Williams said Twitter was perfect for the Obvious model. It was small, not mature, and only needed a handful of people. But, exactly what was it, I asked? “It's a blogging app but it is all about quick little updates,” he said. It's for “real time blogging,” he added. Twitter barely got a mention in my Times story, where I described it as a “blogging-like tool for quick updates.”
Williams was wrong. Twitter would need VC funding. I was far more wrong, though, and I refused to admit it for almost two years. I began tweeting in August 2008.

Saint Gobnait (fl. 6th century?), also known as Gobnat or Mo Gobnat or Abigail or Deborah, is the name of a medieval, female Irish saint whose church was Móin Mór, later Bairnech, in the village of Ballyvourney (Irish: Baile Bhuirne), County Cork in Ireland.[1] She was associated with the Múscraige and her church and nunnery lay on the borders between the Múscraige Mittine and Eóganacht Locha Léin.[1] Her feast day is 11 February.
Sources [ edit ]
No hagiographical Life is known to have described her life and miracles, but she appears in the Life of her senior companion St Abbán moccu Corbmaic,[1] written in the early 13th century but known only through later recensions. Saint Finbarr's Life implies that Gobnait's church belonged to Finbarr's foundation at Cork by alleging that it was not founded by her, but by one of his disciples.[1] In spite of this, Gobnait's cult continued to thrive here and the ruins of a medieval church dedicated to her are still visible today.[1]
The Félire Óengusso and the Martyrology of Donegal give her feast-day on 11 February.[1]
"Mo Gobnat from Muscraige Mitaine, i.e. a sharp-beaked nun, Ernaide is the name of the place in which she is. Or Gobnat of Bairnech in Món Mór in the south of Ireland, and of the race of Conaire she is; a virgin of Conaire's race" – Note to the Félire Óengusso, tr. Whitley Stokes, p. 73
Life [ edit ]
Gobnait was born in County Clare in the 5th or 6th Century, and is said to have been the sister of Saint Abban. She fled a family feud, taking refuge in Inis Óir in the Aran Islands.[2] Here an angel appeared and told her that this was "not the place of her resurrection" and that she should look for a place where she would find nine white deer grazing. She found the deer at the place now known as St. Gobnet's Wood. Saint Abban is said to have worked with her on the foundation of the convent and to have placed Saint Gobnait over it as abbess.
Celtic lore held bees in high esteem, believing the soul left the body as a bee or a butterfly. Gobnait is said to have added beekeeping to her life's work, developing a lifelong affinity with them. She started a religious order and dedicated her days to helping the sick. It has been speculated that she used honey as a healing aid.[3] She is credited with saving the people at Ballyvourney from the plague.[2]
Legends [ edit ]
Harry Clarke 's design drawing for the Saint Gobnait window in Honan Chapel , Cork, Ireland (1914). The bottom of design features the story of Gobnait driving off the brigand.
One story tells of how she drove off a brigand by sending a swarm of bees after him and making him restore the cattle he had stolen.[2]
Well [ edit ]
St Gobnait's well (also known as St Debora's, Deriola's or Abigail's well) is situated to the North of Ballyagran in a high field to the left of the road to Castletown. Rounds were made and a pattern was held on 11 February until around 1870. The well has now dried up but the site is still known. It is said that a white stag could sometimes be seen at the well.[4]
Veneration [ edit ]
In 1601 Pope Clement VIII granted a special indulgence to those who, on Gobnait's day, visited the parish church, went to Confession and Communion and who prayed for peace among 'Christian princes', expulsion of heresy and the exaltation of the church.[5]
Gobnait was originally a patron of ironworkers. Excavation at the church in Ballyvourney yielded considerable evidence of ironworking on the site.[6]
The saint is still locally venerated today,[1] and is among a group of Irish saints whose feast day has been given national rather than just local recognition. The main centres of devotion to Gobnait are Inis Oírr (Aran Islands), Dún Chaoin in West Kerry and Balleyvourney near the Cork / Kerry border.[5] She is depicted on a stained glass window at Honan Chapel in Cork, which was made by artist Harry Clarke in 1916.[7]
Former churches dedicated to Gobnait are commemorated in townlands and other places named Kilgobnet (Irish: Cill Ghobnait "church of Gobnait"): in counties Kerry (near Milltown[5] and Dunquin[8]), Waterford (near Dungarvan), Limerick (in Ballyagran), and Cork (near Glantane, Dripsey, and Clondrohid).[9]

KUCHING: The state cabinet will be announced on Thursday after the seven-day mourning period is over, according to a reliable source.
Chief Minister Datuk Amar Abang Johari Tun Openg will have to reshuffle the cabinet line-up as he is expected to take over the Finance and Natural Resources ministries – posts previously held by the late Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Adenan Satem.
This would entail him vacating the Housing and Urbanisation as well as Tourism, Arts and Culture ministries under him, which would have to be filled.
There is no indication on how the new ministerial line-up would look like but it is almost certain that PBB senior vice-president and Second Minister of Resource Planning an Environment Datuk Amar Awang Tengah Ali Hasan will be promoted to deputy chief minister to take over the post Abang Johari has vacated.
It is likely that some assistant ministers could be promoted to full ministers to take over the portfolios vacated by the new chief minister – triggering more changes in the cabinet.
Ian Harkes (Wake Forest Athletics)
Ian Harkes was too young in the 1990s to capture memories of his father in a D.C. United uniform. Videos, photos and stories, both written and told, have filled in the blanks. The ties that bind father and son to the MLS organization, however, have run constant through the years. And with his signature on a legal document, Ian has followed in John's determined footsteps.
On Monday, 20 years and three months after his father captained the first MLS Cup championship team, Ian Harkes became a second-generation United midfielder. With a multiyear contract finalized over the weekend, the Gonzaga High School and Wake Forest graduate reported to RFK Stadium for the first day of training camp.
“It's funny,” he said, “how it comes full circle.”
[United set to open training camp with a familiar look]
The Harkes become MLS's seventh rostered father-son connection. Alex and Teal Bunbury were the first (2010).
Ian Harkes, 21, won the Hermann Trophy this past season as college soccer's best player, guiding the Demon Deacons to the national championship game. As a former United academy pupil, he was exempt for the MLS draft Jan. 13 and eligible for a D.C. homegrown contract.
Before accepting United's offer, though, Harkes needed time.
“College Cup, finishing school, the D.C. offer,” he said, “it was a whirlwind.”
Born in England in the last year of his father's six-year run in the world's most prestigious circuit, Ian also wanted to explore opportunities abroad. United officials understood the yearning; family history and the romanticism of English soccer were powerful forces. They agreed to give him space.
So Ian trained for about a week with the under-23 squad at Derby County, a second-flight club that employed his father for two seasons. He encountered people who played with John or recognized his family name.
On short notice, though, Derby wasn't prepared to offer a contract. Fulham, a second-tier club in London, had also been willing to take a look, but by then Ian knew what he wanted to do: sign with United.
“I always had in the back of my mind that I would see what else was out there,” he said. “I was happy to get the experience. Having weighed all the pros and cons of different teams and different places to play and having D.C. in my backyard with the history behind it, I made the right decision.”
Even after his father had left Washington for New England and later Columbus, United was part of Ian's life. He attended home matches and once planned a birthday party around a game at RFK. When he was about 15, he enrolled in the youth academy, balancing club soccer with a starring role at Gonzaga, where he was a two-time All-Met.
His father ran United's youth development for a time and went on to become a New York Red Bulls assistant coach under Bruce Arena and a TV analyst for Washington and national outlets. He's now the head coach of FC Cincinnati, a second-division club entering its second season.
“I've known Ian nearly his entire life and have watched him develop into one of the nation's best young talents,” said United Coach Ben Olsen, who has been associated with the club as a player or coach since 1998. “He has all the tools to succeed at the next level and I look forward to being a part of his pro career.”
With United, Harkes will have the opportunity to earn playing time in his first season. He'll work for an organization he knows intimately and help usher in a new era when the Buzzard Point stadium opens sometime in 2018.
Harkes is a two-way central midfielder with size, vision and technical skill. At Wake Forest, his career followed a steady path before culminating with a rush of honors last fall, including first-team all-America and most outstanding offensive player in the NCAA tournament. He scored the golden goal in extra time of the national semifinal against Denver.
Had he been available in the draft, the Fairfax resident probably would've been selected with one of the first two picks.
He's well aware that the leap from college to the pros is tall.
“It's going to be a hard challenge, which excites me,” he said. “I want to play and excel right away, but I know I have a lot of growing to do. Stepping up to the next level, it's like starting again. I'm excited to play with players who are better than me, who will hopefully help me grow, and hopefully I can push them.”

As director Zack Snyder says elsewhere in Total Film's magazine feature on Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, no matter who you cast in an iconic superhero role, people will complain on the internet about it. Perhaps because of comparisons to Linda Carter, thus far the only one to portray Wonder Woman in live-action in a meaningful way, or because she'll have the first live-action female-starring superhero movie of the modern era, or just her general experience level, Gal Gadot certainly had more than her fair share of - we'll be nice and call them "concerned fans." She's not shying away from comparisons, or her own love for the character, who she was personally introduced to through the Justice League cartoon by Bruce Timm and Paul Dini.
"Wonder Woman's a household name, I think, everywhere," Gadot told Total Film. "She's an icon. I wasn't born during the Wonder Woman show with Lynda Carter, so I didn't get to see that [growing up], but I did watch the cartoon." After getting the role, though, she wanted to take it all in, and watched the Carter series. "She was fantastic. I absolutely love her," the actress said of her predecessor.
Gadot appreciates the "relevance" of the Lynda Carter version in the 70s, and is confident that her directors are going to do the same for this version in this time. "Zack Snyder is in collaboration with Patty Jenkins, who's going to direct [the solo Wonder Woman. All of us want to evolve the character because what you saw back then, you've already seen," she said. "So we're going to give it another layer of interpretation and make her a bit more relevant and a bit more up to date" to go with the modern times. "The Wonder Woman story is a story that needs to be told," she concluded. "I'm so happy that it's me to tell this story. I think that there's no better time than now, and it's about time that we showed this amazing heroine on the big screen.
Germany's internet security agency said millions of Germans have had their passwords and usernames for websites stolen, with many of the targeted computers likely being infected with malware.
The Federal Office for Online Security (BSI) said the 16 million compromised accounts surfaced as a result of information forwarded to it by law enforcement agencies and research institutions.
Many of the compromised accounts have email addresses as their username, although social media users and online shopping portals were also targeted.
Agency spokesman, Tim Griese, said about half the accounts have .de domain-name endings, denoting German-based accounts, and it appears the majority of users are in Germany, AP reports.
The BSI has set up a web page where users can check whether their accounts were affected, although the site crashed soon after going live.
Citing an ongoing investigation, the agency did not say when the analysis of the illegal botnets – which are used to compromise computers with malicious software and cede control to a third party – was carried out, who might be behind the attack or what triggered the probe.
A disappointing weekend for Tiger fans ended in the stunning rescue of a Wisconsin man by Baton Rougeans who were in the state for LSU's season opener against the University of Wisconsin, a witness said.
Jill Dunlap, 47, of Baton Rouge, said her husband and a friend leaped to the aid of a man who fell into the Milwaukee River and saved him while dining along the Milwaukee Riverwalk Monday afternoon.

Dunlap was with her husband and two friends in Milwaukee after watching the LSU Tigers' football team lose to the Wisconsin Badgers in Green Bay on Saturday (their other team that weekend, the Milwaukee Brewers, lost to the Chicago Cubs on Monday).
The group was enjoying drinks at Rock Bottom Restaurant and Brewery when they heard a woman screaming Monday at about 4 p.m., Dunlap said.
A man in his 60s or 70s had fallen off a small yacht while trying to tie it to the dock, she said. While the man was struggling in the water, the boat "was still backing up on him," Dunlap said.
Dunlap said she urged her husband, a colonel in the Louisiana National Guard: "Help him!"
Col. John Dunlap and his friend, Ron Duplessis, had trouble lifting the man out of the water because there was no ledge or footing, she said.
So the pair created a stirrup out of rope for the man to stand on as they lifted him out of the Milwaukee River. They were joined by a Chicago firefighter, she said.
"It took three men to get him out," Jill Dunlap said. "The whole place started cheering. The man (who was rescued) started crying and he's like, 'I'm not a good swimmer and I appreciate what you did,'" she said.
Jill Dunlap said she doesn't know the name of the man who fell in the river but said he was a local. The Milwaukee Police Department did not respond to a call late Monday for more information.
"(The crowd) was like, 'Where are y'all from?' Of course, it's 'You guys.' It was very cool," she said. "Finally something good came out of this trip."
Etter has announced that a new version of its multiplayer puzzler Drei will be heading to iOS, Android, and PlayStation Vita this autumn.
It's to be called Dreii and will have faster physics, some new levels, and a new character designed specifically for Dreii.
As with the original game, you'll secretly connect with other online players once you start playing. Then, at some point, these other players will join in with you.
Together, you have to beat levels by stacking blocks of various shapes and sizes up to a certain height without them toppling.
As well as handheld and mobile devices, Dreii will also be coming to Wii U, PlayStation 4, and PC. With this expansion comes a lot more potential players for us all to hook up with.
However, it also adds many different languages for Etter to take into account. Luckily, Dreii is wordless for the most part, but Etter still wanted some select words for people to use to talk in the game.
In the end, Etter picked a handful of words that it then translated into 19 different languages so that players can communicate with each other with ease.
Look out for more updates on Dreii on its official website.
In recent days, we have been witness to two extraordinary acts of sub-national assertion by powerful regional leaders. In the first, Bihar Chief Minister addressed a rally - not in the city of Patna, which he rules and has transformed, but in the beating heart of the Union of India, the Ramlila grounds in Delhi - demanding that his state receive a larger share of central funds and investment. The political formation that promises Bihar "special category status" - a status that eases access to central grants and ups the Centre's investment in a state - will, he implied, receive his support once the next are done. And not just his and Bihar's, he added, but that of other "backward" swing states, like Odisha. In effect, Mr Kumar has announced he is a political free agent, and will use that status to bend the Union of India's fisc to his will.
Both Mr Karunanidhi and Mr Kumar are, in a sense, following in the footsteps of West Bengal's Mamata Banerjee, who, during her tenure as the UPA's opposition-in-residence, scuttled the prime minister's foreign policy initiatives citing her state's concerns, and demanded a greater share of central monies to cover up her maladministration.
We are in the middle, we know, of a giant shift of power to the states. But we have failed to comprehend exactly how deep this change might run, and how much it might lead to division and paralysis even in areas we have come to take for granted will be managed, behind the scenes, by New Delhi's technocrats and experts.
This has been coming for some time. The Left's withdrawal of support to UPA-I over relations with the United States might be explained away by referencing its ingrained anti-Americanism. No states' interests seemed involved, though speeches from the CPM's leaders at the time suggesting it was their misguided way of placating West Bengal's Muslims infuriated by the Party's excesses in Nandigram should have told us there was more to it. Now, however, there is no mistaking the shift. But India is ill prepared for border states' powerful chief ministers having a say in foreign policy. If Mr Kumar declares that Nepal needs more Indian pressure to force that country's government to ensure the Kosi floods less often, will he care if a future alliance partner quotes shibboleths from the 1950s about "non-interference" to him? If Narendra Modi of Gujarat wishes to scuttle peace moves with Pakistan by insisting that the people of his state must have a greater say in what happens to the boundary dispute in Sir Creek, will he be swayed by the arguments of foreign office mandarins? Until India evolves a structured way for regional leaders to impact foreign policy without actually joining a central government and then threatening to leave, it will be unable to frame a coherent approach to the world. The days of Delhi dealing undisturbed with the world are done.
Even more worrying, perhaps, is the fact that the task of fiscal federalism has always been incomplete. The Finance Commission works on an apolitical formula to determine which state gets what proportion of centrally levied taxes. It's based in Delhi, but meets every state government. The formula appears superficially fair, and few complain. The Planning Commission gives off a similar air of apolitical by-the-numbers policy making as it dispenses Plan expenditure. But, now points out, somehow Bihar never quite gets what he thinks it deserves. As this newspaper has argued editorially, Bihar is so poor that its government has limited revenue resources of its own; but it receives less central assistance per capita than the average state does, not more, as you would expect under such circumstances. Stepmotherly treatment has been the case since Independence; in pretty much every Five-Year Plan, Bihar's per capita Plan outlay has been at or near the bottom. The wonder is not that Mr Kumar demands more now; the wonder is that no leader from Bihar has done the maths so far, and really worked at translating his state's votes into more money from the Centre.
Some argue that Bihar should not expect more - after all, as The Financial Express pointed out in an editorial yesterday, it contributes only 2.8 per cent of national income, but receives 8.6 per cent of central funds. On the other hand, it's also 8.8 per cent of India's population, and pretty much the poorest eight per cent at that. Not progressive transfers, prioritising the poorest, but a flat distribution. Do you really expect that state of affairs to continue in a democracy? Internal transfers will have to be more equalising than they have been hitherto, hidden as they were behind supposedly apolitical mechanisms. Indeed, such equalising transfers are basic to well-functioning unions. Consider the United States: The Economist has calculated that, just in the last two decades, states like West Virginia have received over 200 per cent of their GDP in federal spending alone. That's in a system where the central government collects a smaller fraction of overall taxes than ours. In fact, even more blatantly, US states where net federal spending is highest are those with more swing voters.
Sooner or later, Mr Kumar's articulation of poorer states' demands for money will receive pushback from the wealthy West and South. In fact, perhaps the worst thing for Indian federalism is if Narendra Modi's prime ministerial ambitions are thwarted; he will then suddenly discover that Gujarat's money is flowing to all those casteist populists in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh he despises and, by then, can no longer hope for support from. The divisive rhetoric and sub-national power games over transfers to states, over foreign affairs, and over all sorts of policy areas previously the private preserve of New Delhi, have only just begun.

There are players with negotiating leverage, and then there's Cory Schneider.
The New Jersey Devils traded for Schneider -- giving Gary Bettman one of his greatest NHL Draft moments -- because they saw a chance to acquire a franchise goalie right as theirs was aging out of the gig. Sure, it strained their relationship with Martin Brodeur, but Schneider, 28, played like a starter in 45 games with the Devils last season: .921 save percentage and a 1.97 goals-against.
Alas, Brodeur did not, and helped the Devils miss the postseason through their understandable yet detrimental loyalty ...
Scroll to continue with content Ad
Schneider is an unrestricted free agent after this season, a season in which the Devils have constructed a veteran lineup – seven players above the age of 33 – in the hopes of taking another whack at the Stanley Cup piñata before transitioning into the next phase of NJD hockey: One led by Travis Zajac, Adam Henrique and John Quenneville up front; Adam Larsson, Jon Merrill and Eric Gelinas on defense; and Schneider as their anchor.
He's the key to the future … and he's going to be paid accordingly.
From Fire & Ice on July 3:
Devils general manager Lou Lamoriello sounded very optimistic today that he will soon be able to lock up goaltender Cory Schneider to a contract extension. Schneider, 28, would be eligible to become an unrestricted free agent next summer.
“It's a work in progress and we're getting closer and closer,” Lamoriello said. “Hopefully, we'll have that done in the very near future.”
Lamoriello said heading into the off-season that signing Schneider to an extension was a “priority” and he's been working on it with Schneider's agent, Mike Liut, for several weeks. Schneider was not officially allowed to sign an extension until July 1, which has now passed.
Story continues
So what is this contract going to look like?
The cap hit I've heard is $6 million per season.
The term I've heard is seven years.
That puts Schneider's contract in the range of Corey Crawford, who got six years at $6 million annually from the Chicago Blackhawks after his Stanley Cup victory. The annual cap hit of $6 million is what Ryan Miller just received from the Vancouver Canucks to solve their goaltending issues, for you lovers of irony.
Schneider is on the last year of a 3-year, $12-million contract he signed with Vancouver.
The leverage that time was the threat of an offer sheet from someone like the Toronto Maple Leafs. The threat this time is the cornerstone of the Devils' foundation for the future leaving via free agency. In both cases, Schneider will have been rewarded handsomely.
Please note that $6 million would be a higher annual salary than Brodeur ever earned with the Devils during the cap years. For what that's worth...
Thirty police officers across the country have been convicted or accused of serious charges within the past year, including one who filmed a teenager in a shower.

Figures released under the Official Information Act have also revealed five non-sworn police staff have faced charges, including one who is due to be tried in Auckland on sex charges later this month.
Twenty-two police officers are still being dealt with through the court system, facing charges largely relating to assault against women and children.
Nineteen charges laid against 17 officers relate to offending which happened while on duty.
Police National Headquarters said the districts which those officers were associated with cannot be given out for privacy reasons.
Radio New Zealand understands at least nine of them are from the Auckland district.
New Zealand First's police spokesperson Ron Mark said about 0.3 percent of the New Zealand police force was represented in these figures.
He said he thought the police followed thorough processes when investigating their own.
"I think police command understand if they have officers who are transgressing, that needs and must be dealt with to keep the integrity of the police force."
He said it was important to note the very high stress involved in being a police officer.
Mr Mark said common issues among officers included Prolonged Duress Stress Disorder (PDSD), marriage break-ups and mental health issues.
"We have to keep all those things in mind but sometimes police officers need to accept they are going to be scrutinised a hell of a lot more, and that is right and proper."
Labour's police spokesperson Kelvin Davis said the police should be more open about allegations faced by their staff.
"It highlights the whole problem around violence, domestic violence and sexual violence that people refuse to talk about it and hide the issue... sweep it under the mat and hope it goes away.
"And that's the wrong attitude to take, in particular by the police. They need to be open and up front in particular about what's going on."
Mr Davis said while people, including police officers, deserved the right to privacy, the police needed to be more transparent.
"They shouldn't be hiding which district these police are working in, because there are so many policemen that no one could be identified.
"So I think that that excuse is a bit lame. And like I say, they just need to be the ones that set the example and talk about this issue," said Mr Davis.
"If it's a problem in the police force, then say it's a problem in the police force because then that will give other organisations the courage to speak about it being a problem in their workforces as well."
Criminologist Greg Newbold said the police were facing far more accountability than ever before.
"If no one in the police was getting prosecuted then I would be worried.
"But the fact that you are getting police prosecuted gives me confidence that the system is working and they're being held to account."
Mr Newbold said when the police did make mistakes, they should confess to it publicly and not wait for media to ask for the information under the Official Information Act.
Jack Grealish is valued higher than the record fee paid by a British club, according to Tim Sherwood.
The Aston Villa manager insists he would not accept a bid worth £60million for the 20-year-old playmaker.
Grealish is set to feature against Liverpool, the opponents he established his talent against in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley. He scored his first senior goal with a pinpoint curler against Leicester and turned Tuesday's FA Cup tie against Birmingham in Villa's favour having been introduced as a half-time substitute.
Jack Grealish is worth more than the record fee paid by a British club, according to his manager Tim Sherwood
The Aston Villa boss says that he wouldn't want to sell the 20-year-old midfielder for £60million
Sherwood does want more work ethic from Grealish, but believes his skill on the ball and big potential would warrant a monumental price-tag.
‘I wouldn't want to sell Jack Grealish for £60m today. I know what he could possibly be,' said Sherwood. ‘What looks expensive this year might not be expensive next year.
‘That Liverpool game was huge with a lot of expectancy and pressure, it didn't faze him, he grew more.
Despite Grealish's talent Sherwood says he must realise there's more to the game than possession
‘He is certainly a type of player we have seen at the very top level for the likes of Liverpool and in the past for Aston Villa, we have to recognise that.
‘He's not a shop window job, he's our player, and we couldn't put a price on him. I certainly wouldn't.'
But Sherwood added: ‘He's a great player Jack, but he's got to realise – I've been on at him every day – there is more to the game than just when you're in possession.
‘He is certainly a talented player and you want to play him in his best position which is No 10. But he also needs to start working hard to find the ball. He could be the key that unlocks the door for us.'
England manager Roy Hodgson, meanwhile, is seeking clarification from Grealish over his international future as he picks his squad for England's final Euro 2016 qualifiers.
Grealish scored his first goal for Villa against Leicester and is still to decide where his international future lies
Hodgson names his group to face Estonia and Lithuania next week and is considering Grealish as a potential wildcard.
But Grealish, who has already played for Republic of Ireland Under-21's, is yet to confirm who he wants to play for.
Hodgson, who is confident Grealish will choose England, has made further enquiries regarding the youngster's thoughts.
Sherwood wants more work ethic from Grealish, but believes his potential warrants a monumental price-tag
The England boss admitted earlier this month that the 20-year-old was firmly on his radar as he finalises his Euro 2016 plans.
Sherwood said: ‘I think England already recognise that he is a talent they would like to secure the services of,' said Sherwood.
Turkish authorities detained a bird on suspicion it was spying for Israel, but authorities released it after X-rays showed it was not embedded with bugging devices, local media reported Friday.
The kestrel, a member of the falcon genus, with a tag reading “24311 Tel Avivunia Israel,” was turned in to the local governor by residents in the village of Altinayva, Reuters reported.
The bird apparently was registered at a university hospital as an “Israeli spy” by medical personnel, The Times of Israel said. Authorities freed the kestrel after determining it had been tagged only for research purposes.
The Times of Israel reported that Israeli spying is a large concern in the Middle East. In May 2012, authorities in Ankara dissected a European bee-eater after suspecting it was snooping for Israel, and in December an eagle with an Israeli tag in Sudan was captured and touted as a spy.

Janet Napolitano, the president of the massive University of California system, penned an essay this week celebrating free speech and excoriating America's growing throng of intolerant professors and students who seek to limit, ban and otherwise silence speech they don't like.
In the 1,398-word op-ed, published Friday by The Boston Globe, Napolitano laments that “the sanctity of free speech in our country is hardly guaranteed” at this moment in history — “at least not on our college campuses, where freedom of expression and the free flow of ideas should incubate discovery and learning.”
“I write to show how far we have moved from freedom of speech on campuses to freedom from speech,” Napolitano continues, warning that “speech has become the new bête noire of the academy.”
“Speakers are disinvited, faculty are vilified, and administrators like me are constantly asked to intervene.”
The former secretary of Homeland Security under President Barack Obama fondly recalled the 1960s — a different era — when Vietnam War protests in America were “loud and angry and in your face.”
“Today many of the loudest voices condemning speech and demanding protection are students on those same campuses,” Napolitano observes. “Listening to offensive, or merely opposing, views is subject to frequent criticism.”
She quotes Clark Kerr, an economics professor who held the position she currently holds back during the Vietnam era, for the proposition that colleges are “not engaged in making ideas safe for students” but instead for “making students safe for ideas.”
Napolitano writes: “I personally disagree with many of the sentiments expressed in the public spaces on our campuses. But the way to deal with extreme, unfounded speech is not with less speech — it is with more speech, informed by facts and persuasive argument. Educating students from an informed ‘more speech' approach as opposed to silencing an objectionable speaker should be one of academia's key roles. After all, these students will graduate into a country where objectionable speech is the current coin of the realm.”
Possibly to ensure that she doesn't appear too radically in favor of liberty or anything like that, Napolitano goes on to defend “safe spaces.” They are “a good idea,” she advises. (RELATED: Fancypants College Offers SAFE SPACE For Students Traumatized By Republican Convention)
She also chides the University of Chicago's dean of students, John Ellison, for having the temerity to warn incoming students that if they want “trigger warnings” and safe spaces in their college lives, they should attend a different school.
Napolitano describes such a lack of “trigger warnings” and “safe spaces” as “free speech Darwinism.”
“Chalking an anti-immigrant pro-Trump slogan on a sidewalk is one thing; spray painting it on a building is another,” she warns. (RELATED: Wisconsin Professors RAGE After Cops Bust Black Student In Class For Graffiti Rampage)
Also, last year, under Napolitano, the entire taxpayer-funded University of California system instituted a system training faculty about the menace of “microaggressions” — everyday words and actions that radical leftists have decided to be angry or frustrated about.
Under her administration, bureaucrats warned professors to avoid describing America as a “land of opportunity” and to never say “affirmative action is racist” or “I believe the most qualified person should get the job.” (RELATED: California Trains Professors To Avoid ‘Microaggressions')
The attack on microaggressions was the centerpiece of a series of faculty leadership seminars carried out by Napolitano's office at several campuses across the UC system. One document used in the seminars — entitled Tool: Recognizing Microaggressions and the Messages They Send — lists dozens of ominous “microaggressions” for faculty to avoid.
A PowerPoint used for seminar in April shows the dramatic toll the public school system's administrators believes even a single “microaggression” takes on students. Even a simple compliment, such as calling a student “articulate,” can set off a cascade of self-doubt and anxiety for the recipient
A second document instructs faculty on the proper ways to intervene against “microaggressions.” For example, if a person commits the offense of starting a sentence with “you people,” a suggested reaction is to say “I was so upset by that remark that I shut down and couldn't hear anything else.” (RELATED: University Of North Carolina: CHRISTMAS VACATION Is A ‘Microaggression' Now)

Gaming laptops are as much a contest of engineering bravado as they are an attempt at portability and practicality. Meet the case in point: Acer's new Predator 21 X gaming laptop. Its components are excessive, and it is the first ever such machine with a curved display — a 21-inch, 2560 x 1080 resolution IPS display to be exact. We first saw the laptop back at IFA in August, and now we know the whole package will run you an eye-popping $8,999. Acer announced the price at CES 2017 today and says it will be available starting in February.
The Predator 21 X is of course hideous, with rough, protruding black and silver edges and a gaudy blue dragon stock graphic slapped above the keyboard. (The graphic is at least customizable.) It looks not too far off from a military laptop you'd see in the background of an action movie's oversimplified hacking scene. But then again, you're not buying the Predator 21 X for its looks. You're buying the device for its sheer and absurd level of power, illogically stuffed into a package that's only portable if you're willing to carry around a 17.6-pound clamshell monstrosity.
Acer's Predator 21 X absurd gaming laptop This is the most absurd "laptop" of all time. Posted by Circuit Breaker on Friday, September 2, 2016
The reassuring news: its components are up to the task. The Predator 21 X features two GeForce GTX 1080 X graphics cards linked with Nvidia's SLI tech, a brand-new seventh-generation Intel Core i7 processor, four DDR4 slots for up to 64GB of RAM, and up to four 512GB solid state drives, in the event you need unearthly data transfer speeds. Two of those drives can also be NVMe PCIe SSDs, which is a complicated way of saying they're about five times faster than standard SATA drives thanks to updated interface specifications. The standard hard drive configuration on the Predator 21 X will be 2TB.
This ludicrous engineering feat weighs 17.6 pounds
Acer throws in some other add-ons to make the laptop's nearly five-figure price tag only slightly less jaw-dropping. There's Tobii eye-tracking built in, a mechanical keyboard with customizable backlight options, and the numeric keypad flips over to transform it into a touchpad. There are also four speakers and two subwoofers, for outsize sound performance, and five cooling fans.
Still, it's quite obvious Acer made this to flex its engineering muscles, and not because anyone but the most affluent and hardcore would think this product was a logical and well-spent $8,999. If you're so inclined, you can be one of the first 300 customers and get a limited edition series number engraved into the graphics panel, preferably next to the giant blue dragon head. For the rest of us, well... we can only dream — or maybe dream of what else we might afford with that money.
On the more moderate side of the spectrum, Acer is trotting out some more affordable and practical options for portable gaming. The companion device to the Predator 21 X is the Predator 17X, which starts at $2,599 and understandably trades out some of the more ludicrous perks of the wildly more expensive version. You still get Intel's latest Kaby Lake i7 processor, as well as the four DDR4 slots that top out at 64GB of RAM. However, the Predator 17X packs just one GTX 1080 X GPU and limits the type of solid state configurations you can achieve. Acer also trades the massive 21-inch curved display for a 17.3-inch G-Sync screen.
And for those who simply cannot or will not shell out more than $2,000 for a laptop, Acer is announcing a few new additions to its Aspire line. The new V 15 and V 17 Nitro notebooks are being updated with Intel's Kaby Lake processors. They will cost $1,119 and $1,299, respectively and both will be ready to ship in February. Meanwhile, the Aspire VX 15 gaming laptop, which ships later this month, will start at $799 and pack Intel's latest processor alongside less powerful Nvidia graphics. All three machines come with 15.6-inch displays.
They are, of course, more portable and practical than the Predator 21 X, but they are noticeably less ludicrous. That is the trade-off.
Update 1:14PM ET, 1/4: An earlier version of this article said the Predator 21 X would be made to order. Acer has since clarified that it decided against that release strategy, so the laptop will only ship in one configuration starting next month.

Japanese businesses are finding they need to deal with increasing numbers of foreign visitors to Japan, and Panasonic thinks it has the answer: a megaphone that translates the user's voices into multiple languages. The Megahonyaku, which is a reasonably good pun on the Japanese words for “megaphone” and “translation,” listens for Japanese input and plays back phrases in English, Chinese, and Korean.
This isn't quite the portable babelfish of your dreams — Panasonic has only loaded it with around 300 set phrases, though it can connect to the internet to get more. Also it has a touchscreen, which you might think would let you bypass the whole “speaking” thing in the first place, but hey. And it requires a contract of “less than ¥20,000 ($183) a month,” according to Kyodo, which says Panasonic is looking to secure 10,000 enterprise customers by fiscal 2018.
Last night was a perfect example of the bad luck that seems to be chasing Rick Nash and the rest of the Blue Jackets this season. Cutting in against Niklas Backstrom, a rebound hopped onto Nash's stick with a wide open net, he fired a quick snapshot....and Jared Spurgeon managed to thrust his stick into the way just enough to deflect the puck against the goal post instead of the sure-fire goal it appeared to be a split second before.
At this point, Nash sits with 4G, 8A (12) in 17 games - his last point coming on November 10th (an assist), and his last goal back on October 30th vs. Anaheim. The player many expected to be energized by the addition of Jeff Carter for a career year is now on pace for a 57 point season, which would tie his second worst total since the lockout.
Many have claimed that Rick Nash should be stripped of his captaincy. More than a few questions if he's living up to his franchise player contract. But it's worth asking if perhaps that very same captaincy, contract, and expectations are a big reason why Nash might be struggling?
When looking at Nash's current stat line, I decided to look for similar players around the NHL off to an equally bad first quarter, and the results I found were rather interesting. While you do see players like Henrik Sedin, Phil Kessel, and Jason Pominville off to a strong clip, there are some surprising names with similar or worse stat lines than Nash, and they all have something in common - a "C" stitched to their sweater.
Eric Staal - Carolina Hurricanes
Like Nash, Staal is a power forward who quickly became the face of his franchise, though unlike Nash he had a chance to inherit the captaincy after a retirement, rather than a trade, and has also seen far more playoff success.
This season, with Carolina struggling at the bottom of the Southeast Division, Staal is 4/4/8 in 18 games, and an NHL worst -17 on the ice, a shocking drop given that Staal has put up an average of 75 points the last five seasons.
Staal is likely also impacted by the emotional issue of his brother Marc's concussion, but you have to wonder if he, like Nash, sees the trials of the team as a personal failure, and tries to compensate.
Ryan Getzlaf - Anaheim Ducks
Another team scraping the bottom of the Western Conference, the Anaheim Ducks are 2-5-3 in their last 10 games, and the fact that their captain has gone dry since October 27th doesn't help. With only four goals and 5 assists on the season, Getzlaf actually might be a little worse than his stats suggest given that half of his scoring came in two games - a two goal night vs. Phoenix and a two assist night vs. the Blues, both in mid-October.
Jarome Iginla - Calgary Flames
Unlike some of the players we've already highlighted, Iginla at least hit the score sheet recently - he had a goal vs. Colorado on Saturday. But at 5G, 4A in 17 games, he's far below his usual clip - at this time last season Iginla was on a point a game pace.
Iginla is a bit older than some of the peers we've already discussed, but that turns both ways - he has a body of experience that should help to lift his team, but he also may be dealing with the start of a decline in his personal skill.
Daniel Alfredsson - Ottawa Senators
Another member of the older guard, Alfredsson has been a rock for Ottawa since he broke into the league with a 26 goal rookie campaign, but an injury shortened season in 2010-2011 seems to have continued to impact his play this season, where he has 5G, 3A in 13 games. Even in years where his team struggled, Alfredsson generally has been a 70+ point player, but an incredibly poor start for his team included a long hard dry spell for "Alfie", and perhaps it isn't a coincidence that the Senators are starting to scrap their way towards a playoff spot in the East with their captain contributing two goals and an assist in their last 5 games.
Vincent Lecavalier - Tampa Bay Lightning
As captain of a team that was expected to be a major contender in the Southeast division, Lecavalier hasn't been horrible (6G/7A in 17 games), but his scoring has come one dry spell already, and appeared to be on the verge of another before tallying an assist in the Lightning's loss to Winnipeg on Monday.
Joe Thornton - San Jose Sharks
One of the few captains on this list whose team is in a playoff position, San Jose, much like Columbus, had a slow start to the year before hitting their stride in late October. For Thornton, however, things haven't gone quite so smoothly. Jumbo Joe has 4G, 9A so far this season, but it was October 17th before his first point of the season, and didn't see his first goal until the 21st vs. the Devils. Since scoring vs. LA a little over a week ago, he's been held off the score sheet.
Others In The Club
Though they may not wear a captaincy, there are other NHLers operating under a high level of pressure who have failed to light up the season so far - and while injuries and adjusting to new situations may be part of the concerns, it's still worth noting that they, too, are struggling to help put Nash's season in context.
What to do?
If the burden of the team is impacting Nash (and other, similar players under an equal weight of responsibility), it's too simplistic to say that taking responsibility away would fix the issue. If Rick Nash is in the Columbus locker room, he's going to feel the weight of a losing streak - doubly so if something should affect his position on the club. In fact, I can't think of anything more likely to send Nash into a deeper funk.
A trade, as some have suggested, would be a chance for a fresh setting and new teammates, but I don't think that's a solution yet. Rick has said repeatedly he likes playing in Columbus. The team has built to try and make him successful. Sending him away, unless the return was truly staggering, is not an answer.
There are a few ways I would suggest that the team could help to lift Nash, and perhaps could be equally applied to other teams seeing the same struggles.

Today in Tokyo, Toyota announced that it is investing US $1 billion over the next five years to establish a new R&D arm headquartered in Silicon Valley and focused on artificial intelligence and robotics. The Toyota Research Institute (TRI) plans to hire hundreds of engineers to staff a main facility in Palo Alto, Calif., near Stanford University, and a second facility located near MIT in Cambridge, Mass.
Image: Toyota via Ustream At a press conference, Toyota president Akio Toyoda showed a photo of Gill Pratt working on a Corolla some 35 years ago. “Nice hair, Gill,” he said.
Former DARPA program manager Dr. Gill Pratt, an executive technical advisor at Toyota, was named CEO of TRI, which will begin operations in January. Toyota president Akio Toyoda said in a press conference that the company pursues innovation and new technologies “to make life better for our customers and society as a whole,” adding that he wanted to “work with Gill not just because he's an amazing researcher and engineer, but because I believe his goals and motivations are the same as ours.”
We spoke to Dr. Pratt to find out what kinds of things TRI wants to work on, how they plan to transform pure research into practical applications, and where all that money is going.
Photo: Toyota Dr. Gill Pratt, the former DARPA program manager responsible for the DARPA Robotics Challenge, will lead the new Toyota Research Institute in Silicon Valley.
FOCUS ON CARS AND ROBOTS
TRI's initial focus is AI for cars and robots, Dr. Pratt told us. He detailed some of that strategy in September, when Toyota, the world's largest automaker by sales, announced a research collaboration initiative with Stanford and MIT, a first step in the company's big push into AI and robotics. With TRI, Toyota wants to significantly speed up the development of AI with applications to smarter and safer vehicles, as well as robots that can make our lives better at home, especially as we age. But although vehicles will be equipped with more powerful sensors, computers, and software, that doesn't mean they'll be designed to operate fully autonomously all the time, as Dr. Pratt explained:
“Our belief is that you actually don't have to give up the joy of driving, and in fact we can make the joy of driving much safer, and much more available to all kinds of people across a very wide spectrum. But we're not also shutting off the idea that some of the time you actually want the car to take over from you and to either drive on a highway on its own or drive in a parking lot by itself, or maybe if you're too tired to drive home, to take the lead for you.”
In terms of robots, he said they'll be using what they learn and hardware that they develop for indoor mobility applications, hoping to develop technology that can help people get around as well as move objects in their homes.
FROM PROTOTYPES TO PRODUCTS
TRI has a broad mandate, with lots of flexibility, and Dr. Pratt said they'll be exploring research on numerous fronts. But he emphasized that, as part of its mission, the organization will strive to bridge the gap between fundamental research and product development:
“We think that the answer is to have projects that have a feasibility prototype or some other type of milestone as an intermediate goal in order to see what is possible to do. Then we want to see if we can translate those results into a new capability that we will test to be able to say, ‘Okay, does this work or doesn't this work? What are the advantages and disadvantages? Should we turn this into a real component of a future car? Or in the case of the robotics field, some new type of capability in a robot that might be used indoors?' ”
Dr. Pratt added that they'll have a “modest fund” that they'll be using to invest in startups: not as a way of making money, but to “help nurture technology” that their projects can benefit from. What kinds of technology is Toyota interested in the near term? He gave us one example:
“There are new kinds of imaging and proximity sensors coming out all of the time now, because [LIDAR] has transformed the field of both map making and autonomous driving quite a bit. The trouble is that those sensors tend to be very expensive, and many people right now all over the world are looking at how you can have that same capability in a much less expensive sensor. Some of that research is being done by Toyota, some of it is being done by other places and we're going to be looking at all of it.”
Photo: Toyota Toyota recently demonstrated a Lexus test vehicle capable of driving itself on highways, aiming to offer the technology in commercial models by 2020.
GET YOUR RESUME READY: TOYOTA IS HIRING
For the new TRI facilities in Palo Alto and Cambridge, Toyota plans to hire about 200 employees. That's a lot of people to hire, and Dr. Pratt is aware that the process might ruffle some feathers. Uber found itself in the middle of a controversy when it hired dozens of researchers away from Carnegie Mellon's National Robotics Engineering Center. Google did something similar to establish its own autonomous driving program. But Dr. Pratt is not concerned, noting that the first step for Toyota was to support the academic programs at Stanford and MIT directly:
“We think that it's really important to nurture the pipeline of new talent that grows, and that means trying to make sure that professors and research scientists that are at universities are not only used as a source of talent but also that we put support back into the system to try to grow more talent. We also think that when students get to the stage that they have decided that they're ready to move from the academic world into the private sector that our job is to present them with a really good option—here's a place where you can be creative, work with other people who are extraordinarily smart, and where you can become even more talented than you were before. And of course have a whole lot of fun.”
For our part, we're very excited to see what happens with this. We write a lot about robotics research, and far less about robotics products that make your life better, simply because getting from the former to the latter is surprisingly difficult. We feel that this level of commitment Toyota is demonstrating towards AI and robotics is exactly the kind of big push we need to get these technologies out in the real world. With these new research facilities in California and Massachusetts, we're hoping that we'll be able to follow along as TRI develops its advanced cars and robots, as well as other technologies that are probably going to be a complete surprise.
The city's subways are constantly being disrupted — by jerks!
An epidemic of bad behavior by out-of-control passengers has caused the number of delays in the city subway system to skyrocket, according to data obtained by The Post.
The system has degenerated into such a cesspool of trouble-making that more than 2,300 train delays attributed to unruly customers were reported in January — an 80 percent increase over the year before.
The numbers were also up 43 percent in December and 53 percent in November.
The rampant rudeness includes everything from vagrants getting into fistfights to people pulling the emergency brakes — and break dancers causing delays by holding doors open, sources said.
Police are called to many of these incidents, typically by transit workers.
The 6 line had the most delays caused by unruly riders, followed by the 2, 5, E and R, sources said. The 7 and the L were the calmest.
“People think they can do whatever they want,” said a police source. “Smoke, act unruly, start fights. But they don't realize that they are on MTA property and . . . they don't realize they have to follow the rules.”
Everyone seemed to have horror stories of trains being held up by thoughtless passengers.
Music teacher Chris Bates, 22, of Washington Heights, said an A train was recently delayed as three drunken men brawled.
“They were trying to punch each other through the doors,” he said. “It was annoying because the train was held up.”
Laura Simpson, 49, of Inwood, said she was disgusted recently when the doors couldn't close because an adult rider was punching a teenage girl.
“The woman said that somebody pushed her,” said Simpson. “And so she stood in the door and she was punching the girl. And she pushed the girl off the train, and the girl tried to get back on the train, so she was hitting her.”
On Sunday alone, there were more than 20 incidents.
People are always holding the doors and they try to cram their way in when there's no room. - Pat Cashin
They included a deranged man who punched a female conductor at the Euclid Avenue station on the A line and a violent man who frightened E riders so much, they called for help on an intercom.
An unruly homeless man also hit the emergency brake on a Q train at Times Square and then fled.
Transit cops also recently nabbed an armed straphanger for threatening passengers.
“Move out of the way, you don't want me to hurt you,” Pedro Moreno, 53, allegedly snapped at riders Feb. 17 at the Lexington Avenue-59th Street station. Cops found a .25-caliber handgun with one round in the chamber.
“People are awful, and they behave despicably during rush hour,” said frustrated carpenter Pat Cashin, 36, of Woodside.
“People are always holding the doors and they try to cram their way in when there's no room. That's what's causing the delays and the arguments. Hands down, it's worse than it used to be.”
The delays sometimes have deadly results.
On March 10, service was disrupted when a retired correction officer killed a drunken man in the Borough Hall station following a fight on a 4 train.

I went to Somogybabod in Hungary to witness the 30th edition of the largest off-road festival in Central Europe. This is what happened during taking on a few kilos of mud.
“By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; you are dust, and to dust you shall return.” Genesis 3: 20
It's all about the struggle.
I mean it has to be about the struggle. I cannot interpret it in any other way. Why would anyone build an off-road truck, drag it across Europe, blow some of the family savings at a weekend where one could get the experience of being shit-faced, trying to get the 4x4 on a vertical wall, spending seemingly endlessly long minutes - if not hours - trying to get it off where it was stuck, sticking those mud-covered legs out of the engine bay to get the damned thing restarted in the torrential rain, then repeat all this the next day, then the following one to finally pack everything up and haul all that jazz back to the other side of the continent?
Because that's what men do: trying to make things work in our lives. If it's working just fine, we find other struggles to deal with. Or just eff up the existing one - the father of many divorces.
So yeah. It is difficult to find another get-together of men trying to do manly things that is so pointless in its manliness. I am probably one of those who define themselves less than manly, whose testosterone-balancing acts are exhausted in successfully drilling a hole in the wall to hang up a guitar or something.

That said, I was somewhat curious what this annual off-road thing was all about that kept returning for the 30th time in my neighborhood - less than 25 miles from where I live - yet I never got to experience it.
A bit of context then, just for kicks.
Somogybabod (pronounced closer to ‘shomodbabod' - it's a bit difficult to explain non-existent phonemes to the English language) is situated in the North-East of Somogy county, in South-West Hungary. This used to be a land of some real Game of Thrones-like of stuff over a thousand years ago, formerly owned by a Khal Drogo-kind of figure, plotting a charge for the throne in the name of ancient religion against the favoured, state-founding future Hungarian king. His failure meant Hungary was born and Scotland gained a saint (now there's a cliffhanger for you).

By terrain it is very much like Southern England - as former Jalopnik-writer Péter Orosz explained it to me while discovering the secret race track of Budapest - and after having lived in the South-West of England, I can testify to that. I would even go so far that it has a hint of Wales as well.

What does all this nonsense mean?
Well, you got hills. Not big ones, but annoyingly many of them - requiring some significant earth-work at larger constructions - which makes the area ideal for some off-road action. Because hills have elevation, hills have grass and hills have mud flowing on the side when there's no grass on them any more.
Advertisement
The buzz is instantly there when you get to the village where small Toyotas mix with purpose-built turbodiesel monsters cruising on the main road or just getting towed to the spot. That brown slush is just flowing down the mountain and you try to swim upstream to get anywhere near the real action.
It's the cigarette-blended smell of beer, pork chops, some idiosyncratic use of language, the pumping music, the roar of V8s and the whistle of turbos and it's...
...it's organized chaos...
Advertisement
Man and machine might have never come together in that sort of unity before. Literally. There's always a 4x4 to run you over and there's always a 4x4 to drag out from the mud by manpower, as if you were parachuted into the largest congestion of non-English-speaking rednecks. My very first thought was “there's nothing happening here, actually, but that nothing is happening very intensely”. The ‘wailing wall' is virtually open for everyone who were able to get up to that spot already - which was made easier by the previous day's sunshine, but that's about to change.
Meanwhile, people are flocking in and I'm clenching fingers around my 1.5-litre beer bottle, getting a good laugh at some people - wasted with obscure beverages on the inside and wasted by mud on the outside - when an old bloke stands right in my face. “That was a helluva climb, my lungs are wasted, could you spare me a few drops of your beer?” Her steaming-hot daughter (?) bursts out with laughter, so I say “sure, go ahead”. “Thank you, my dear sir.” he mumbles as he almost swings the bottle around his head. Still, don't get any more smiles from the girl. Dammit.

As the excitement of seeing some BMW-buggies kicking some mud dies down and gets a bit repetitive, I decide to pay a visit to ‘the wallow' where the manliest of manly things happen. Getting there is a challenge by itself, the edge of the nearby crops field is already destroyed due to the traffic across it as the regular ‘road' is completely wasted. There's an unusual tug-of-war game going on between an ancient Mercedes Unimog and a Jeep with a foreign licence plate. The Unimog wins without trying really hard, but then it is stuck in the small lake, stalling the engine. The roof hatch opens and the guy inside gives a shout to the small crowd: “Does anybody have brake cleaning spray? How about some deodorant? Girls, what about you? You don't carry any in your purse? OK, how about some cigarettes, then?”

By that time, the rain is all-consuming. Some guys from the local forestry watch the events unfolding, having nothing else but a T-shirt on top. Yep, they know that struggle those in the pond are experiencing. That's part of what they do every day in their Lada Nivas. Finally, heavy artillery is brought in, and a truck with actual weight has to pull them out. The Unimog still won't start, though. Power cables are prepared and the V8 Jeep comes over for help. One of the Merc guys goes “Oi, how do you say ‘battery' in German?” “It's ‘battery, bitte'” someone shouts. Then tractors starting to roll in without any effort that sort of kills the macho image of these off-roaders and that's when I decide to go back to the main action. It's a bloody nightmare. The roads got so wet that trucks are towing each other out of ditches and holes on the way to the wallow. What would usually be a five-minute walk under normal circumstances ends up being over half an hour.
Back at the wailing wall Range Rovers get stuck, quad bikes buzz around, people do waterski in the mud while getting towed by trucks. The madness and mudness is relentless. People sliding into the pool, then unable to get out. 4x4s getting stuck in mud downhill, beer spilled, music pumping, the whole nine yards, but everyone is having a great time in this less-than-pointless festival of struggle.

Because this is what it is all about. People could have chosen to stay home, but they chose to get covered in dirt while walking or driving from A to B. It's the annual struggle they came here for. Not necessarily to get somewhere, but to try and get somewhere. At least trying without too much risk involved other than trying not to kill themselves or anyone else in the process.

Every time you interact with someone, you come into contact with the thousands of tiny microbes that inhabit her bacterial universe.
Scientists used to think that our microbial ecosystems intermingled only through touch, but now a team led by James Meadow at the University of Oregon has discovered that we eject millions of microorganisms from our bodies into the air around us. The rate at which we do so depends on how often we scratch or fidget, and the composition of each person's microbial radius is slightly different.
Meadow and his colleagues published their findings in the journal PeerJ , where they explain that they analyzed DNA from bacteria in the air surrounding 11 healthy volunteers in their 20s and 30s as they sat in a closed booth for four hours. The researchers found that the volunteers each had a signature “stew” of bacteria that filled the space around where they sat.

Is Kaspersky in Hot Water??
The Russian newspaper Kommersant recently broke news regarding the arrest of Ruslan Stoyanov, the head of Kaspersky Lab's investigations unit. Stoyanov was arrested in December for treason allegations. It is reported Stoyanov served as a major to the cybercrime unit of Russia's Ministry of Interior for six years prior to his employment with Kaspersky. It is unclear if he had entirely severed these ties, while working for the Moscow-based antivirus company.
ArsTechnica was provided the following statement from company officials,
“The case against this employee does not involve Kaspersky Lab,” company officials wrote in a statement issued following the report. “The employee, who is Head of the Computer Incidents Investigation Team, is under investigation for a period predating his employment at Kaspersky Lab. We do not possess details of the investigation. The work of Kaspersky Lab's Computer Incidents Investigation Team is unaffected by these developments.”
Paul Rosenzweig reported on this issue to Lawfare,
The incident raises some questions that need consideration: The ability of Russian CI to identify a Kaspersky employee as an American intelligence source suggests, again, that the Russian government has close operational ties with Kaspersky. In light of that, should Kaspersky be publicly identified as a Russian-controlled system by the US government?
Do we need a risk assessment of the extent to which Kaspersky anti-virus products are used in critical American infrastructure?
Russian Loyalty?
The Moscow-based company has strong ties to the Russian government and military. This shouldn't come as breaking news. As of 2012, the company shifted its focus considerably, after Kaspersky scotched an IPO partnership with investment firm General Atlantic. Which according to Bloomberg Businessweek, lead to an internal email being circulated stating the company's highest positions would be held only by Russians. The company denies that the e-mail was ever sent.
Having ties to the government isn't necessarily a bad thing; however, it depends on how these ties are used. Since this is a well-known security solution used world-wide, they have accessibility to a plethora of data. Again, it is all about how they use it.
Wait–They're Russian Based?
You didn't know Kaspersky was based in Moscow? It is likely many of their users don't. To find out where your security solution is researched, developed and supported, click here.

Not a mole, not a rat: The forbidding environment of East Africa's deserts is home to one of the most bizarre rodents, the naked mole-rat. These beauties wouldn't win any pageants, but they are fascinating animals. Yes, these odd little creatures with pink, wrinkly skin dig and live in underground burrows the way moles do. Yes, they have skinny, rat-like tails. Yet naked mole-rats are more closely related to porcupines, chinchillas, and guinea pigs than they are to moles or rats and are the only species of mole-rat that has practically no hair.
Why are they "naked"? Native to the desert regions of East Africa, which can be pretty warm during the day, naked mole-rats live underground. If it does get cold at night, the little mammals just huddle together in a mole-rat pile and use each other's body heat to keep warm. And since they spend their lives underground, they don't need hair for sun protection. It's hard to see, but naked mole-rats do have about 100 fine hairs on their body that act like whiskers to help them feel what's around them. Hairs between their toes help sweep soil behind them while tunneling.
Most mole-rat species live by themselves. But the naked mole-rat and the Damaraland mole-rat are the only two mammal species that are eusocial (yew SO shul). This means they live in a colony that may have several generations living together and just a few individuals that produce all the offspring for the colony, much the way bees and ants live. Scientists believe the naked mole-rats' eusocial behavior is due to the challenges of living underground in the desert, where there is little food or water.
A naked mole-rat colony may have from 20 to 300 individuals living in an underground area that can be as large as 6 football fields! It is filled with a tunnel system that stays at a warm temperature of 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius), even though the outside temperature can get much colder or warmer. To keep the colony healthy and safe, there are chambers, or rooms, at different points along the tunnel system.
Each chamber has a purpose, just like the rooms in your home. There is the nesting chamber, or nursery, where the queen (dominant female) stays with the pups (babies), and feeding chambers, used for collecting and storing food—a mole-rat pantry! There is even a toilet chamber, where the members go to the bathroom (sorry, no shower).
Most people think naked mole-rats are blind. Their tiny eyes are not much use underground, but they can still see a little bit. However, mole-rats rely on their senses of hearing, smell, and touch more than they do their sight. Researchers have studied them in both light and dark environments and find their behavior doesn't change.
About two years ago, when I first scooped that Microsoft was going to include Cortana as an integral part of Windows 10, at that time, I had been told that the digital assistant was going to live in the system tray. But, as we all know, Cortana currently lives on the taskbar but that may be about to change.
Part of the reason why it was moved to the taskbar is that it would put it closer to the Start button and improve discoverability. But, with it being on the taskbar, it also needed to have the option of being removed which is a problem for Microsoft.
The company loves to tell you that usage of Cortana is very high but the reality is that it's not as rosy as it may seem. If you hit the Windows key and search, you are now a Cortana MAU (monthly active user); use edge and Cortana pops up in the URL bar, welcome to the MAU club. Further, many users are simply removing Cortana from the taskbar but to remediate this issue, Microsoft will move the digital assistant.
Cortana, like its original mockups, is currently being tested living inside the system tray. The company is placing it near the clock and action center icons and is also introducing a new UI that is conversation-like, according to sources familiar with the product.
The UI and features are in the early stages of development and if you ask Cortana a question, it will open on the right side of the screen from the taskbar. Further, it will prompt with smart reply suggestions like Google Allo for when you need to interact with the assistant.
As with ever early implementation of a new feature in Windows 10, this could be cut before being released and may change dramatically before arriving to Insiders. But, know that Microsoft is actively working on a new implementation of Cortana and it's currently looking like the system tray will be the new home.

Knightscope's autonomous, crime fighting robot has the complexion of a washing machine. In pictures it looks cute, the size of a penguin maybe. In person it is five feet tall with intimidating breadth. It moves steadily and with insistence. If you stare at it long enough, the twin panels of lights about two-thirds of the way up its body start to take on the appearance of shifty, judgmental eyes. It sees what you're doing and wants you to cut it out.
The full name of the Knightscope robot on display at the Launch Festival this morning was the K5 beta prototype. Former Ford Motor Company executive and Knightscope CEO William Santana Li describes it to MC and festival organizer Jason Calacanis onstage as a “crime fighting autonomous data machine.” But that doesn't come close to doing it justice.
This is society's collective fantasy of a robot, part-R2D2, part-Robocop, part-WALL-E, part-Rocky's plaything in Rocky 4, mixed in with a our shared technological nightmares. It sounds like a joke, but it isn't.
As Santana Li outlines proudly, the beast before him on stage takes in 360-degree video through four cameras, is capable of thermal imaging, registers gestures, recognizes faces and can run 300 license plates in a single minute. It works off proximity GPS and scans its environment every 25 milliseconds. It runs off nearly identical technology to Google's self-driving cars. He boasts that it can see, feel, hear and smell. It is autonomous, will roam outdoors, can take video, decide when it needs to return and charge its batteries and can detect biological and chemical pathogens and radiation.
The Knightscope will get put out in the field gathering data, Santana Li says. The owner can log in to a security panel and get a read of what is going on in the area. The robot can scan license plates and report back on stolen cars. Its facial recognition capabilities can alert its owner to any registered sex offender in the area. The sample dashboard Santana Li logs in to, shows that the robot can report back about things as specific as how many people are lying horizontal and how many are gesturing with their hands. The company is working on giving it a 3M graffiti proof sheen, it emits a piercing sound if someone tries to tip it over and the machines will often work in pairs so they can protect each other.
For law enforcement officers, using Knightscope, Santana Li says they will be able to get real time data and a precise heat map of where to focus their efforts. Knightscope will figure out for police where they should be looking. Next month the machines will be rolled out for a test client in an undisclosed location. Scared yet?
Santana Li has different rationales for why Knightscope should exist. It is going to be offered as a “machine as a service business model,” he says. It will retail for $3,000 a month. The machine works 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, which he reminds us works out to about $4 an hour with “no pension liability.”
The law enforcement apparatus we have will not scale with population growth. The security industry has a 100-400 percent employee turnover rate. “The jobs aren't all that great,” Santana Li says. He envisions a security company having seven machines for three humans and outsourcing some of the process.
Crime has a $1 trillion impact on the American economy, according to Santana Li. “If we can show that we can literally cut that in half, we're going to have every mayor in the country calling us,” he says.
But in extrapolating upon this, Santana Li hits entirely upon why Knightscope is a disturbing invention. “The first line of defense for law enforcement is to physically be there. The presence of law enforcement changes behavior,” he says. If every mayor in the country did hypothetically come knocking, Knightscope threatens to make law enforcement omnipresent. It's less a crowd control tool than a behavioral control device, making our entire existences akin to the moment when you drive past a police officer on a freeway.
As Santana Li wraps up, Calacanis takes a spot poll from the crowd. Many times more people express concern than excitement.
“We're on the cutting edge here, and this should give you a little discomfort,” Santana Li says. “This is much more efficient than a human.” He sees the Knightscope as disrupting law enforcement, revolutionary on the ATM machine or the PC.
Disrupting law enforcement though, by proxy has the capability to disrupt civil liberties, which is a disturbing can of worms to open. Humans may be less efficient than Knightscope, but we have empathy and emotional judgment. There's a reason an invention like this has remained the realm of dystopian fiction so far, because it's a safe bet more people would be okay with a less efficient police force than a partially robotic one.
Or something. I should probably watch my words though. This guy looks like he reads his own press.

Anthony Finkelstein wrote a great post about the benefits of being a software engineer: you can call yourself an engineer without getting your hands dirty, and you can wear jeans and a T-shirt to work (if you feel like being smart). All good points, but it got us thinking, whilst it may be good to be a software engineer, it's even better to be a research software engineer. And here's why.
(And if you're interested in this post, you should attend our workshop for research software engineers on 11 September in Oxford.)
1. Right at the cutting edge of science
You can read books and watch documentaries about research, but that's old news. If you really want to know what's going on, you have to work with the researchers themselves.
Research software engineers work right at the frontiers of science: they are the people who researchers work with in order to turn theories into results. And unlike researchers, Research Software Engineers don't have to pay for this privilege by writing papers.
2. Travel the world
Fancy a trip to Singapore, Rio, Hawaii, LA, Hong Kong, or Shanghai? Become a research software engineer.
We're not saying that you'll be jet setting every other day, but in how many jobs do you get to fly around the world to visit collaborating universities, or present work at international conferences? Not many! By sitting on the line between software development and research, research software engineers benefit from similar travel as their researcher colleagues.
3. Use the tools and languages that are best suited to the job
There's a lot of freedom in research software development. And rightfully so, because restrictions tend to stifle creativity, and intelligent solutions are creative.
Researchers want results, so research software engineers are often given complete flexibility in their approach to a problem. Novelty and creativity are encouraged, which means there's rarely a restriction on the tools you can use.
4. Open to open source
The freedom in choosing tools extends to the use of open source. Research is completely amenable to the use of open-source software.
It's not just about the use of open-source software: it's also about the freedom to open source the code that you create. It benefits the whole community when researchers share their work, and this applies equally to software. Research software engineers are far more likely to be active members of the open-source community, and meet far fewer restrictions on being allowed to open source their own software.
5. Wall-to-wall bright people
Universities and research establishments in general are interesting places to work. They are populated by people who are fascinated by the world around them. Research software engineers - who share this passion - find a happy working environment in research institutions.
6. Flexibility
Some people get so engrossed in a solving a problem that working hours is not a term that applies to them. Many research software engineers find themselves coding way into the night in an attempt to get something completed, not because they are being pressurised to do so, but because they enjoy the reward of doing something that others have not been able to do.
Research software engineers get a lot of flexibility in their working environment. Again, it's about results. If you produce the software researchers need, you will receive a lot of flexibility over the hours you work.
7. Why work in only one discipline?
The unique combination of understanding research and software engineering makes research software engineers extremely useful in all disciplines. In fact, many works simultaneously on different projects in different disciplines. Working with such a broad range of subject areas and people is both stimulating and rewarding.
8. Important work
Software engineers might work as part of a large team working on a small part of a software package. Research software engineers will often be responsible for an entire software package - or a large part of it. Such responsibility can be daunting, especially when the results produced by your software could be the foundation of a new research field, but it is also incredible rewarding.
The knowledge that your work could have a big impact is one of the main attractions of being a research software engineer.
9. Collaboration
Of course there is competition within research, but if your hear about someone doing interesting work, you can usually start a conversation with them and often a collaboration. This gives you access to expertise to help improve your software (designers, usability experts, hardware engineers) as well as access to resources from supercomputers to datasets that just wouldn't be shared in industry.
10. Choose your own path
Research software engineers might not yet have a career path in research, but their importance is certainly recognised by the researchers who they work with. The combined benefits of using the tools you want, the ability to swap between interesting fields and being able to make a significant impact with your work means that research software engineers can carve out their own path through research.
Now all we need to do, is make sure that this important role is recognised and rewarded with proper contracts and adequate remuneration.

I scout a Terran, cross position on Fighting Spirit. He is at 4.5 and I am at 10.5. We are pretty even at first because he opens with a standard expansion and I 3 hatches. I don't think you have to pressure in these situations, because unlike ZvP, the ZvT matchup only threatens Overlords with Wraiths. Frankly the investment is too large and fast expansion Terran can't do it.
Vulture kills Zergling so initial investment looks like factory style, or so I persuade myself. I am really expecting marines still until something clicks and the Vulture fits into place. Wanted to face Fantasy style if facts, but haven't seen it yet on ladder. Since its cross start I got maximum opportunities to develop tech, but might as well open lurker standard here (because still expecting marines).
So here's lurker. SCV sneaks by, and I got a strong urge to kill it, but don't. Things will get a lot easier, now, since I've secured 3rd. Lotta tech options, I guess, but I just wanna make Queens. It's not an instinct worth revising, and plus how u gonna revise it? Just ensnare if bio, and spawn if fact. Easy enough to redress both these options.
Now I got the research starting. I take 12o'clock which should be pretty good, too. You can see I got an extra evo which is fine cuz I just won't build with it. Plenty of Queen are starting and Terran gonna push hard. Some Lurker here and there, regrettably. Some might say I've even entered "delusion" Zerg style b/c no hive and no defiler. But I've tried spawn strats before and got some good results... You'll see it don't happen here tho!
Well he's gonna move out! Yea, I just scouted him moments before w/ late speed. Should probably have moved to contain with lurkers. A lotta zerg will get paranoid, here! You gotta make some reasonable estimates, what's he gonna do? Haha, well your suspicions are the right one! This time he's just gonna attack, probably attack. Hope I got enough...
It's time to halt the advance. Terran is moving out uncharacteristically soon. He scans moves over some lurkers, and he won't even siege up... Time to pull all my resources and get some overlord sight range. A lot of players overlook overlord sight range for some reason against tech ran. Hmph, well it's already pretty bad, that's true. Maybe I can stall him out at the natural of course is the last hope.
My shot of the Queens got deleted somehow in the conversion process. There are a way bunch, a bunch of queen hovering above the ramp, lol. They will probably gather energy for some time, but then it's time to strike... Sad to say he already has a siege position of some kind, and I have been in this position a few times. Yea, it looks completely over.
Time to take things seriously and micromanage well. The pressure is on as the natural hatch dies. It isn't dead yet but inside his head I know it's dead. Some fire is absorbed, but very few tanks die to splash. Actually no tanks die to splash. It's desperate enough now maybe, so let's send the hydra and spam out all the resources.
The queen will salvage this bad situation, that's the build. We got some kinda sanity here, and somehow macro has fallen ff. So let's use the moment like it should be used, snipe the tanks and repel the army.
Everything died! Haha, of course not literally everything... It's a damn shame there is no targeting computer. Especially with queens smart cast could be so great. Final destination train of wonder! The vultures are falling and goliaths and now the tank line erupts into flames.
Come on! The battle begins anew. Perhaps the Terran will be overcome, it's unthinkable of course. My bank is really heavy, so there's hope for sure. It may feel a long way off but I'll win, somehow I'll win. Terran takes a hidden 4th at bottom left (7.5). hehe
(not pictured, big vulture run-by kills buncha drones at main and 1.5).
result: i end up losing, but not gonna report on it, yet.

The Foundation for Apologetic Information and Research (FAIR) has announced the release of the second edition of Shaken Faith Syndrome: Strengthening One's Testimony in the Face of Criticism and Doubt. Author Michael R. Ash, a veteran member of FAIR, released the first edition of Shaken Faith Syndrome in 2008 as a source for Mormons who were struggling with their faith because of LDS-critical claims. Ash said, "As attacks against the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are becoming more pervasive, members and investigators of the Church are finding an increasing need for answers to troubling questions." He added, "I frequently receive emails from distraught members who were on the verge of abandoning their faith. Thankfully my book was helpful in resuscitating their religious convictions."
The second edition of Ash's widely popular book includes more than 50 additional pages of material that includes highlights from scholarly studies that support the Book of Mormon and Book of Abraham, more discussion on the emotional and mental distress that frequently accompanies faith-based challenges, and a brand-new chapter on race issues and the Church. The new edition also includes more discussion on DNA science and archaeology and how they relate to Book of Mormon studies, as well a vastly improved index for helping readers locate specific topics.
Divided into two sections, the first half of Shaken Faith Syndrome engages the turmoil members might experience when they discover claims that seem to challenge their core beliefs. This first section also presents basic and important principles that can be utilized by struggling members in their quest to understand such discoveries in light of modern scholarship, science, and their own religious convictions.
The second half of Shaken Faith Syndrome incorporates the principles outlined in the first half of the book and addresses seventeen specific categories of LDS-critical accusations and includes over eighty sub-topics within those categories. Topics such as Book of Mormon anachronisms, Joseph Smith's First Vision, Plural Marriage, Lamanite Identity, the Temple and Masonry, and more are all covered within the second half of this book.
FAIR President Scott Gordon commented, "For struggling members, or family and friends of struggling members, this is the 'go-to' book for understanding the emotional turmoil that accompanies testimony-damage, and providing answers and resources to assuage the doubts which may impede faith."
FAIR is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing well-documented answers to criticisms of LDS doctrine, belief and practice. Along with the FAIR Wiki, FAIR also sponsors a website that includes answers to difficult questions. FAIR has an "Ask the Apologist" option where people can pose questions to apologists and FAIR also sponsors MormonVoices which responds to public discussions and comments from public figures that misrepresent The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

In Tolkien's Lord of the Rings series, Aragorn and the other Rangers of the North - along with their counterparts in Gondor - have a mysterious and alluring quality. These scouts live off the land and steer clear of the civilizations they silently protect. On the opposite end of Tolkien's good vs. evil spectrum are the Nazgûl - the twisted shadows of former humans hopelessly corrupted by Sauron. Similar to Rangers, these stealthy wraiths glide across the land mostly unseen, doing their Dark Lord's bidding with otherworldly might. Nazgûl are among the darkest examples of the spectral undead, called wraiths, lingering in Middle-earth. Talion, the protagonist of Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor (our exclusive cover story for issue #248), is a powerful-yet-conflicted combination of a wraith and a Ranger of the Black Gate. This fusion creates some enticing narrative and gameplay opportunities for Monolith Production's ambitious next-gen game.
Diehard Tolkien fans may be flipping through the pages of the Silmarillion or The Unfinished Tales for any mention of a man-wraith hybrid. You won't find any evidence save for the fact that in Tolkien's lore, living creatures can become wraiths. Monolith Productions doesn't take the Middle-earth mythos lightly, and has created an intriguing circumstance for this unprecedented transformation.
Talion was stationed at the Black Gates of Mordor, keeping watch over the troubled lands. Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor takes place between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings trilogy, which means Sauron's power is mounting but Mordor isn't the tortured environment seen during Frodo Baggins' adventure. Even so, Mordor is a chaotic landscape in which human frontiersmen struggle to scrape by. Talion's wife and son stay with him near his dangerous post - a risky situation that his family ultimately pays for.
"The story opens with a family and continues elaborating on that topic, and clearly is an inner part of the story - if not the surface," says lead writer Christian Cantamessa, whose impressive resume includes Red Dead Redemption. "If you want a cost to the price of power, then you have to balance it against something else. We choose to use the concept of family to weigh against..."
Talion and his family are murdered by the servants of Sauron at the beginning of Shadow of Mordor. Somehow, instead of meeting his fallen loved ones in the afterlife, Talion is bound to Middle-earth with a curse. He is resurrected when his being unites with a wraith. Why he is linked with this wraith is as much a mystery to him as it is to players at the beginning of the game. Talion's extended stay in Middle-earth opens the doors for revenge on those who destroyed his life. Tapping into his existing Ranger skills and the new ethereal wraith powers, Talion sets out into Mordor.
"He reawakens from death, and there is this spirit of vengeance within him," says Michael de Plater, director of design. "[The wraith is] the main [force] that gives him the power to not only continue to move in the world that he's familiar with, the physical world, but now to see into the world that is normally unseen - into the wraith world."
The wraith and Talion seem to be separate entities existing within the same body. The wraith is a separate character with similar personal motives, but the two cooperate on their journey.
Talion literally carries his past with him on his adventure. He bears Ranger equipment, like a sword and tattered cloak. He also keeps tokens of his family with him, like his son's broken sword. Visually similar to the shattered hilt of Narsil, Talion uses this small blade as a dagger for stealth takedowns and other close-range attacks. His dagger, sword, and bow can be upgraded by killing Uruks (the biggest, nastiest orcs) and collecting ruins.
In addition to his physical armaments, the wraith unlocks a host of other moves for Talion. A teleport ability called Shadow Strike allows him to home in on enemies' locations for quick kills and environmental navigation. For example, if an Uruk archer takes aim on Talion from up on a rampart, he can use Shadow Strike to deftly blink up to the foe. He can also bind foes' feet to the earth, stopping them dead in their tracks. The wraith also lets him slow down the action to dial in accurate shots with his bow. Some Talions' most important abilities involve striking fear into the Uruks.
"Fear is a big part of the gameplay and combat system," de Plater says. "There are a lot of enemies, and it's easy to get overwhelmed. One way to successfully deal with masses of enemies is to make them break and run. It's really helpful if you're fighting a large group, things like taking down their leaders will spread terror among the troops. Terrifying displays of your power will make them flee."
Talion's terrifying touch can bend his foes to do his bidding. Once under Talion's influence, enemy Uruks can become spies used to gather intel or attempt assassinations. For instance, peering into a crowd of Uruks through the eyes of the wraith might reveal a handful of enemies bearing Talion's mark. If a melee breaks out, these turncoats will attack Talion's enemies on his behalf.
Talion's spectral counterpart not only opens up combat options, but also connects him to the drama surrounding Sauron and his mounting power. "Through the course of the game, Talion and the wraith will learn the identity and the secrets of who it is, what brought these two characters together, and also learn how that's connected to the larger story of Middle-earth," de Plater says.
Cantamessa expands on the broader arc of Talion's quest for vengeance: "The final transformation of the character is not something I'm willing to discuss today, because that is where the story will take us," he says. "But it is important to understand that these journeys in life change us and sometimes make us better persons and worse persons. Whatever happens to him will change him forever and will have a big impact on the world of the story."
We know the basics of Talion's former life and his current ordeal, but there are still plenty of questions swirling around his role in Middle-earth's larger conflict. Will his interactions with Gollum link him to Sauron's tireless hunt for the One Ring? Is his wraith counterpart a key player in the wider Tolkien lore? Some Lord of the Rings fans may bristle at any alteration or addition to the written stories, but we have faith in the Tolkien junkies at Monolith. The mysteries swirling around Talion have us excited to enter the land of sleepless evil.

Don't worry! There are ways to protect against them.
Malicious hackers can use tracking pixels to help them gather intelligence for attack campaigns, both mass and targeted in scope.
Digital marketing firms have long used tracking pixels (longer than they've been using the Battery Status API, at least) to analyze email and web marketing campaigns. These pixels are image files that are usually just one pixel in size, a design which prevents users from noticing them in most cases.
With code as simple as <img src="http://example.com/cgi-bin/program?e=email-address"> , the marketing tools ping a website whenever someone downloads an image.
Tracking pixels can do more than just provide notice of someone engaging with a media file. They can also gather information about a user including their IP address, operating system, web browser and send it to a designated email address. The operator of that address can then use that information to fine-tune an advertising campaign.
Unfortunately, tracking pixels don't just help advertisers. Attackers can also abuse them to carry out malicious campaigns.
Donald Meyer of Check Point elaborates on this misuse of tracking pixels in a blog post:
“In phishing attacks, tracking pixels can be used to learn which recipients are most likely to open scam emails. Since some scammers retool mass phishing attacks against random users to target high-value enterprise users, scammers are turning to pixel tracking to increase the odds a spear phishing attack will succeed.… Our security researchers have already discovered tracking pixels being used in the wild as a surveillance tool to gather information for use in phishing scams.”
Indeed, Check Point detected tracking pixels used for a phishing campaign back in August 2016. The red “X's” mark the location of the pixels, which email security tools prevented from loading properly.
Not only that, but because Microsoft Office documents also accommodate tracking pixels, attackers could insert one such image into a Microsoft Word document and send it to multiple individuals in a company. They can then track the documents as they move throughout the organization, mapping the company as they go.
When all is said in done, the bad actors can use this information to conduct targeted attacks in the future.
Fortunately, it's not difficult to protect against this sneaky threat.
Organizations can use anti-phishing and email security solutions to protect against suspicious images. You may be able to prevent your email client from automatically loading images from unapproved senders. Continuous patch management and a healthy dose of skepticism around emails that contain anomalous image placeholders go a long way, too.
A group of Indiana Democrats were arrested in connection with submitting fraudulent voter registrations.
Prosecutors charged 11 temporary canvassers, and their supervisor, Holiday Burke, who were working for the Indiana Voter Registration Project for submitting fraudulent voter registration applications before the 2016 election, according to the Associated Press.
The group is managed by Patriot Majority USA who has links to the Democrat Party, including to former President Bill Clinton and former Sen. Harry Reid, the AP reported.
Focused on getting out the black vote, it became the subject of an investigation in August after Hendricks County flagged around a dozen registrations as suspicious.

Prosecutors and police believe the fraud occurred because of “a very bad, ill-advised business practice” of giving canvassers a daily quota of registrations to meet, according to the AP.
A search warrant unsealed on Nov. 14 says some workers admitted to falsifying registrations, saying they faced the possibility of losing their temporary job if they didn't register at least 10 new voters a day. The probable because affidavit says supervisors told canvassers “to obtain their quota by any means necessary.” Canvassers were paid $10 an hour and worked five-hour shifts.
“By giving someone a financial motive to (meet a quota) is what caused these canvassers to cut corners and do things that not only undermined the goal of having legitimate registered voters but led to a situation where we allege it bled over into criminal conduct,” Marion County Prosecutor Terry Curry said.
If convicted, the defendants face a prison term of up to 2 and 1/2 years. Indiana Voter Registration Project is faced with a fine of as much as $10,000.

This story was updated at 6:00 p.m. ET.
JPMorgan Chase, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, reported a 23 percent increase in profit Wednesday, thanks to a significant drop in provisions set aside to cover losses on home mortgages and credit cards.
But the joy that comes from $4.4 billion in earnings and from beating Wall Street's expectations could be short-lived as the New York-based lender faces mounting investigations and likely lawsuits over its admitted sloppiness in handling home foreclosures. Regulators from all 50 states announced a coordinated investigation today into big banks' foreclosure practices. Expected losses industry-wide could reach into the tens of billions, if not more.
The megabank, which kicked off earnings season for large financial firms, decreased its provisions for losses by more than $5 billion compared to the same period last year, allowing the firm to book its increased profit despite a $3 billion drop in revenue. Analysts and investors are poring over JPMorgan's earnings report gauging the coming announcements by lenders like Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo.
Compared to the third quarter of 2009, the firm reported higher earnings in its credit card and retail lending divisions as fewer borrowers fell behind on their payments, a reflection of a stabilizing economy and the fact that risky borrowers have largely had their credit lines cut or been shut out completely. But the firm reported lower earnings from its investment banking division and from its own trades of various securities as a volatile market and depressed yields on assets took its toll. Overall revenue dropped 11 percent to $23.8 billion compared to last year.
JPMorgan set aside less money for employee pay and bonuses, decreasing the quarterly total by nine percent to $6.7 billion relative to last year. Through nine months it has set aside $21.6 billion, or about one percent less than last year's amount. The amount is also lower relative to total revenue, the firm's records show.
In a likely sign of things to come, the bank set aside an additional $1 billion to cover higher estimated demands to buy back the soured loans it pushed onto investors and government-owned mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It now has $3 billion to cover such requests, which typically come after the party that acquired the mortgage found some kind of defect in the loan documents.
The additional money to cover these demands comes on the heels of the lender being forced to buy back some $1.5 billion in bad mortgages in the quarter ending Sept. 30, a 215 percent increase from the same period last year and a doubling of the amount it was forced to eat in just the three-month period ending in June. Fannie and Freddie, backed by an aggressive government regulator, has been trying to get big banks to buy back the defective home mortgages they were sold or asked to guarantee.
However, those demands could pale in comparison to the losses JPMorgan could be forced to swallow if its reported careless handling of foreclosures escalates into a larger crisis. The firm admitted that it has identified situations where employees or contractors didn't follow the law when processing foreclosures. JPMorgan is reviewing about 115,000 mortgages that are in the foreclosure process, it said. The lender announced that it was expanding its temporary moratorium to 41 states.
An increase in the time it takes to process a foreclosure will only delay the housing -- and overall economic -- recovery. Already, it takes about 448 days on average for a delinquent borrower to fall into foreclosure, the firm said. In Florida it's 678 days; in New York it's 792, or more than two years, according to JPMorgan Chase.
Housing analysts say the process, already gummed up because of the flood of foreclosures and the inadequate staffing and preparation by mortgage services, will likely only get worse than homeowners and investors in mortgage-linked securities initiate litigation to recoup losses from potentially wrongful evictions and soured investments.
Concrete efforts to slow down electric vehicle adoption are taking form. Last week, we reported on the oil and biofuel industries forming an alliance to lobby against electric vehicle incentives and now the same industries are being linked to other efforts to undermine EVs.
A new report links the fossil fuel industry to a series of new legislations being introduced in several states in order to impose fees on electric vehicles.
Those yearly fees are being introduced under the pretext to make up for lost revenue from the gas tax. Several states, like Michigan, have already implemented them, but since the start of the year, six more states have introduced legislations to do the same: Indiana, South Carolina, Kansas, Tennessee, New Hampshire, and Montana.
Some of those fees can cost electric vehicle drivers up to $180 per year.
As we explain in a recent piece ‘Yearly “EV fees” to replace lost gas tax revenue are less reasonable than they seem‘, those fees are misguided and they certainly are not compensating for lost gas tax revenue.
Using the same principle as the gas tax, those fees should be applied to the cost of electricity, which is already taxed. And if the goal is to have EVs pay for the damages they do on public roads, the same idea should be applied to the damages gas-powered cars do to the environment, which is actually much more measurable than the damage passenger cars do on roads.
Most lost revenue from the gas tax are related to the increase in fuel efficiency over the last decade and not to the few hundred thousand EVs on the roads out of the more than 250 million vehicles in the US today.
Now where things are getting interesting is that those new efforts to introduce those electric vehicles fees are being linked to the fossil fuel industries and especially, the multimillion-dollar lobbying campaign against electric vehicles launched by the Koch brothers last year.
We didn't know for sure what legislation those lobbying efforts would lead to, but it seems like we could have a winner.
In a recent report, Gina Coplon-Newfield, Director of Sierra Club's Electric Vehicles Initiative, linked the recent money being spent by those groups to the legislation being introduced this year:
“Reportedly, for more than a year, Koch Industries has spent nearly $10 million dollars, and plans to do so every year, on a campaign to boost petroleum-based transportation fuels and attack government support for electric vehicles. This campaign was presumably created because of the risk EVs place on the oil and coal industry. American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a right-wing state legislation machine funded by the Koch brothers and several other multinational corporations, introduced in December of 2015 a resolution to discourage states from providing subsidies for EVs at their States and Nation Policy Summit.”
What do you think? Is the fossil fuel industry behind those bills and are those fees the right approach to lost gas tax revenue? Let us know in the comment section below.

About
Tiggly lives on after Kickstarter:
"Wow. This is sure to be at the forefront of the next generation of educational apps." - Babyology
"In my experience, kids are using iPhones and iPads younger and younger. Our eight month old stares intently at pictures of baby faces on the iPhone and my son and daughter knew how to slide to unlock before they could crawl. Tiggly Shapes gives them something fun to do on the iPad and, using capacitive touch points, allows them to put shapes on the screen in order to win games and interact with characters." - JOHN BIGGS TECHCRUNCH.COM
Meet Tiggly
With my two year old son Kirkland in mind, I have set out to make the iPad more engaging, fun, educational and age-appropriate for toddlers.
Together with Phyl, my Harvard classmate, (and helped by several other great friends), we've dreamed up Tiggly—real toys and iPad apps that work with these toys.
Our first toy, Tiggly Shapes is a set of shapes for toddlers (target age: 18 months to 3 years) that can be uniquely identified by an iPad. We plan to get Tiggly Shapes into the hands of the toddlers in your life this winter!
Tiggly Shapes includes...
Tiggly Shapes package for our Kickstarter supporters
Safety info: Needless to say, as a father with kids that will use this toy, we're taking every precaution. The shapes will have NO hard corners, small parts, electronics, or batteries. They will be made of a soft, flexible and non-hazardous plastic. You can feel at ease if your child is chewing or throwing these shapes! Finally, before we ship, we'll pay for the best toy testing we can find to ensure we meet all industry safety standards. See our FAQ for more safety details.
Your iPad will also be safe. Tiggly's soft outer cover and silicone touch points won't scratch or harm your iPad.
Tiggly's beginnings
My two-year old son, Kirkland, has always been interested in my iPad since we got one last year. In fact, he's really good at using it. Looking back on it, however, my wife and I probably let Kirkland spend too much time using the iPad. How can you strike a happy medium between real play and the digital world?
Earlier this year, the answer to our question hit me: why couldn't we take something that is age appropriate and that Kirkland does use very well—traditional toys—and add technology so that these toys could be used on an iPad? Imagine the possibilities if we could take one of Kirkland's favorite toys, a wooden shape puzzle, and make it more interactive and engaging by using an iPad! We could keep the best of the digital world and blend it with the physical world.
Okay, so how does the technology work?
CAD rendering of final triangle
Without getting too nerdy, we've created shapes with special sensors that replicate human touch. Each shape has a unique set of touch points that allows our customized iPad games to tell which shape it is. We've been able to create these touch points without using any batteries or electric currents so it's totally safe for your child and you won't have another toy that needs recharging every week.
More about our 3 apps
We have 3 apps under development that encourage both creative and critical thinking and are specially designed for our shapes and for toddlers!
Tiggly Safari is a fun, immersive app where toddlers are guided to place shapes on the screen to form animals that come to life Target age: 2 to 3 years
Go on a shape Safari!
Tiggly Draw allows toddlers to use the Tiggly Shapes as stamps and as paint brushes. Target age: 18 months and up
Tiggly Match is a game that teaches kids how to identify shapes. Target age: 18 months to 2 years
You can learn more about each of these apps in the FAQ section.
In developing these apps, you can rest assured that we are consulting with creative and educational advisors with decades of experience working with toddlers to build the best possible apps. Additionally, we're testing our beta apps weekly to ensure that we're creating quality learning and fun. In the coming months we hope to release even more great educational apps that work with Tiggly Shapes.
How did we get here?
The many prototypes leading up to our final star
In April we built a rough prototype that we tested with dozens of kids. With even a basic app, kids were still very engaged—and parent feedback was incredibly positive. Phyl and I also spoke with over 50 folks in the toy, retail, app, and early child education industries.
Over the summer, we worked with an industrial design firm to create and test a variety of design concepts with toddlers and parents. We went through 6 different iterations including mock-ups and 3D prints. Our final design met all our key criteria: safe for the toddler, safe for the screen, inviting to play with and easy to hold and use.
T-Shirt designs for our backers
What's next?
We wanted to start with a simple product for the youngest iPad users, hence Tiggly Shapes! However, we really believe adding a physical element to the iPad can enrich learning in so many different ways and have a long list of additional toy ideas for kids of all ages.
***A special thanks to our design advisor, Will Gridley***
***We can't forget our fellow classmates who were instrumental to developing the concept and launching our first phase: Jill Dorans, Gopesh Mittal, Mike Tomkins, Janee Wilson-Key***
you can't have all that. not on GIT and not on SVN.
you've already realized that your requirements conflict with each other and even admitted that your current setup does not cover all the situations so you should change the way you're approaching this problem.
instead of demanding certain capabilities from the tool try to explain what are the actual problems that need to be solved and allow people to suggest ways to solve them, chances are those won't be things you've already considered.
I'll try now to answer the problems you've shown on the comments and completely ignore your initial request, I hope it helps more with the actual situation you're in.
we cannot afford a timeline where the commit messages of every (10-15) modules display in the same place
unlike SVN, in GIT you have branches (real branches) and each branch will have its own history so as long as your devs use branches and you merge them instead of using rebase you should be able to isolate each branch log with the appropiate commands, see git log --graph to get the idea.
currently merges are anxiogenic and therefore developers try to avoid merges as often as possible
there's no real solution for this but there are ways to mitigate the problem.
one way is to have several clones of the repo along with the master copy, if your team is about 40 people and you have 10-15 modules then I guess you have small teams there that focus in particular areas/modules; if that's the case then each subteam should have its own clone of the repo and merge locally there before merging back to the master copy.
this approach effectively splits the merge process (and the responsibility) in two phases, one that concerns the changes within the subteam and another that deals with the interaction with the rest of the modules.
But I must keep the use case 4 (move and edit) to give Git a clear lead in the developer eyes and tame that fear of merge
I'll be completely honest, UC#4 is impossible*. particularly on GIT where the mv operation is actually a composition of rm and add .
perhaps if the addition happens before the movement some (d)VCS can figure it out but I don't think that's the case for GIT, even so I think you're taking the wrong way to "tame that fear of merge" let me explain.
* @sleske suggests checking this thread for a way to do UC#4
the reason people fear the merge is because they don't understand it and SVN forces you to merge upstream (that is, on the server) which adds pressure, the problem with your approach is that by trying to help them avoid it you're reinforcing the idea that merges are something obscure and dangerous that should be avoided, don't do that.
if you want them to get over the fear you need to train them so they have the tools to deal with the situation, in other words don't help them avoid the problem force them to solve it, teach them about all the merges and conflict styles, tell them about rerere , even teach them the octopus merge which I've never used but what he hell teach them that too! and then MAKE them practice so it becomes something they know and can handle.
merges in GIT aren't as stressful as with SVN because they're also local so you can do them as many times as you want without fear of screwing other peoiple's environment, you'll only push them once you're absolutely sure they're ok.
that's all for now, if you have additional concerns add a comment and I'll see if I have an idea, good luck!
Bob's Burgers always serves up big laughs for the holidays, but on Sunday, open wide for a supersize Christmas meal. The animated comedy's hour-long episode — a musical, to boot! — kicks into gear with Linda awakening from a magical dream and deciding to throw a party to brighten up this blue Yuletide season. Alas, someone steals the top of her special ornament-studded tree. “Right when she was trying to do something bright for the holidays, the most evil thing possible happens,” creator Loren Bouchard tells EW. “She wants her kids' ornaments back, they're irreplaceable. She goes on a tear, she hunts down her friends and neighbors, one by one, because anyone who was at that party is a suspect. Bob is very concerned that she is too emotional about this.”
Meanwhile, Teddy tells the kids about a chilling mythical creature named the Bleaken. They come to believe that the Bleaken is the thief — and he'll be coming back soon for their presents — so they embark on an adventure to hunt down this anti-Santa. How dangerous does it get? “By the end of this thing, we're in a tunnel, the lights go out, and all the characters think they might die,” says Bouchard. “This is a serious Christmas — yet full of surprises.”
One of those is Star Wars actor Adam Driver, who voices an artist/nude model named Art the Artist. Art attends Linda's party, which makes him one of many suspects. Two things you should know. One: “He's nude in that scene,” says Bouchard. And two: he will sing. “He did a wonderful voice and he sings in this very sweet — I want to call it a young Emo Philips — voice,” says Bouchard. “It's this adorable character that he plays.”
The episode also contains a big closing number called “Twinkly Lights,” and it contains a pointed message for these trying times in America. “There are a lot of white Christmas lights, but it takes all colors of lights,” says Bouchard. “That is an important point to make.”
Above, you can get a preview of the Bleaken in this clip from “The Bleakening,” which airs Sunday at 8:30 p.m. ET/PT.
What's that? You also want a tiny Tina tease? “You get to see Tina holding a battle ax in a fantasy,” says Bouchard, “and you get to see Tina fight with a ruler in reality.” Merry Buttsmas!
For the next two weeks, Czech visual artist Federico Díaz has the tough job of watching – but not touching – as his shimmering 20-ton public art piece “Subtile” is installed along West Sacramento's river walk near Raley Field.
“Subtile” was built and assembled by Díaz and his team in Prague before being dismantled and shipped to West Sacramento. Now, he and his team are reduced to coaching as West Sacramento workers retrace their steps.
He's not allowed to reassemble his own art because he doesn't have American contractors insurance to cover any damage that could occur while erecting the complicated structure along a popular running trail.
Monday was Díaz's first day on-site along the Sacramento River levee. By early afternoon, workers were ready to use a boom lift to raise and painstakingly lower the third of dozens of undulating side segments into place.

Each piece requires the precision of a moon landing to line up each bolt just right. Workers in hard hats and orange safety vests then hand-tighten nuts. Díaz and two other team members pointed, instructed and consulted as the $500,000 piece slowly took shape.
Díaz's works have appeared in museums in Tokyo, London, Miami and Shanghai, but this will be his first outdoor public art piece.
Fully assembled, “Subtile” will be 26 feet long, 14 feet high and 6 feet wide. Its complex, wavy structure, formed by steel panels, will be covered by 34,000 stainless steel disks making the object, evocative of a cloud, appear to disappear into the environment at the right distance, Díaz said.
“It will be the most significant public art project we've done as a city,” said West Sacramento Mayor Christopher Cabaldon.
The art installation is the latest in the decades-long effort to turn a former industrial zone along the Sacramento River into a hip housing, retail and entertainment district. Cabaldon said the new public art will build on what's already happening with The Barn outdoor gathering space farther south along West Sacramento's river walk.
“Subtile” was funded with $394,850 from a state grant aimed at bringing art to areas with low-income housing – the Bridge District includes 70 units of affordable housing at the Rivermark building – and $200,000 in developer fees. Besides paying for the artwork, funds cover installation, landscaping and city overhead.
West Sacramento officials worked with Shelly Willis, former director of Sacramento Metropolitan Arts Commission, to create the public art selection process. “Subtile” was the unanimous pick, beating out works by San Francisco sound artist Bill Fontana, Brooklyn artist Janet Zweig and Maine sculptor John Bisbee.
The 2016 selection and installation of an $8 million sculpture by artist Jeff Koons outside of Sacramento's Golden 1 Center faced criticism from residents who said more of that funding should have gone to local artists. Cabaldon said he's not expecting similar pushback.
The piece is already turning heads as runners, cyclists and residents wonder, “What is that thing?”
Díaz frequently tries to use his work to probe the human understanding of the environment.
“Federico Díaz uses new media – or work made with technology – to make invisible aspects of the natural environment visible,” states the 2015 staff report asking the City Council to approve the selection.
The first week of the build involves connecting the wavy frame core of the structure. The second week involves attaching the 34,000 stainless steel disks to the undulating structure. Each piece will shimmer in the wind.
“The Sacramento River with its originally flourishing ecosystem is a place for hope. Moreover, it's a place for change; this is the place to show our awareness of the environment we inhabit,” Diaz said in his artist's statement. “We can't take back what has already been done, but we can try to make things better for the future.”
Health inspectors have scoured the county to find the 15 Kent food outlets that need the most urgent hygiene improvements.
From mouldy food to dirty surfaces or even mouse or cockroach infestations - inspectors can list several reasons for giving restaurants or takeaways a zero food hygiene rating.
In some cases sewage is even found in the food preparation areas, which can be hazardous to health.
Scroll down for video and audio
Kent's zero rated food outlets, according to the Food Standards Agency on Wednesday, May 25 (scroll down for list)
However, some outlets can score zero stars on technicalities such as a temporary broken boiler, and have to wait until their next inspection before they can improve their rating.
The restaurants and takeaways on this list scored zero out of five for food hygiene on their last published inspection. The list also covers schools, clubs and some shops.
A zero-star rating indicates "urgent improvement is necessary'" and inspectors have the power to close down a business if they think there is an immediate risk to the public.
VIDEO: Reporter Josie Hannett visits a zero rated takeaway in Dover
When they visit a food outlet, inspectors look at three areas: the hygiene of the food, the cleanliness of work surfaces and appliances, and how well management keeps cleaning records and acts on criticism.
The Food Standards Agency, which oversees the national food hygiene rating scheme, says outlets with a zero rating are likely to have scored badly against all three criteria.
David Brown, leader of the food inspection team at Medway Council, described some of the things that would warrant a zero-star rating.
"You might have a serious pest control problem, or a drainage problem - staff can't wash their hands properly for example.
"Or in some cases you find sewage coming into food preparation areas, which is a serious health concern."
<!-- comment -->
He also warned that appearances may be deceptive.
"You can't always judge a book by its cover. Sometimes the outside looks grotty but the kitchen might be immaculate. Sometimes the reverse is true."
The good news is the number of zero-star ratings is down more than 25% on last year, which saw 22 outlets score nothing.
However, dozens of food outlets across Kent and Medway have scored just one star out of five, which still raises serious concern over cleanliness.
A one-star rating means 'major improvement necessary' according to the Food Standards Agency, indicating the business has performed badly against the three inspection criteria.
Inspectors look at the cleanliness of surfaces and appliances during their a to a food outlet
But even including the one-star ratings, the list is just a tiny proportion of the 10,729 food outlets in the county, 94% of which have three stars or above, according to the Food Standards Agency.
And generally speaking, standards have never been higher, according to Mr Brown.
He said: "Businesses look at competitors and if a similar outlet has a four or five-star rating that is a serious driver to improvement.
"Consumers are also increasingly aware of the rating system, and increasingly are asking questions and voting with their feet."
Local authorities are responsible for monitoring food safety standards, and most premises are visited once a year, or more regularly if a problem has been identified.
Cockroaches were clearly visible in the kitchen
So we've looked at the places you probably don't want to eat at, now check out our pick of the best 45 restaurants in Kent.
Cliftonville Primary School in Margate will be one of the outlets aggrieved to find itself on the zero-star list.
Headteacher Jane Troth said the rating related solely to issues with a faulty boiler, which supplied hot water to the kitchen.
She added: "Thanet District Council agreed to food preparation continuing with temporary measures put in place to provide hot water.
"Kent County Council is in the process of installing a new boiler and the school is confident the previously awarded rating of five will be given on re-inspection."

Devo English Wikipedia has an article on: Wikipedia
Associated with the band Devo's concept of "de-evolution".
Intel, the chip giant, has committed $50 million and engineering resources as part of a 10-year partnership with a Dutch university to advance research in quantum computing. The partnership with Delft University of Technology and TNO, the Dutch Organization for Applied Research, will involve research and materials at Intel and at the university.
Intel (INTC) is not the only big name company involved with quantum computing. Google (GOOG) has a quantum computing lab it operates with NASA and has experimented with a quantum computer from D-Wave Systems, a Canadian startup. Lockheed Martin has also purchased a D-wave machine, while IBM (IBM) has invested significant amounts in basic quantum computing research in its labs.
Perhaps Intel is ready to publicly admit that Moore's Law is on its last legs and that it's time to start seeking other ways of moving computing forward. The chip giant's co-founder Gordon Moore coined the law, which posits that the number of transistors on a chip would double every two years, and Intel has reaped the benefits of making ever smaller chips crammed with more and more transistors. The entire computing industry has profited in the form of faster, cheaper, and smaller computers.
Now that model is coming to an end as physics make it more challenging and expensive keep up with Moore's Law, which means researchers are looking elsewhere. Quantum computing, which is completely unlike traditional transistor-based computing, is one avenue of research. Quantum computers could solve problems other computers can't, such as simulations of large-scale financial analysis and molecules that could lead to drug development.
Rather than working with binary ones and zeros as transistors do, quantum computing is more probabilistic. It uses quantum entanglement to allow a combination of zeros and ones to simultaneously answer many questions with quantum bits of information. These quantum bits of information are called qubits, and they generally only hold their state when they are kept very, very cold.
Mike Mayberry, Intel vice president and managing director of Intel Labs, explained in a press release that Intel could help make quantum computing a reality, not with quantum theory so much as the specialized electronics that connect the qubits: “While qubit development has been the focus of quantum computing research to date, low-temperature electronics will be required to connect, control, and measure multiple qubits, and this is where we can contribute.”
It's an exciting area of research, although one that has always been about a dozen years out since I started covering computing 14 ago. Yet, in the last five years, several big-name companies have started putting more engineering muscle and money behind quantum computing. So maybe Intel's CEO Brian Krzanich was correct when he wrote in a blog on this investment:
Intel can help advance progress in this field through our leading manufacturing, electronics and architectural expertise. We can help with scaling this technology. Why am I so confident? Because this is what we do best. This research is on the cutting edge of silicon, architecture and software. Intel's entire history has been built on driving innovations in the very leading edge of all three of these.
Maybe this time around we really will see quantum computing a dozen years from now.

Question: What is wrong with this speech regarding my decision not to have children?
“…well, firstly, as the world's population has surged to over seven billion, I feel it is more ethical to adopt one of the many children already needing parents if I decide to become a mother. I also have a job that entails me being photographed nude and tied up. I don't want to be responsible for the mental scarring or bullying that will come when my hypothetical kid finds the pictures. Not to mention I don't want to pass on the cancer that runs in my family…”
Answer: It should never have to be said.
Though sadly I have found myself parroting versions of the speech whenever the subject of my decision to remain childfree comes up. I get told that I'll change my mind, that I'll regret not having children- and even once “I don't believe you”.
If somebody who's been a couch potato for decades suddenly says they're joining a gym, the accepted response is not “oh, you'll go twice and go back to watching the television”.
If someone says that they intend to visit Africa and help with Water Aid, it is rude to say “no you won't- everyone says it and hardly anyone does it.”
However, when a woman says she does not wish to reproduce, she will often receive a dismissive standard response whether the person she's talking to is a close relative or a total stranger.
I recently posted a questionnaire for women who do not wish to have children. I asked them two questions:
1) Have you ever come across offensive attitudes because of your decision? (“You'll change your mind”, “all women want children”…)
2) If so, how did/do you respond to or deal with the situation?
Almost every woman responded to the first question by listing the many hurtful comments they had received. These are often so rude and persistent that some women expressed the wish that they were sterile so that they would have a reason to not have children. That saddened me – wishing that there is something biologically wrong just to have a culturally acceptable reason for the decision…
Most of the women dealt with the situation by listing the reasons why they do not want to reproduce – defending themselves rather than challenging the mindset of the person speaking. It's a logical thing to do; when someone doesn't understand your point-of-view, it seems like a good idea to justify it, especially when it is not considered the norm. But that does not mean it is the best thing to do.
Women are now able to go out to work, choose when to have a child and then decide whether to go back to work or not. Thanks to contraception, we now have the means to control when we would like to get pregnant and if we find ourselves pregnant by accident, to choose from the options available. While any these decisions can attract judgement, it is not socially acceptable to challenge a total stranger's choice to their face!
Women should be able to choose not to reproduce, without it being questioned, ridiculed, or debated.
So what can we do?
It is very easy to label parents as ‘breeders' and snigger at Youtube videos made by people having a rant. The problem is, while you're angry it can make you feel a lot better but at the same time, it creates a divide between the parents and the childfree, which helps no-one.
– Try not to buy into the backlash and rant about ‘Mumzillas' on Facebook. Not every parent considers little Jayden's poo to be the highlight of their day. In the same way that many child-free women worry about being labelled “babyhaters”, I have known many intelligent and interesting parents who worry that they will be rejected based on the fact that they now have offspring! Give parents a chance. (And peace too!)
– If you are a proud parent and have used the ‘you'd be an amazing mother/father' line, although it's meant as a compliment, it rarely gets taken that way. No matter how good you feel your friend would be, and no matter how gently you are using your powers of persuasion, respect their decision- it is not yours to make.
– Don't get into an argument. You wouldn't demand to know why your neighbours have had children; you are not obliged to give them a reason for you not having any. Unless you personally feel comfortable answering the “why” question, it is usually best to just re-iterate that this is what you have decided and you don't feel it necessary to elaborate.
– I've been lucky- my mum has always accepted my choice, but if you have a particularly persistent friend or relative, then depending on your relationship with them, it might be worth taking them aside for a quick heart-to-heart. Explain that while they may be disappointed, you have made your decision and constantly having to defend it upsets you. They may not realise how rude they are being, and if they do know, it's a good opportunity to take control and tell them firmly that you no longer wish to discuss the subject if they cannot respect your view.
– I'm twenty-four, and although I have some wonderful friends who are parents, I sadly lost a good friend too. From the moment she decided she wanted a baby, XX was unrecognisable, and when I visited after XY was born, I couldn't speak for more than ten seconds without her interrupting me to burble at the baby. She didn't even try to converse- it was as if I wasn't there. After two years, no change and a lot of soul searching, I decided to stop calling her. She never called me to ask why she hadn't heard from me, and we never spoke again.
Sadly, it can happen and the best thing to do sometimes is let go. When all your friends start having children, it can be lonely (I certainly was) even if they are still awesome and just don't have as much free time anymore. I looked online for Meetup groups for childfree people. They exist! The aim is to make new friends, meet up and talk (and not just about being childfree). It's a good site for horizon-broadening if you do find yourself lonely.
Example answers to questions you may face
When you find a man you really love, you'll want to give him children.
Any man who wants children is not a man I could really love.
How can you deny your parents grandchildren?
If they want another generation of kids to look after, they can adopt another generation of kids to look after.
Don't you care about future generations?
I care so much that I want to limit the population so we can renew resources.
OR
I'm praying for the zombie apocalypse.
Your body was made for childbirth.
And yours was apparently made to be rude and insulting, that doesn't mean we both have to fulfil our destiny.
What if you regret it later?
I'd rather regret not having a child than have one and then resent them.
But it's a biological urge!
Institutions await those who can't control their biological urges!
You're still very young- you might change your mind.
I might, and I might also… *insert equally improbable thing* …but I really don't think I will, so please respect me by accepting that decision.
When considering what answers to questions like these would best suit you, bear in mind you shouldn't have to have your private and personal decisions escalate into an argument (see also: how to argue like an adult).
Remember…
Sometimes, people know right from the start that they would one day like to be parents. For some, it dawns on them slowly and when they finally do give birth to or adopt a child, it's a fantastic day for them.
Other people grow up, get married and then have a baby without really thinking about it, because it is just something that is expected. It doesn't mean that they don't love their child, but that perhaps they'd still have been happy without one.
There are seven billion people on this planet – ensuring the survival of the species is not a task that we need to worry about (thank goodness) and there is no reason for every woman in the world to have a child. There is nothing wrong with choosing not to, for whatever reason. All that matters is that it is your decision.
Keep supporting your right to make it.

Hiring a software development firm is often one of the largest decisions a new web or mobile product company will make. Questions about technology choices, programming languages, frameworks, development methodologies, and the like are all important, but so are the non-technical questions sometimes overlooked by technically-focused or inexperienced entrepreneurs and product authors. Here are a few to keep in mind.
Can I see what you're doing on my project on a daily or weekly basis?
This is a question about transparency and the more transparent a firm, the better. You really do want to see how the sausage is made. Increased visibility into the building of your application is going to help you avoid common pitfalls, and increase the likelihood that you get the results you want.
When you work closely with a development firm, watching your application come to life, you'll be in a much better position to evaluate for yourself the value you're receiving. You'll also be able to judge the pace (or velocity) of development, and make your own estimations as to whether the project is on track from a timing or budgetary standpoint.
Can I adjust my feature set and specifications as we go?
Unless you're building a very trivial application chances are you're going to want to make course corrections (change the scope) throughout the development process. You might need to re-prioritize features to take advantage of a new opportunity, or you may want to respond to initial user feedback. That feedback could mean dropping features you had planned for at the outset and replacing them with ones you hadn't even thought of, or even significantly changing your approach (AKA a pivot). This flexibility is often the difference between the success and failure of a project or business, but it comes at the expense of budget certainly. This is why the transparency we discussed earlier is so important. You've got to ensure your development team is delivering working software incrementally, and that you're in a position to evaluate its value. With high visibility, that evaluation should be easy since you see exactly what you've got, and you know how much it cost.
Can I meet and work directly with the designers and developers on my project?
At the end of the day people, not processes, tools, or frameworks, are building your software. Working with people that “get” what you're trying to accomplish and have internalized your objectives will result in much better outcomes.
You'll know you've got a team that “gets it” if they ask you why you want something built, not just what you want built. The impact this has on a project is massive. Designers will ensure that they are creating a user experience that is aligned with your users, and developers will push back on features they think are cumbersome or won't be used (or both), and will suggest alternatives that provide better value. If you're hiring a top-notch firm they are going to have some very smart people working for them, and you want their input.
Who owns the code and designs you produce for me (AKA the work product and deliverables)?
If the answer to this question isn't a resounding “You do,” your Spidey sense should start tingling. You want all the work done for you to be defined as a “work made for hire” under the US Copyright Act. If it isn't, you may run into issues when you want to sell, or otherwise transfer rights to someone else, since you can't sell something you don't own.
Some firms may carve out certain exceptions for open source software and development tools, which is generally appropriate. Just make sure the line is clear between those two different types of deliverables / work products.
Will you help me transition to an in-house team or mentor and train my team?
At some point you may want to take new feature development or maintenance in-house. A leading development firm will view this transition as an indicator of a successful project, and will be very supportive in the transition.
The best way to make this transition is to hire your own developer, who can be integrated into the firms existing development process as tightly as the firm will allow. That way the new developer will not only learn the code-base, but will also pick up on what should be a mature and well tested development and deployment process. If you're asking your development firm to take a new hire under their wing, keep in mind they will probably want the opportunity to interview your candidates, because they will want to make sure you end up with someone that can do the job and will fit in with the rest of the team.

When Rick Santorum and Ted Cruz decided to speak at a South Carolina summit over the weekend hosted by birther, anti-Muslim conspiracy theorist Frank Gaffney, it was no surprise that they encountered activists who were, let's say, a bit on the fringe.
For example, one attendee asked Santorum why Republicans in Congress did nothing to stop “communist dictator” Obama from “destroying my country,” mentioning the president's executive actions on immigration and the time when “Obama tried to blow up a nuke in Charleston a few months ago.” (In case you aren't familiar, several far-right outlets and pundits have embraced a bizarre claim that Obama tried to nuke Charleston as part of a potential false flag operation). “I want him out of the White House, he's not a citizen and he could've been removed a long time ago,” she added.
Santorum told the questioner that congressional Republicans are showing a “complete lack of leadership” in failing to stop Obama's “dangerous” immigration actions: “As you've mentioned, the word tyrant comes to mind.”
He said that just as the courts have embraced “judicial supremacy,” Obama is now seizing powers from Congress, whose members don't realize that “there is a fire ranging that's going to burn the whole forest down as you worry about the tree in front of you.”
“This is the unraveling,” Santorum said, explaining that Republicans should have “shut down the government,” refused to confirm any nominee or “pass any bills” in order to have “hearing after hearing on the unconstitutionality of what this president has done.”
Later in the summit, an attendee told Santorum that Obama is an “Iranian plant” who is working with Valerie Jarrett to secretly help the Iranian regime.
Federal Reserve Has New Worries About Inflation Rate
After years of concern about prices and wages going up too much, central banks are worried about too little inflation. Linda Wertheimer talks to David Wessel of the Brookings Institution.
LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST:
For much of the past half-century the Federal Reserve and the Central Banks of other major economies have worried about too much inflation. But lately their worry has been the opposite - too little. The U.S. government releases the latest consumer price index data tomorrow. Joining us now to tell us what to expect and to explain why low inflation is now the enemy is David Wessel. He's the director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution, and a contributor to The Wall Street Journal. David welcome.
DAVID WESSEL: Good morning.
WERTHEIMER: So what are the inflation gauges reading now?
WESSEL: Well, in the United States the consumer price index has been rising about a 2 percent annual pace. But the inflation gauged that the Fed favors - it's called the personal consumption expenditures price index, clearly not chosen because the words trip off the tongue. It' been running well below the Fed's target of 2 percent for the past 12 months. Now we get updated forecasts from the Fed later this week, but the last one showed that most Fed officials show - expect inflation to be below the target well into 2016. It's been rising at about 1.6 percent over the last 12 months. Now, a lot of people are skeptical of these government numbers because they tend to remember the prices of things that go up and ignore the prices of things that go down. But the best data show us that prices are rising very slowly here in the United States, and the problem is even more acute in Europe. The countries that share the euro currency have reported inflation of just 0.5 percent for the last 12 months, which is why their central bank has been getting increasingly aggressive.
WERTHEIMER: David we're told repeatedly that inflation is a very bad thing, the cost of living rises, prices go up, something to be avoided. So how can too little of a bad thing be a bad thing?
WESSEL: Well that's a good question. (Laughing) So too much inflation is definitely bad for an economy, but so is too little inflation. I mean it sounds appealing, prices going down, people paying less at the store. But when inflation is low that means wages are going up very slowly too. That's of course not very popular. There are a couple of problems with too little inflation. It can be a symptom of a lousy economy, one in which demand for goods and services and workers is anemic. It can make it hard for the Fed to spur borrowing because it's hard for them to get the interest rate below the inflation rate. Particularly once rates hit zero as they did in 2008 and have remained there, and it also means that an economy is closer to what they call deflation which is a generalized decline in wages and prices and that's not healthy.
WERTHEIMER: And deflation is how serious?
WESSEL: Well it's very hard for an economy to prosper when wages and prices are falling. That's been a problem in Japan for the past couple of decades. Yeah when prices and wages decline incomes decline, but the amount of money that you owe does not fall. So you get less money every month but your monthly payments on your debts do not fall, and that can be a very insidious development in an economy.
WERTHEIMER: You know, David, I wonder if the tools of the Federal Reserve are exhausted in terms of stimulating the economy as you suggest. What do you do then?
WESSEL: Well, that's a good question. So it used to be that economists believed that a central bank can always create inflation by printing more money. But lately it's been -seems harder to do that than the textbooks had told us. An interesting case is Japan where only when the government - the elected government and the central bank got together and said we're going to do whatever it takes to create inflation, running deficits, printing money, talking about inflation has managed to get the inflation rate closer to their target above zero finally for the first time in years.
WERTHEIMER: David, thanks very much.
WESSEL: You're welcome.
