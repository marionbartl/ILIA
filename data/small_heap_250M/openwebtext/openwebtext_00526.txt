Donald Trump is conducting an unprecedented experiment in running a barebones campaign, in which he is not only the candidate, but also his campaign's top surrogate, rapid-response operation, de facto press secretary, and primary fundraiser.
Some of the problems with that approach are beginning to show. On a rhetorical level, his attack on Judge Gonzalo Curiel was a disaster, suggesting his own self-interest and earning him harsh condemnation from fellow Republicans. His response to the massacre in Orlando—renewing his call for a moratorium on Muslims entering the country, and implying President Obama is a traitor—may endear him to elements of his base, but it has also frustrated many Republicans. The result is that the bottom has started to fall out of Trump's poll numbers.
One culprit for this may not just be Trump's own rhetorical indulgences. Trump is suddenly being hit with a lot of television advertising. Politico, not typically given to overwrought headlines, announces, “Clinton to unleash TV hell on Trump.” The Clinton campaign is about to spend “eight figures” in eight swing states: Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, and Virginia. All of those are swing states that Obama won twice, except North Carolina, which he won in 2008 but not 2012; the Trump nomination is considered by some forecasters to have put the state in play. Meanwhile, the buy excludes upper Midwestern states that Trump thinks he can win, but which Democrats apparently don't think he can. Some of the ads are positive, but others are decidedly not.
Clinton is going on the air now, but Priorities USA, a Democratic super PAC that's backing her, has already been on the air, not least with “Grace,” a powerful and hard-hitting ad that pounds Trump for his mockery of a disabled reporter:
Priorities are dropping a reported $20 million on that ad so far, which means a total spending of at least $30 million between it and the Clinton campaign. That's nearly half as much as Trump's rivals spent against him through mid-April, around $70 million, according to Kantar Media—and that was over the course of several months. Throughout the primary, Trump's rivals hesitated to attack him, in part because they believed that he'd burn himself out and didn't want to alienate his backers. By the time they realized their error, Trump was effectively unstoppable. Some of the biggest spends against Trump instead came from outside conservative groups like the Club for Growth.
News Altcoins are Going SegWit for Price Boost of a Lifetime
Little-known altcoin DigiByte is following Litecoin and Syscoin in making investors rich with impending SegWit activation.
DigiByte Celebrates Countdown To Ultimate Pump
Metrics highlighted by developers Saturday show the proportion of DigiByte miner support at 72.48% – inching past the 70% activation threshold.
“6 more days to go till activation at this rate! Happy Easter everyone!” a Twitter post added.
We have hit the 70% activation threshold for #Segwit on #DigiByte! 6 more days to go till activation at this rate! Happy Easter everyone! pic.twitter.com/f2zErDq4J9 — DigiByte (@DigiByteCoin) April 16, 2017
Despite having barely made a name for itself prior to the announcement, DigiByte is currently 63rd in CoinMarketCap's cryptocurrency listings, its price increasing 15% in the 24 hours to press time Sunday and having more than doubled since the beginning of April.
SegWit Spinning Gold Across The Board
The events continue an increasingly familiar pattern of behavior among altcoins. Both Litecoin and Syscoin have already benefitted from elevated interest, trading and publicity from SegWit activation ‘likelihood,' with traders rejoicing after extended periods of flat prices.
Litecoin is currently trading at $10.76 per token, maintaining highs not seen since 2014 and dwarfing the many months it spent dormant at just under $4.
SysCoin's story is almost identical. Having staged a modest increase in April 2016 following a 50% supply cut, prices remained at around $0.01 per token until SegWit activation announcements saw them treble to $0.03.
Reactions to the altcoin phenomenon have been mixed. While SegWit potentially provides a convenient method for get-rich-quick schemes, reflecting on Bitcoin's battle with the technology's activation, BitFury CEO George Kikvazde was rueful.
“One can only imagine at what price level bitcoin would be now, if a sound, well-tested tech like segwit had been activated,” he mused last week as Litecoin's success edged closer.
Bitcoin & SegWit Still Unholy Matrimony
In further Bitcoin news, major Chinese mining pool F2pool said on Friday in accordance with its poll results it would be implementing SegWit on both Litecoin and Bitcoin “soon.”
As 56% from the poll in favor of segwit & agreed UASF is bad. We'll respect ur opinion and implement segwit on both BTC & LTC soon. Thanks. pic.twitter.com/bOI8VusM2j — Wang Chun (@f2pool_wangchun) April 15, 2017
The decision comes despite lead figure Wang Chun's frequent criticism of Bitcoin Core and preference for a user-activated soft fork (UASF).
Following the SegWit statement, Chun likened Core to Chairman Mao, with users similar to the Red Guard.

In the weeks since Trump's election, Portland has seen the rise of a campaign of a protracted street mobilization and some of the most defiant manifestations against the election of Donald Trump and the white supremacy, exploitative economic policies and the misogyny that he represents.
Alongside these mobilizations there has been the development of many tangible community organizing efforts. With individuals, affinity groups and organizations putting together ongoing community self defense workshops across the city and the development of neighborhood meetings and assemblies occurring on a regular basis, many are asking them selves the question, what's next?
In response to this need for the development of a long term strategy a new initiative called The Portland Assembly has been created. It aims to unite community organizations and individuals toward direct action, solidarity and mutual aid, as well as provide a recurring opportunity for community members to plug into ongoing organizing efforts and to engender their own.
As the state is further politicized by the new administration we look toward the development of localized neighborhood assemblies as directly-democratic bodies of community power, to provide the means to fight. Based on the ideas of Anarchist Murray Bookchin's Libertarian Municipalism and Democratic Confederalism, we believe we must build a united front against the far right.
But it can't just be a reaction. We must present a bold vision for a new urbanism that emphasizes the necessity of direct democracy, the right to the city and has the capacity to bring together different neighborhood assemblies, left groups and anarchist formations throughout the urban area into a city wide Spokescouncil.
We believe we must organize in bigger and better ways than ever before to keep our communities safe against the threats that have been presented to us. As such we believe in a necessity to immediately develop a citywide directly democratic infrastructure to facilitate the development of dual power structures to assist in the creation of programs to provide material necessities to our communities when food stamps, health care and access to reproductive rights inevitably come under attack. We believe we must organize city wide community self-defense initiatives to protect our communities from groups who desire to perpetuate hate crimes and right wing political violence, we must engender systems of mutual aid and solidarity to keep Portland a sanctuary city and defend against attempts to remove undocumented people from their homes and families.
Rather than create a new political party or hierarchical centralized organization to perpetuate this work we seek to generate an inclusive framework that allows for a multiplicity of political perspectives and forms of organizations to take autonomous actions while having access to one another to better coordinate and gain needed resources so as to engender the formulation of the various projects and programs that must be created to survive Trumpism.
Furthermore, we hope to create a space that is inclusive to both seasoned activists and people new to the movement who are eager to get involved. To use this structure as an incubator for neighborhood organizing and to assist the already developing and ongoing neighborhood assemblies/meetings that have been taking place through the city in the weeks since Trump's election.
As we proceed we provide this suggested model to other cities in hopes that it incubates ideas and hope for surviving and moving beyond Trumpism and ultimately manifesting a truly egalitarian society in the ashes of the old!
As such we now have out strategic guide “Lets Run Rip City: A Guide to Keep Portland Powerful in the Face of Trumpism” available here.
Computers have become more powerful and more portable, letting you execute some compute-intensive tasks on your laptop. But internet connections have also become incredibly faster, making it much easier to outsource some tasks to servers sitting in a data center.
Most of the apps on your phone already rely on a server component to store and process your data. When you post a video on Facebook, it gets re-encoded into multiple formats on the server so that other users can stream your video in SD, HD, etc.
But I think this trend is going to become even more important in the coming years, with all your devices acting as a simple screen into your stuff running on servers in data centers near you.
First, internet connection speeds and latency need to improve drastically for everyone. I'm lucky that I live in Paris, a dense city with efficient infrastructure. I get around 800 Mbps and 250 Mbps of download and upload speeds at home. And I can ping all data centers around Paris in less than 2 milliseconds with a wired connection.
Second, I've valued portability over specs for years. I'm currently typing this article on the tiny 12-inch MacBook. It's a lightweight, fanless device that is more or less than powerful as the MacBook Pro I was previously using.
Raw performance has more or less stagnated for laptops if you opt for the lightest device you can get. At the same time, more tasks are relying on powerful graphics processing units. Creative people manage bigger photos and 4K video footage. Even your browser has become more demanding.
Third, companies need to develop services that everybody can use without any coding experience. For instance Adobe could release thin clients of Photoshop, Premiere Pro and other apps with all the heavy work happening on a server. I feel like Adobe's subscription model is the perfect opportunity to try this with an optional add-on.
Even without reinventing the wheel, some companies are innovating in this space. French startup Blade is working on a service called Shadow, mostly for cloud gaming. It is running thousands of virtual machines on server-grade Intel Xeon processors with a dedicated Nvidia GTX 1070 for each user. You can get your personal instance for around $32.70 per month (€30).
At first, I was quite skeptical as cloud gaming has never worked perfectly well due to latency, image compression and restrictions. But in this case, you get a full-fledged Windows 10 desktop environment with great network performances.
The company has just released Windows and Android apps, and it is currently working on a macOS app as well as a dedicated device with a cheap CPU and all the ports you need. This way, you don't even need to have an existing computer to connect to your virtual machine on Shadow's servers.
After a few minutes running the Windows app on my Windows computer, I got confused and realized I needed to use two different wallpapers because I couldn't tell if I was interacting with my local computer or the virtual machine running in Shadow's data center near Paris.
When you run a game on your Shadow instance, your laptop fan remains silent because not much is happening on your local computer. It's one of the most telling examples of outsourcing compute-intensive tasks. These companies will have to make sure they have a rock-solid privacy policy and security system.
CPUs, GPUs and SSDs are still going to get better over time. These innovations will mostly benefit cloud companies so that they can provide better servers.
Conversely, infrastructure is going to become increasingly important as LTE and constrained fiber-optics internet connections won't cut it anymore. You'll want gigabit connections on all your devices. And then, it'll feel like you're living in the future.
Most software companies have learned to grudgingly cooperate with researchers who expose security vulnerabilities in their products. Google, lately, seems positively excited to see its products taken to pieces by skilled hackers.
At the Pwn2Own contest next month, Google will offer $20,000 to the first security researcher who can gain full control of a laptop running its Chrome Browser, a task that requires defeating the software's sandbox protections, measures designed to isolate an attack within the browser and prevent it from accessing the machine's operating system. The contest, run annually by security firm Tipping Point, now owned by Hewlett-Packard, will offer a total of $125,000 in cash to hackers who can be the first to compromise various machines including laptops running Apple's, Microsoft's, Google's and Mozilla's browsers, as well as mobile phones that will include the iPhone 4, BlackBerry Torch, Dell Venue and Nexus S. Successful contestants also walk away with whatever device they managed to hack.
But this year represents the first time Google has added its own bounty to that program, likely making Chrome the prime target of the contest--and, in theory, helping to keep the browser safer from real-world attacks, as all Pwn2Own hacks are disclosed to the software's vendor before they're released to the public. "Kudos to the Google security team for taking the initiative to approach us on this," reads a statement on Tipping Point's blog. "We're always in favor of rewarding security researchers for the work they too-often do for free."
The Chrome prize is only the latest in a string of incentives from Google for anyone who can demonstrate security flaws in its products. In January of last year, it launched a bug-buying program to pay as much as $1,337 for information about critical security bugs in its browser. Within six months, it upped that maximum payout to $3,133.70. (Both numbers contain a coded reference to the word LEET, or "elite" in hacker jargon.)
Then in November Google extended those rewards to its Web applications including YouTube, Blogger and Gmail, and soon after announced that it planned to award the first $20,000 for vulnerability information in those programs.
In last year's Pwn2Own contest, Chrome remained the only browser to end the contest unscathed. Many have argued those results had little to do with Chrome's security: The browser may have simply been too new at the time to attract much attention from the contest's researchers. But I speculated at the time that even so, Chrome would have a "sword-in-the-stone"-type reputation by the time the next Pwn2Own rolled around. With $20,000 riding on its fate, that sword is bound to seem shinier than ever.
I stayed perfectly still after they chased me into the air vent. I hadn't heard anything for several minutes. Surely they'd left by now. Crawling out of my hiding spot, I found myself face to face with one of my pursuers. He hadn't moved. He started shouting, but he remained locked in place, unable to move at all. Alien: Isolation had broken again.
This piece originally appeared 6/29/15.
Video game artificial intelligence (AI) is something most of us don't notice until it breaks. It's always there, influencing our gameplay experience, affecting how we feel about every moment in a game, but it's also one of the most overlooked elements of video gaming. AI is the spice that takes a video game from bland to cool—it's the thing that immerses us in a game world the way nothing else can.
AI means a lot of different things to a lot of different people, especially in video games. The term can refer to the programming processes that drives a game's characters, individual entities within the game, or even, in some cases, opposing players you never see, like the enemy players in a real-time strategy game.
Back to Alien: Isolation. It's a great game, occasional glitches aside. Never before have I played a movie game that let me felt like I was actually inside a movie. Alien: Isolation makes me feel like I'm one of the characters in an actual Alien film, like I'm there.
Every Alien film establishes a clear goal: kill or get rid of the alien. Many individual moments throughout the films lend themselves to interesting gameplay, whether it's Dallas climbing through the air vents with a flamethrower or Ripley in a mech-loader, punching out the queen. These films, like video games, are very encounter-driven. The stories in the Alien universe translate to game mechanics extremely well.

The alien itself is a complex creature, which means a lot of gameplay possibilities. It hides in shadows, encouraging attention to level design. It can crawl in air vents, leading to surprise attacks on the players. It hates fire, so we can use flamethrowers against it. At the same time, these complexities are somewhat rigidly defined. We know how the alien's life-cycle works. We know that it bleeds acid blood. We know it takes on the characteristics of its host. In other words, the Alien films have set up a distinctly compelling sandbox for developers to play in.
Alien: Isolation depends on the strength of its AI to be an enjoyable experience. The alien must act in a way that helps the player feel like they're in an Alien movie. That is its job.

Every decision you make in Isolation comes back to the alien. Do you hide? Use precious flamethrower fuel? How long do you wait for it to leave? You are living the Alien experience with an “actual” alien that will act and think like an alien. That's awesome! It's also terrifying. Mostly awesome, though!
I've talked with plenty of people over the years about “good game AI.” I've had developers and critics alike tell me that good AI is impossible, because, to them, good AI is what is technically known as “strong AI,” or AI that is essentially as smart, if not smarter than a human. Personally, I don't think that's good game AI. Good game AI is that which makes a game enjoyable to play.
A strong AI would be more like another player, with the same goals a player has: it wants to win. Good game AI doesn't want to win, it wants to make you earn your win. This is why the alien is not some realistic simulation of movie's greatest monster, but an impression of it instead.

In Isolation, the alien is almost always nearby. Sure, you can distract it for a while, or move from one room to the next, but it's always going to end up close by anyways. The alien is often believable, until it decides to inexplicably hang around in one room while you hold your breath, hoping it will leave so you can crawl out of the locker.

The alien appears to have an approximate knowledge of your location at all times, popping up wherever you are, which keeps things tense and uncertain. It doesn't outright notice you (except for the times it glitches and does) unless you fail the stealth game aspect of gameplay. This is great for maintaining the horror movie tension, but sometimes the game stretches a bit too much and it starts to feel fake.
Advertisement
Several times, I've watched the alien leave the room on my motion detector, disappear, and reappear behind me almost instantly. Occasionally, the game's so focused on crafting tension that it forgets about something far more important: immersion.
The funny thing about the word “immersion” is that, through marketing overuse, it's essentially lost all meaning. Now, any game that holds your attention is “immersive.” While it's true that “immersive” is more or less synonymous with “engrossing,” it has another, more specific connotation relating to the idea of being submerged. When you are immersed in the ocean, you exist inside the ocean.
The 1990s gave rise to the concept of the“Immersive Sim.” The idea was that players could exist within a game's world and treat it as if it were a real space. Some of the most well-known 90s immersive sims include games like System Shock and Thief: The Dark Project. Both of those games were developed by Looking Glass Studios, and both put an especially heavy focus on artificial intelligence.

A game without great AI is like an empty movie set. A good set is nice to have, but a movie thrives on its characters. Great AI breathes life into a game's characters and its world. It is the most important ingredient in replicating that immersive movie experience.
For a good example of an immersive sim in action, let's look at a level from Looking Glass's 1998 classic Thief. The game takes place in a fantasy world, and you play as a thief named Garrett. One mission sends you down to the Bonehoard, a series of underground ruins. One particular area of the map features zombies. These aren't your normal zombies, however; you can't hack them to pieces. They'll get back up shortly after you've killed them. The only way to truly be rid of them is to use holy water on your expensive water arrows—which are traditionally meant for putting out light sources, allowing you to hide better.

I was playing the game recently and the zombies were proving particularly troublesome. When a zombie notices you, it roars, alerting other zombies who roar, alerting even more zombies. Being caught meant being swarmed by every zombie in the level. It was frustrating. I didn't have enough arrows or holy water, either. So, I formulated a plan.
I found a room occupied by two or three zombies. I quietly opened the door, then snuck to a balcony above it. I fired at the first zombie with a regular arrow. He roared. His friends roared. They began searching the room for me, not realizing I was hiding above them. Soon, more zombies began to arrive. When the room was finally packed, I began firing my holy water arrows. The splash of water from the arrows meant that I could kill multiple zombies with a single arrow. I made short work of them.
That's the concept of immersion in a nutshell. The game created a space. It created enemies who had a logical set of rules. It gave me water arrows, and, logically, they would splash, because that is what water does. I was able to treat the game-world as if it were real and MacGyver up a creative solution to deal with the zombies.

When a game breaks immersion, it pulls you out of the experience. Good game AI, I think, works like Thief's, rather than Isolation's. Tension is important in an Alien game—it's a crucial component—but immersion is the bedrock that it should be built on. If a game stops being believable, does it continue to be scary?
Of course, for immersion to work, we have to buy in to the experience. Alien, the movie, only works if we let ourselves get absorbed in its reality. It doesn't work if someone stands in front of the screen telling us that an alien didn't really burst out of a man's chest. It's a symbiotic relationship: Alien: Isolation, as an immersive game, must do what it can to present a “real” world to us, and we must treat it as if this is so. We have to be along for the ride.
Because Alien: Isolation is a video game, it has to be interactive, which means it has to put a lot more work into feeling “real” than Alien ever did. For the experience to work, the game has to be immersive. The rules have to make sense and be consistent.
Advertisement
If either you or the game breaks that relationship, the game stops being scary and the experience falls apart. When the people hunting for me stop moving, or when the alien teleports behind me, it breaks my immersion and pulls me out of the experience. It stops being scary, which is the whole point of an Alien game in the first place.
We play Alien games because we want to live the Alien experience. When the AI breaks or cheats, the immersion is lost and the game falls apart. When the AI works, then we become Ripley, hiding in a locker, holding our breath, waiting for the monster to pass.

So, I didn't even realize I had been rematched.. I had moved on and continued with my next gift exchange.
So last Saturday, I get a delivery from UPS, and I've got no idea what this is, or who its from..
I open The package and see the two greatest things I could have gotten. A new Guinness pint glass! Classic style even! Oh man, it feels so great in my hands.. :D
Along with a pack of whiskey stones! I've always wanted some of these! Finally I get to use whiskey stones! Woohoo!
I know its a simple thing, but I'm honestly excatic about this glass and these stones.. :)
Thank you so much rematcher, and I'm sorry it took a while to get this post up, been going through a lot that I don't want to bore you with.. :) But thank you so much, it really is appreciated!
What's up with record low renewable energy prices? Policy innovation is key to harnessing renewable energy potential.
There's a revolution happening in the world of renewable energy policy. At last count, 48 countries had adopted auction-based approaches to subsidizing renewables, with an additional 27 countries seriously considering the idea.
The idea is simple (in theory). Set a target level of investment in renewable energy capacity, and then allocate these contracts to the lowest bidders. This idea is also somewhat polarizing because it marks a move away from “feed-in tariffs” which have been used in many countries, for many years, to subsidize renewable energy projects.
Feed-in tariffs (FiTs) have traditionally been set well above the prevailing electricity price. The concern among some renewable energy advocates is that determining tariffs via competitive auction will drive renewable energy subsidies down…or eliminate them entirely.
The potential to get more bang for each renewable energy buck is precisely what appeals to the governments on the supply-side of these subsidies. As renewable energy markets mature and penetration increases, a growing number of countries are looking to reduce subsidy costs by spurring competition.
The rise of auctions and the fall of subsidies
Some notable countries have recently turned green on the map above. Germany is one. Germany's feed-in tariff system produced the “solar miracle” (truly miraculous to see 38 GW of solar PV capacity in a country that has the same solar potential as Alaska). But this came at a cost that was ultimately too high for consumers to bear. Last year, Germany ended feed-in tariffs in favor of competitive auctions for power purchase agreements.
India is another important example. For years the Indian government has guaranteed long term payments at above-market tariffs to renewable energy producers. These FiTs are rapidly being replaced by auctions in the hopes that competitive pressures will drive down procurement costs and increase transparency.
With all this auction adoption action, you might be wondering what's happening to renewable energy procurement prices. The graph below shows auction prices for solar PV:
The general trend that jumps out is the decline in prices through 2016. In 2017, this downward trend has continued.
In June, we saw large-scale solar PV procured at an average price of $70/MWh in Germany's most recent solar auction. Last month. France announced results of its second large-scale PV auction which contracted with 507 MW at an average price of $64.9. Since February, India has held four major solar power auctions with tariffs falling by as much as 26% between the first and the latest auction. In May, winning bids were as low as $38/MWh for utility-scale solar projects.
Recent wind auction results have also been making headlines. Germany held its first offshore wind auction in April. Winning bids were below the market price for power in Germany. This “subsidy-free offshore wind” is being celebrated as a “moon-landing moment”. India held its first-ever wind power auction in February. Last year, wind projects in India were contracting at FITs in the range of $62-$93/MWh. This year, the winning auction bid price was INR 3.46/kWh ($54/MWh).
Good news for a change?
Looking at how procurement costs are falling among countries that had previously relied on other mechanisms, it seems possible – even likely – that auction-based procurement is accelerating price discovery and reducing procurement costs relative to what we would have seen otherwise.
This sounds like good news (unless you are a project developer seeing revenues melt away). But is it really?
It's good news if falling procurement costs reflect the market's ability to seek out the most cost-effective projects, and if this competitive pressure will fuel efficient innovation going forward. But there are legitimate concerns that the cost reductions we are seeing today are short-lived and/or illusory.
Some critics argue that small/medium sized companies can be at a disadvantage in these auctions. If smaller outfits start exiting, a more concentrated wind and solar industry could mean less competition in the long run.
It's also possible that auction-based procurement is forcing bidders to be too aggressive. If the winning bids are based on overly favorable assumptions about future equipment costs or debt financing, the winner's curse could come back to bite us. Uber-aggressive bids could also reflect developers' willingness to take a hit in order to enter a new market, or strategic hopes to renegotiate additional remuneration after winning the auction.
This kind of under-bidding could amount to a risk worth taking, particularly in emerging economies with ambitious renewable energy investment targets. As one Indian analyst observes: “If the first 20 gigawatts goes to scrap, but as a result, it brings competitive and widely scalable solar, they (the government) are happy to have that.” Moreover, there are things countries can do to mitigate under-bidding (e.g. impose pre-qualification requirements, such as bid bonds, to screen participants).
Learning by doing
The long-run political viability of ambitious global emissions reduction targets depends critically on finding lower cost paths. Early evidence from renewable energy auctions suggests that market-based procurement could be driving down procurement costs. Will this reduce the long-run social cost of a global energy transition? I think it's too early to tell.
The ultimate success of this policy shift will depend to a significant extent on the gritty auction design details (which I have glossed over entirely in an attempt to keep this blog quasi-compelling). We're seeing lots of variation in auction design. With 48 real-world experiments in progress (and more on the way), there's a lot we can learn about how auctions can be designed to deliver sustainable cost reductions. Careful analysis of this large-scale experiment will be critical. We need technology innovation and policy innovation to fully realize renewable energy potential.
With the 2014-15 NBA campaign just three weeks away, a number of teams have begun unveiling the new and improved floor surfaces on which their players will ply their trades this coming season. The San Antonio Spurs, Washington Wizards, Toronto Raptors, Sacramento Kings, Cleveland Cavaliers and New Orleans Pelicans have all showed off their new home court designs, and on Monday, it was the Atlanta Hawks' turn:
And the Hawks have a re-designed home court: pic.twitter.com/GFDJatPFBf — Jeff Zillgitt (@JeffZillgitt) October 6, 2014
Scroll to continue with content Ad
The most notable difference, of course? The reappearance at center court of the Hawks' old "Pac-Man" logo, which the team reintroduced as a secondary logo back in May, and has now elected to deploy in a decidedly non-secondary fashion on the Philips Arena deck. A compare-and-contrast look between the old court and the new, courtesy of sometimes sideline reporter Craig Sager Jr.:
Here's a look at the new Atlanta Hawks court design (top) compared to the previous one. #PACisBACK pic.twitter.com/ezZoJIx62p — Craig Sager II (@CraigSagerJr) October 6, 2014
Story continues
Everything about this seems like an upgrade to me. The move to a darker baseline, the darker tone of the wood on the court, the switch from blue to red in the lane, the removal of the extraneous former secondary logo inside the 3-point arcs, etc. — it's a cool, clean presentation that connects the Hawks more to their fun-and-highlight-filled past than to their tumultuous present. Nicely done, all the way around.
The new court's christening will come Monday night, when the Hawks welcome Anthony Davis and the Pelicans — a franchise that knows a thing or two about angry birds on the floor — to Atlanta. All we need now are some Dominique and Spud-evoking throwback throwdowns and we've got a recipe for a pretty fun little evening of preaseason basketball in Georgia.

It might not have been the best food on Earth, but it had a legitimate claim to being the finest fare in the sky. On board a zeppelin, one of the German-owned rigid airships that traversed the Atlantic in the early 20th century, travelers ate like kings—or, at the very least, lesser nobility. From 1928 to 1937, when the Hindenburg disaster saw the once-bright future of lighter-than-air travel go up in smoke, passengers experienced food to rival modern luxury cruise ships. These rigid airships were enormous structures, the size of buildings, hanging more than 1,000 feet in the air and cruising at speeds exceeding 80 miles an hour.
Airships went farther and faster than anyone ever had before, but journeys were still rather time-consuming. A trip from Brazil to Europe, for instance, took three days, and there was little to do except look out the window, read, socialize, eat, and drink. These last two, as one might expect, were taken quite seriously. Meals were regular and lavish, and drinking so excessive that prairie oysters, a hangover cure made with hot sauce and a whole raw egg, were listed below the cocktails on the bar menu.
While meals were usually provided free of charge, guests paid extra for drinks. Collection of Dan Grossman
Food aboard the Graf Zeppelin, and its sister ship, the Hindenburg, was based on the dining one might find at a traditional, high-end European hotel. The chef on the final Hindenburg trip, Xaver Maier, for instance, had come to it from the Ritz, in Paris. Because of that, the food was not always to American tastes, says Dan Grossman, airship historian and author of Zeppelin Hindenburg: An Illustrated History. “The most important thing to remember about food on the Hindenburg was that it was German food—very, very German food. There were some complaints from primarily American passengers,” he says, “that it was a lot too heavy and specific for their tastes.” Menus were strong on meat. Vegetables, where they appeared, were usually lathered in butter or a rich cream sauce. “The food was not really tailored to the needs of their customers.”
The libations were also very German. On the Hindenburg's maiden flight, the bar is said to have run out of gin. This is because, says Grossman, “Germans don't drink a lot of gin. Brits and Americans drink tons of gin, but the very fact that they did [run out] shows that they weren't really thinking about accommodating the expectations of their passengers.” An inventive guest, Pauline Charteris, who was married to the author Leslie Charteris (creator of “The Saint”), is said to have taken kirsch (a cherry brandy), dry vermouth, and grenadine to produce an alternative “Kirsch Martini.” Later that night, she entertained guests by singing a contemporary jazz song, with the lyrics “Mamma want no gin, because it makes her sin.”

Zeppelins flew so much lower than modern planes do that they did not have the same cold, dry, pressurized cabin air that dulls taste and smell today. Airship food would therefore have been much more flavorful than what we eat aloft today—even if the menu didn't include fattened duckling with champagne cabbage. No expense was spared. In The Great Dirigibles: Their Triumphs and Disasters, John Toland describes the Hindenburg's larder: “turkeys, live lobsters, gallons of ice-cream, crates of all kinds of fruits, cases of American whiskey, and hundreds of bottles of German beer.” The Graf Zeppelin allowed for 7.5 pounds of “victuals” per passenger, per day, whether fresh or in specially prepared cans, with labels hand-affixed by the chef's sister.

The emphasis on German cuisine was no accident. While there was a hope that these commercial zeppelin flights would one day be profitable, they were primarily a way to demonstrate a kind of German cultural strength, says historian and writer Richard Foss, author of Food in the Air and Space: The Surprising History of Food and Drink in the Skies. “It was an instrument of national prestige. It showed a Germany that had been so completely trampled in the war [World War I] now had the fastest and most luxurious method of transport. They could serve caviar with every meal, they could do whatever they wanted to, because they didn't really have to make money.” Joseph Goebbels, who ran the Ministry of Propaganda, invested in the company for its ability to represent Germany on the world stage.

The day's eating began sometime around 8 a.m. Tables were laid with vases of fresh flowers and blue-and-white china. Despite the weight considerations always associated with air travel, the plates and teapots were inlaid with real gold, and were very heavy. Upon arrival on the ship, passengers were given a single white napkin, in a personalized envelope. They were to keep this and reuse it for the rest of the journey to keep weight down—though it's hard to see how much of a difference this made on the 236-ton, china-laden Hindenburg.
The Hindenburg's dining room was furnished with lightweight, state-of-the-art aluminum Bauhaus furniture. Measuring 46 feet in length, the space could accommodate all guests on board simultaneously, at either separate tables or one long one. “They did everything they could do to make it feel like a land-based restaurant,” says Foss. On the final Hindenburg voyage, guests were served the following traditional German breakfast:
Coffee, Tea Milk, Cocoa
Bread, Butter, Honey, Preserves
Eggs, boiled or in cup
Frankfort Sausage
Ham, Salami
Cheese
Fruit
At the time, cocoa was believed to be a health food of sorts that aided in digestion and strengthened the constitution. Every morning, bread rolls were baked fresh in the all-electric, all-aluminum kitchen, which had been designed both to limit weight and minimize the risk of a catastrophic kitchen fire. It was, after all, basically inside a building full of flammable hydrogen.

Guests spent a considerable amount of time in the bar, the only place on board where they could smoke. There, they had access to as many as 15 different kinds of wine and sparkling wine, as well as a selection of mixed drinks, divided into “Sours,” “Flips,” “Fizzes,” “Cobblers,” and “Cocktails.” In addition to the most common cocktail orders, the bar offered a few specialties: LZ 129, made with gin and orange juice, and Maybach 12, the formula for which is now lost. “We don't really have recipes [for their cocktails or meals]—in fact, things were really nonstandard,” says Grossman. “It was very much run on an apprenticeship basis. People knew their jobs because they'd been doing them for a really long time.”
Also set up in the bar was the world's first aluminum alloy piano. Weighing just 356 lbs, it was made of duralumin, an alloy of aluminum, copper, and other metals, with hollow tubing for its legs, back bracing, and lyre. The outside was covered in light-colored pigskin leather. It had been taken out of the airship before the 1937 travel season, so it avoided the fate of the rest of the Hindenburg disaster, though it was accidentally destroyed several years later, during World War II.
Guests had access to two different kinds of champagne, five kinds of liqueurs, and food options, from French fries to beluga caviar. Collection of Dan Grossman
By the time of the Hindenburg disaster, nearly 3,000 people had ridden on the luxury airship, then the global standard for speed, luxury, and fine dining. Today, it's near-impossible to eat food of any kind on any sort of dirigible. Until recently, the Hendricks blimp, which is currently out of action, served three gin-based cocktails in the air—but it's a far cry from the golden age of dirigible dining.

It was Earth Hour on Saturday. I know, I know, you probably missed it too. All around the world smug weather-worriers dimmed their lights, lit a candle and said a little prayer for the planet as everyone else just got on with living. Still, a bare 24-hours later the BBC chose to show just how it can manage to shoe horn climate change into just about anything.
Yesterday, Caribbean with Simon Reeve, a three-part travelogue that documents his various movements around a resoundingly beautiful part of the world (presumably in jets spewing a trail of noxious burnt aviation fuel as they go), chose to alight on Venezuela and Colombia.
So far, so good, for a little docile TV wallpaper on a quiet Sunday afternoon. Except Reeves thought it would be a super to outline the fraught lives of the people he met and use them as a backdrop for his own enhanced platform of climate fretting.
First stop was the Sierra Nevada mountains of Columbia where viewers were treated to interviews with an Amerindian tribe called the Kogi. One of its members said this:
“How can [you] expect us to live when you come from the other side of the world and destroy mother Earth so that multinational companies profit? … river levels have fallen, the rains don't come when they should, crop seasons are changing. Only when this stops can life carry on as normal.”
It didn't end there. Further on some of the same members were transported down a mountain and mustered in front of a power station where they voiced disappointment that such an evil thing should exist.
“Before this was built, everything was normal. Building this here has harmed the Earth. It could kill everything here…. Mother Earth is in pain.”
Oh the horror. If “before this was built, everything was normal” means that before electricity “normal” saw people living an agrarian lifestyle in simple huts with no real tools, a limited lifespan, sickness, ill-health and a diminished future, then that would seem to be a pretty slim argument to mount against the existence of a power station.
As to the untested assertion that “Mother Earth is in pain” I guess that is a matter for conjecture. I will just have to wait for Mother Earth to call and outline her list of ailments.
Until then, that alleged pain is nothing compared to the excruciating agony of viewers forced to watch such earnest, dim-witted tosh – all dished out by the taxpayer-funded BBC.

Seven years ago, I journeyed into the world of self-publishing. Before the success of crowdfunding had given a stage to the seas of hungering creators, I took my vision for a type of book that did not exist and some of my savings and turned them into the black hardcover tome known as The Dark Verse, Vol. 1: From the Passages of Revenants—a collection of the first 26 short stories of occult, metaphysical, and fantastical horror that I had written and narrated for my podcast, The Dark Verse.

10 stats that show how incredible Liverpool have been this season
Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool have been wreaking havoc this season
Premier League never ceases to amaze its viewers. Over the years, the Premier League has given us plenty of moments to savour and this season has been no different. A mouthwatering clash between Arsenal and Liverpool on opening weekend set the tone for the season.
From the offset, the season had all the ingredients to be one of the most epic title races of all time, after all, where else but the Premier League would you see so many world class managers lock horns?
Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool are currently top of the Premier League table after 11 games with 26 points and they have deserved to be on top with some scintillating football. The Reds have been a nightmare to play against and many of the opposition managers including the likes of Arsene Wenger, Mauricio Pochettino, Claudio Ranieri, Mike Phelan, Alan Pardew, Tony Pulis, Francesco Guidolin and Walter Mazzarri have heaped praise on Liverpool's performance.
Listen to: Andy & Leo's Premier League Podcast- All Of The Lights (Week 11)
These 10 mind-blowing statistics about Liverpool's season so far will explain how dominating the Reds have been this season.
#10 Liverpool have the most goals (30), most passes (6,587), most forward passes (4,112), most chances created (170) and most shot per game (7.8) in the Premier League
Jurgen Klopp'
s men are top of the table after 11 league games
Liverpool are not just top of the Premier League table, they top the league in many other tables as well. The Reds have scored 30 goals this season which is 4 more than any other team in the league.
What is incredible is that despite scoring 30 goals, none of Liverpool's recognised strikers, that is, Daniel Sturridge, Divock Origi and Danny Ings, have scored a league goal this season.
The 30 goals scored by Liverpool shouldn't come as a surprise as they have a league-high 170 chances created. Manchester City are second in this table with 151 chances created.

Jurgen Klopp's men have also played the most passes in the league with 6,597 passes which puts them ahead of Manchester City with 6,545 passes. Of Liverpool's total passes, 4,112 are forward passes of which they have made 127 passes more than second-placed Arsenal.
Finally, Liverpool's 7.8 shots on target per game is not just the best in the Premier League, but it is also the best by any team in Europe's big five leagues.

In 2002 my primary form of hearing new music was friends burning me CDs and saying, “You have to listen to this.” I was in 8th grade when my friend Ryan handed me a copy of The Mercury Program's A Data Learn the Language and my worldview was completely turned up on its head. The only instrumental albums I'd heard up until that point were jazz, and as a percussionist, I'd never heard a band that relied so heavily on the rhythm section to drive the narrative of a song. David Lebleu's driving, complex, groove based drum patterns were hypnotic, and perfectly underscored by Sander Travisano's full, round, melodic bass lines. Paired with Whit Travisano's Rhodes keyboard and Thomas Reno's ambient and subtle guitar licks and, occasionally, Lebleu's impressive use of a vibraphone, you'd be hard pressed to find any listener not smiling in blissful contentment. All these years later, ADLTL is one of my most listened to albums.
Most of my youth was spent going to shows in the tri-state area surrounding Philadelphia, and The Mercury Program was one band I was determined to see live. Unfortunately I soon learned that they were more or less on a sort of hiatus, no tours, no new music, and no social media presence to speak of, until seven years later, in 2009 they surprised everyone with a week-long tour and a fourth studio album, Chez Viking. I saw The Mercury Program at an intimate show at Kung Fu Neck in Philly's then up and coming Fish Town neighborhood. It remains the best show I've ever had the luxury of attending. The music was no longer simply beautifully arranged sounds coming through my headphones, but a powerful and emotional display of what music can communicate even without words.
It's surreal that I find myself in a position all these years later to not only learn that The Mercury Program will be releasing a new EP, New Myths on May 20th, but below is the premiere of the title track—the first new music from the band in seven years. The new track is a departure from the ambient, trance-like tracks of my youth, but the groove and the raw energy is still very much alive. I caught up with bassist Sander Travisano shed some light on the new album and the on again, off again relationship they have with their music.
Noisey: Can you give me the abridged history of The Mercury Program leading up to the release of the new album?
Sander Travisano: The Mercury Program was formed in 1997 shortly after the breakup of Yusef's Well. Yusef's Well was a band that Tom Reno and I had been playing in with a couple of friends. We quickly moved our rehearsal spot from a music store space to Tom's uncles landscaping business warehouse, it was the beginning of a new sound for us and we made some home recordings which we self released as 45s. In 1998 Tom moved to Gainesville FL to be with his girlfriend (now wife) who was to attend school at the University of Florida. Tom would call Dave and I are constantly badgering us to move up there and finally we gave in. I moved in the summer of 1999 and then Dave followed shortly thereafter. This began our stint as a local Gainesville band.
Also, around this time my younger brother Whitney was accepted to the school of music at Florida State University. Whitney had been coming to our rehearsals since he was in middle school. Given the relatively close proximity Gainesville this eventually gave way to Whitney missing enough school for us to write songs together.
With the first record in circulation it got the attention of an aspiring new label from NYC called Tiger Style Records. They approached us to see how serious we were about our project and having never even seen us live they asked us to sign a deal with them. We agreed and shortly thereafter began writing another full length, Whitney had dropped out of college at this point and became a full-time member of the band.
The band has been seemingly inactive since 2003's Confines of Heat until late 2009 when Chez Viking was released, why the long gap between releases and tours?
With signing to a record label came the obligation to tour and support for each release. We spent a majority of the following years on the road touring the country and I think that it eventually took its toll on our friendships. Driving all over North America in van with your best friends and brother for six weeks can really tax your relationships. I can remember coming home from a long stretch of touring back in 2003 ,and us all agreeing that we needed a little time to get grounded. Not long after we had that conversation my girlfriend, (now wife), asked me to move with her to NYC, I jumped at the offer wanting a change and The Mercury Program kinda went cold for a while.
Was there similar reasoning behind the seven years between that album and New Myths?
We managed to get together and write Chez Viking a couple years into my living in NYC. Around this time was when Dave Lebleu and Whitney decided to leave Florida and move to NYC. We did a scant amount of touring to support Chez Viking and then things went cold again. We all kinda moved around a bit. Tom and I both got married and had children. Years passed and the dialogue started again, we eventually convinced one another that we needed to get back together for another round of writing and recording. A decision was made to get together where my brother was living at the time in Vermont to do a home writing/ recording session. A few of us from NYC piled all the gear we could into my van and a Jeep and we drove the six hours from NYC into the remoteness of the northeast kingdom. It was hands down the most enjoyable recording experience I have been apart of yet. Being snowed in and alone in the woods with no disturbances makes for great creativity.
What was the writing and recording process for New Myths like?
New Myths was written and recorded over the course of five days. It differs from pretty much all other Mercury Program recordings in that we had no pre-written material going into the session. Once our home studio was set up we sort of hit the ground running knowing we had a short amount of time to get a lot done. There were hours of us just noodling around until something cohesive was formed and then Dave and I would lay down the drums and bass and Tom and Whitney would come back and work their magic with overdubs. Having a deadline sort of made it easy for us to say, "That's good enough and lets move on." That is what I think sets this record apart from our previous releases.
What can we expect to hear on New Myths?
It is a much more spontaneous and less refined sounding record in my opinion, having been the first time in years that we had all been in the same room made for a very excitable mood. I believe that that energy is apparent on this record. We took a more aggressive approach to writing these songs because they had to get written or we were all in the woods wasting our time. It was sort of a test to see if it was all still worth doing.
Can we expect resurgence in TMP activity with the release of the new album?
With the release of this album The Mercury Program does plan on doing some limited US touring. There has already been talk of more writing sessions. We are all very excited that it is something that we can still enjoy and plan on enjoying it for many more years to come. In defense of our criticized slow pace I would like to say that maybe some things do get better with age, but perhaps tend not to be as spry.

Twinkle, twinkle little star dwarf planet, how scientists wonder what you are.
The mysteries of Ceres, the largest object in our solar system's asteroid belt, continue to deepen. For over a decade, scientists have been puzzled by a cluster of inexplicable bright white spots on the dwarf planet's surface. The clearest photo yet taken of the spots does little to shed light, so to speak, on the matter.
The photo, snapped by NASA's Dawn Spacecraft on June 9 from an altitude of 2,700 miles, reveals a grouping of highly reflective spots -- the biggest one is six miles across -- nestled in a large crater on Ceres' surface.
Per a release from NASA, Dawn uses a suite of instruments to analyze the light reflected off Ceres, thereby helping scientists identify the minerals on the dwarf planet's surface. At this point, the bright spots are thought to be ice or salt, though there are other possibilities, too, including geysers or volcanoes of some sort.
Dawn also snapped a photo of a mountain, three miles high and shaped like a pyramid, that protrudes from an otherwise smooth area of Ceres' surface. We've circled the mountain in yellow below:
WASHINGTON—The U.S. Supreme Court decision, June 26, interpreting the U.S. Constitution to require all states to license and recognize same-sex “marriage” “is a tragic error that harms the common good and most vulnerable among us,” said Archbishop Joseph E. Kurtz of Louisville, Kentucky, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB).The full statement follows:Regardless of what a narrow majority of the Supreme Court may declare at this moment in history, the nature of the human person and marriage remains unchanged and unchangeable. Just as Roe v. Wade did not settle the question of abortion over forty years ago, Obergefell v. Hodges does not settle the question of marriage today. Neither decision is rooted in the truth, and as a result, both will eventually fail. Today the Court is wrong again. It is profoundly immoral and unjust for the government to declare that two people of the same sex can constitute a marriage.The unique meaning of marriage as the union of one man and one woman is inscribed in our bodies as male and female. The protection of this meaning is a critical dimension of the “integral ecology” that Pope Francis has called us to promote. Mandating marriage redefinition across the country is a tragic error that harms the common good and most vulnerable among us, especially children. The law has a duty to support every child's basic right to be raised, where possible, by his or her married mother and father in a stable home.Jesus Christ, with great love, taught unambiguously that from the beginning marriage is the lifelong union of one man and one woman. As Catholic bishops, we follow our Lord and will continue to teach and to act according to this truth.I encourage Catholics to move forward with faith, hope, and love: faith in the unchanging truth about marriage, rooted in the immutable nature of the human person and confirmed by divine revelation; hope that these truths will once again prevail in our society, not only by their logic, but by their great beauty and manifest service to the common good; and love for all our neighbors, even those who hate us or would punish us for our faith and moral convictions.Lastly, I call upon all people of good will to join us in proclaiming the goodness, truth, and beauty of marriage as rightly understood for millennia, and I ask all in positions of power and authority to respect the God-given freedom to seek, live by, and bear witness to the truth.---Keywords: U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, USCCB, Archbishop Joseph E.

YEREVAN: As the melancholic notes of duduk — a pipe instrument integral to Armenian music — caress the air in Vernissage, the country's biggest flea market, a woman in her late 60s waves an exquisite wall hanging made of jute and ceramic, exhorting customers: “Five hundred Armenian drams only!”The French word vernissage means a private showing or preview of an art exhibition. The lines of desperation on the woman's face --- 500 Armenian Drams for that converts to a measly amount of Rs 70 --- hint at the ravages of history, of what went wrong with the country that's the cradle of a rich ancient civilisation. It produces the most exquisite brandy, wines and carpets and is believed to be the resting place of Noah's Ark.The mountainous country in the south Caucasian region has seen fierce invasions by Arabs, Mongols, Persians, Turks and Russians, forcing local populations to flee with every wave of attack; Armenia's national symbol Mount Ararat, believed to be the resting place of Noah's Ark, became Turkey's territory in the 1920s; earthquakes in 1988 devastated the nation: 25,000 killed, thousands rendered homeless. Yet the most painful chapter remains the genocide by the Ottoman Empire in 1915 that killed 1.5 million Armenians. The violence tears up every Armenian, both resident and the diaspora.Yet it's not the tragedies but the remarkable grit of Armenians to give back to their motherland and restore its ancient glory that is stunning. “We can never forget the genocide but we have to move on, snap out of the ‘victim' mode. Showcase the beauties of Armenia, its rich civilisation and ancient history,” says Armenuhi Magarditchian , a PhD scholar of classical archaeology at the University of Geneva . A Swiss national, Armenuhi is in her country of origin to study rock inscription in Greek in the ancient pagan temple of Garni, a symbol of Hellenistic culture built over two centuries before Armenia became the world's first country to adopt Christianity as a state religion in 301 AD.Named after her country, like many others, Aremenuhi's family tree exemplifies the massive global village that Armenians have turned the world into. Born in Switzerland, her father is in Bulgaria, mother in Lebanon and maternal grandparents in Egypt where her maternal great grandparents had fled to escape the 1915 genocide. On her father's side, the family moved out of Armenian city Ani when it was attacked by the Seljuk Turks in circa 1064. Canada, Brazil, Romania and Cyprus are other places where her family moved out.When Armenians fled in 1915, made foreign countries their home, what they carried with them were the duduk's melancholic notes that to the day make even young Armenians cry. Yet the nation's biggest tragedy has also united the diaspora, estimated at three to four times Armenia's population of three million.A sense of gratitude to their saviours bonds Armenians. The Aurora Prize for Awakening Humanity, instituted in 2015 by the survivors of the genocide to thank their saviours, is an example of this sentiment. The award is given to those engaged in humanitarian service– from missionary doctors in war-torn Sudan to those teaching girls despite opposition by the Taliban and mullahs in Afghanistan “We cannot forget how the world's people helped our forefathers. ‘Gratitude in action' is our motto,” says Ruben Vardanyan, co-founder of the Aurora humanitarian initiative . Ruben's grandfather's family was wiped out; his grandfather alone was saved by a man from Turkey taken in by an orphanage and grew up to become an eminent professor.Today, youth are forced to leave --- pushed out by the high unemployment rate and low salaries. "Education in Armenia is still steeped in the Soviet system that was theoretically excellent, but does not meet the requirements of modern times,” says Zara Zeitountsian, head of Armenia's state tourism committee.But it is no wonder that the diaspora has such nostalgia for Armenia with its picture-perfect landscapes and warm-hearted people --- with flawlessly crafted features. The streets of capital Yerevan only reinforce the survey that adjudged Armenian ladies to be the world's most beautiful women. As the handsome 60-something gustily sells her colourful folk art, she leaves you with the thought that for all its tragedies, Armenia remains a land of hope and beauty.
EUGENE -- De'Anthony Thomas said he is hopeful his sprained right ankle is healed enough to play Saturday night against Washington State, but the Oregon running back said he did not practice Monday because of soreness.
“I'm just not ready for it yet,'' Thomas said. “I'm trying to recover and trying to get to how I was before the season started.''
Thomas hasn't played since Sept. 28, when he rolled his right ankle at the end of a 27-yard return of the opening kickoff against Cal. He wore a protective boot on the sideline of the Oct. 5 game at Colorado, and went through pregame warmups last week at Washington. However, he said he was nowhere near playing against the Huskies.
“I wasn't close at all. At all,'' Thomas said.
Thomas said he awoke Monday to the ankle feeling “kind of sore,” but he twice said on Monday that the injury “is nothing that bad.”
Thomas is one of the most dangerous offensive weapons on the No. 2 Ducks. He averages 8.0 yards per carry, 19.3 yards per reception and has six rushing touchdowns. He also averages 23.2 yards per kickoff return.
Sophomore Byron Marshall and freshman Thomas Tyner have excelled at running back the past three games, and Keanon Lowe, Josh Huff and Troy Hill have all filled in on kick returns. Marshall rushed for 130 yards against Cal, 122 yards against Colorado and 106 yards against Washington.

“I'm proud of them,'' Thomas said.
The No. 2 Ducks (6-0 overall, 3-0 Pac-12) play Washington State (4-3, 2-2) at Autzen Stadium on Saturday, before facing No. 9 UCLA on Oct. 26 at Autzen. After a bye week, the Ducks then play at No. 13 Stanford.
When Thomas will return is anybody's guess. But Thomas left no doubt about his importance. When asked if teammate Marcus Mariota was the best player in college football, Thomas didn't hesitate.
“Yes ... beside myself,'' Thomas said. “He is the best quarterback in the country, you can say that.''

Manchester United will make a renewed, final push for Álvaro Morata this week as Jose Mourinho 's frustration at a lack of signings begins to bubble over.
Manchester United will make a renewed, final push for Álvaro Morata this week as Jose Mourinho's frustration at a lack of signings begins to bubble over.
The Spanish forward has been United's top attacking target since Antoine Griezmann decided to remain with Atletico, and has his mind set on moving to Old Trafford.
But Real Madrid are holding firm over a €90m (£72m) fee, frustrating United's efforts to have their squad complete by the beginning of pre-season.
Mourinho had insisted on his signings being in place before the club head away on their pre-season tour of the United States this weekend and handed executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward a list of targets for each position in the spring.
Since then, Woodward has been able to complete just one signing and that was Victor Lindelof, a player that Jorge Mendes had been offering to the club since the January transfer window.
Morata still expects to sign for the club but United are struggling in negotiations where Madrid have all the leverage. Gianluigi Donnarumma's new contract in Milan muddies the waters further after Florentino Perez had ditched his interest in the United keeper in favour of the Italian starlet. The Old Trafford club does not want to sell De Gea and will not use him to land Morata.
News that Ed Woodward flew to New Zealand to watch the British and Irish Lions did not irk Mourinho in itself but Mourinho had expected his squad to be taking shape by this point and the lack of arrivals is now severely testing Mourinho's patience.
The club has had a reputation for doddering in the transfer market under Woodward's stewardship and there is an awareness that failing to secure targets for Mourinho will not be acceptable, with the Portuguese already having fired warning shots in public after securing the Europa League in May.
“Ed Woodward has my list, what I want, what I would like for more than two months. Now it's up to him and the owners.”
United insiders insist it is difficult to do deals with their financial might barely a secret. But if Mourinho is to elevate United from finishing sixth to winning the Premier League then he not only needs his top targets secured but also time to work with them before the campaign begins in around six weeks.

We kicked off last week by doing a sneaky little update of the Frontline beta, containing the final boss fight of the Temple of Seasons. While it isn't 100% ready in terms of graphics and cut scenes, we really wanted some insight in how people felt the fight played. We are reaching a point in the game where the difficulty is starting to really kick off, which makes the beta testers more important than ever. Making a boss or area hard is easy — making it fair and fun is the tricky part!
Anyway! With some much appreciated help from our loyal beta testers, old and new alike, we got a good dose of feedback and critique. The general vibe was positive, so with some more tinkering we're hoping we'll end up with a boss you'll enjoy getting your asses kicked by!
Vilya took the time to clean up the room of the boss battle, pulling her (presumably) last straw to the second dungeon-stack!
While not there just yet, Fred is nearing the finish line on his end as well. With all of the actual battle stuff for the boss out of the way, the cut scene animations took center stage!
So while Fred and Teddy have been working on the final touches of the temple, Vilya have kept speeding ahead and started working on the next big area of the game. Still nameless, we've settled upon a Desert (with some twists!) that will be the connecting area to the fourth dungeon. Below are some prop and color testing:
Now we know, desert areas in RPG don't generally tend to be anyone's favorite. Heck, even 2/3 of Pixel Ferrets hate deserts in RPGs with a deep and devoted passion. Therefore, we're more determined then ever to infuse it with as much care and love as humanly possible to make it stand out! With some added Pixel Ferrets magic, we might end up with the first ever enjoyable RPG desert. Fingers crossed!

With all of the amazing rockabilly music that has been created over the years, trying to pick the “best songs” is next to impossible. Of course, everyone has an opinion on the subject and it's fun to talk to other rockabilly enthusiasts about which songs they consider to be the best. Everyone agrees that there are some songs that you simply have to know if you're going to keep up with the conversation when it turns to rockabilly music–they just don't always agree on which songs those are! In this article I'll talk about five songs that I think are essential to an education in rockabilly music.
Mystery Train: Elvis' version of this song is simply amazing. It may be the best thing he ever recorded. It's raw and sparse and it embodies the very essence of early rockabilly. If you're not old enough to remember when this tune hit the airwaves, you'll have to simply imagine what a departure this was from anything on the radio at the time. This is as lean as it gets: Elvis and his acoustic, Scottie Moore on guitar, and Bill Black holding the bottom and setting the rhythm with his slap bass. That's right, no drums! And still one of the greatest rock and roll performances of all time. Blue Suede Shoes: Yes, after being a smash hit for both Elvis and Carl Perkins (who wrote it), it has become almost expected over the years and can get worn out by the commercial oldies stations, but this gem still rocks like nothing else. Perkins' version features great guitar work, clever lyrics, urgent vocals, and trend-setting style. Everyone loves this song! Train Kept A'rollin': This Burnette Brothers Rock and Roll Trio classic features one of the greatest rockabilly guitar solos of all time. The amazing guitar solo in this song has spawned one of the most heated arguments in all rockabilly music! Some say it was played by ace session man Grady Martin, others say it was the trio's regular guitarist Paul Burlison, and still others insist that there are two guitars on the record and both men played on it. Regardless of who played it, it's clever and down right nasty. It sets the dirty tone for this rockin' heartbroken lament and in his typical fashion Johnny Burnette slams it home with an equally insistent vocal performance. Who Slapped John: Classic Gene Vincent, this song lets loose with all of the abandon that makes rockabilly so compelling. More fantastic guitar solo work by the incomparable Cliff Gallup alternates beautifully with Vincent's trademark unsettled vocals and the screams and yells provided by various Blue Caps (Vincent's backing band) makes this a two-minute party that leaves you breathless. Rock Around With Ollie Vee: Everyone knows Buddy Holly, but most people don't know him like this. This is pure rocking rockabilly and when you listen to it, it's easy to see why Holly became such a sensation. In just a short time after this song was recorded, Holly became the polished and accomplished performer that we all know from his hits and that just makes it all the more fun to listen to his early, ragged rockabilly gems. This is Holly in all his brilliance, but raw.
These are just five songs that I think are essential. Not the only five to be sure! But if you become familiar with the five, you'll get a great start on understanding rockabilly music and what makes it so special.

In this eye-opening TED Talk, veteran investigative journalist Sharyl Attkisson shows how astroturf, or fake grassroots movements funded by political, corporate, or other special interests very effectively manipulate and distort media messages.
The talk covers the increasingly artificial paid-for reality we get…and how to recognize the truth.
“Astroturf seeks to manipulate you into changing your opinion by making it seem as if you're an outlier–when you're not.”
“Hallmarks of astroturf and propaganda include use of inflammatory language such as quack, crank, nutty, pseudo, paranoid and conspiracy.”
“Beware when an interest addresses an issue by controversializing or attacking the people, personalities and organizations surrounding the issue rather than the facts. That could be astroturf.”
Here is Sharyl Attkisson's TED Talk outlining how the news media is manipulated:

MMA fighter, “War Machine” (born Jonathan Koppenhaver), is in court facing 34 charges, including sexual assault and attempted murder, in relation to his abuse of ex-girlfriend, Christy Mack.
Last year, the self-described “Alpha Male” broke into Mack's home, beating her and friend, Corey Thomas (who Koppenhaver allowed to escape, ordering him not to call the authorities), viciously, leaving the 24-year-old woman hospitalized with a lacerated liver, 18 broken bones, multiple stab wounds, a fractured rib, and two missing teeth. Koppenhaver also forced Mack to undress, threatened to rape her, then, allegedly, sexually assaulted her with his fingers after saying “That's my pussy and I'm going to take it back now.” She escaped and ran to a neighbour's house while Koppenhaver was in the kitchen, she believes, looking for another knife. Afterwards, he claimed he did all this out of love.
@ChristyMack I'm so heart broken…in all ways. I will always love you. — War Machine (@WarMachine170) August 9, 2014
I only wish that man hadn't been there and that Christy & I would behappily engaged.I don't know y I'm so cursed.One day truth will come out — War Machine (@WarMachine170) August 11, 2014
I'm not a bad guy, I went to surprise my gf, help her set up her show and to give her an engagement ring and ended up fighting for my life. — War Machine (@WarMachine170) August 11, 2014
Of course this was not the first time Koppenhaver had assaulted Mack.
“He became abusive about four to five months in,” she told ESPN. “But by that time I was totally in love with him… The first time I thought, ‘Oh it'll never happen again.' The day after, he stayed home from training and coddled me. After every time he would hit me, those were the best days of our relationship.”
In November 2013, she tweeted that her boyfriend at the time “beath the shit out of [her]” and threatened to kill her. There are other accounts of his violence, too…
Needless to say, it's unsurprising that this misogyny has continued in court. On Monday, Koppenhaver and his defense attorney, Brandon Sua, argued that the fact that Mack was a porn actress constituted consent to rape, instilled in her “the desire, the preference, the acceptability towards a particular form of sex activities that were outside of the norm,” and that the sexual assaults Mack was charging Koppenhaver with were “a consensual part of their relationship.”
These claims are disturbingly familiar to the ones we heard from Jian Ghomeshi last year who, likewise, attempted to claim that assault was, in fact, simply consensual “rough sex” and said that “sexual preferences are a human right.”
Essentially, Koppenhaver and his lawyer were arguing that because Mack engaged in violent sexual acts, “rough sex,” and rape scenes in porn, she was unrapeable. But it's not really just that he thinks she, as an individual, isn't rapeable, it's that he actually doesn't think rape is wrong. He thinks it's what “real men” do.
In 2013 he tweeted that he raped Mack, following his statement up by saying, “Real men rape. ( Their GF's and wives, not strangers, don't get your panties in a bunch.)”
Just raped @ChristyMack She tried to make me wait until "after errands" As if! =p — War Machine (@WarMachine170) August 10, 2013
Presumably, I don't need to tell anyone here that rape is not negated because a woman works in the sex industry… That is to say, prostituted women and women in porn are raped all the time. But I also think it's worth mentioning that the cultural narrative surrounding pornography and the supposedly “consensual rough sex” we see in porn is part of the problem. Men all over the world watch women be abused and raped in porn and learn that it's simply a “sexual preference” and are told this “sexual preference is a human right.”
It's not as though violent monsters like Koppenhaver are the only ones pushing this narrative — it's progressive men and women, too. Ghomeshi is a good example — a man who pretending to be a feminist ally and, by all accounts, a politically progressive man, who also thought he had a “right” to act out his violent fantasies on women. But where do men get these ideas from? Whether or not they're comfortable admitting to it, leftists and liberals are complicit.
Editor of Jacobin magazine, Connor Kilpatrick, defended men's right to access porn (you can't argue that men in prison have a “right” to porn without arguing that all men have a right to porn), framing the sexualized abuse of women as simply “booby pics.”
Yes, this is a battle people should fight: taking away booby pics from people locked in barbaric modern day gulags https://t.co/HlCZlId2eQ — Connor Kilpatrick (@ckilpatrick) October 28, 2015
The idea that porn culture is not only harmless but that it is a human right is embraced in our culture, despite the harm of the overarching message.
Porn actively advocates against consent. It teaches its audience that consent isn't sexy but that violence is. Porn sends men the message, every single day, that sex, in any form, is their right. That access to women's bodies is their right. It says that rape and violence is a “sexual preference.” So it's no real surprise that men not only try to defend, but truly believe that their abuse is not abuse at all but simply a personal sexual preference that is completely harmless — they are fed this message constantly by liberals, leftists, and porn culture alike.
Sure there are men who watch porn but don't rape, but the fact that we work so hard to convince them that the images they see on their computer screens constitute “sex,” a “human right,” and that they are a perfectly healthy part of being male don't counter the anti-violence messages liberals and progressive pretend to support. Men aren't seeing that line you keep trying to draw between rape culture and porn culture because it isn't there. I mean, it's no wonder men like Koppenhaver and Ghomeshi think they can get away with these lines.
War Machine only epitomizes the kind of behaviour our culture, at large, condones. To say violent porn is a man's right only to turn around and say sexual violence is not sending a dangerously inconsistent message that has real-life consequences for women everywhere.

MELBOURNE'S gay community is set to mark the 20th anniversary of the infamous police raid at the iconic club Tasty.
A Facebook page for the anniversary event says: “A bunch of defenceless homos were held hostage by police. They are our forefathers and we salute them.”
The August 7, 1994, incident — in which 463 clubbers were strip searched and detained for seven hours — sparked a huge public backlash, successful legal action against Victoria Police, and a $10 million payout to patrons.
Former Tasty promoter Gavin Campbell said: “We come together, 20 years on, to commemorate this watershed moment in Australian LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) history.”
Campbell likened the Tasty raid to Stonewall, a reference to a police raid at a famous New York gay club, which led to riots and later, better gay rights.
He said: “Many raid victims couldn't find a voice, too traumatised, too closeted, too much to lose. These silent victims of the Tasty raid, qualify as an inspiration in our fight for rights, they epitomise the injustices …”
Indeed, for the gay community, times have changed dramatically since the raid.
“Today, it's all about marriage equality,” Campbell said. “Back then (in the 1990s), inexplicably, we found ourselves in a fight for equality itself.
The Tasty Raid 20th anniversary will happen at Poof Doof, in South Yarra, on August 9, with British DJ Jon Pleased Wimmin and former Tasty stars Campbell and Peter McNamara.

Alex Azar on Wednesday will make his first public appearance since being nominated by President Trump to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the agency tasked with managing ObamaCare.
Democrats on the Senate Health Committee are certain to bombard Azar with questions about how he plans to implement ObamaCare, his tenure as a pharmaceutical executive and how he'd lower the rising price of prescription drugs.
ADVERTISEMENT
Republicans have lauded Azar's credentials, saying he has the experience needed at HHS — a massive department overseeing a wide range of health-care issues, from Medicare and Medicaid to drug approvals and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.
Trump tweeted that Azar “will be a star for better healthcare and lower drug prices!”
Azar is a veteran of HHS, having served as its general counsel from 2001 to 2005 under President George W. Bush and as its deputy secretary for two years after that. After leaving HHS, he worked at the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly for nearly a decade, most recently as the president of Lilly USA — a post he left in January.

Patty Murray Patricia (Patty) Lynn MurrayThis week: Congress, Trump set for showdown on emergency declaration Senate reignites blue slip war over Trump court picks Johnson & Johnson subpoenaed by DOJ and SEC, company says MORE (Wash.), the Senate Health Committee's top Democrat, on Wednesday plans to ask if Azar will run HHS similar to his predecessor, Tom Price Thomas (Tom) Edmunds PriceIs a presidential appointment worth the risk? Former Ryan aide moves to K street Grassley to test GOP on lowering drug prices MORE, according to a Senate Democratic aide. Democrats charge that the Trump administration has been purposely sabotaging ObamaCare and eroding women's access to health care.
Azar has made far fewer public comments about ObamaCare than Price, who authored repeal-and-replace bills for years during his time in the House. But in television appearances, Azar hasn't shied away from bashing the law.
In July, a Fox Business host asked Azar his position on an ObamaCare repeal-and-replace bill moving through Congress at the time.
“I think, Stuart, you and I generally agree that the status quo is pretty bad and any change to that that's productive is a good thing,” Azar said in July, adding he'd like to see some changes to the legislation.
Democrats will also quiz Azar over his tenure at Eli Lilly, questioning why the price of insulin — a lifesaving drug for people with Type 1 diabetes — reportedly tripled during his time at the company. They'll ask Azar to commit to lowering drug prices if confirmed as HHS secretary and on his plans for doing so, the Democratic aide said.
“In announcing your nomination, the President promised that you would be ‘a star for better healthcare and lower drug prices!' I have several concerns about your ability to carry out the President's promises,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenSanders: 'Damn right' I'll make the large corporations pay 'fair share of taxes' House to push back at Trump on border GOP Sen. Tillis to vote for resolution blocking Trump's emergency declaration MORE (D-Mass.) wrote in a letter to Azar Tuesday.
“I am concerned that your tenure as a pharmaceutical executive may attenuate your interest in working to provide the American people with ‘lower drug prices.' ”
In the 21-page letter, Warren posed 68 questions she'd like written responses to, while also asking Azar to be prepared to answer the questions at Wednesday's hearing. This included questions on drug pricing, such as if Azar agrees with Trump's comments that drug companies “are getting away with murder,” what steps he'd take to decrease out-of-pocket costs of medicines and if he believes Medicare should be allowed to negotiate drug prices.
A few Democrats have already come out against Azar's nomination.
Hours after Trump announced Azar in mid-November, Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernard (Bernie) SandersPush to end U.S. support for Saudi war hits Senate setback Sanders: 'I fully expect' fair treatment by DNC in 2020 after 'not quite even handed' 2016 primary Sanders: 'Damn right' I'll make the large corporations pay 'fair share of taxes' MORE (I-Vt.) — a vocal critic of drug companies — said he would “vigorously oppose” the nomination.

“During Mr. Azar's tenure at Eli Lilly, this multibillion-dollar corporation dodged taxes while charging Americans outrageously high prices for life-saving prescription drugs,” Sanders said in a statement. “We need an HHS secretary who is willing to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and lower prescription drug prices, not one who has financially benefitted from this greed.”
Azar's supporters say his time working in the drug industry is an asset. They say he understands the ins and outs of the industry, and, thus, knows what needs to be changed.
“In nominating Mr. Azar, the President has chosen someone who is extremely qualified and a respected leader in the healthcare community and who has significant experience in the public and private sector that makes him uniquely qualified to help President Trump solve our nation's healthcare challenges,” Ryan Murphy, an HHS spokesman, wrote in an emailed statement.
At a conference in May, Azar said, “Let's start by saying we have a problem. This is not something to put our head in the sand about. Patients are having to pay too much for drugs.”
He added: “[Drug prices] erupted because we've seen a complete and fundamental restructuring of health insurance in the United States over the last three to five years.”
The opioid epidemic is another issue likely to crop up at the hearing, as deaths from prescription painkillers, synthetic opioids and heroin have quadrupled since 1999. In late October, Trump declared the opioid crisis a national public health emergency, which HHS oversees, and lawmakers will want to know how Azar plans to curb the overdose deaths plaguing the country.

“The fentanyl, heroin, and opioid epidemic is the most pressing public health and safety challenge facing New Hampshire, and the next Secretary of Health and Human Services must understand the urgent need for robust federal funding for states like ours that have been the hardest hit by this crisis,” Hassan said in a statement after meeting with Azar Monday.
Azar was nominated more than a month after Price resigned from office. He stepped down after Politico detailed trips he took on private and military planes costing taxpayers more than $1 million dollars.
Azar's appearance before the Health Committee is considered a courtesy hearing, as the Senate Finance Committee is the one with the power to send his nomination to the Senate floor.

Pool,AP Photo/Eric Gay
Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney on Thursday applauded a new bipartisan plan to overhaul Medicare, hours after the White House slammed it as "radical."
During a Republican presidential debate in Sioux City, Iowa, the former Massachusetts governor called the proposal, which resembles a proposal Romney had earlier made, the result of politicians in both parties caring about "America in a critical time." Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon put forth the proposal that would provide seniors a subsidy called "premium support" that would give them the option to receive traditional Medicare- a government-run health insurance -or the option to buy private insurance. The plan would go into effect in 2022 and the Medicare eligibility age would remain at 65. The White House slammed the plan today saying it would "end Medicare as we know it for millions of seniors." Romney called the Wyden-Ryan plan "good news," and said it was a "big day for our kids and grandkids" because the plan could deal with the country's mounting debt, which has the "potential of crushing our future generations." White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said today that the Obama administration is concerned the new proposal "would undermine, rather than strengthen, Medicare." Earlier in the year, Ryan introduced a more conservative idea that would have entirely phased out government-run Medicare in favor of providing "premium support" vouchers for private insurance. Democrats rebuffed that plan with the same rebuke, that "it would end Medicare as we know it." Romney said he hopes people grasp just "how big today is for our country."

While the federal corporate tax code ostensibly requires big corporations to pay a 35 percent corporate income tax rate, on average, the 280 corporations in our study paid only about half that amount. And many paid far less, including a number that paid nothing at all. [...] Many people will be appalled to learn that a quarter of the companies in our study paid effective federal tax rates on their U.S. profits of less than 10 percent. Others may be surprised to learn that an almost equal number of our companies paid close to the full 35 percent official corporate tax rate.
Via ThinkProgress , Citizens for Tax Justice has released a new report on corporate tax rates, 2008-2010. The report examines 280 of Fortune's list of the 500 largest American companies: there are a lot of interesting tidbits in there, but here are a few of the highlights from the report [PDF]
The average effective tax rate for the 280 companies was 18.5 percent, but the range is surprising: 30 companies paid a negative effective tax rate over the three years, while 71 companies paid effective rates of over 70 percent. Note that this isn't because those companies made no money: members of the negative-tax club include General Electric and ... well, and a phalanx of financial, energy and telecommunications companies.
Over the 2008-10 period, our 280 companies earned almost $1.4 trillion in pretax profits in the United States. Had all of those profits been reported to the IRS and taxed at the statutory 35 percent corporate tax rate, then the 280 companies would have paid $473billion in income taxes over the three years. But instead, the companies as a group paid only about half that amount. The enormous amount they did not pay was due to the hundreds of billions of dollars in tax subsidies that they enjoyed. [...] More than half of the total tax- subsidy dollars over the three years — $114.8 billion — went to just 25 companies, each with more than $1.9 billion in tax subsidies.
This, perhaps, comes closest to summarizing the current situation:
Notably, 56 percent of the total tax subsidies went to just four industries: financial, utilities, tele-communications, and oil, gas & pipelines.
So while people often claim that the financial and oil industries are exceptionally heavy feeders at the government trough, this would seem to provide hard evidence. If over half of all corporate tax subsidies are going to the financial, tele/utility and oil/gas sectors, that seems a rather dramatic tilt in favor of those particular, heavily-lobbying industries.
It may surprise you that the financial sector, of all things, is the recipient of such government largesse. After all, most people are familiar with government efforts to subsidize oil production: what on earth are we subsidizing, on Wall Street?
While the report doesn't break it down by industry, it does single out a few of the popular tax avoidance strategies. This one seems rather solvable, if you ask me:
Most big corporations give their executives (and sometimes other employees) options to buy the company's stock at a favorable price in the future. When those options are exercised, companies can take a tax deduction for the difference between what the employees pay for the stock and what it's worth (while employees report this difference as taxable wages).13 Paying executives with options took off in the mid-1990s, in part because this kind of compensation was exempt from a law enacted in 1993 that tried to reduce income inequality by limiting corporate deductions for executive pay to $1 million per executive. [...] Of our 280 corporations, 185 reported “excess stock-option tax benefits” over the 2008-10 period, which lowered their taxes by a total of $12.3 billion over three years. The benefits ranged from as high as $1.5 billion for Apple over the three years to tiny amounts for a few companies. Just 25 companies enjoyed almost two-thirds of the total excess tax benefits from stock options received by all of our 280 companies, getting $8.1 billion of the $12.3 billion total.
All right then. There's a place to start.
Q: Will FFXV be coming to PCs? Also, what about the PS4Pro version of the game, the improvements will consist only in 4K and HDR or there'll be modes/configurations for the player to choose how the game looks?
HT: About the PC we're focusing all our efforts into the console versions of the game. So we're not looking into it right now to be honest. Making a PC version of the game would mean we'd have to readjust a lot of stuff and concentrate solely on developing it, even though the development team has shown interest in getting a PC version out at some point. About the PS4PRO, it's basically the same thing about the PC – if we wanted to take full advantage of the new hardware that would mean putting in much effort and time to make the game look and run better…and time is something we don't have right now neither we had foreseen the PS4Pro existence before. In the future, with some dedication and time maybe we can get a PS4Pro version of the game that can take advantage of the systems capabilities. But as of right now the game has maxed out the PS4 horsepower.

Darkest Dungeon has been out of Early Access now for almost two weeks and we wanted to take a moment and share some of our excitement over the coverage we've received as well as give all our players an update on what to expect in the coming months.
To kick things off here is just a small sample of some of the coverage we've received:
“The Darkest Dungeon is a triumph… A gold standard for early access games.” – Total Biscuit
“Darkest Dungeon is an incredible take on the classic dungeon crawl.” – Dan Tack, Game Informer
“The Darkest Dungeon is a mean, capricious game. Success is a gambler's thrill, addictive and illicit. It comes rarely.” – Jake Muncy, Wired
“…a grim and merciless tactical strategy game whose great tension comes from its many layers of complexity…” Dan Stapleton, Editors' Choice – IGN
We are super thankful to all of our players who joined us on this journey through Early Access. You helped us make our game the best it can be!
Bug Fixes, Performance Improvements, and Translations
Since release, we've been working on improving the performance of the game for many of our players as well as collecting feedback on our Localization to take back to our partner to improve the overall quality of the translations. We are super grateful for your patience and willingness to help us track down these issues and resolve them as quickly as possible.
As you've no doubt seen, we've already deployed a number of hotfixes, and those will continue as necessary!
Short Term Roadmap
Aside from bug fixes, a bunch of other stuff is in the works for the near future:
Kickstarter Backer Trinkets: these are done and being QA'd. We expect them to deploy within a few days!
Gameplay tweaks: now that we've been able to watch and collect some data regarding the endgame, we have a few gameplay tweaks planned that should help reduce some of the grind that occurs in mid and late-game.
Credits: in addition to crediting ourselves for all of our hard work (har har), we will soon be adding the Kickstarter Backer credits in game ($20 tiers and higher).
Linux : This is in work and we'll announce a date as soon as we know how long it will take.
March 8th Update: Town Events, the Merchant, and the Musketeer (Adventurer Tier Kickstarter reward class). Circle your calendar–these new features are planned for that day!
Long Term Roadmap
Steam Workshop Support – We remain super excited about empowering modders. Sometime this Spring, we want to have Steam Workshop support in the game and create some better tools. We'll keep you posted as we make progress towards that.
PS4 / Vita: We have great partners at Sony, and now that the Steam launch is out of the way, we can dedicate ourselves to figuring out a great controller scheme and continuing with the process of finishing up the PS4 and Vita versions. As you may already know, we showed the PS4 version in a hands-on demo at the PlayStation Experience (PSX) in San Francisco and December, and it was a hit!
While we don't have a firm release date yet, know that it is in work and we'll update you when we can!
Kickstarter Physical Rewards (Art books, prints, dioramas): The game art is done, so we can also begin production of these items!
Other Awesome Stuff: While we can't confirm specifics, let's just say we aren't out of ideas, and have some other things planned as well!
REMINDER: Launch Discount Ends on Tuesday February 2nd! Tell your friends!
Finally, we wanted to remind everyone that on Tuesday, The Darkest Dungeon's price will be returning to its planned price of $24.99 now that we're out of Early Access. During our release day, we had an issue with the Steam store that prevented us from increasing our full release price to $24.99 with the 2 week launch sale price of $19.99. As a quick solution we just set the full price to $19.99 to ensure people were buying the game at the discounted price. On Tuesday, the price will go up to $24.99 where it will remain until the next sale. So if you want to grab it at the Early Access Price/Discounted Price, do so before Tuesday!
Delve deep, bring a shovel, and remember to just let Wilbur be…

The FDA has approved an investigational new drug application for Tumor Paint BLZ-100, a protein-linked dye that highlights cancer cells in images so surgeons can precisely target brain tumors.
The FDA move means Blaze Bioscience can proceed with a clinical trial in Los Angeles, Queensland, Australia and other sites.
Twenty-one adult patients who need surgery for often-deadly glioma brain tumors are expected to enroll in the study, which is aimed at examining the safety of injecting the BLZ-100 molecule into the bloodstream, where it rushes to highlight cancer cells.
The molecule was discovered and first developed by researchers at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle Children's Hospital, and the University of Washington.
BLZ-100 may be especially beneficial for patients whose cancer might otherwise be difficult for surgeons to see — and remove, said Heather Franklin, president and CEO of Blaze Bioscience. It may help solve a long-standing problem in medicine: how to identify tumor cells so surgeons don't remove too little, leaving disease behind — or too much, removing healthy tissue.
Tests of the compound in skin cancer patients in Australia are ongoing, she added.
This first product based on Tumor Paint technology is a molecule that consists of two parts: a chlorotoxin protein that penetrates tumor cells and a dye that glows under near-infrared light.
“We believe it binds to a target protein on the surface of cancer cells,” said Jim Olson, M.D.. a Fred Hutch pediatric brain cancer expert who pioneered the notion of targeting tumors with fluorescent dye to help surgeons distinguish healthy cells from malignancies. “We believe (the target) is not present on the surface of normal cells.”
Participants are expected to enroll in the new trial through December 2015, according to the federal description. Patients must be adults ages 18 to 75 who meet a variety of criteria; eventually, Blaze researchers hope to test BLZ-100 in children, too.
May be useful or other cancers
The Phase 1 clinical trial is only one step toward routine use of Tumor Paint in hospitals around the world, Franklin said. It will be tested in brain tumors now, but preclinical evidence suggests that it may be helpful for a wide range of cancers, including lung, breast, prostate, colorectal, skin and sarcomas.
Blaze Bioscience has invested nearly $10 million, said Franklin, who estimates that it could take five or more years before the product is ready for the commercial market.
Laszlo Piszker told CBC News in March that he and his wife, Margaret, were pulled over by two city police officers on Portage Avenue and fined for using a cellphone while driving, even though they say they've never owned a cellphone.
A Winnipeg couple is shaking their heads, wondering why they got a ticket for talking on a cellphone while driving — when they don't own a cellphone.
Laszlo Piszker and his wife, Margaret, were pulled over by two city police officers in the 2500 block of Portage Avenue on Friday.
Piszker was handed a $199.80 ticket, even after he urged the officers to search him and the car for any sign of a cellphone.
"I told them, 'Do whatever it takes. There's no phone in here; never has been. I don't know anything about the phone.' But they won't have it," he told CBC News.
"They were just going crazy, going to arrest me, and they were nasty to my wife as well."
Piszker, 74, said he is so technically challenged he wouldn't know how to use a cellphone if he did have one.
"I'm the stupidest man you ever talked to when it comes to electronics. I don't know anything about it," he said.
"I'm struggling to put the DVD on. The only thing anybody would find in my car is the garage opener."
Immediately after getting the ticket, the couple went to a nearby police station to complain.
Piszker said the officer there laughed and suggested the ticket was likely issued to fill a quota.
The couple intends to fight the ticket, which Margaret calls "ludicrous."
"We're not going to stand for this. It's just not right," she said, noting they are retired and on a fixed income.
"[The ticket] is a lot of money for anyone, but especially when you didn't do it."
Another Winnipeg motorist, Jody Nelson, said he was recently issued a ticket in St. Vital for using a cellphone while driving, even though he said he wasn't using his phone at the time.
Nelson said the police officer who gave him the ticket did provide an explanation. The officer did not provide a badge number, either, he added.
Nelson said he plans to fight the ticket in court, rather than pay the $200 fine.
"I got to go to my cellphone provider and make sure that they're sending me records," he said. "It's going to cost me to print up all the information."
Nelson said he believes the police are ticketing people simply to generate revenue.
"I'd like to see kind of some transparency," he said. "I get the feeling that even the officers might not even appear in court."
A little over a week ago, Derek Joslin wasn't playing. Now, he's getting about all the minutes he can handle.
The Hurricanes' defenseman, who turned 24 on St. Patrick's Day, has set new career highs in minutes played in each of his last two contests. He had never hit the 20-minute mark in the NHL before playing 20:36 against the Toronto Maple Leafs last Wednesday. He followed that up with 22:39 in the team's overtime win against the New York Islanders two days later.
Paul Branecky Follow on Twitter
Not bad for a player who had been a healthy scratch for the first five games of March.
“I always knew I could do it at this level,” said Joslin. “I just needed someone to give me that opportunity.”
The majority of his minutes have been good ones. Joslin, acquired from the San Jose Sharks on Feb. 18, has yet to post a negative plus/minus rating in any game as a Hurricane, with an overall rating of plus-6 in just seven games of work. He's shown a willingness to mix it up with the opposition and play physical in front his net, and has even chipped in 3 assists since joining the team.
“He blocks shots, he's a big body at five-on-five and he gets the puck through pretty good on the power play,” said coach Paul Maurice. “We're pretty happy with him, and he'll only get better.”
Joslin's increased minutes came with his increased role on special teams. He would occasionally kill penalties with the Sharks, but had never before played on an NHL power play until the Hurricanes began using him there last week. While his primary goal will still be preventing goals, he may be becoming more of a two-way threat than previously given credit for.
“He's showing signs as a young defenseman that he can move and move with the puck,” said Maurice. “If he has a little offensive upside that would be good too, but we really like what we've seen so far.”
Joslin's strong play ever since he arrived on a red-eye flight from San Jose to make his debut on two hours sleep made his removal from the everyday lineup somewhat difficult. When the Hurricanes acquired Bryan Allen, his current defensive partner, in a trade with Florida, Joslin became the seventh defenseman on a team that dresses six. He wouldn't get back in until Jamie McBain, the only defenseman on the team younger than Joslin, suffered a shoulder injury in Washington on March 11.
“It is frustrating, but as a young guy you go through the ropes,” said Joslin of watching games rather than playing them. “I knew it was a numbers game and that Bryan Allen is a veteran who helps this team tremendously.”
“We just kept saying the same thing to him,” said Maurice. “‘We like you and we like your play on such a short sample of games.' He worked hard, never complained, put himself in a position to play well and would make it a very difficult decision if we had to take somebody else out to put McBain back in.”
That decision may occur much sooner than expected. Originally given a 3-4 week timeline that would have had him questionable to return by the end of the regular season, McBain practiced with the team on Sunday and, although he hasn't been cleared for contact and didn't attempt any hard shots, looks to be healing more quickly than anticipated.
“It's one or two weeks ahead of what we had projected,” said McBain. “It's just good to get out there, and there was progress even in practice with learning how much pressure I was able to put on the puck.”
“He's probably on the early part of his curve,” said Maurice. “He's probably closer to two (weeks) than three, but before he goes back in the lineup he's still got a lot of work to do.”
If McBain is cleared to play and the Hurricanes decide to use him, there won't be any clear choice as to which defenseman might exit the lineup to make room. It could very well end up being Joslin once again, although the Canes could elect to dress all seven of their quality blue liners.
Whatever happens, Joslin, as he has been throughout his NHL career, will be prepared for it.
“I've gone through it all year,” he said. “When your number is called, you've got to be able to perform. I have to play every game like it's my last.”

With new Korean recruits like Genius and backed by a to-be-announced sponsor, Team Love Your Girlfriend looks to make a late splash in the StarCraft 2 scene.
Just a month ago, LoveYourGirlfriend was not a team most people had heard of. That all changed when they abruptly announced the
The same question was on everyone's mind: What the hell was going on? When did a previous unknown team get
To learn more about this mystery team and their intentions, I e-sat down with Pascal Anton, the owner and co-founder of LYGF, and James "FosTA" Foster, LYGF's SC2 Manager.
DarkLordOlli: Talk to me a bit about your team origins and where you came from in SC2.
Pascal Anton (owner and co-founder): I started LYGF with a friend of mine during the HotS beta, as a clan. When Pulse eSports was about to disband, we merged with them. That's where James came in. That merging was a big boost for both parties.
DLO: You've recently turned heads with a few big signings. What made you decide to take that big step forward into the competitive scene? Is it a passion project or are you looking for a return?
Pascal: Let's say it started as a business idea that I was passionate about (laughs). I'm definitely looking to make a return with it eventually but for now, the players have to be happy first. I didn't go into it inexperienced, I do have my own business and invested my money into LYGF.
James "FosTA" Foster (SC2 Manager): I was on LgN before they fused with FXO so this is not the first team I'm working on. It's definitely a passion project for me.
DLO: A big question that pops up whenever a rather unknown team starts signing player is "are they being paid?". And if so, "where's the money coming from?". Can you talk me through that?
Pascal: I was actually a bit surprised that people were saying that we came out of nowhere. We've been around for a good 5-6 months, even paying players for that amount of time. But we found an investor that is going to fund the entire professional team. Which means I won't have to invest any money anymore.
DLO: Now, about the signings themselves. You recently announced the addition of players like Genius, Tassadar, Mamuri and Bubble to your professional roster. How do you decide who to sign?
James: The main goal was always to establish a team that's able to compete in teamleagues such as ATC for example. And we'd been looking to sign a big Korean player for a while to really define ourselves as a professional team. But at the same time we were looking out for "middle tier" Koreans in the Korean GM league who we thought had potential.
Our translator "Kidding" used to live in Korea and he knows a lot of professional Korean players well. He's familiar with a lot of talented players and was able to help us decide who to approach. From there on we looked at our budget and asked ourselves what we could offer to whom, and so on. There's always an idea, a dream in mind before we break down the possibilities and so forth. We work out a business plan for each player that contains what we can offer them and what goals we have in mind for that specific player.
Pascal: Oh and Motok. People should be talking about him a lot more because he's really, really good. But people seem to forget him a lot when talking about our signings.
James: Yeah, definitely watch out for Motok.
DLO: How did you eventually make contact with these players?
James: That was different for all of them. For Genius for example it took us about a month to contact him and talk to him about joining our team. He'd been teamless for a while so we'd been interested in signing him. We had to ask our way through a few Koreans to eventually reach him. He was immediately interested but requested that his friend, Sia (previously on NSHS and Zenith) could join as well. We were never going to say no to that opportunity.
Tassadar's story is different, him and Pascal have been friends for a while. They talk a lot and have been keeping in touch. One day Tassadar messaged Pascal, he said he was interested in our team. He was on fOu back then though so we told him that joining would be impossible right now. He knew about that of course so the conversation didn't bear fruit at first. We're not the sort of team that would try to steal players away from someone else. A day later however, fOu disbanded so we immediately got back to Tassadar and talked about it again.
DLO: An important thing for any team out there is definitely creating an image, a profile for yourself. There are teams that define themselves through their results in teamleagues and individual leagues and there are teams that are more focused on being close to the community and focusing on creating content. What type of team is LYGF going to be?
Pascal: We're really trying to do both of them. If you think about it, one really helps the other and both are equally important, at the very least from a business perspective. For example we're going to have a new website going up very soon, we're getting our players to stream a lot more (the Koreans too!) and we're going to have an AMaA on Reddit to clear up almost everything. We're trying to be active on Twitter as well as Facebook to stay in touch with the community.
DLO: An ask me almost everything?
James: Well, we wouldn't like to go into details about contracts for example.
DLO: So what happens if a girl joins the team?
James: Nothing would really change, we just hope that... if she had a significant other that she would love them.
DLO: No LYBF tag?
Pascal: Someone already took that so no (laughs).
DLO: Got it. Now for the fun part. Any shoutouts, where can people follow you? All that fun stuff.
James: You can follow us on Twitter
Pascal: And definitely tune into some of our players' streams. For example, you can watch Genius at
If everything goes the way LYGF says and hopes, then they have a bright future. However, by now we know it's all too easy for things to go awry in esports. All that remains is to wait and see what happens. Just a month ago, LoveYourGirlfriend was not a team most people had heard of.

Down the Tube: YouTube Quietly Launches New Censorship Scheme Designed to Limit Access to Videos
YouTube has been accused of censorship after introducing a controversial new policy designed to reduce the audience for videos deemed to be "inappropriate or offensive to some audiences".
The Google-owned video site is now putting videos into a "limited state" if they are deemed controversial enough to be considered objectionable, but not hateful, pornographic or violent enough to be banned altogether.
This policy has come into force in the past week, prompting anger among members of the YouTube community.
The Sun Online understands Google and YouTube insiders refer to the tactic as "tougher treatment".
One prominent video-maker slammed the new scheme whilst WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange described the measures as "economic censorship".
However, YouTube sees it as a way of maintaining freedom of speech and allowing discussion of controversial issues without resorting to the wholesale banning of videos.
Videos which are put into a limited state cannot be embedded on other websites.
They also cannot be easily published on social media using the usual share buttons and other users cannot comment on them.
Crucially, the person who made the video will no longer receive any payment.
Earlier this week, Julian Assange wrote: "'Controversial' but contract-legal videos [which break YouTube's terms and conditions] cannot be liked, embedded or earn [money from advertising revenue].
"What's interesting about the new method deployed is that it is a clear attempt at social engineering. It isn't just turning off the ads.
"It's turning off the comments, embeds, etc too.
"Everything possible to strangle the reach without deleting it."
Criticism of YouTube's policies is most acute among people on the right of the political spectrum, who fear that Silicon Valley is dominated by the left and determined to silence opposing voices - a claim denied by tech giants like Facebook and Google.
The "tougher treatment" system is in its early stages and is likely to provoke more controversy in the coming months, particularly in an era where political debate online is highly polarised and extremely passionate.
Right-wingers on the internet believe Silicon Valley is dead set on censoring conservative websites and channels, taking its cue from over-sensitive members of Generation Snowflake who are known for taking offence too easily.
At the same time, left-wingers think the right is spreading hate and must be silenced for the good of society.
The "culture war" between these two sides shows no signs of abating - and YouTube is the frontline in this increasingly vicious battle of ideas.
ATHENS (Reuters) - Struggling with a growing logjam of refugees, Greece recalled its ambassador to Vienna on Thursday in protest at moves by Austria and Balkan states to make it harder for migrants to head north across Europe.
The unusual step reflected Greek fury at being excluded from a meeting of Balkan states in Vienna on Wednesday to coordinate border restrictions across the region to limit the flow.
“Greece will not become a Lebanon or a warehouse of souls,” said migration minister Yannis Mouzalas. Lebanon, a country of 4 million people, is hosting more than 1 million refugees from the civil war in neighbouring Syria.
Greek officials estimated there were 20,000 refugees and migrants trapped in the country as a result of the new restrictions, which began when Austria announced on Feb. 18 it would let in no more than 3,200 people a day and cap daily asylum claims at 80.
European countries are trading bitter recriminations as they wrestle with the continent's worst migration crisis since World War Two. More than a million people arrived in 2015, most fleeing conflict in countries like Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, and over 100,000 have reached Greece and Italy already this year.
Greece is likely to face a cost of more than half a billion euros this year, equivalent to about 0.4 percent of economic output, even as it struggles to cope with its worst financial crisis in generations.
“It's a conservative‎ estimate. Costs could go up if there is increased inflow and refugees become logjammed in Greece due to border closures,” said a central bank source.
FACILITIES FULL
With reception facilities full, Greek authorities were using stadiums as temporary accommodation. They planned to boost reception capacity by 20,000 by March 6, Defence Minister Panos Kammenos said.
On Thursday, it emerged that the United Nations refugee agency had sought information from tourism authorities on leasing hotels with a minimum capacity of 100 beds for an initial period of nine months, and with immediate availability.
Ignoring warnings from Greek authorities that the border was shut, hundreds of migrants set off on the country's main north-south motorway to Idomeni, a small community on the frontier with Macedonia.
“We have been here for six days. We cannot take it any more,” said Hasan, an Iraqi in a group of hundreds walking some 10 km (6 miles) from the Macedonian border.
One couple were using a plastic box as a crib for their infant, pulling it along the road. Further south at Tempe in central Greece, another group of migrants walked through a valley shadowed by police. One man held an infant wrapped in a turquoise blanket in one hand, angrily waving an empty milk bottle with the other.
SLOW RESPONSE
Greece angered EU nations last year with its initial slow reaction to the crisis, and an apparent policy of simply waving migrants and refugees through the country.
In recent months it has tightened controls, but the tone among EU partners has become increasingly critical as Athens accuses them of reneging on a deal to share out up to 160,000 refugees across the continent.
On Tuesday, Athens accused Vienna of an ‘unfriendly act'. The move to recall the envoy for consultations was designed to “safeguard friendly relations between the states and the people of Greece and Austria”, a foreign ministry statement said.
Unilateral initiatives and violations of international and European laws by EU member states threatened to “undermine the very foundations of European unification”, the ministry said.
The Austrian foreign ministry said it could be an opportunity for the recalled ambassador to inform Greeks of the situation, and the challenges for countries lying along the migrant route such as Austria.
BOSTON -- The saying goes that every possession in the postseason matters.
If that is truly the ruling principle, it stands to reason the more possessions a team can procure, the better chance it has to be successful. Any player that can conjure up extra possessions simply through sheer will -- he'd be invaluable, right?
It would be a disservice to describe the Cleveland Cavaliers' Tristan Thompson in any other way through the Cavs' 3-0 start to their first-round series against the Boston Celtics.
Thompson has 14 offensive rebounds through the first three games. Boston, as a team, has 29.
Not only is Thompson grabbing offensive boards, but he has been the Cavs' most clutch postseason player based on when he's grabbing them. In Game 2, he boarded a LeBron James miss with 1:32 to go that eventually set up a James layup with 1:13 left to put Cleveland up by eight. Later, he rebounded a J.R. Smith miss with 43.7 seconds remaining, setting up two Kyrie Irving free throws with 39.7 seconds left to increase the Cavs' lead to 10.
Game 3 was even more dramatic. Thompson rebounded an Irving miss with 2:18 to go, tapping it back to Irving who found Kevin Love for a corner 3-pointer to double the Cavs' edge from three to six with 2:13 to go. He followed that up by rebounding a James miss with 49.9 seconds left setting up a Love 3-pointer to put the Cavs up by eight with 26.7 seconds left and effectively end the game.
"That's my best play call," Cavs coach David Blatt joked. "That's my play call that I always make: 'Tristan, go get the offensive rebound, and kick it out to the three, and we're going to score.' And I do call that one."
James called Thompson an "offensive-rebound machine" after Game 3. The backup big man is averaging a meager 8.0 points and 8.0 rebounds in the series, yet as David Zavac of the blog Fear the Sword pointed out, he has a playoff PER of 19.4 on a usage rate of just 11.9 percent. In Game 2, he had 11 rebounds and zero shot attempts. He knows what he's out there for.
"I just do what I can to get our team extra possessions," Thompson said. "That's my role here on the team, just to rebound and fight for loose balls. Fortunately it went my way when I got that offensive rebound and kicked it out, and Kevin hit the 3."
The Celtics have challenged the Cavs in every game of the series despite being the No. 7 seed to Cleveland's No. 2 seed. The 3-0 series record could look a lot different without the plays that Thompson has made.
"Listen, you got to give all the credit in the world to Tristan for his just relentless attacking of the glass at both ends, his willingness to do the dirty work and his desire to get to the ball and to make possession plays for us," Blatt said.
Added Irving, who came into the league as a rookie with Thompson in 2011, and has experienced both the lean and lush times in Cleveland in step with him: "He's going to continue to go in there every single play until you stop him."
James said Thompson's continuous energy can have a cumulative affect on the opposition. "It's demoralizing for the opponent when a guy is wrestling with two to three guys down there and is still able to come up with it," he said.
After colorfully summing up his dirty-work efforts by saying, "I'll be a janitor forever," after Game 1, Thompson is trying to snatch that nickname back like it was a teammate's shot caroming off the rim.
"We ain't going to call it a janitor no more," he said. "We're going to call it, like, 'The Clean-Up Guy.' Just do the little things. Janitor is (done with), no disrespect. I'd rather call The Clean-Up Guy. Just do all the little things. So, we'll roll with that. We'll roll with that. We'll roll with that name now."
Christmas is usually a time for carols, good tidings and presents. Usually.
The recession however, has worked its way into every household and personal budget, causing much uncertainty surrounding the holiday season this year. You might have a reason to celebrate, but here are 10 reasons it's going to be a bad Christmas for the U.S.
1. The Grinch has nothing to steal.
According to a recent study by McClatchy Newspapers, 43% of 233 police departments saw a rise in crime this year, which most attribute to the recession.
2. The only gift Santa can afford to give is love.
76% of families are expecting to cut back on holiday spending according to a ConsumerReports holiday shopping poll.
3. The elves are going back to their own country to find work.
Immigrants take the brunt of the recession and are often the first casualties. Many are leaving the U.S. to head back home, where they might actually find work.
4. Rudolph can't find any seasonal work.
Many employers are cutting seasonal jobs, and more people are expected to compete for each open position. We're pretty sure Rudolph and many of the high-schoolers in the nation are going to be funemployed this season.
5. The ghost of Christmas Future broke the bad news about employment to the ghost of Christmas Present.
Although the broader economy shows signs of recovering, unemployment is expected to remain high for a prolonged period of time because jobs will be the last thing to recover.
6. The gingerbread man has become a cannibal to survive.
The number of people on food stamps, especially in urban areas, has climbed dramatically in the past two years.
7. People are actually planning on giving birth in mangers to save on health care.
Health care costs are on the rise again for 2009, and many people without health insurance won't seek any new coverage.
8. Parents will tell their kids that there is no Santa Claus to avoid buying presents.
There is an actual article on how to tell your kids Santa doesn't exist on eHow. We're not kidding.
9. Tim Burton was hired to write two sequels, “The Nightmare During Christmas” and “The Nightmare After Christmas.”
The box office definitely reflects reality, especially when there are more disaster movies for the holidays, including post-apocalyptic thrillers like 2012.
10. Charlie Brown has a right to be depressed since Barack Obama will steal his limelight. Good grief.
President Barack Obama is expected to address the nation about sending 300,000 additional troops to Afghanistan in a televised appearance that will push back the time slot reserved for the Charlie Brown Christmas special.

The Haunted Mask
The real reason that teenagers love wearing Halloween masks is because they cover up all of their acne.
Unfortunately, once on, the macabre masque in this horror movie cannot be removed.
Teased by her friends for her faint-heartedness, Carly Beth (Kathryn Long) ditches her duck Halloween costume for a more menacing mask that she stole from a costume shop.
Unbeknownst to her, the mask has strange properties that manipulate her behavior. And when she goes to remove it, she's shocked to find it's permanently affixed to her face.
Adapted from one of R.L. Stein's most infamous Goosebumps tale, The Haunted Mask also marked the genesis of the long-running television series.
Although the narrative is frightful and mindful, especially for the prepubescent market, it's the outdated special effects that really do this parable an injustice.
Besides, nowadays, instead of a haunted mask it would have to be a haunted sexy pirate costume.

CONCORD, N.C. – Nationwide has expanded its three-year relationship with Hendrick Motorsports to become the majority sponsor of driver Dale Earnhardt Jr. and the No. 88 Chevrolet SS team beginning with the 2015 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season.
Nationwide, which in May announced it will join Hendrick Motorsports as a corporate partner, will increase its primary sponsorship of Earnhardt to 21 Sprint Cup events, including the Daytona 500, for each of the next three seasons. The revised agreement provides Nationwide with nine additional primary races in 2015 and eight additional primary races in both 2016 and 2017.
“We're thrilled to be deepening our partnership with the Hendrick Motorsports team,” said Matt Jauchius, chief marketing officer at Nationwide. “We look forward to seeing Nationwide on the No. 88 for NASCAR's biggest races over the next three seasons.”
Nationwide is making an early debut as Earnhardt's primary sponsor during this weekend's Sprint Cup event in Richmond, Virginia, where it is previewing the 2015 No. 88 Nationwide Chevrolet SS paint scheme.
“That Nationwide has already elected to grow the sponsorship sends a clear message about the opportunities they see and how well our teams are working together,” said Rick Hendrick, owner of Hendrick Motorsports. “It's quickly become a strong relationship, and we're committed to building on that foundation and delivering results in every facet of the program.”
Earnhardt, 39, is a two-time Nationwide Series champion and has 22 career points-paying Sprint Cup victories. NASCAR's 11-time most popular driver, he has won three races in 2014, including his second career Daytona 500, and currently sits second in the standings. The Kannapolis, North Carolina, native recently clinched a fourth consecutive appearance in the championship-deciding Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup, which will begin following Richmond.
“I know the people at Nationwide extremely well and truly appreciate how invested they are in our team and our sport,” said Earnhardt, whose family has been insured by Nationwide for more than 35 years and who has been featured in its national advertising since 2009. “It's extremely gratifying that they recognize so much value in the partnership and want to do more. Having this kind of support and seeing so many positive things happening around the team feels really good.”
Fans and members of the media can follow the new @Nationwide88 handle on Twitter for updates related to Earnhardt and his No. 88 team.
It may not seem like it, but 2006 was a different time. The concept of viral fame didn't really exist yet. Even the creators of YouTube hadn't quite figured out what it was for. (They thought it was going to be place where you could easily access “big, newsworthy footage,” like Janet Jackson's nipple slip.)
It was into this online Wild West that comic and actor Liam Kyle Sullivan uploaded his massive hit “Shoes.” For those of you who've forgotten its glory, “Shoes” has Sullivan playing Kelly, a teenage girl with two things; an asshole family who doesn't get her and an undying love of footwear. The whole song is backed by a sort of electroclash lo-fi thump.
The folks over at Noisey interviewed Sullivan to get his thoughts on “Shoes” a decade after its birth. In that interview, Sullivan says that yes, he was listening to a lot of Peaches and Chicks On Speed when he wrote “Shoes.” He says that the new method of YouTube comedy—do it cheap and often and talk directly to your audience—is for sure a more cost-efficient model than doing a “Shoes” every three months. And that it's hard to say what “viral” even means in the age of Vine. Also, that he doesn't totally understand how Vine works.

He also adds that Kelly was kind of a flop when he first debuted the character, and that her terrible family is sort of based on his own experiences growing up:
Her creation took a long time. I first started talking like Kelly in the car, driving around and just saying, “Shut up!” I remember the first time I did that character in public, I didn't have her look, I was just a guy doing a silly voice. I imagined a teenage girl who had braces, and had to pull her lips back and hold her head back because they were so heavy. That simple bitchiness came out—I'm only going to say a couple of words because it's almost too much for me to talk. I did that character at the Acme and it didn't work, it wasn't funny. So I scuttled it, and brought it back a few years later when I was doing stand up, and it didn't work then either. I'm chalking it up to not having the look—I didn't have the wig or the chunky glasses. I think once I had all that stuff, it worked. But I could be wrong. Some of her family is borrowed from my own life, because I was the younger brother and my sister, who isn't like Kelly at all, had restrictions on her that I didn't have. Being younger, the parents make all of the mistakes with the older one, and then with the younger one they're like, “Ah, he's fine, let him be.” And also being a girl, maybe you have an earlier curfew than a boy would—those kinds of things. So I just exaggerated that. I made the parents just openly hate her. Here she is, a young woman now, and they're not comfortable with that. But the boy, he gets a computer and a car, whatever he wants.

It's worth it to take some time today and re-watch “Shoes,” not only to appreciate how different the internet was 10 years ago, but also because the last minute of that video is absolutely magical.
The season has ended; the summer is upon us. A time for enjoying cold lager, cheap paperbacks on sunbeds, and counting down the days until August, when we can get back into the weekly routine of enjoying this thing of ours.
And yet we never entirely let it go... even during these matchless months. Wives and girlfriends across the country despair as we fill the weekends watching last seasons reviews, stressing over the transfer gossip on the back pages, and scouring the Internet to see if Umbro has released next years kit yet.
This year, weve even got the World Cup – and plenty of Blue representation to look forward to. Anyone else bought the Mundial mag from Steeple Pine? Office workers, have you got the tournament broadcast schedule inputted into your Outlook calendar? After not being all that bothered about the World Cup since Italia 90, is it just me, or is there some promise of magic finally at this years tournament?
And talking about magic, did you see Ross Barkley in the warm-up game against Ecuador? That was the Ross we all know and love, eh? And it seems that the rest of the football world is starting to know about him, too. Which is something us Blues are apprehensive of, is it not? Painful memories of Rooneys transfer still fresh in minds...
But, as much as we, as fans, worship them, no player is irreplaceable. Every player has a price. A shrewd club knows how to value players, and wont buy a player for more than hes worth, or sell a player for less. Implicit in this also, is that a shrewd club wont hold onto a player when an offer comes in which they believe exceeds the value of said player. This is why its the case that, even under a long contract, any player can be prized away from their club.
And so, it could be argued that selling Rooney was one of the best things Everton did in the last decade, considering the cash we got for him, at only 18 years old, and how this apparently saved our club from financial ruin. And credit must be given to the club for getting top dollar for the sales of the likes of Rodwell, Lescott, and Fellaini, and bringing in bargains such as Coleman, Stones, and McCarthy. I think we can say with confidence that weve managed to sell for more than the true value, and bought for less than the true value, in the majority of transfers over the last ten years. (Pienaar and a few others excepted.)
This is why the sale of Coleman, Stones, and McCarthy may not only be inevitable, but even in the best interests of Everton Football Club, in the long term. Theres no room for sentimentality in football. If you could reduce it to statistics, you would. If a team has a 55% chance of winning the average Premier League game with Coleman in the side, but you can sell him and replace him for two players whos inclusion in the team raises your winning chance to 55.5%, then youd be better off in the long term to sanction the transfer.
The link between probability of on-field success, individual contribution of any one player, and therefore value of said player, has to be down to the manager of the club. Of course, its not an exact science, and for most, it seems no more scientific than throwing darts at a board. But, for the likes of David Moyes (give him his dues), and, I believe, Roberto Martinez, there is a shrewd, calculating, and strategic mind behind all activity in the transfer market. They may not always get it right, but there is a science behind their methods, and over the long term, they will make more good decisions than bad ones.
So, given all of that, if Real Madrid, PSG, or – God forbid –Liverpool, come in with a £100 million offer for Ross Barkley, then we should snap their hands off... right? No; not in Barkleys case. But Im not making this case based on sentimental reasons, nor solely on on-pitch statistical analysis, but based on a business sense that tells me Ross Barkley could be worth much more than £100 million over the next 10 years, both on the pitch and off it.
I believe that the story of Ross – a local lad, playing for his boyhood team, spearheading our resurgence from obscurity – is going to be a marketing dream. I believe Everton are not only a sleeping giant on the pitch, but off it too, in terms of our "brand" and how we can capture the imagination of a knowledgeable footballing population growing sick of being force-fed the Sky Sports driven agenda which is as appetizing as a McDonalds Happy Meal to a connoisseur.
The football following populace of the world is fed up with Sky, Kopite pundits, sterilization of terrace culture, cheating and diving, mercenaries playing for oil money, and all that the game has become. No-one was fooled by the Kopite pundits agenda to paint Liverpool as some kind of "choice of the people", "everybodys second team" malarkey in spite of everyone knowing perfectly well they are a mega rich behemoth backed by a group of American businessmen for whom, along with the Manchester United owners, their sole motivation to "invest in the British sporting market" is that they have identified "under-monetization of sports consumers in the UK". In other words, the American businessmen are coming for us because were not being milked enough already!
I believe Everton, owned by boyhood fan Bill Kenwright, with local lad Ross Barkley as star player, with our feet on the ground, shrouded in our history, still in possession of our souls, strong local fan base, unwithered roots, playing football the right way, playing the "School of Science" way, will capture the imagination of the silent majority of decent, intelligent, thoughtful fans the world over. It will take time, yes. Intelligent, thoughtful fans dont just jump onto the latest bandwagon. But I believe – if we keep doing what weve been doing, and we keep hold of Barkley, as the poster boy of everything that is great about our club – then, slowly but surely, Everton will get the global recognition and plaudits we deserve.
And I believe we can eventually go one better than Atlético and win the Premier League and even go on to win the Champions League too, with Ross as our talisman. Its all a long way off, and first must come Champions League qualification – and hopefully Europa League success next season – but before even that, Id say one of the keys to our on-field and off-field success would be securing Ross on a long-term, well-paid contract, to send the message to all and sundry that hes not going anywhere.
And if they want their own Ross Barkley, then theyll have to develop one themselves from their own local pool of talent. Good luck to them with that.
ps: Im aware of the inherent contradiction in me arguing we should keep Ross for commercial reasons which would involve monetizing a brand purporting to be a counterweight to the over-commercialization of the game! My point, I suppose, is that a) At least it would have built organically and be local at its nucleus; b) Im not against capitalism per se – I just ask that its done with a little class; and c) I think the sort of fans wed attract globally would be decent people with good taste – exactly the opposite of the crass individuals worldwide following our neighbours and the "top of the product endorsements" table over at the "Theatre of Nightmares".

A woman cyclist was killed after being struck by a lorry just yards from the Bank of England in horrific scenes today.
The 26-year-old cyclist was struck by a tipper lorry at one of the City's busiest junctions at the height of this morning's rush hour.
Doctors and paramedics carried out emergency treatment in the middle of Bank junction as fire crews held blue tarpaulin screens around the victim.
The young woman died from head injuries around 40 minutes after the accident despite desperate efforts to save her.
All roads leading into the junction were closed to traffic following the incident at 9am.
The woman is the eighth cyclist to die on London's roads so far this year. Six of the victims have been women and seven deaths have involved lorries.
One witness said: “I must have left the Tube seconds after it happened. I saw people - passers-by- trying to help her as she was trapped under the wheels.
“Then ambulance crews arrived and they must have been working on her behind a tarpaulin. It was horrible. She would have left home this morning going to work and now she's dead. Makes you realise how fragile life is.”
Christian Stanley, who works in insurance, said: “I came out the tube and heard a crunch and heard people screaming. I ran over to her. She wasn't conscious. The driver came out and looked shocked.
“People were gathering around and screaming. She was about 25-35. It was horrendous.”
The female cyclist involved in a collision at #Bank junction has sadly died — City Police (@CityPolice) June 22, 2015
Another witness, Allan Williams, said on Twitter: “V distressing at Bank, where there's been another incident with cyclist and lorry. CPR taking place, lorry driver distraught.”
Charlie Lloyd, spokesman for the London Cycling Campaign, described the junction as "frightening" as he called for it to be completely pedestrianised.
He said: "I think everyone coming through that junction knows it is horrendous. This junction is at the heart of the city. It would make a fantastic pedestrianised space. There is no need for road traffic. It should be made wonderful and not frightening."
Donnachadh McCarthy, spokesman for campaign group Stop Killing Cyclists, said the local authority had made no investment to improve the junction's safety despite repeated calls from campaigners.
He said: "It is one of the most dangerous junctions in the City of London and almost nothing has been done about it. "
Commenting on today's tragedy, he said: "This is the third time in two weeks we have to send our condolences to the family of a cyclist. We are just gutted for them. Three times in two weeks is just too much."
London Ambulance Service said it sent an ambulance crew and the air ambulance to the scene after being alerted at 9am.
A spokeswoman said: “Sadly, despite the extensive efforts of our crew, a woman was pronounced dead at the scene.”
The driver of the blue and yellow lorry was still talking to police officers an hour after the incident. At the time he had not been arrested.
The incident comes two years after the City of London Corporation agreed to implement new road safety measures for pedestrians and cyclists at the Bank junction.
The corporation admitted that the junction, a meeting point for six major roads, was a hotspot for collisions involving cyclists.
One of the two most recent incidents was in Camberwell on May 29 when physiotherapist Esther Hartsilver died.
On April 9, Moira Gemmill, 55, a leading figure in the arts and design world, was killed in a collision with a tipper truck close to Lambeth Bridge in Westminster.
A City of London Police spokesman said officers were called to reports of a road traffic collision involving a female pedal cyclist and a tipper truck at Bank Junction at 8.59am. The woman was pronounced dead at the scene at 9.42am.

With a lap to go in the men's 5,000m at the Adidas Grand Prix on Saturday, Ben True‘s eyes widened as if he were in the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon with coordinates aligned to punch it to hyperdrive. True was shoulder to shoulder with the leader in a tight pack of six runners. He had triumphed in faster 5,000m races, but not on this stage and against this caliber of competition (he finished fourth at the meet in 2013, running 13:16 as Hagos Gebrhiwet prevailed in 13:10).
Given the race's methodical pace, it was clear that True would have a kick, but so too would Olympic 1500m silver medalist Nick Willis, who, with 200m to go, slingshot from sixth to first in a matter of 10 seconds. There weren't many seconds to go after that. “When I came up to the lead I thought Thomas Longosiwa was going to kick again, but once I passed him I thought I had it. I figured all the other guys I had already passed. But that's a long straightaway into a bit of wind.” Willis said after the race.
“I had doubts, yeah.” said True. “On that straightaway I moved out to lane 3 and I just really pushed hard. I realized I wasn't losing more, I was starting to gain, and when you have that little bit of positive feedback, that you are closing a little bit, mentally you get such a big gain that you can really go for it.” True won in 13:29, beating Willis by three tenths of a second. “I can't let a 1500 meter runner win a 5k,” he laughed.
For a 1500 meter runner, Willis has dabbled quite a bit in the 5,000m. He has raised his training volume with an eye to the future at both distances. “I still think the 1500 is the event I have the best chance of medals. Perhaps I'll consider giving the 5k a go as a more concerted effort after this Olympic cycle. At the moment it's just used as a mechanism to keep me accountable to the high mileage training. My shortest runs have been 90 minutes the last three months. Weekly mileage is 95, I run six days a week. It has taught me how to strengthen my legs to cope with running rounds as well. At the last few championships my legs have been pretty sore after the semifinals. Doing 150s or 100 meter strides after long runs is a good way to toughen up the muscles.”

The media scrum around Ajee Wilson after her victory in the women's 800 was thicker than it had been in past meets. The 21-year-old, who appeared on the cover of the event program, finally seems to be getting her due. Wilson likes to keep it simple. Her goal for this race was to win, and she did, in 1:58.83, dispatching the field by over half a second.

At Friday's press conference, David Rudisha stated his goal was to run a world leading time. Check. His 1:43.58 clipped the prior 2015 best, Ayanleh Soulieman's 1:43.78, and bested his own winning time from last year by over a second. The men's 800 meter race was the most fashionable of the lot, with Duane Solomon matching his orange Saucony singlet with an orange bandana and orange-tinted glasses, while French 800 meter ace Pierre-Ambroise Bosse ran in a white Henley collared tee-shirt equally suitable for tennis.
What was an off year for Rudisha last year was a year off for Usain Bolt, and the difference showed. Bolt stated at the presser on Friday that his goal was to run sub 20 and that one of his remaining career goals is to go sub 19. Bolt's narrow victory in 20.29 into a -2.9 m/s headwind wasn't quite what he was hoping for. The Jamaican legend was upstaged by the 19.58 that 20-year-old Canadian Andre De Grasse ran Friday at the NCAA championships (wind was +2.4 m/s for De Grasse). Bolt is 28, Justin Gatlin 33.

In her blog entry on June 30, 2013, Olympic steeplechaser Bridget Franek wrote that “I've decided to hang up the spikes temporarily and take an extended break from the sport.” Two years later Franek is once again thinking about the Olympics, this time with a different mindset. “I want to make the team in 2016. Right now I'm running with the motivation of using this talent that I've been given and this opportunity that I've been given to travel and to compete and to get into some of these big meets as a way to do something bigger. I want to get more involved in communities and reach out a little more and use running as a platform for social change. It's not just about me any more.” Franek finished sixth in the 3000m steeplechase on Saturday, running 9:36, slicing 11 seconds off her time from the Birmingham Diamond League meet a week ago.
Another runner making a splash on the comeback trail was 2008 Olympian Erin Donohue, the surprise winner in the women's 1000. Nike Oregon Project's Treniere Moser doubled back from the 800 and gave a spirited chase for second. “We decided a couple of days ago that the double would be best for my future,” said Moser. “When the idea was put to the table I'm like, that sounds so painful, but I'm glad I did it.” When asked to comment on the recent controversy surrounding coach Alberto Salazar, Moser said “[t]he coaches have done a great job of putting it all on them. At the end of the day we know our job is to go out there and perform. They've been really good about making sure we stay focused and not letting the distractions take over.”

The use of white phosphorus and other incendiary weapons is covered in one protocol of a 1980 international treaty, the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, that bans making civilians “the object of attack” by such arms. More broadly, though, international officials have acknowledged that militaries can legitimately use the substance in some cases.
Phosphorus rounds are usually used to spread a thick, white smoke to screen military actions and mark specific areas. Military experts say phosphorus is often particularly useful in urban warfare, in part because it creates tall columns of smoke that can obscure upper-story windows.
But human rights groups harshly criticize its use, saying that the horrible burns and the widespread fires that phosphorus causes make it a menace to civilians. Peter Herby, the head of the Arms Unit for the International Committee of the Red Cross, said in a statement that his agency would not comment publicly on whether it considered Israel's use of white phosphorus a violation of international humanitarian standards, pending further investigation.
In Gaza, Ms. Abu Halima said that when her family was hit, “fire came from the bodies of my husband and my children.”
“The children were screaming, ‘Fire! Fire!' and there was smoke everywhere and a horrible, suffocating smell,” she said. “My 14-year-old cried out, ‘I'm going to die. I want to pray.' I saw my daughter-in-law melt away.”
Dr. Nafez Abu Shaban, head of Shifa's burn unit, said the family's burns, which he and an assisting doctor from Egypt had treated, were of a kind he had never encountered, reaching to the muscle and bone.

“They were deeper and wider than anything I had seen; a bad odor came from the wounds and smoke continued to come out of them for many hours,” he said in his office around the corner from Ms. Abu Halima's sickbed.

He added, “We took out a piece of foreign matter that a colleague identified as white phosphorous.”
Dr. Shaban said that dozens of such cases came to Shifa during the war and that his unit was unprepared to handle them. Many of the burn patients have been sent to Egypt and abroad from there. In a few cases, he said, seemingly limited burns led to the patients' deaths.

The doctors discovered that the best way to deal with such burns was to get the patients immediately into surgery and clean the areas well. Initial attempts to dress phosphorous burns like normal ones made them worse.
Part of what makes white phosphorus controversial is that it can be difficult to control how wide the effects are. When the shells explode in the air, they disperse pieces of felt soaked in phosphorus — larger version of the shells contain more than 100 of them — that can land on people and cause intense burning, according to Chris Cobb-Smith, a British Army veteran who is here as part of Amnesty International's investigative team.
The newspaper Haaretz reported Wednesday that one focus of the Israeli military's inquiry was the use of white phosphorus by a reserve brigade that fired about 20 such shells in Beit Lahiya, where Ms. Abu Halima lives. Col. Shai Alkalai, an artillery officer, is leading the investigation.
Haaretz said about 200 such shells were fired in the fighting, nearly all at orchards where Hamas gunmen and rocket-launching crews were taking cover.
The article added that some of the rounds used were recently acquired 120-millimeter phosphorus shells that have a computerized targeting system attached to a G.P.S. unit. It quoted commanders as saying the shells had been effective but were apparently also responsible for the strike on a United Nations school that killed two and a friendly-fire episode that seriously wounded two Israeli officers.
Donatella Rovera, Amnesty International's researcher for Israel, the West Bank and Gaza, said in an interview, “We don't know why they used them, but we do know that it could constitute a war crime.”
She added, “It is not a banned weapon, but it matters how you use it and there is no reason to use it in such densely populated areas. We want a full impartial investigation, not one by the army that used it.”

Ms. Abu Halima said that on Tuesday some relatives went to her home and found it destroyed. They then properly buried the dead.
She wept with fury, saying that as farmers she and her family had good relations with Israelis, selling them produce in past years. But now, she said, she wants to see Israel's leaders — she named the foreign minister and president — “burn like my children burned.”
“They should feel the pain we felt.”
As the Trump administration looks to deal with democrats on immigration, DACA students at Loyola University are fighting against legislation that would harm friends and family.

The day after the Trump administration said it would end a program that protects young undocumented immigrants from deportation, students at one Chicago-area medical school donned their white coats and held a rally to support their undocumented classmates. Their message? #HereToStay.
Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine has 32 undocumented students, the most of any medical program in the country—and nearly half of around 70 such students in medical schools nationwide in the United States. In addition to the routine stress of earning an M.D.—classwork, licensing exams, and applying for residencies—they are stressed about their futures in the country.

Last month, President Donald Trump announced a six-month "wind down" of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program offering two-year renewable permits to undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. It has allowed some 800,000 so-called "Dreamers" to get work permits, driver's licenses, loans, and other official documents; the nickname comes from the DREAM (Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors) Act, a failed federal legislative proposal to legalize their status.

Unless Congress acts to extend or replace the program by March 5th, DACA recipients' permits will expire at a rate of around 1,000 per day, leaving them without benefits and vulnerable to deportation.
Under the terms of the wind-down, those with permits set to expire in the next six months had until October 5th to renew them. After that, the government will no longer accept applications. In recent weeks, tens of thousands of affected DACA recipients rushed to renew, lining up at legal clinics to get help to fill out the paperwork.
Loyola Stritch students Belsy Garcia Manrique and Cesar Montelongo, both Dreamers, have anxiously awaited news of DACA's fate since Trump took office. On the campaign trail, Trump pledged to end the program as part of his hard-line platform on illegal immigration. But his tone on DACA seemed to soften in the initial weeks of his presidency, even as he implemented strict immigration enforcement measures elsewhere.
Now that DACA is ending, though, the students are dealing with the uncertainty in very different ways. Manrique, 27, has found an escape through work at a hospital as part of her third-year clinical rotations.
"As a medical student, you have to focus on your studies," Manrique said. "But having this news literally everywhere [can] affect you in such a personal manner, it takes a toll on your studies and concentration."
Meanwhile, Montelongo, 28, has thrown himself into activism in hopes that Congress will pass legislation to replace DACA.
"One of the elements in our favor is all the outrage over DACA ending," said Montelongo, a joint M.D.-Ph.D. candidate. "They're getting rid of our only safety net for no reason. And that really resonates with the mainstream."
Last month, Montelongo traveled to Washington, D.C., to tell his story and ask a group of senators to pass the DREAM Act, which would give Dreamers permanent residency and a pathway to citizenship. He spoke up again when Illinois senator Dick Durbin, who introduced the bill, visited Loyola Stritch to advocate on the students' behalf.
"The timer is counting down,' he added. "And I feel like that is a good thing because it will force Congress to act."
Montelongo was born in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, a city long plagued by drug gangs and violence. At age 10, he and his family arrived in the U.S. legally on tourist visas, which they overstayed. Though his parents recently obtained family-sponsored green cards after a 10-year wait, by then Montelongo and his sister were too old to qualify as part of the family.
DACA, introduced through executive action by President Barack Obama in 2012, was the siblings' only option for legal status in the U.S. It allowed Montelongo to apply for medical school, his lifelong dream, and to obtain a Social Security number so he could receive loans and a stipend for his Ph.D.
"Growing up undocumented, you lack access to health-care options," Montelongo said. "My dad had diabetes, and he was often in pain. It was very treatable, but there was no one to diagnose it. He was very sick and he lost an eye from diabetes."
The experience, he explained, pushed him toward the medical profession. His research aims to use bioinformatics to predict and treat infections of the bladder.
Dreamers Against the DREAM Act
Whether he'll get a chance to finish his studies, let alone stay in the country he calls home, depends on a sharply divided Congress with a poor record of passing major bills.
Congressional Democrats are preparing to negotiate a deal with Trump to ensure the Dreamers won't face deportation. But some of the biggest opposition comes from the Dreamers themselves.
Many worry that the Democrats, desperate to pass a bill, will make compromises in the DREAM Act or other legislation that will lead to an increased threat of deportation for undocumented parents, friends, and relatives. Trump and many Republicans have demanded more immigration enforcement and a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
Dreamers receive the most sympathy of all groups of undocumented immigrants in the U.S., with wide bipartisan support for them to stay in the country. Their parents, however, are often painted as lawbreakers because they illegally crossed borders or overstayed visas.
DACA recipients are wary of being used as bargaining chips. Montelongo said he can't support legislation that saves him but leaves others behind. He and other activists are pushing for a "clean" DREAM Act, one where, he said, "Dreamers get a path to citizenship but it leaves out negative additions that constitute other people getting arrested, detained, and deported."
Manrique echoed Montelongo's concerns. Her parents, undocumented immigrants from Guatemala who live in Georgia, have increasingly been preparing for the possibility of deportation. And each day, Manrique is more fearful that immigration agents will land on their doorstep and tear her family apart.
"The parents of Dreamers are the original Dreamers," Manrique said. "They get put in this bad position because they're not the 'special' ones, and that is what worries me. They also have rights, and they need that pathway to citizenship. And at this point, no one is fighting for them."
Still, Montelongo said, given the time pressure, they may have to settle for whatever Congress is able to push through by March 5th.
"I feel conflicted being vocal about something like the DREAM Act if there's no more action for comprehensive immigration reform in the future," he said. "We don't want to set our goal as the ideal and not pass anything at all. So even if we compromise right now, we can't let go of what the ideal is."
DACA was never meant to be a long-term solution. Obama created the program by executive action in 2012 after Congress failed to pass an earlier version of the DREAM Act. DACA's genesis also explains why it was so easy for Trump to undo.
"We Are With You"
The large portion of DACA beneficiaries at Loyola Stritch means their future has become a call to action for the entire school. After the white-coat rally, students organized mass phone calls to lawmakers.
"It was a gut-punch," said bioethics professor Mark Kuczewski, who chairs Loyola Stritch's department of medical education, of Trump's announcement. "But these are the kinds of young people who have lived their entire lives not taking no for an answer. And within 24 hours, we had our entire community saying, 'We are with you.'"
The American Medical Association, for its part, has said the end of DACA would not only leave dozens of medical students in limbo, but would exacerbate the physician shortage in the U.S. The country lacks 8,200 primary care physicians, and the figure could grow to more than 61,700 by 2025, the AMA said.
"DACA students are also more likely to be bilingual, to come from diverse cultural backgrounds, and to understand challenges in certain ethnic communities," it wrote in a September 5th letter to Democratic leaders. "Without these physicians, the AMA is concerned that the quality of care provided in these communities will be negatively impacted and that patient access to care will suffer."
As for Manrique, her DACA status expires in August of 2018. By then, she'll have finished her third-year clinical rotations. But without a post-DACA solution, she won't be able to apply for her medical residency, the prerequisite to becoming a doctor.
"It's got to be baby steps," Manrique said. "I'm thinking, 'Let me finish this week, this rotation, this year.' It's one day at a time. And hopefully I can get my M.D. degree."

Tata Communications, which is working as a technical partner of Formula 1, teamed up with broadcaster Sky to deliver the first end-to-end broadcast of a race in UHD.
Sky took several state-of-the-art UHD cameras to the Singapore race and footage from these was mixed with the host images from FOM's Broadcast Centre, before being sent direct to Sky's headquarters in the UK.
The trial comes ahead of Sky's plans to show all F1's races from next season in UHD.
Keith Lane, director of operations at Sky, said: "UHD offers four times higher resolution than HD, making F1 a more powerful, immersive experience for fans than ever before.
"The success of this proof of concept in Singapore shows that we're on track to show every race live in UHD next season using our next-generation Sky Q home entertainment service, and to continue to give our customers the action-packed F1 experiences that they crave."
The switch to UHD, which requires superfast global connectivity, is viewed as a key step towards future Virtual Reality plans for F1.
Mehul Kapadia, managing director of F1 business at Tata Communications said: "Other game-changing technologies like Virtual Reality will rely on ubiquitous, superfast connectivity too.
"As the break-neck speed of technology innovation continues, we'll work with Formula One Management to enable fans to experience the exhilarating world of F1 in new ways."
After the confetti has been shaken out of the hair and the party balloons have deflated, what is left from Tuesday's election night is a disturbing message: There is nothing to celebrate.
The winner is the loser. But the loser is not the winner. Clinton's victory was not big enough to snatch the nomination from Obama. But neither was his star power enough to woo the voters in the center.
It seems the race is jinxed: He was handed a defeat when he needed a victory, and she secured a victory when only an improbable triumph would have helped her.
Barring a miracle, Clinton's role at the Democratic Party convention in Denver in August will be limited to guest speaker. But Obama will go into the actual presidential election badly damaged.
On the night of Obama's first primary win, in the state of Iowa, this columnist wrote: "(Obama) has scant hope of reaching the White House. He's too young, too inexperienced, too vague, and for many Americans, too black. His magic words about the era of change, of hope, of an America he will unite -- all that will evaporate like morning mist."
This prediction was confirmed in Pennsylvania. The euphoria over the 46-year-old senator has until today only gripped 50 percent of Democratic voters -- who make up only a third of registered voters. The Obama flame burns, but only in parts of society. Obama receives more goodwill than actual votes. And his press is better than his real situation.
Obama's chances of a successful run for the White House are anything but rosy. There are three reasons why his presidential run will be difficult:
First, a politician who favors social policies has a tough time in a recession. In his desperation over the persistent rejection by white working class voters, Obama has shot himself in the foot.
He recently promised voters the moon at a trade union convention: State-subsidized health insurance. A $100 billion infrastructure program for the construction of bridges and roads. A $160 billion ecological investment program. Tax exemption for all pensioners with an annual income of under $50,000. Tax cuts for all middle-income groups. An increase in the minimum wage, which is currently set at $7.50 an hour.
But the voter groups which are decisive for any president distrust people who claim to be miracle workers. The union officials clapped, but many of its members lowered their heads pensively.
REUTERS What's to celebrate?
These people want new jobs, but they don't want new government debt. They want leadership, but Obama is only flashing his wallet.
Secondly, he is an opponent of war in a time of war. The United States is fighting a lonely and increasingly difficult war on two fronts, in Iraq and Afghanistan. He would like to finish the war quickly -- but the majority of Americans would like to win it first.
Past experience of former Democratic candidates shows that, in times of war, candidates who strike a pacifist tone have slim chances. While war was raging in Vietnam, Richard Nixon moved into the White House. George W. Bush won a landslide victory while the Iraq campaign was in full swing. Up to now, Hillary Clinton has expressed caution as far as the war is concerned.
Thirdly, he is a party favorite in times of dwindling party loyalty. He excites the active members of the Democratic Party, the officials, the young people and the university graduates, not to mention that part of the party -- a part which should not be underestimated -- which is to be found within newspapers and TV stations. Up to 35,000 people came to his meetings in Pennsylvania.
But the further one moves from the ranks of the true believers in the direction of the undecided -- from the left to the center, from young to old, from student to worker -- the lower the excitement over Obama. In Pennsylvania, 61 percent of older voters chose Clinton, as did 68 percent of Catholics, 65 percent of workers and over 70 percent of voters in rural areas. There, where life is hard, serious and sometimes monotonous, Obama struggles to make himself heard.
The American electoral system gives the center exceptional political power. Since most states are firmly in the hands of one party, attention is focused on the so-called swing states, large states such as Ohio, Texas, California and Pennsylvania which are sometimes Democratic and sometimes Republican. Obama has won many US states -- but not these swing states.
After Tuesday, the situation for the Democratic Party is no easier. The party seems to be cursed in this primary season, as if Obama's supporters and Clinton's fans had sealed a diabolical pact. They refuse him victory but spare her defeat.
But this game is approaching its terrible end. The superdelegates, who are independent from the party base, will have to commit a political murder in the coming months. Will it be Obama or Clinton? For the party, the decision could amount to political suicide.
When Nokia made it known that the Meego-running N9 wouldn't be making any official tour to the US, the sound of crushed dreams could be faintly heard in households across the nation. Would the newly-announced Lumia series suffer the same fate somehow? Might Uncle Sam's invitation to the family BBQ get lost in the mail a second straight time? Thanks to Nokia's US website, we know that at least one of the two Windows Phones will leave Espoo and land somewhere between sea and shining sea, as the budget-conscious Lumia 710 appears front and center on the OEM's home page while the 800 is nowhere to be found. We're not giving up just yet -- if absence makes the heart grow fonder, we don't want to get enamored with the AWOL phone this fast.Dampen down those hopes and dreams, kids. Nokia has said that it will be making a splash in the USA at the start of next year, but it won't be with the Lumia phones. The page went up just for your information.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on Monday released a secret 2010 Justice Department memo justifying the killing of Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen killed in a drone strike in 2011.
ADVERTISEMENT
The court released the document as part of Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by The New York Times and the American Civil Liberties Union to make the document public.
Then-acting Assistant Attorney General David Barron, in the partially redacted 41-page memo, outlines the justification of the drone strike in Yemen to take out al-Awlaki, an alleged operational leader of al Qaeda.
Barron wrote that al-Awlaki had taken up arms against his country, and it was necessary to take him out with a drone because he could have caused his nation harm.
"The U.S. citizen in question has gone overseas and become part of the forces of an enemy with which the United States is engaged in an armed conflict; that person is engaged in continual planning and direction of attacks upon U.S. persons from one of the enemy's overseas bases of operation; the U.S. government does not know precisely when such attack will occur; and a capture operation would be infeasible," wrote Barron, who was recently confirmed to the First Circuit Court of Appeals.
In April, The court ordered the redacted version of the document to be released because the administration had already made public and discussed al-Awlaki's killing. The administration decined to appeal the ruling, and Monday is the first time the memo has been released.
Attorney General Eric Holder last year outlined a three-pronged justification for targeted killings of a U.S. citizen who is a leader of al Qaeda: The suspect must pose an imminent threat, capture must be infeasible, and the strike needs to adhere to applicable war principles.
Sen. Mark Udall (D-Colo.) applauded the release of the full memo but said questions remain unanswered.
"I also have called for — and not received — answers to questions such as how much evidence the government requires in order to make an American a legitimate target, how an 'imminent' threat is defined, and what are the geographical boundaries of these authorities, among others,” the senator said.
Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) similarly said he hoped the release would pressure the administration to address some unanswered questions.
"How much evidence does the president need to determine that a particular American is a legitimate target for military action?" Wyden asked. "Or, can the president strike an American anywhere in the world? What does it mean to say that capturing an American must be ‘infeasible'? And exactly what other limits and boundaries apply to this authority?"
Al-Awlaki was accused of helping to orchestrate the Fort Hood massacre and the “underwear bomber” plot. His death in a drone strike in Yemen had been widely reported before the administration publicly acknowledged it last year.
The memo details justification for a strike by either the Department of Defense or the CIA, which ultimately carried out the strike. The publicly available version of the memo begins on page 12. The CIA section is much more heavily redacted than the Defense Department section.
The Justice Department concluded that al-Awlaki's U.S. citizenship did not impose "constitutional limitations that would preclude the contemplated lethal action under the facts represented to us by DoD, the CIA, and the Intelligence Community."
The Justice Department found that some protections from the Fourth and Fifth Amendments likely still applied, granting him due process.
Citing a previous court ruling, however, the DOJ found that the realities of combat make some force necessary and appropriate and the "due process analysis need not blink at those realities."
The Justice Department also cited the Supreme Court when finding the Fourth Amendment protection against seizures has to be balanced against the importance of the government interest.
"As explained above, on the facts represented to us, a decision-maker could reasonably decide that the threat posed by al-Awlaki's activities to United States persons is 'continued' and 'imminent,” ” according to the memo. The paragraph immediately preceding it is redacted.
Under the section justifying a strike by the Defense Department, Barron concluded the Authorization of Use of Military Force (AUMF) approved by Congress in 2001 could be used to justify the strike.
The Justice Department found there is precedent for capturing and detaining a U.S. person abroad if that person is part of al Qaeda. The memo concluded, "it also authorizes the use of 'necessary and appropriate' lethal force against a U.S. citizen who has joined an armed force.'"
Though the strike took place in Yemen, far from where the primary U.S. conflict with al Qaeda took place, the DOJ concluded it still falls within the AUMF. It noted that the authorization did not set geographical limitations.
"Al-Awlaki, an active, high-level leader of an enemy force who is continually involved in planning and recruiting for terrorist attacks, can on that basis fairly be said to be taking 'an active part in hostilities,' " the memo reads.
The ACLU said the release represents a long overdue step, adding the drone program has been responsible for the death of thousands of people.
“There are few questions more important than the question of when the government has the authority to kill its own citizens," said ACLU deputy legal director Jameel Jaffer, who argued the case. “This memo's release will allow the public to better understand the scope and implications of the authority the government is claiming."
The Justice Department said the memo only applied to the specific case of al-Awlaki.
"In reaching this conclusion, we do not address other cases or circumstances, involving different facts," according to the memo. "We emphasize the sufficiency of the facts that have been represented to us here, without determining whether such facts would be necessary to the conclusion we reach."

By Kim Jae-heun
Not many people think that the 16 year-old fashion model Han Hyun-min is Korean — they think he is a foreigner. People approached Han speaking in English during Seoul Fashion Week last fall, but Han does not speak English. Some fashion designer gave him the nickname "Paul," but Han neither likes that Western name nor wants to be called by any other name than his real name, Hyun-min.
Born to a Nigerian father and a Korean mother, Han is Korea's first Korean-African model. Fortunately, he takes his uniqueness positively while living in Korea, and working in the fashion industry where racism is still strong.
"My strength lies in my different look from others," said Han during an interview with The Korea Times at a cafe in Hapjeong, western Seoul, last Thursday. "I look different from my outer appearance and I have a different skin color, which I find the best. I was a super skinny boy standing 184 centimeters tall and weighing 56 kilograms last year. My friends called me anchovy."
Han grew five centimeters taller and gained a little more weight to follow his dream to become a model. He became one of the top male models to on the catwalks in last season's Seoul Fashion Week, appearing in 11 fashion designer shows.
It was his second season, although his success could have come earlier if he had not signed an exclusive contract with fashion designer Han Sang-hyuk opening the brand Heich Es Heich.
"I could not believe I participated in the show. I've never learned to walk as a model and I only watched them on shows on YouTube," said Han.
However, it was his company's CEO's job to make his career look beautiful outside and deal with less attractive situations inside.
Han Hyun-min would practice walking in 12-centimeter high-heels at gay clubs to prepare for the fashion show's concept of gender neutrality, but he was replaced by another model on the day to participate on a different catwalk.
He was not cast in his most favorite fashion designer's show as the young dressmaker said he did not hire black people.
Still, the discrimination does not disturb Han from growing as a model thanks to his slow and positive personality or perhaps his longtime-learned skill to ignore such irrational reactions.
"People would not talk to me backstage at fashion shows because they thought I didn't speak Korean. But once they learned I did, people start to gather around me and talk to me," said Han.
"I would participate in the rehearsals and coordinators there yell out orders in English only to me. I would wait until the end and tell them I don't speak English so please talk to me in Korean," added Han.
Unlike many Korean models' dream to become a top model in Europe, Han wants to work in the Japanese fashion industry. He was impressed by his experience with Japanese Gentlemen's Quarterly (GQ), last year, when he shot a page for the monthly fashion magazine. Han said the outcome there was unique and stylish while his works in Korea are mostly too typical.
"Also, there are many black models in Europe. My ultimate goal is Japan, where people don't look at me interestingly," said Han.
The Big 12 will not only bring back a championship game in 2017, but it likely will form two five-team divisions. Which means we get to start playing the always-fun parlor game of telling the conference exactly how they should do that.
Once upon a time, splitting a college football conference into two divisions did not require a whole lot of brainpower. The SEC in 1992 and the Big 12 four years later employed logical, easy-to-remember geographic configurations. The Big 12's six Texas and Oklahoma schools were definitively south of those in the North division. And while Auburn is slightly east of Vanderbilt, pairing it with Alabama justified placing the Tigers in the SEC West.
Then conference realignment went batty, and every divisional formation since has been a political and/or geographic headache.
Article continues below ...
The ACC in 2005 decided its top priority would be to place powerhouse rivals Florida State and Miami in opposite divisions in hopes they'd play a second high-wattage game most years. (Miami, 11 years in, has yet to make an appearance.) That alone negated any chance of splitting things geographically, resulting in the seemingly randomized Atlantic and Coastal divisions that remain today, though now with 14 teams.
Putting Texas and Oklahoma in opposite divisions makes sense if the round-robin format continues.
It's worked so well that North Carolina (Coastal) and Wake Forest (Atlantic) will soon stage a non-conference series due to the fact they meet so rarely.
The Pac-12 had all sorts of logistical hurdles to deal with upon adding Utah and Colorado in 2011 — in addition to protecting rivalries like USC-UCLA and Cal-Stanford, for recruiting purposes, the Northern schools wanted to maintain their presence in Southern California. At that point something called the "zipper plan" was discussed.
Ultimately, the league went with a relatively simple North-South split (though North members Cal and Stanford are technically south of Colorado and Utah.)
Big Ten commissioner Jim Delany in 2011 became the first to try to consciously instill competitive balance, splitting traditional powers Ohio State and Penn State from Michigan and Nebraska. The result was disastrous, partly because the groupings were impossible to keep straight but mostly because of the regrettable Legends and Leaders names.
Keeping the Oklahoma schools together in one division would help America make sense of the new alignment.
Three years in, that conference pivoted to a more traditional East and West, and in doing so putting Ohio State, Michigan and Michigan State on the same side.
The Big 12 will not likely have the luxury of a straight geographic split, because it now has six Texas and Oklahoma schools but just three former North Division members (Kansas, Kansas State and Iowa State) plus outlier West Virginia.
It's also in a different position than any conference before it. The 10-team league doesn't have to worry about protecting certain rivalries over others because it's keeping a round-robin schedule. Every school will play everybody else every year, regardless of its division.
That being the case, you could theoretically just draw names out of a hat.
TCU and Baylor could go either way, but keeping them together in a division ensures a marquee late-season clash.
But as the Big Ten learned, it's still important to group schools with some sort of commonality if you're trying to gain public acceptance. And while a conference championship game rematch is unavoidable, in an ideal world the two would not have just played a week or two earlier.
That part can be easily accomplished by making schedules where the five cross-divisional games are played in September and October followed by each team's four intra-division games in November. That in turn will likely produce de facto division championship games late in the season.
With that goal in mind, here's how the Big 12 should divide the teams.
— First of all, league heavyweights and archrivals Texas and Oklahoma should be in opposite divisions. For one thing, the Red River game in Dallas is always played in early October, so if the two do meet again there would be a decent amount of separation. And let's be honest, TV would love for them to meet again.
Like with the Oklahoma schools, keeping the Kansas foes together just makes sense — even if the rivalry isn't bringing much right now.
And while Texas has been in a down cycle this decade, generally these two have been the conference's flag-bearers. Placing them in opposite divisions gives the conference a better chance of divisional balance.
— Conversely, because rivals Oklahoma and Oklahoma State usually meet Thanksgiving weekend, they should be kept together so as not to play again a week later. It will also help fans remember which side is which.
So here's where we are at this point:
THE NEW BIG 12 Division A Division B Oklahoma Texas Oklahoma State TBD TBD TBD TBD TBD TBD TBD
— Since Texas A&M left the Big 12 five years ago, Texas has rotated playing Texas Tech or TCU on Thanksgiving weekend. Let's make Tech its permanent rival going forward, for reasons that will become clear in a moment, and place the Red Raiders with Texas in Division B.
— While the dates of their games have been all over the map, TCU and Baylor have forged nothing short of a blood rivalry since the Horned Frogs joined the conference. Let's try to keep it that way post-Art Briles.
TCU and Baylor also join the other two Texas schools in Division B and also play annually Thanksgiving weekend.
— Though not exactly Auburn-Alabama, Kansas-Kansas State should remain an intra-division rivalry and join Division A. Again, grouping together in-state rivals makes it that much easier for fans in other parts of the country to keep the divisions straight.
Here's where we are now:
THE NEW BIG 12 Division A Division B Oklahoma Texas Oklahoma State Texas Tech Kansas TCU Kansas State Baylor TBD TBD
— That leaves Iowa State and West Virginia, neither with a strong connection to either grouping. But let's keep the Cyclones with fellow North Division legacies Kansas and K-State. West Virginia, by default, gets thrown in with the Texas schools.
All that's left is naming them — and no, they will not be the Texas and Oklahoma divisions. Simple is better, and history tells us geographic names are the easiest to understand, even if one school (in this case West Virginia) doesn't fall into place.
Presenting the 2017 Big 12:
THE NEW BIG 12 NORTH SOUTH Iowa State Baylor Kansas Texas Kansas State Texas Tech Oklahoma TCU Oklahoma State West Virginia

Democratic presidential candidates Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Hillary Clinton take part in a presidential debate sponsored by CNN and Facebook at Wynn Las Vegas on Oct. 13, 2015, in Las Vegas. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)
Hillary Clinton has struggled as a candidate -- to put it kindly -- since she formally entered the presidential race in the spring. She's been guarded, wooden and slow to adapt to changing circumstances. Her allies insisted that she could -- and would -- be a good candidate. Yet, every time Clinton had a chance to shine she, well, didn't.
That changed last Tuesday in Las Vegas when Clinton outclassed the four men on stage with her in the first Democratic presidential debate. She was affable, knowledgeable and presidential. She looked bigger -- and better -- than everyone else around her.
Clinton's strength in that debate helped drive two of her marginal opponents -- Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee -- out of the race. Chafee said as much when he dropped out Friday morning.
Asked why now, @LincolnChafee said simply: @HillaryClinton had a good week. — Mike Memoli (@mikememoli) October 23, 2015
Her performance also launched a narrative that Vice President Biden might well have missed his window of opportunity for getting into the race. Clinton no longer looked like a deeply wounded candidate, ripe for the picking by Biden. Polling in the wake of the debate began to turn; she widened leads over Bernie Sanders and Biden in Iowa and moved into a statistical tie with Sanders in New Hampshire. Suddenly, Clinton had momentum -- something she had failed to find repeatedly in the first six months of her campaign.
Then came Biden's announcement on Wednesday that, indeed, he had missed his window and would not seek the presidency. While Biden's decision had an obvious practical effect -- in polling he tended to pull more from Clinton than Sanders -- there was also symbolic weight to it. Biden had looked at the numbers and the calendar, talked to lots and lots of Democrats and concluded that he, the sitting vice president of the United States, couldn't run a campaign that could beat Clinton.
Without Biden, the race effectively turns into a one-on-one contest between Clinton and Sanders. Webb and Chafee are out; Martin O'Malley may well follow them soon if he can't bump his Iowa numbers up. And, in a one-on-one race, it's almost impossible to see how Sanders beats Clinton unless he peels away significant black and Latino support from her. He's yet to demonstrate any ability to do that.
A day after Biden bowed out, Clinton faced down the House Select Committee on Benghazi, a made-for-TV standoff that many had been awaiting for more than two years. (Clinton was last on Capitol Hill to testify about Benghazi and her role in it as secretary of state in January 2013.)
For Republicans, the hearing amounted to the political equivalent of Al Capone's vault -- lots of expectation, little result. Clinton, clearly chastened by the negative publicity her famous/infamous "what difference does it make?" outburst drew the last time she testified, was calm, cool and collected. She pushed back effectively when it was warranted but never lost her temper. She movingly told the story of the day of the attacks in Benghazi and of how it impacted her -- recounting the "sleepless nights" she had spent in the wake of the deaths of the four Americans killed in September 2012.
"I don't know that she testified any differently than previous times she testified," Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), chairman of the Benghazi committee, acknowledged at the end of the hearing. So, yeah.
What we learned (or relearned) about Clinton over the past 10 days is that in certain formats, she can be outstanding. Those formats tend to be ones governed by a very specific set of rules (debates, congressional hearings) in which preparation pays off and the amount of freelancing required is minimal.
It remains to be seen whether Clinton can get better at things like rallying big crowds to her side with a display of genuine passion. (She'll get a chance to flex that muscle Saturday night when she speaks at the Jefferson-Jackson dinner in Des Moines -- the event that effectively launched then-Sen. Barack Obama's campaign eight years ago.)
But, over the last 10 days, Clinton proved (or re-proved) that she can perform under the brightest of lights and can even get a break or two (like Biden not running). For a candidate who has struggled as much as Clinton has, that's a gigantic win.
NEW YORK -- Some disturbing video of a teacher at a New York City charter school is raising questions about the harsh treatment of some of its youngest students. But the school says the video does not tell the whole story.
In the video, Success Academy teacher Charlotte Dial's frustration is clear.
"So count it again, making sure you're counting correctly," Dial says.
"Go to the calm-down chair and sit!" she tells a first grade student after angrily tearing up the child's work.
"There's nothing that infuriates me more than when you don't do what's on your paper," she says. "Very upset and very disappointed!"
An undercover video shot by a former colleague and published by the New York Times showed Success Academy charter school teacher Charlotte Dial belittling her first grade students and tearing up their schoolwork. CBS News
The video was taken by an assistant teacher in 2014 and published by the New York Times on Friday.
It raises new concerns about the demands on students at the 34 Success Academy schools in New York City. The charters have been among the highest-performing on New York state tests seven years in a row.
"I think this video is 100 percent a reflection of the culture at that school," former Success Academy teacher Ayanna Legros told CBS News. She said some teachers would rip up work if it wasn't good enough.
"The purpose of 'rip and redo,' in my opinion, was to cause the students to feel a level of embarrassment and not necessarily make that same mistake," Legros said.

Charlotte Dial did not comment at a press conference, but CEO Eva Moskowitz said this was an isolated incident.
"I am not going to throw Charlotte Dial under the bus," Moskowitz said at a news conference.
"To smear all teachers and to represent this as the ethos of Success Academies, that is unfair and it is wrong," she told CBS News.
Last month, a group of parents filed a federal complaint against the schools. They said Success Academy repeatedly suspended special needs students in an attempt to push them out.
But despite the complaint and the video, many parents continue to support the teachers.
"I've never witnessed anything like that video before and I do believe that it's a one-time incident," parent Natasha Shannon told CBS News.
Success Academy said Dial was suspended for a week and completed a week of retraining. She is now back in the classroom.
In a world where debt equals the ability to purchase large items, access to debt is king. For this reason banks are the new modern day oligarchy since they have a nearly unlimited line of credit with the Federal Reserve. The public during the credit bubble days had access to nearly unlimited debt via mortgages, home equity loans, auto debt, credit card debt, and student debt. Since the credit bubble burst, access to credit has been severely limited to the public. It is interesting to note that credit card debt, the lubricant of our consumer economy is lower today than it was in 2009. Some $56 billion has been taken away from the credit card market for American consumers. Banks have the ability to loan but choose to speculate in real estate investments since many households simply do not have the incomes to back up large purchases. Part of being addicted to debt is that the withdrawal is painful yet banks have not faced any retrenchment while the public has been forced to adapt to credit austerity.
Credit card rate arbitrage
One of the most obvious ways that banks gouge the public is through high interest rates on credit cards. First, you have banks being able to create money out of thin air. This is part of our fiat based system. Of course, banks are hungry for leverage when it comes to their own speculation but not with the public. That is why credit card debt has contracted. However, as the Fed has artificially lowered interest rates banks continue to charge incredibly high prices on credit cards as reflected by average interest rates. In other words, the Fed's low rate gamble is not filtering down to the average American.
Here is a clear example of corporate welfare versus aiding the public. Credit is supposed to be the oil that fuels the economy, not the main source of speculation for banks. The banking tail is wagging the real economy dog. So let us look at current rates:
Typical cash back cards have an average rate of 16.34 percent while low rate cards have an average rate of 11 percent. Low rate cards of course are reserved for those with pristine credit and given the troubled balance sheet of many Americans, few qualify for these.
Keep in mind the Fed funds rate is essentially zero. Banks have the unique privilege to borrow at an extremely low rate (this is why banking profits are so outrageous). If you wanted to save some money in a certificate of deposit, how much could you get?
The average one year CD has an interest rate of 0.81 percent. So think of the massive margin here. Say you go into the bank and put in $10,000. After one year, the bank will pay you $81. Say the bank lends $10,000 out at 15 percent on their credit card. After one year, the bank will collect $1,500 in interest alone. With this kind of racket is it any wonder why the financial sector has so much power?
It gets even better when you look at traditional savings accounts:
This rate is from one of the largest banks in our country. Basically they are a formalized mattress for your money. Most too big to fail banks are providing an interest rate that is hovering extremely close to zero percent. The margin here is completely in favor of the banking institutions.
Banks rather speculate with Fed money than lend to public
Banks have the unique ability to make money out of thin air. The Fed has pushed interest rates lower in hopes of spurring more borrowing in the economy. However, banks would rather lend and speculate within their tiny network instead of lending this money out to the public. Take a look at current excess reserves:
This is money that can be easily lent to households but it is not. Instead, we have inequality rising as banks lend to a tightly controlled network and lock out the public. And this money is funded by the Fed, an entity that is both public and private yet serves the interest of large banks. It is interesting to note that since 2009 banks have suddenly had a taste for residential real estate and are crowding out regular home buyers. Why? Because these low rates provide a massive buffer to speculate. If you can get a loan carrying a 0 or 1 percent interest rate you have a wide margin to make mistakes. Yet the public is dealing with 15 percent credit card rates and 4 to 5 percent mortgage rates. Then you wonder why banks continue to make record profits.
The only two sectors of consumer debt that have grown dramatically since the recession ended is student and auto loan debt, not exactly good debts to have:
While credit card debt has gone down by $56 billion since 2009, student and auto debt is up a stunning $608 billion over the same period. There is already a massive crisis occurring in the student debt market. Next to housing, an auto purchase is the biggest purchase Americans will make. But unlike housing, cars begin depreciating from day one. So shifting people into auto debt isn't exactly a positive when it comes to building wealth. The fact that inequality is at levels last seen from the Gilded Age should tell you something about the structure of our current economy. Even though interest rates are low on the banking front very little of this is trickling down to the public. It certainly isn't being reflected in the rates being charged on credit cards.

Introduction
Welcome to this website.
In February 2012, students in Quebec launched an unlimited general strike to fight back against a 75% hike in university tuition fees. Contrary to the expectations of many, the strike movement lasted more than six months, morphing into one of the largest periods of social unrest the province had ever seen.
In the global context of the commodification of education, youth and students everywhere are becoming increasingly conscious of the need to organize as a means to defend education as a social right.
The text you'll find on this site was written in the aftermath of the strike by a few students who were involved in various official and unofficial capacities during the strike and the months and years leading up to it.
Having travelled outside of the province to speak to students and activists about the strike, some of us were struck by the need for deeper analysis as well as practical pointers for those wishing to draw inspiration for their own struggles.
This website, which addresses the history of the 2012 Quebec student strike, as well as many related topics, is our humble attempt to contribute to the efforts of those wanting to build democratic and combative social movements, with a strong potential to win.

It's a good thing that Tim Cook alluded to the company's pitched battle with the FBI at the beginning of Monday's keynote, and not just because it's an important issue.
Bringing it up was the equivalent of holding a newspaper in a ransom photograph. It's about the only thing that proved the event was actually taking place in 2016.
Otherwise you might think you were living in a Groundhog Day of Apple keynotes — where we keep seeing the same products launch, over and over.
The "Apple launches 4-inch iPhone" headlines took me right back to September 2012, the first time I saw and wrote them. (Ironically, I could be found at that event imploring Apple to make a truly new and outside-the-box product; the company has since introduced a smartwatch).
Meanwhile, the company announced a new 9.7-inch iPad, which took me all the way back to January 2010 and the launch of the first 9.7-inch iPad.
Before my fellow Apple fanboys start frothing at the mouth: I know, I know. That was the iPad, this is the iPad Pro. New features, new specs, all very cool stuff for us nerds. I'm seriously considering a 256GB iPad Pro in rose gold, and the last thing I need is more Apple devices.
What I'm concerned with is how the company is perceived by the general audience. It's getting harder to ignore the fact that Apple is simply repackaging the same iOS machines in differently sized boxes, no matter how cool the anodized aluminum on that box is.
My colleague Heidi Moore joked that Apple was gaslighting — the act of convincing people that previous events did not happen. This actually isn't too far from the truth. Tim Cook and Co. never once mentioned the 4-inch iPhone 5 on stage today, for example.
To watch an Apple event is to live in a state of tech gaslighting. "Wait, doesn't this exist already? No? Are you sure?" — Heidi N Moore (@moorehn) March 21, 2016
End of the line
With the launch of the iPhone SE, Apple now basically has an iOS product in every size you can hold with one hand, all on sale together for the first time.
Maybe some day the company will give us the iPhone SSE, a 3.5-inch device for those with extra small pockets and hands. (Insert your favorite Donald Trump joke here.) Or we might see the iPad Super Pro, a 20-inch tablet for when you basically want to carry around a small TV.
Maybe some day the company will give us the iPhone SSE, a device for those with extra small pockets and hands.
There are other options, I suppose. You could custom-make an iPhone to fit the exact dimensions of your pocket. Maybe the iPhone Square, for taking the perfect Instagram shot.
But somehow I doubt it. This is it for iOS devices — the end of the product line. Indeed, if you include the Apple Watch (technically a different OS, I know), Apple makes pretty much the same touchscreen device in size increments from 1.5 inches all the way up to 12.9 inches.
It's a lucrative business to be in, the iPad's slow sales growth notwithstanding. The iOS ecosystem remains the world's best mobile OS (Sorry, Android). Just because the category isn't going to grow any more doesn't mean it is going away.
But the strain of Apple trying to make iOS be all things to all people is starting to show. You could see it in Monday's keynote, where Phil Schiller tried to persuade users of Windows PCs to come on over to the iPad Pro.
It's a large Rose Gold iPhone 6S! No, wait, it's a small Rose Gold iPad Pro! Image: Apple
But as great as many iOS apps are, it's never going to replace the laptop. There are just too many finicky little things you can't do on it, usually for workplace security reasons. For example, I can't write this story without access to certain browser extensions that just don't exist on iOS.
To recap: Apple is a company that makes touchscreens and Macs. Their sizes are now pretty much set in stone. There will be incremental software and hardware updates from now until forever. The end.
For all we love to huddle around our screens for Apple launch events, this may be the day they stopped being about anything that was truly, categorically new. Well, until the much-vaunted Apple Car drives into our lives — an unveiling of something truly new that can't come soon enough.

Former leader will say growth in membership and local election vote share shows success, as Vince Cable repeats prediction it is possible he could be PM
Former Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron will tell his party conference that his tactics “saved the Liberal Democrats,” saying the party's increasing membership was a sign it was on the road to recovery.
Farron's defence of his record came after a fraught session on the conference floor on Sunday, where party members attempted to overturn policy on a second Brexit referendum, in favour of a policy which would see Article 50 reversed without a public vote.
After a vote, party members voted in favour of retaining Farron's policy of giving UK voters a referendum on the final Brexit deal, rather than changing policy to oppose leaving the EU under any circumstance.
Farron quit as Lib Dem leader after the June election, where the party won an additional four seats but failed to make a significant national impact.
Farron, who was succeeded by Vince Cable, will defend his record in a speech on Monday at the conference in Bournemouth, citing his strategy to build the party from the ground upwards.
“The day I took over as leader, one journalist predicted confidently that ‘the party that began with Gladstone will now end with Farron',” he will say.
Universal credit a train wreck that must be stopped, Lib Dems say Read more
“I saw those assumptions that we were dead and buried and I resolved that we were going to survive, grow and win again. The Liberal movement of Gladstone, Lloyd George, Shirley Williams, Jo Grimond and Charles Kennedy – the movement I joined as a 16-year-old, was not going to die on my watch.”
Farron will say his leadership had seen the first local election gains in eight years as well as a record number of new members. “We saved the Liberal Democrats and I am proud of every single one of you.”
Cable repeated his prediction on Sunday that he believed it was possible he could become prime minister. “I think it's perfectly plausible, actually,” he told the BBC's Andrew Marr show. “As leader of the third UK party, my job is to be the alternative prime minister. I think British politics is in a remarkable state of flux.”
Asked if the Lib Dems could get a Commons majority, Cable said: “It's possible that we could break through. If British party politics starts to break up, if the traditional structures start to break up, and that could well happen, we are extremely well positioned with moderate, sensible policies. I am very confident talking about being an alternative prime minister.”
On Sunday, MP Jo Swinson gave her first conference speech as deputy leader, one of several MPs including Cable who won their seats back in June. Swinson said she was concerned over the direction western politics was heading in, calling it “the politics of the bully.”
Swinson said US president Donald Trump should not be offered a state visit, and said he was a product of “anti-liberal forces”. She said: “Trump is a bully, a misogynist and a racist.
“When calm heads and brave leaders are needed more than ever, global politics seems broken. A few years ago it would have seemed inconceivable that in such a crisis, China would be a voice of reason, and Russia more measured than America. The politics of the bully is back.”
Swinson said the party could not afford to wait for the mood to change. “As far as I can see, there is nothing inevitable about the triumph of liberal values. We need to understand what is going on, so we can work out what to do.”
She said the party “needs to be much more radical, both in what we propose and in how we craft it”.
Senior figures in the party have admitted the conference, Cable's first as leader, will be relatively light on new policy, coming so soon after a general election.
However, both Cable and Swinson are said to be keen to ensure the focus is not entirely on Brexit, with both keen to discuss new economic policies and social justice. “An exit from Brexit is necessary, but not sufficient,” Swinson told the conference.
Former Lib Dem cabinet minister Ed Davey said he backed a new policy which would see company executives prosecuted if they rip off consumers by breaking competition laws.
Speaking to reporters in Bournemouth, the former energy secretary, who won his south London seat of Kingston and Surbiton back in June, said he attempted to force through the policy in coalition but had been blocked by former prime minister David Cameron.
“I suggested when we are hunting down cartels, when businesses are cheating the public, we should not go through the system we have where the competition authorities investigate and charge,” he said.
“That's an administrative process – we should actually put people in court and have a prosecutor model as they do in the United States. I think if big businesses are cheating consumers, we should put them in the dock and properly question them in a much tougher, robust way.”
Davey said he backed action against both firms and individuals, but declined to name the sectors he had in mind when asked whether he was thinking specifically about energy companies.
“Ripping customers off of tens of millions is outrageous. If they are in breach of competition law they should feel the uncomfortable position of being put in the dock,” he said.
The party's former leadership contender Norman Lamb announced he intends to stand down as Lib Dem health spokesman to concentrate on his new role as chairman of the Commons science and technology committee.
Lamb, whose constituency in North Norfolk had a majority vote to leave the EU, is known to be uncomfortable with the party's stance on Brexit. Lamb told the Press Association last week the party needed to “start thinking again” about how it approached the issue.
“A lot of people felt that we were treating them as if they were idiots for having voted for Brexit,” he said. “And yet, as liberals, we ought to understand people's anxieties about remote power.”
The trend over the last few years was that EPs and mixtapes were overtaking albums as the true source of experimentation and ambition, demonstrating unfiltered artistic expression that was less beholden to label interests. But in 2016, full-lengths from major artists took the sort of risks you'd usually find buried on B-sides and demos. So in terms of creative independence and challenging the listener, this felt like the first year of the streaming age in which blockbuster albums caught up to EPs and mixtapes.

That means the context has changed for our year-end EP/mixtape list, but the results are no less impressive. In the top five, you'll find two collections of stellar album session scraps, and two releases that blur the line between mixtape and full-fledged LP. And once again, there's a handful of emerging names who put together captivating introductory statements.
Below, check out the 10 best EPs and mixtapes of 2016.
10. Nina — Beyond Memory
We premiered “Beyond Memory,” the moody title track to this synthed-out little release, back in April, and damn if the song isn't still running through the corridors of my mind eight months later. Produced by electronic maestro Richard X, Nina's EP is a short but sweet retro-analog ride. Literally, this thing is two songs plus a remix of each. Sometimes that's all it takes. — ROBBIE DAW
9. Bridgit Mendler — Nemesis
Long gone are the Good Luck Charlie days of Disney Channel for Bridgit Mendler. On Nemesis, the singer's second EP, she emerges as our latest formidable indie darling, experimenting with R&B-tinged beats (“Do You Miss Me At All”), wistful folk (“Library”) and dream-pop that rivals the likes of Imogen Heap (“Atlantis”). And this is only the beginning. — RACHEL SONIS
8. Betsy — Fair
This 24-year-old Welsh songbird had a promising career in fashion in the palm of her hands, but she chucked the glamour of London and Paris to the side to go live in a caravan propped up in her brother's backyard and record some demos on her laptop. We're all the better for that decision. Fragile ballad “Fair” was one of the first breaths of fresh musical air we heard this year, and further outside-the-box cuts like “Time” and “Rosie” ensured that Betsy has our full attention going forward. — ROBBIE DAW
7. Annabel Jones — Libelle
Lovers of offbeat, vaguely depressing British pop music will find a lot to love about Annabel Jones' debut EP. Libelle ticks all of the boxes – sassy, pseudo-top 40 bops (“IOU”), brittle synth-pop (“Happy”) and ethereal electro-experiments like “Not Today” and “Magnetic.” The latter is where the EP really comes into its own, heralding a clever, defiantly odd new voice. — MIKE WASS
6. Dagny — Ultraviolet
Of all the Scandipop queens currently wreaking havoc on the music world, Dagny has one of the lower profiles. Which is deeply confounding because the Norwegian's debut EP is one of the most eclectic, fully realized collections of pure pop songs released in 2016. Pay particular attention to the euphoric “Fools Gold,” bouncy Partridge Family-channeling “Fight Sleep” and the glorious early Pretenders swag of the title track. — MIKE WASS
5. Grace VanderWaal — Perfectly Imperfect
Singer-songwriter Grace VanderWaal plays ukulele and, vocally, sounds like some post-grunge '90s alt diva falling out of time. Despite that, there's an unmistakable modernity to the five emotional tracks here on her debut EP. By the way, Grace is 12 years old. And she won America's Got Talent this year, plus she's signed to Simon Cowell‘s SYCO label. What a world. — ROBBIE DAW
4. Tinashe — Nightride
It's confusing as to what Nightride actually is. It's billed as a mixtape by some but an album by others, with little clarity from the artist herself, who tends to describe it as a two-part “project” comprising this and her long-overdue sophomore LP Joyride.
Fuzzy classifications aside, even if Joyride never happens, Nightride finds Tinashe holding her own more than ever before. Velvety slow jams like “C'est La Vie” and “You Don't Know Me” hit equally hard here as hazy bangers like “Party Favors” and the feisty “Company.” Maybe this won't get her the Top 40 fame she and her team have been so obviously aiming for, but it does place her in the ring with alt-R&B pioneers like Dawn Richard and Kelela. Which is honestly just so much more interesting. — RACHEL SONIS
3. Kendrick Lamar — Untitled Unmastered
For anyone who mistakenly claimed there wasn't enough “rap” on To Pimp A Butterfly, they'll get their fill of Kendrick bars here. The studio versions of the untitled songs he performed on TV throughout the TPAB cycle alone would've made this an essential listen, but this thing is littered with boom-bap spitfire, trap stomps and stream-of-consciousness studio riff sessions, with a jazzy swing underlying much of it that conceptually ties the release to its predecessor LP. That his rejects are this full-bodied and listenable is more proof that when he's not catering to the lowest common denominator on trash pop features, Kendrick's high up on his own plane. — CARL WILLIOTT
2. Chance The Rapper — Coloring Book
Coloring Book is a mini-miracle for many reasons, the first being simply that the 23-year-old rapper managed to skyrocket to music superstardom without a proper record deal. The second (and perhaps more important) reason is just how much this work gushes with joy. Chance finds unwavering happiness in love, new fatherhood and faith, while also putting the trials and tribulations of the black experience at the center. On “Blessings (Reprise),” he acutely points out that “the people's champ must be everything the people can't be.” I don't know if this is a self-fulfilling prophecy or what, but it seems to me like we've found our guy. — RACHEL SONIS
1. Carly Rae Jepsen — Emotion: Side B
Liking Carly Rae Jepsen post-“Call Me Maybe” is a little like being a teen and wondering why your favorite band isn't more popular. You wish they'd get the arena-filling crowds they deserve, but then you get a little older and think, “Ya know what, I'm glad it's my little secret. I don't want them to be pressured to pander to the taste-blind masses.” Granted, Jepsen is famous, but she still feels like a pop secret. And so a year after releasing what was arguably 2015's best pop album, she puts out throwaways from that project and the results are nearly as exhilarating — and even more ignored by the masses. Songs like “First Time,” “Cry” and “Body Language” are among the best she's ever done, and brainless mall pop doesn't get much more proudly brainless than “Store.” These leftovers made for one of 2016's sweetest surprises, but it's no longer surprising when CRJ delivers like this. — CARL WILLIOTT
Dwight Howard will take a good look at his free agency options other than the Los Angeles Lakers this offseason. The Houston Rockets and Dallas Mavericks are two of the teams that could end up wooing the free agent center, CBS Sports' Ken Berger reports.
While the Lakers were hoping for a relatively quick decision from Howard to re-sign with them, sources told Berger that they believe the big man will give his free agency a lot of thought. Although Los Angeles could offer Howard a five-year deal and higher increased pay from year to year compared to a team that signs him away as an unrestricted free agent, there are other, non-monetary advantages if Howard were to leave Lakerland.

For one, Howard will be looking at another max contract if he remains healthy, making the ability for a longer-term signing with the Lakers a moot point. In addition, the teams in Houston and Dallas could be a better fit for Howard and his skill set.
Los Angeles will be locked into a tight budget next season even if they use their amnesty clause on a large contract. The age of the Lakers lineup and the turmoil this past season are obviously possible problems for Howard as well. He would have to be confident that the Lakers would be able to bring in enough key players next offseason to turn them into a true title contender.
In Houston, he'd be able to join young All-Star James Harden along with rising role player Chandler Parsons and big man Omer Asik. The Rockets have plenty of flexibility to add more pieces to the puzzle, and though they'd need to make some small moves to make room for a max contract, it's certainly doable.
Dallas is another intriguing possibility. Aging All-Star Dirk Nowitzki said after this season he would be willing to take a pay cut for the Mavericks if they needed to sign another star player. Nowitzki also named Howard along with Clippers point guard Chris Paul as players he'd like to be teammates with.
Berger also notes that Howard could save $10 million in state income tax by playing in Texas.
Whatever the case may be, Howard appears to be set on exploring his options, which is not to the Lakers' benefit.

Canada to dramatically escalate its role in Mideast war
By Keith Jones
4 October 2014
Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper has announced a major escalation of Canada's role in the new US-led war in the Middle East.
Speaking in Parliament Friday, Harper said that six CF-18 fighter planes will be deployed to mount bombing raids in Iraq and possibly Syria as part of a six-month Canadian Armed Forces' “counter-terrorism” mission.
According to Harper, the aim of this mission is to significantly “degrade the capabilities” of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), which also goes under the name the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.
Harper is being disingenuous at best. He, his Conservative government, and the Canadian military know full well that the shoring up of the pro-US regime in Baghdad and its allies in the Kurdish Regional Government against ISIS is only an initial, partial aim of the “coalition of the willing” assembled by the US and for which they signed up Canada virtually from the get-go.
The true target of the war coalition—which now includes Britain and France, respectively Iraq and Syria's former colonial overlords, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and other Sunni Gulf State absolutist Sheikdoms—is the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad.
The US is determined to oust Assad, who is a close ally of Iran and Russia, as part of its longstanding military-strategic drive to secure untrammeled domination of the Middle East, the world's principal oil exporting region.
For the past three-and-a-half years all the member-states of the coalition, and especially the US, France, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, have been sponsoring a “regime change” war in Syria, financing and arming Islamacist forces—including ISIS—as their proxy army against Assad.
While Canada's government and those of other western powers are highlighting the coalition's anti-ISIS mandate, making convenient use of its sectarian atrocities to overcome popular opposition to another western military intervention in the Middle East; in Turkey, Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the region the coalition's member governments are making no secret of the fact that the war's real objective is Assad's overthrow.
Already the US is carrying out bombing missions in Syria. At present these are targeting ISIS and allied groups. But Washington has repeatedly said that were the Syrian government to try to assert its national sovereignty under international law and interdict the US warplanes, it would treat this as an act of war—i.e. an excuse for an all-out attack on Syria.
In his Friday speech, Harper announced that Canada will also be contributing to the war coalition an air-to-air refueling aircraft and two Aurora surveillance planes. While the government did not provide figures, it is estimated that 350 CAF personnel will have to be deployed to the Middle East to fly and maintain the planes.
The government has also said that the deployment of CAF special forces to northern Iraq will be extended for a further six months. Earlier this week, Defence Minister Rob Nicholson said 26 Special Forces' troops were in northern Iraq to advise and train Kurdish Peshmerga militia. This deployment, which was slated for 30 days when it was first announced at the end of August, could ultimately involve as many as 69 CAF elite troops.
The government has insisted that this “advise and training” role in no way contradicts its pledge that the CAF mission will not involve any “troops on the ground” or in combat.
In announcing Canada's greatly expanded role in the new Mideast war, Harper resorted to standard Manichean “war on terror” rhetoric. He trumpeted ISIS's crimes against civilians and portrayed Canada's intervention as motivated entirely by humanitarian concerns and reputed ISIS threats to attack Canadians.
Needless to say, Harper avoided any mention of how ISIS is itself a direct product of the monstrous crimes carried out by US imperialism—crimes that have been aided and abetted by Canada. These include: the illegal 2003 invasion of Iraq, which blew up Iraqi society; the US's subsequent manipulation and fanning of communal sectarian divisions in Iraq as part of a “divide and rule” strategy; and the use of Islamacist forces as the spearhead of the “successful” NATO 2011 “regime change” war in Libya and the proxy war the US and its allies have fomented in Syria.
Even Postmedia, one of Canada's major newspaper chains, noted in an article published this week that were Canada to deploy CF-18s to Iraq they would very likely end up bombing Islamacist fighters for whom CAF pilots had provided air cover during the NATO campaign to topple the Libyan regime of Muammar Gaddafi. With CIA encouragement, thousands of Islamacist fighters flocked from Libya to Syria after Gaddafi's overthrow, many if not most of them ultimately joining ISIS.
In his parliamentary address Harper made clear that his government views Canada's participation in the Iraq-Syria war as vital to ensure the Canadian ruling elite has a say and a share in the spoils of the imperialist reordering and redivision of the Middle East. “Being a free rider,” declared Harper, “means you are not taken seriously.”
Just two months ago, in a speech on the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War, Harper celebrated that orgy of destruction as marking Canada's emergence as a “great power.” “When the great nations of the world gathered,” said Harper, “we must never forget that our place at the table … was bought and paid for on the gas-choked field of Ypres … at Vimy Ridge, … in the long muddy slaughter along the River Somme; in the drenched and cratered wasteland of Passchendaele.” (See: “Canada's Harper marks World War I with bellicose address”)
Harper's dismissal of “free-riders” was in part directed at the opposition parties. The NDP, Liberals and Greens have all made clear that they share Harper's and Washington's principal war aims, including the overthrow of the Assad regime. However, well aware that there is no enthusiasm within the Canadian population for the CAF playing a leading role in another imperialist war, they have thus far withheld their support for Canada participating in the Iraq bombing campaign.
Repeatedly during the past weeks the Liberals said they would be open to supporting the deployment of Canadian fighter jets. But after Harper's Friday speech, Liberal leader Justin Trudeau said his party believes Canada “can make a more helpful contribution to the international effort” against ISIS by helping to build up Iraqi institutions, including its repressive state apparatus, and providing “humanitarian assistance.”
NDP leader Thomas Mulcair said the Official Opposition could not give its support to the government's planned deployment because “the prime minster hasn't outlined a broad strategic blueprint for the mission.” Mulcair expressed concern that the intervention could end in a quagmire, while the party's foreign affairs critic Paul Dewar said the NDP feared that Canadian bombing missions against ISIS in Syria could bolster Assad's regime.
Both Mulcair and Trudeau made reference to the 2003 US invasion of Iraq. They did so, however, from the standpoint that it had ill-served western interests—not that it was part of an ongoing, Canadian-supported US imperialist drive to strengthen Washington's military-strategic dominance of the Middle East. And that the new Mideast war is the continuation and escalation of that drive.
The opposition parties have supported Canada's whole-hearted participation in one US-led war of aggression after another, from the 1999 NATO war on Yugoslavia, through the Afghan War and the 2011 regime change war in Libya. They have also stood shoulder to shoulder with the Harper government in its provocative promotion of the US-German drive to detach Ukraine from Russia's sphere of influence.
The Liberal-NDP opposition to “Harper's Mideast war” is a cynical maneuver motivated by the approach of the 2015 federal election and concern that Canada's prolonged involvement in a bloody imperialist war in the Middle East could give rise to social opposition outside establishment channels.
A parliamentary vote on the new six-month CAF war deployment will be held next week, but as the Conservatives have a majority its outcome is a foregone conclusion.

Late on Friday afternoon, WikiLeaks dumped some 5,000 of top Hillary manager John Podesta's emails. They contained a few whoppers – none bigger than this revelation from April 23, 2014, in which Hillary openly admitted that she was fully aware emails of State Department employees, including personal emails, were being hacked by foreign sources. Presumably asked about Edward Snowden's leaked emails, Hillary answered thusly:
But, at the State Department we were attacked every hour, more than once an hour by incoming efforts to penetrate everything we had. And that was true across the U.S. government. And we knew it was going on when I would go to China, or I would go to Russia, we would leave all of our electronic equipment on the plane, with the batteries out, because this is a new frontier. And they're trying to find out not just about what we do in our government. They're trying to find out about what a lot of companies do and they were going after the personal emails of people who worked in the State Department. So it's not like the only government in the world that is doing anything is the United States. But, the United States compared to a number of our competitors is the only government in the world with any kind of safeguards, any kind of checks and balances. They may in many respects need to be strengthened and people need to be reassured, and they need to have their protections embodied in law. But, I think turning over a lot of that material intentionally or unintentionally, because of the way it can be drained, gave all kinds of information not only to big countries, but to networks and terrorist groups, and the like.
This is incredible. Hillary openly acknowledged that the State Department was constantly under cyberattack. But just as importantly, people's personal emails were being hacked. And Hillary added that Snowden turning over material “intentionally or unintentionally, because of the way it can be drained,” helped our enemies, including terrorist groups.
It wasn't until March 2015 that the Benghazi panel discovered Clinton's private email server. But Hillary had been using one since becoming Secretary of State – knowing full well that such emails were being hacked. And as FBI Director James Comey later pointed out, her email server was less secure than Gmail; Comey acknowledged that we may never know whether Clinton was hacked.
Podesta himself lied about this in July when he told Charlie Rose, “I think when you look against security in other places, it seems – it's actually – you know, one could argue that this was even a more secure system than others.”
Hillary, by her own statements, endangered national security by unintentionally – at best – exposing our classified secrets to the enemy. And she did so knowing the whole time that private emails were under attack.

A 14-year-old girl was found unharmed after she slept through a carjacking early Friday morning in the backseat of her mother's vehicle when it was stolen in northwest Houston.
The incident happened about 1:30 a.m. in the 6300 block of Milwee near Bolin, according to the Houston Police Department.
Police said a woman was carjacked outside her home while her daughter snoozed in the back seat. The thieves sped away in the car.
Police later found the vehicle abandoned with the teen still asleep and unhurt.
No description of the suspects was available.
A simple reform would drain some scalding steam from immigration arguments that may soon again be at a roiling boil. It would bring the interpretation of the 14th Amendment into conformity with what the authors of its text intended, and with common sense, thereby removing an incentive for illegal immigration.
To end the practice of "birthright citizenship," all that is required is to correct the misinterpretation of that amendment's first sentence: "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside." From these words has flowed the practice of conferring citizenship on children born here to illegal immigrants.
A parent from a poor country, writes professor Lino Graglia of the University of Texas law school, "can hardly do more for a child than make him or her an American citizen, entitled to all the advantages of the American welfare state." Therefore, "It is difficult to imagine a more irrational and self-defeating legal system than one which makes unauthorized entry into this country a criminal offense and simultaneously provides perhaps the greatest possible inducement to illegal entry."
Writing in the Texas Review of Law and Politics, Graglia says this irrationality is rooted in a misunderstanding of the phrase "subject to the jurisdiction thereof." What was this intended or understood meaning by those who wrote it in 1866 and ratified it in 1868? The authors and ratifiers could not have intended birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants because in 1868 there were and never had been any illegal immigrants because no law ever had restricted immigration.
If those who wrote and ratified the 14th Amendment had imagined laws restricting immigration -- and had anticipated huge waves of illegal immigration -- is it reasonable to presume they would have wanted to provide the reward of citizenship to the children of the violators of those laws? Surely not.
The Civil Rights Act of 1866 begins with language from which the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause is derived: "All persons born in the United States, and not subject to any foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed, are hereby declared to be citizens of the United States." (Emphasis added.) The explicit exclusion of Indians from birthright citizenship was not repeated in the 14th Amendment because it was considered unnecessary. Although Indians were at least partially subject to U.S. jurisdiction, they owed allegiance to their tribes, not the United States. This reasoning -- divided allegiance -- applies equally to exclude the children of resident aliens, legal as well as illegal, from birthright citizenship. Indeed, today's regulations issued by the departments of Homeland Security and Justice stipulate:
"A person born in the United States to a foreign diplomatic officer accredited to the United States, as a matter of international law, is not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. That person is not a United States citizen under the 14th Amendment."
Sen. Lyman Trumbull of Illinois was, Graglia writes, one of two "principal authors of the citizenship clauses in 1866 act and the 14th Amendment." He said that "subject to the jurisdiction of the United States" meant subject to its "complete" jurisdiction, meaning "not owing allegiance to anybody else." Hence children whose Indian parents had tribal allegiances were excluded from birthright citizenship.
Appropriately, in 1884 the Supreme Court held that children born to Indian parents were not born "subject to" U.S. jurisdiction because, among other reasons, the person so born could not change his status by his "own will without the action or assent of the United States." And "no one can become a citizen of a nation without its consent." Graglia says this decision "seemed to establish" that U.S. citizenship is "a consensual relation, requiring the consent of the United States." So: "This would clearly settle the question of birthright citizenship for children of illegal aliens. There cannot be a more total or forceful denial of consent to a person's citizenship than to make the source of that person's presence in the nation illegal."
Congress has heard testimony estimating that more than two-thirds of all births in Los Angeles public hospitals, and more than half of all births in that city, and nearly 10 percent of all births in the nation in recent years, have been to mothers who are here illegally. Graglia seems to establish that there is no constitutional impediment to Congress ending the granting of birthright citizenship to those whose presence here is "not only without the government's consent but in violation of its law."

CINCINNATI -- Adam Jones says he believes that had it not been for his controversial past, his career would long ago have hit financial heights he instead has since struggled to reach.
"If I would have never gotten suspended, I would have $100 million right now," the Cincinnati Bengals cornerback said Wednesday.
The comment came while Jones spoke about serving multiple on-field roles on the team. Reporters presented hypotheticals about whether Jones considered what his career might resemble if he were only a punt returner or only a kick returner, instead of playing both special teams positions in addition to cornerback.
"Ifa, coulda, woulda," Jones said, just before making his $100 million comment.
Jones later told ESPN he thinks about his past "every now and then."
"You got to think about your past to get to your future," he said. "But I don't let it block nothing mentally or physically that I'm trying to do."
Suspended twice near the start of his career for separate off-field incidents, Adam Jones appeared in just 24 games between 2006 and 2009 while playing for the Titans and Cowboys. Patrick Semansky/Associated Press
Few active professional athletes have the "ifa, coulda, woulda" story Jones does. Suspended twice near the start of his career for separate off-field incidents, Jones appeared in 24 games between 2006 and 2009 while playing for the Titans and Cowboys. The suspensions were the result of his involvement in an altercation with a bodyguard and for allegedly instigating a brawl in a Las Vegas nightclub that resulted in two men being shot, one of whom was left paralyzed. Jones wasn't the gunman, but a court ordered him in January to pay $12.4 million in damages related to the 2007 incident.
During the start of his comeback in 2010, Jones' early shot at on-field redemption was cut short by a neck injury. After appearing in five games that year, he didn't play again until Week 8 the following season.
Each year since, he has performed better and better statistically. His 63 tackles last season tied for a career high he first set in 2006, his second season. He also had three interceptions in 2014 to go along with a fumble recovery and an All-Pro kick returner selection. He had the highest kick-return average of players with more than 20 returns.
"He had a lot of ability and a lot of room to grow," Bengals coach Marvin Lewis said. "To his credit, he's taken advantage of it."
Although ordered to court two years ago for an incident in Cincinnati that a judge ultimately cleared him of, Jones in recent years has largely avoided the negative spotlight that defined the start of his career. It's well-timed, too, as he hopes for a possible contract extension. His previous deal -- the third he's signed with Cincinnati -- was a three-year, $5.35 million contract that came in 2013.
If not re-signed by March, he'll be eligible for free agency.
Jones wonders what could have been had it not been for his two years away from football.
"I was in the prime of my career," Jones said. "But it'll be all right. You live and you learn."
This report makes the case for increased Western support, and argues the EU has been too timid in applying its unprecedented political mandate to drive forward post-2014 reforms in the country.
The report, which includes policy recommendations, assesses Ukraine's position and prospects, and examines its double existential threat: resisting Russian interference, and the fierce internal contest to determine its own political, institutional and civic future.
It states it is an illusion to believe diplomatic formulas alone will diminish Russia's determination to dominate Ukraine, suggesting the West must work inside and outside international negotiation frameworks, the Normandy Format and Minsk process, to resolve the war between Ukraine and Russia and strengthen European security.‪
The West should provide increased defence assistance and training; funding for the modernization of the Kyiv-controlled parts of Donbas and NATO advisory programmes in the security and law enforcement sectors, it says.‪
The report covers six critical areas: geopolitics and security in the context of the conflict with Russia; European integration and the demands of the Association Agreement; economic reform; governance, democratization and the media; the role of civil society in reforms; and efforts to combat corruption.
Summary of findings and policy recommendations:
Security
‪Arguably the greatest danger to Ukraine comes from within. Ukraine's establishment, its informal networks, its Soviet legacy and, most of all, vested interests in the form of businessmen with excessive influence on the levers of power pose the greatest threat to stability and success.
It is an illusion to believe diplomatic formulas alone will diminish Russia's determination to dominate Ukraine and rid it of meaningful Western influence. Russia's calculations will change only when its most influential figures perceive that a continuation of the present course is no longer feasible.
There is no contradiction between dialogue and defence. The West must work inside and outside the Normandy Format and Minsk process to resolve the war between Ukraine and Russia and strengthen European security. ‪
‪The West's sanctions against Russia should be periodically reviewed, strengthened where necessary, and kept in place however long the illegal annexation of the Crimean peninsula lasts and destabilization of the east of the country continues.
‪NATO and the EU should, respectively, launch security sector and law enforcement advisory programmes in Ukraine commensurate with NATO's existing efforts in the defence sphere.
If Western countries remain committed to supporting Ukraine, both bilaterally and multilaterally through the G7 and the EU, Russian strategy towards the country can be checked to a significant extent. A Western policy of benign neglect or, worse, accommodation with Moscow at Ukraine's expense would seriously destabilize the country.
The establishment of an effective, trusted and accountable state is a primary national interest.
Unless law enforcement, security and defence institutions are fit for purpose, Ukraine will remain dangerously vulnerable to infowar, penetration, sabotage and destabilization.
EU integration
The EU has an unprecedented political mandate for driving reforms forward. However, it has been too timid to use this mandate, and risks losing the trust of reformers.
The Euromaidan revolution and the conclusion of the EU's landmark Association Agreement, signed in 2014, and ratified in 2017, offer the promise of a sea-change in Ukraine's relations with Europe.
‪The EU must maintain strong conditionality in the long term to stimulate real, rather than partial or cosmetic, reforms.Its support should move away from classic, pre-scripted technical assistance projects – the effectiveness of which are very low – to tailored, more flexible and longer-term programmes of at least four to five years in duration.‪
Economic and political reform
Judicial reform remains the Achilles heel of the anti-corruption effort as a whole. Progress on the rule of law and an independent judiciary are the ultimate test of Ukraine's reforms.
There must be continued pressure for progress towards zero tolerance of corruption at all levels. The establishment of a special trial court or chamber free from political interference is essential for further progress in the battle against corruption and the development of a new legal culture. The appeal system must be similarly independent.
‪Civil society and the international community should place as much stress on electoral and institutional reform as on anti-corruption measures, to encourage a break with the old system and allow a new generation of genuine reformers to shape laws and policies.
Land reform is badly needed to ensure that Ukraine's large but low-productivity agricultural sector is a powerhouse for longer-term economic growth. There are indications that the Ukrainian government will partially lift a moratorium on land sales by the end of 2017. Reform should also include the sale of over 10 million state-owned hectares of agricultural land, which could potentially raise big sums for the state budget.
‪Further reform of Ukraine's more than 3,000 state-owned enterprises is essential.
Of all the areas in which Ukraine needs reform, economic policy is one of the most critical. With the country's macroeconomic and financial resilience apparently improved, the next challenge is to improve the business environment, unlock the potential of the land market and support investment to deliver much-needed economic growth.

Planned Parenthood, which provides an array of health services, including abortions, through clinics and affiliates, has been embroiled in a fierce fight with Congressional Republicans who want to cut off federal funding to the organization. Some lawmakers threatened to shut down the federal government to do so.
Some legislators have also accused Planned Parenthood of illegally selling fetuses for profit, an allegation that arose in July when abortion opponents released clandestine videos that the organization said were manipulated.
Mr. Handler and Ms. Brown posted the announcement the day before the president of Planned Parenthood, Cecile Richards, testified on Capitol Hill over what she called “outrageous accusations” by Republicans who said that her organization profits from the sale of fetal tissue. In the hearing on Tuesday, she called the charges “offensive and categorically untrue.”
The entire future of the internet may now depend on some plastic retainers. Specifically, two competing versions of those clear plastic alignment systems adults sometimes get instead of braces. And if that sounds weird — which to be fair, it really is — well, welcome to the strange utterly pervasive world of IP law in a digital century.
The Wall Street Journal explains where this particular strange test case for regulation came from. It all stems from a question of international trade and digital transmissions originating overseas.
Here's the background: there are two companies in a trade dispute over orthodontic devices. The products are InvisAlign, which you've probably heard of, and ClearCorrect, a competitor that you may not have.
Align Technology, the company behind InvisAlign, holds some patents on the technology. The International Trade Commission found that ClearCorrect was infringing on some of Align's patents when they made their own teeth-alignment devices, and ordered ClearCorrect to stop. That's pretty straightforward; it's what the ITC does. One of the agency's major purposes is to stop IP-infringing stuff — including counterfeit and knockoff goods, and items that infringe on patents or trademarks — from coming into the U.S.
Except ClearCorrect, a Texas-based company, wasn't importing the actual plastic devices from overseas. They were importing digital information from overseas. Their process starts by scanning a patient's teeth, here in the U.S. Then that digital file is sent to technicians in Pakistan who create more digital models, for the steps between crooked teeth and straight ones. Those digital models — just files — then get zapped back across to Texas, where ClearCorrect feeds the models into a 3D printer. Voila: retainers.
To the ITC, however, importing the digital infringing articles worked out to the same end as importing the physical infringing articles, and so in 2012 (PDF) they told ClearCorrect to stop.
The action by the ITC marked the first time the agency had intervened to take action against virtual, rather than physical, infringing material. As you might guess, that decision has resulted in a whole lot of pushback. ClearCorrect appealed the decision, and both sides are being joined by a wide array of internet, tech, consumer, and privacy groups.
The key issue everyone else is worked up about has nothing to do with dentistry, orthodontics, or even patents but everything to do with copyright, software, networks, piracy, and precedent. In short: if a trade regulatory agency can go after companies that send IP-infringing files zipping around the world, that opens up a whole new Pandora's box of potential woe.
To trade groups like the MPAA and RIAA, the ITC's move is a great idea. It gives them a new tool in the regulatory toolbox that would let them shut down pirated music, movies, and other media that come in from sites hosted outside of the United States. A senior attorney for the MPAA told the WSJ that the ITC's approach “matches up well with some of our current problems,” and added that if the commission “is limited to just physical goods, the ITC will end up in the historical dustbin because everything these days is moving toward electronic importation.”
Groups that represent internet businesses and individuals, however, are much more concerned. The Internet Association, which represents basically every top-tier internet business you've ever heard of, filed a brief in the case (PDF) arguing that the ITC's stance was dangerous overreach. At the time the brief was filed, Abigail Slater, the organization's VP of Legal and Regulatory Policy, said, “This landmark patent law case has enormous implications for cloud computing, the free flow of information between countries and the future of a free and open Internet. … We believe the Commission's position is unlawful, unenforceable, and harmful to global Internet commerce.”
Advocacy groups Public Knowledge and the EFF also filed a brief arguing that treating digital files as imported articles could have further harms. “The decision to treat digital data as an article of importation raises the question of whether all telecommunications, including phone calls, audio streams and television broadcasts, are also articles of importation,” Charles Duan, Director of the Patent Reform Project at Public Knowledge, said of their filing.
He added, “Additionally, we must now ask if internet service providers, telecommunication companies, or even individual internet users can be summoned before the ITC. Unless the Federal Circuit rejects the ITC's overboard and incorrect decision, these questions may plague the courts and the public for years to come.”
It's not hard to see why the ITC made the initial judgement it did about ClearCorrect. The line between digital and physical content grows more blurred every day, and it's now possible for anyone with a 3D printer, anywhere in the world, to print out basically anything from a file generated anywhere else in the world. Patent-infringing and counterfeit goods are only going to get easier to make and distribute as more and more items have their full plans scanned into a computer somewhere, and it's the ITC's job to try to stop that.
But it's also easy to see how dangerous a precedent may be set if the appeals court agrees. The movie and recording industries are not known for restraint when it comes to throwing every kitchen sink they can find at anyone they even suspect of getting a $5 movie or a 3-minute song for free — regardless of how much other damage it could cause to the entire rest of the internet.
Either way, it will be months yet before we know how this will play out: The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit will hear arguments in the case in Washington, D.C. on August 11.
Imports of Digital Goods Face Test [Wall Street Journal]
All statements made by the five Guantánamo prisoners accused of plotting the September 11, 2001, attacks have been classified by the Obama administration, prompting legal challenges from civil libertarians and news organizations.
The order, made in April at the beginning of the military trials of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four others, applies to anything they have said, either in court or in private with their attorneys.
According to the order, “Because the Accused were detained and interrogated in the CIA program, they were exposed to classified sources, methods, and activities. Due to their exposure to classified information, the Accused are in a position to reveal this information publicly through their statements. Consequently, any and all statements by the Accused are presumptively classified until a classification review can be completed.”
In other words, if the statements are not classified, the Obama administration claims, the Central Intelligence Agency's detention and interrogation efforts might be revealed.
“Of course, much information about the programs—including torture of detainees—has long been public,” writes Cora Currier of ProPublica. “The CIA's so-called black-site prisons were acknowledged nearly six years ago by then-President Bush. More details about the program were released by President Obama in 2009.”
The American Civil Liberties Union, one of the defendants' lawyers, and media organizations have challenged aspects of the order. The matter may be reviewed by a military commission judge next month.
In a separate development, the military tribunal considering the case of alleged USS Cole bomber Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri ruled that the defendant would not be allowed to be present at a pre-trial hearing because the information being discussed was classified.

Two others in strange situations appear to be Ryan Caldwell and Tom Heathcote. Both players have a year to run on their contracts but could, like Nick Abendanon, be looking elsewhere for more opportunities. Irish lock Caldwell is now at best fourth choice, and with Will Spencer on the rise his chances appear increasingly limited.
Meanwhile Heathcote is firmly behind George Ford at no10, with Ollie Devoto's versatility often keeping him off the bench as well. With the World Cup just around the corner his Scotland aspirations might require a move elsewhere for more playing time. If Heathcote does move on it could free up some space to keep Henson.
Now seems as good a time as any to start talking about a return to the Premiership from the Championship leaders. Their intent was well and truly signalled today as they announced seven signings all at once. Jack O'Connell, Max Crumpton, Craig Hampson, and Darren Hudson are all young squad members with potential. Nick Koster has been on loan from Bath all year and it's unsurprising that he will stick with them given Gary Gold's departure.
Jack Lam from the Hurricanes is a big signing, one that could prove the best of the bunch. He's been in superb form and is currently keeping Ardie Savea out of the side. Matthew Morgan is another ambitious pick-up, having spurned a considerable offer from the Dragons to sign on. There will always be concerns about the diminutive flyhalf's defense, but with ball in hand he is absolutely electric and he could be a very good signing.
Of course Dwayne Peel, Anthony Perenise, and David Lemi have already been announced, and should they win promotion, as looks increasingly likely, there's every chance that Ross Rennie will stay on and be joined by Ryan Jones. Head coach Andy Robinson is clearly set on staying at the top once they get back there.
The Chiefs have opted to retain veteran trio Kai Horstmann, Haydn Thomas, and Ceri Sweeney for another year after speculation that all three were headed elsewhere. Only three players – Tom Cowan-Dickie, James Phillips, and Jason Shoemark – are out of contract, with the latter expected to be retained but the first two on the way out, possibly to the Championship sides where they are currently on loan. Only a couple players are still to be added, with another tighthead prop still of the utmost importance. Adam Hughes has been rumoured to be arriving via the Dragons, but is currently on loan at Bristol and could stay there.
There are still a few slots yet to be filled but an all-important halfback spot has been taken this week by part-time Scotland captain Greig Laidlaw. Jimmy Cowan's time at the club is almost certainly over as a result. A flyhalf is still on the needs list, and another versatile back rower, though openside Thomas Young has been brought in to replace Andy Hazell.
As mentioned previously Callum Braley, Mark Atkinson, and Stevie McColl are all expected to be made official soon, with Santiago Fernandez another strong possibility. Huia Edmonds, Dan George, Rupert Harden, Lua Lokotui, Tim Taylor, Jonny Bentley, Martyn Thomas, and Cowan are all out of contract and not expected to stay. Mike Tindall is likely to retire as well, which may require another centre addition.
Surprising news came with the re-signing of all three Saxons hookers – Rob Buchanan, Joe Gray, and Dave Ward – to new contracts, which now leaves Harry Allen out in the cold. Quins fans are starting to get a bit antsy about Jordan Turner-Hall and more so Joe Marler, both of whom are out of contract and garnering interest from other parties. Of the two Turner-Hall is the most likely to leave after struggling to find form and fitness over the past couple seasons, though a move would still come as somewhat of a surprise. Squad members Darryl Marfo, Nic Mayhew, Joe Trayfoot, Tim Molenaar, and Ollie Lindsay-Hague are also out of contract, with Mayhew and Molenaar most likely to leave.
The move for Alberto de Marchi has been scuppered by French vultures after his hugely impressive form in the Six Nations, so Tigers have instead opted to sign up his club rival Michele Rizzo. Also on the way from Treviso are star hooker Leonardo Ghiraldini and Italo-Canadian back rower Robert Barbieri. The latter's signing is a result of the Opeti Fonua deal falling through as he remains contracted for another year to Bayonne, and his get-out clause only takes effect if they fall to Pro D2, which now looks highly improbable.
Fijian Seremaia Bai and Japanese international Christian Loamanu have also been sounded out as hopeful singings, though both appear to have hit snags with visa applications still to be sorted. Vereniki Goneva's on-again off-again move to Castres has shown no signs of being resolved, while Daniel Bowden is another yet to decide his future with offers on the table from several interested parties.
Louis Deacon, Pablo Matera, and Blaine Scully are off contract but all hopeful of signing new contracts. The fate of Rob Hawkins looks less assured, as the signing of Ghiraldini all but consigns him to a release. Michael Noone is another yet to be re-signed, though the additions of Barbieri and Laurence Pearce suggest his future is elsewhere.
C.J. van der Linde's Irish career appears to have ended after 20 minutes of action as he has headed back home to recover from surgery on a pectoral injury. Joining him on the plane is Sailosi Tagicakibau, with the Samoan international heading to the Stormers on a season-long loan. It's unclear whether he will be back next season, but the suggestions are that he won't be.
Promising hooker Gerard Ellis, moonlighting as a flanker in recent weeks, has been re-signed for another season, while former England no8 Luke Narraway is incoming from Perpignan. The old Gloucester captain adds good leadership to the squad and will compete with Tom Guest for his preferred position. Christopher Hala'ufia has been linked with Scarlets now that his presence is no longer required.
John Yapp and Ian Gough are out of contract and unlikely to be retained, while Declan Danaher has all but confirmed his retirement. There's still room in the squad for a couple new signings, with a second row the highest on the priority list. Manu Samoa lock Daniel Leo has recently announced he is returning to the UK, could he be joining his Perpignan teammate in London?
Scrumhalf Chris Pilgrim and burly centre James Fitzpatrick are headed to Leeds, furthering the rumours of the arrival of Ruki Tipuna and Juan Pablo Socino. Rob Vickers has re-signed after switching to loosehead prop this season from hooker, with Grant Shiells expected to depart as a result. Key backs Gonzalo Tiesi, Ryan Shortland, and Sinoti Sinoti have yet to be re-signed but it's unlikely Dean Richards would let them go. Back row forwards Richard Mayhew and Chris York are likely fighting for one spot, with the latter most likely to depart.
Steve Diamond is in the market for a tighthead prop with Henry Thomas already gone and Tony Buckley expected to join him. The rest of the squad seems fairly settled, though youngsters Josh Beaumont, Nathan Fowles, Will Addison, and Charlie Ingall remain out of contract but likely to re-sign.
It appears Adam Jones has opted to stay in Wales, so tighthead prop remains a big hole. Hooker Max Crumpton, currently on loan at Harlequins, is off to Bristol next season. Veterans Ernst Joubert and Neil de Kock are set to retire, and fringe players Petrus du Plessis, Eoin Sheriff, Justin Melck, and Nick Fenton-Wells are out of contract and unlikely to be retained. Several key veterans are also out of contract but expected to be re-signed, Alistair Hargreaves and Charlie Hodgson among them.
Tom Lindsay now looks more likely to stay following Ghiraldini's move to Leicester, and no news is probably good news as regards Tom Palmer, with the veteran lock still hoping to secure a new contract to stave off retirement rumours. Tommy Bell could be looking elsewhere with impressive Leeds flyhalf Alex Lozowski reportedly on the way, and if Lorenzo Cittadini's arrival is confirmed it could mean an exit for Phil Swainston. The log-jam in the back row probably means a departure for one or both of Ed Jackson and Rory Pitman, with Matt Everard almost certainly off, possibly to London Scottish where he has been on loan.
Dean Ryan has moved to replace Mariano Galarza with Dan Sanderson of Rotherham, a player of very similar attributes. Two young hookers, Niall Annett and Ben Sowrey, have also been brought in, calling into question the future of Agustin Creevy, who despite saying that he wished to stay must be looking elsewhere to preserve his Pumas starting spot. Ed Shervington is most likely the other hooker set to give way.
Leonardo Senatore is unlikely to stick around for reasons similar to Creevy's, with Semisi Taulava certainly on the move and possibly headed to Newcastle. Props John Andress, Jeremy Becasseau, and Rob O'Donnell are all out of contract, so too veteran locks Chris Jones and Dean Schofield, and key flanker Jake Abbott. All could be off with relegation all but certain at this point, though Abbott remains firmly in Ryan's long-term plans.
Microsoft's bizarre relationship with VMware is no news and given the role of EMC in this relationship, it's clear that so-called 'moles' are driving the affair. According to the latest news, EMC and Microsoft are growing even closer. Much closer.
EMC, Microsoft team for share of IT budgets [...] While tech spending has not evaporated, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said on Tuesday that most companies have mandated that their IT departments cut a significant percentage from their budgets. “To save 5 (percent) to 10 percent, you have to save a little bit on a lot of things,” Ballmer told CNET News on Tuesday, in a joint interview with EMC CEO Joe Tucci, “It's not like there's nothing new getting done. Some new projects are getting killed. There's pressure on vendors to reduce prices.”
For the uninitiated, here is some background reading:
As The Inquirer puts it, “Microsoft divides IT budgets with EMC.” By a sort of inference, Microsoft is now sharing money with VMware as well. VMware is managed by former Microsoft employees, some of whom have a criminal past that Microsoft paid a lot of money to hide.
This week's news speaks a lot about an open source product from VMware, but almost nobody pays attention to the fact that VMware is now promoting Microsoft's pet GNU/Linux distribution, which comes at a cost (of software patents). In other words, the ‘new' VMware (under Microsoft's management) already helps demote distributions and vendors that don't sell out to Microsoft, very much like Hyper-V does [1, 2].
We'll note here that prominent among VMware View Open Client's features is a Novell SUSE Linux Enterprise Thin Client Add-On RPM package and command line interface.
But what about Red Hat?
Isn't Red Hat the leading GNU/Linux distribution?
It sure seems as though Paul Maritz came from Microsoft to scoop up some former Microsoft colleagues with Tucci's endorsement (Tucci became Microsoft's partner of the year last year). Now he's working from inside VMware to put a software patents ‘price tag' on GNU/Linux. Wasn't that predictable? Microsoft pried VMware from the hands of GNU/Linux. It is using its money and its partners to rob parts of the industry of GNU/Linux and impose Microsoft's rules. Remember XenSource too. Here is a new article about it.
If Microsoft Loved Open Source, Who Would It Buy? [...] Could Microsoft take its cash reserves and buy an open source company? Why not? Who expected Oracle and Citrix Systems to become such big investors in open source. Citrix' purchase of XenSource sure has worked out–for Microsoft, in my opinion. And that example might seed a desire for more open source code in Microsoft's camp. [...] “[Y]ou have to save a little bit on a lot of things,” Ballmer told CNET News on Tuesday, in a joint interview with EMC CEO Joe Tucci, “It's not like there's nothing new getting done. Some new projects are getting killed. There's pressure on vendors to reduce prices.”
For background about XenSource and Microsoft, start here. What Microsoft and its super-close partner did there eventually pressured Red Hat into buying KVM (with its parent company) and maintaining its own virtualisation solution, which is laborious and cumbersome.
As Matt Asay correctly pointed out a couple of days ago, this is Microsoft's and Novell's war on Red Hat (and any GNU/Linux distribution that does not pay for mythical software patents).
Going forward, I believe that Red Hat must expand its solution offerings if it wants to take market share from Microsoft. The Unix-to-Linux “low-hanging fruit” won't last forever. When it's gone, the biggest barrier to Red Hat's continued growth will be Microsoft. Unless Red Hat starts acting now to build up a holistic response to Microsoft's value proposition, including the desktop, Red Hat will eventually struggle to grow.
The piece above contains a dramatic exaggeration because we keep seeing businesses that dump Windows for Red Hat, but either way, it's clear that Novell and Microsoft are both attacking any distribution which is not a vassal to software patents, Microsoft and its ecosystem. Therefore, Novell and SLE* must be stopped. █

BUSINESS
With Apple battling it out in court against Korean manufacturing giant, Samsung, more information about the iPhone and it's origins have surfaced. So here's a round-up of some things that were revealed in court.
Project Purple. In a document filed in court, Apple points out to a prototype device codenamed ‘Purple'. It bears a lot of simillarity to the iPhone we know. The Purple was, apparently, first shown within Apple back in August 2005 and it was what went on to become the first generation iPhone. During that time, Project Purple was a well kept secret that Apple executives called on it's top developers to work on it and most of the employees didn't even know exactly what they were developing. The team took one of Apple's Cupertino building and locked it down. It was on a single floor with badge readers and cameras. There were instances when workers on the team would have to show their badges five or six times. Sounds too much? Probably. But hey, Apple is known to go through great lengths to ensure that new products are kept under lock and key.
Google. Documents used by Apple in court apparently reveal that Samsung deliberately copied some aspects of the iPhone and iPad. This comes from a raft of internal Samsung documents that openly admit that the company mimicked the iPhone and was even warned of doing so by Google. In February 2010, Google told Samsung that the Galaxy Tab and Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablets were “too similar” to the iPad. Ouch! That's gotta hurt.
Rejected designs. One of the fun benefits we got out of the Apple vs. Samsung court battle is that Apple gave an inside peek at how Cupertino develops its new products. Apple had to hand over tons of documents and one of them are iPhone and iPad prototype designs. There were iPhones with slanted corners, curved corners, sharp rectangular sides and some iPhones that even looked like the iPod. Apple, at some point, considered building an iPhone with shaped glass. The idea was to put rounded glass on the top and bottom of the iPhone instead of the flat panels we have today. The idea was scrapped because of one simple reason. It would have cost too much money to build it. The iPad on the other had was considered to have square corners and others had round corners. Another prototype design was shown to have something Apple considered to include in the iPads design: a kickstand.
Delays. The iPhone, orginally called Project Purple, almost never happened. Apple's late co-founder Steve Jobs, according to Apple designer Christopher Stringer, had his doubts about whether or not the simple design that the company chose would be a hit. Well, it's a good thing they decided to push through with it. Turns out, the iPhone became one of the highest selling phones in the world.
Apple refused to 3G patent negotiations. And so it just keeps coming. Announcements in court suggest that Samsung attempted to enter into negotiations with Apple regarding essential patent licenses for 3G technology included on the iPhone and iPad. These patents relate to touchscreen and 3G data transmission. How did Apple respond? They refused to cooperate. Simple as that.
Apple spent US$1.1 billion marketing the iPhone and iPad. Apple spent more than US$1.1 billion marketing its iPhone and iPad since 2007. The revelation came during Apple's patent trial with Samsung when Phil Schiller, Apple's vice president of marketing, testified on Friday. By the way, that amount doesn't include money spent in 2012 for the iPhone. Schiller testified that Apple spent $647 million marketing the iPhone from its 2007 release through fiscal 2011. Marketing for the iPad on the other had coast the company $457.2 million since the device was released in April of 2010. Wowsa! Thats a lot of money!

Serfdom and Russian economic development
Andrei Markevich, Ekaterina Zhuravskaya
There is a debate among economists about the effects of serfdom on economic development. This column sheds light on this debate using novel dataset from 19th-century Russia. The findings indicate that serfdom was a crucial factor causing economic slowdown. The abolishment of serfdom was followed by a sharp increase in agricultural productivity, the living standards of peasants, and industrial development.
Serfdom was one of key institutions in Russian history. This column argues that relatively late abolition of serfdom was an important factor of divergence in economic development between Russia and Western Europe.
Serfdom is a term that refers to an institution of forced agricultural labour that existed in the Middle Ages all over Europe. It largely disappeared in Western Europe by the early modern period, while persisting in Eastern Europe and, in particular, in the Russian Empire till the 19th century. Serfs were tied to land and had to work on duties assigned by the landlord. Their legal status, obligations, and rights varied greatly through time and across regions.
There is a debate among scholars about the effects of serfdom for development. On the one hand, scholars such as North and Thomas (1973) to Acemoglu and Robinson (2012) argue that limited rights of serfs over their labour and human capital distorted incentives, discouraged the efficient allocation of resources, and as a consequence, harmed economic growth. On the other hand, a number of studies debate this conclusion, portraying serfdom as a dynamic institution that sustained a considerable speed of economic development (e.g., Moon 1996, Dennison 2011, and Stanziani 2014). They point out that landlords were the only social class that could at that time guarantee and enforce social order, accumulate resources to launch new projects when access to credit was limited, and provide minimum food consumption to peasants during famines.
New evidence on the effects of the Russian serfdom on economic development
Our recent paper (Markevich and Zhuravskaya 2015) sheds light on this debate. We are the first to conduct a rigorous empirical analysis to assess the effects of serfdom on economic development of the Russian empire throughout the 19th century. Our results strongly confirm the conjecture that serfdom was a crucial factor causing a slowdown of economic development of Eastern Europe and that the difference in timing of the abolition of serfdom is an important reason for the divergence of development paths across the European continent.
This analysis was made possible due to a novel province-level panel dataset of development outcomes that we constructed for the European part of the Russian empire in the 19th century. Using these data, we document a very large (in terms of magnitude) and sharp (in terms of timing) increase in agricultural productivity, peasants' living standards, and industrial development as a result of the abolition of serfdom.
Figures 1 and 2 illustrate these results. They show the deviations of the measures of agricultural productivity (Figure 1) and peasant nutrition (Figure 2) from the long-term trend around the time of the emancipation of serfs in the Russian empire.
Figure 1. The abolition of serfdom and agricultural productivity
Figure 2. The abolition of serfdom and peasant nutrition
Grain was the main commodity produced in the Russian empire in the 19th century.
Our results indicate that the abolition of serfdom caused a 10% increase in grain productivity.
This is a large effect comparable to 40 years of aggregate development; grain productivity, on average, was increasing by 2.5% per decade in the 19th century Russia. This result confirms that with limited economies of scale, as in the production of cereals, forced labour has a negative effect on agricultural development.1
The abolition of serfdom also had a very large positive effect on living standards of peasants, measured by the height of draftees into the Russian army.
We find that peasants became 1.6 centimetres taller as a result of emancipation in provinces with the most severe form of serfdom (corvee, barshchina).
We also find that peasant mortality decreased by 5.6 deaths per thousand people as a result of emancipation of serfs in addition to the development trend.
These results suggest that the abolition of serfdom in Russia was one of the most important humanitarian reforms of all times.
Finally, we find a substantial positive effect of the abolition of serfdom on the industrial development of Russia's provinces.
In an average province, industrial output increased by 60% and the industrial employment more than doubled as a result of the abolition of serfdom.
Concluding remarks
Overall, according to our counterfactual estimates, Russia would have been about twice as rich by 1913 compared to what it actually was, had it abolished serfdom in 1820 instead of 1861, as was considered by the emperor Alexander I and demanded by the ‘Decemberists' gentry liberals. In 1913, according to Maddison (2007), Russia's per capita GDP was $1488 (measured in 1990 US dollars). Our estimates suggest that the abolition of serfdom in 1820 would have implied per capita GDP in the range between $2513 and $2992. Thus, by 1913 national income per capita in European Russia would have been comparable to Norway ($2447) or Sweden ($3073) right before World War I.
The difference in the level of development by a factor of two in 1913 due the counterfactual abolition of serfdom 40 years earlier implies that 20th century history of Russia could have taken a very different trajectory.

It's official: The Nexus 5 and 2013 Nexus 7 won't receive the Android 7.0 Nougat update from Google today. The update will roll out to the Nexus 6, 9, 5X, 6P, the Pixel C tablet, the Nexus Player, and the General Mobile 4G (an Android One phone that has been included in the beta program), but older gadgets will remain on Marshmallow.
Neither device was supported by the Android N developer beta builds that Google has been releasing all summer, and both are past the point when new major Android updates are guaranteed (July and October of 2015 for the Nexus 7 and 5, respectively). But the beta support list is not always indicative of the final support list. Google has provided updates outside of that 18-month window before.
Google provides its monthly security patches either three years after a device's release date or 18 months after the end of general availability, whichever is longer. According to the dates listed on Wikipedia, that ought to cover both of them until October 2016 or so, at which point both devices may be left behind for good.
Nexus 5 owners who want to stay updated have some options. The Nexus 5X is nearly a year old, but it's still a solid phone, and it goes on sale pretty regularly at this point. And rumor has it that one of the upcoming HTC-made Nexus phones will have a 5-inch screen, too. Sadly, Nexus 7 users don't have an easy Nexus upgrade path since both the Nexus 9 and Pixel C were significantly larger and more expensive. There are no rumors of a new small-screened Nexus tablet on the horizon.
Even if people use those older Nexuses for another year or two, they'll still be running a newer version of the OS than the vast majority of the Android ecosystem. And the Nexus devices' easily unlockable bootloaders and wide use among developers make them popular among the ROM development community. So you'll be able to find Nougat builds floating around if you're equipped (and brave enough) to install them. But it's too bad that the support lifecycle of the most consistently updated Android devices is so much shorter than what Apple achieves with iOS, especially since the hardware should still be more than capable of supporting Nougat.
The D.C. Council… TAI's highlights, seen and heard, from each Washington Wizards game. Now: Wizards vs. Sixers, Game 48, February 5, 2016, via Rashad Mobley (@rashad20), from the Verizon Center in D.C.
.@JohnWall going 5-hole for 1 of his 10 assists last night #WizSixers https://t.co/HLntGR4W2n — Arthur Reinaltt (@DistrictMamba) February 6, 2016
M.V.P.
John Wall had 18 points, a career-high 13 rebounds, 10 assists, and a Euro-step in leading the Wizards to victory on Friday night. He wasn't facing Russell Westbrook, and his numbers certainly weren't as flashy as the 41 points and 10 assists he amassed in the Wizards' loss to Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors, but he controlled the game against Ish Smith, who is arguably playing as well as any point guard in the NBA right now. Most important, the Wizards won.
Both Wall and Wittman downplayed the significance of Wall's triple-double while playing up how good it felt to get a win. But Wittman did make it his business to play up his star guard's 13 rebounds:
“We had talked where we are as a team rebounding, and it's important that we get our guards back and help more. I think the importance of that is, [Wall] is going to give me 10-plus assists probably every night. The 13 rebounds I really like, just from the standpoint of getting back there and helping. We won the rebounding game tonight because of that. To me it doesn't matter one way or another as long as we win.”
Wall also remarked that his renewed focus on rebounding made it easier for him to control the pace of the game:
“It is a lot easier. Just from watching Russell [Westbrook] when he rebounds the ball he doesn't have to worry about waiting for the outlet pass, he just starts the break. I think it makes it easier for me, too. I don't have to wait for the outlet pass, I can just get the rebound and go.”
Speaking of Westbrook, Wall was victimized by his wicked Euro-step last Monday when the Thunder defeated the Wizards—it “f***** me up,” Wall admitted. Against the Sixers, Wall broke out a Euro-step of his own. After the game Wall was asked why he doesn't use the move more and he said, “I know how to do it, I just don't ever be doing it because I be going to fast … I ain't got it like James [Harden] or Russell [Westbrook] do.”
It was just the Sixers, though, and there will still be instances where Wall gambles and takes plays off on defense—seen in the third quarter when Ish Smith went off for 14 points and the Sixers cut the Wizards' lead from 25 to 10 points. But as Coach Wittman has told the media during countless post-game pressers, a win is a win, and they aren't always easy to come by in the NBA. The Wizards took the W and Wall was the engineer behind, aggressive from the start
L.V.P.
Otto Porter. Maybe it was the trade rumors, or maybe as Jared Dudley alluded to after the game it was Porter's sore hip, or perhaps he's just mired in a slump. Whatever the reason, Otto Porter played timid against Philadelphia. There is certainly no shame in going scoreless in the first half of a game, but Porter took just two shots in about 10 minutes of play. He hit the Wizards' first basket in the second half on a 26-foot 3-pointer, but he scored just two points the rest of the game. Porter finished 2-for-8 from the field, good for five total points. He's now failed to break double-digit points in two straight games, so now seems like a good time to mention that Kelly Oubre, who is capable of providing the very energy that Porter lacked on both ends of the floor, only played a minute of garbage time in the fourth quarter. As the kids say, “I'm just sayin'.”
X-Factor.
For the first time since December 9, 2015, against the Houston Rockets, Bradley Beal was in the starting lineup (it would have been nice to see him get that start against the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday, but that ship has sailed). He and John Wall (10 points each) were the main reasons the Wizards were able to score 38 points in the first quarter, and his offensive aggressiveness gave the Wizards some much-needed versatility. Garrett Temple is a fine player who has the ability to hit the open shot (sometimes) and drive to the basket with purpose on the break, but as Dudley and Wall diplomatically said after the game, Beal's presence in the starting lineup was truly missed:
“He just gives us more of a fire punch,” Dudley said. “He's someone, out of everyone on our team … him and Gary Neal are by far the most aggressive to score, looking to score, to put pressure. He's our best offensive player. Anytime you have that threat, people coming off and looking to pass, he's looking to score. He's the one guy besides John (Wall) who can give you 30. Anytime you have that on the floor, his spacing, he's one of our best shooters. I'm glad to see him back there.”
“Other guys have been stepping up and doing a great job in their roles,” Wall said, “but with Brad starting it gives us another ball handler and he's more aggressive and able to make plays.”
That Game Was … Bittersweet
A glass half-full kind of person would look at Friday night's game as a step in the right direction. The Wizards are currently on the outside of the playoff picture and need to start accumulating wins to close the gap. With more than 30 games to play, they will need to win some challenging games against the upper echelon of the Eastern Conference and they will need to pick up some victories against the lesser teams, too. Against teams like the Sixers, the worst team in the league. Progress!
A pessimistic person who chooses to view the glass as half empty will look at the 25-point lead the Wizards relinquished and focus on how the Sixers were able to stay just within striking distance the entire game. They will focus on Kelly Oubre's lack of playing time, the inconsistent Otto Porter, and Randy Wittman's inability to consistently keep the Wizards focused for 48 minutes.
A victory in Charlotte tonight will go a long way in providing some clarity.
Once one of Britain's principal conspiracy theorists as well as friend to David Icke and Alex Jones, Charlie Veitch, was known as a 9/11 “truther.” As soon as he realized that he had been duped, he stopped. But that was when his problems really began.
According to an interview Veitch gave to the Telegraph, Veitch, who had been Right-wing, joined the Territorial Army (TA). After a drunken night out with his best friend, his friend had turned to Veitch and told him that they had been lying to him. He told Veitch that 9/11 was not what he thought it was and that he was being given “special knowledge.” Veitch's friend went on to show him a video entitled Terrorism: A History of Government Sponsored Terror, a video that was produced by US radio talk presenter, Alex Jones.
Veitch was shortly after made redundant, so with some of his payout, he purchased a camcorder and megaphone, in the style of Alex Jones. He used eccentric methods to publicly express his beliefs, such as swooping on public spaces and embarking public transport to make announcements to whoever was available to listen. In one piece of footage, Veitch was heard to say to a group of passengers: “I am a proponent of the idea that the Twin Towers were brought down in a controlled demolition manner. Those buildings would not have collapsed in the slightest from a Boeing 767 hit.”
But one June afternoon, in New York City's Times Square, Veitch began to film himself on his cell phone, as he made statements to camera about the devastation of the World Trade Center. Only this time, his message was different from all the others he had posted on Youtube. In the video, he said that he no longer believed that 9/11 was an inside job.
Because of his conspiracy theory films and the fact that he was at the forefront of what is known as “The Truth Movement” arm in the UK, Veitch had been approached by the BBC to go on an all-expenses paid 9-day trip to the United States, to examine these “conspiracies” from a scientific standpoint, with a view to furnish him with real information.
In the BBC program, entitled 9/11: Conspiracy Road Trip, 4 additional individuals, with divergent opinions from the official account of events of 9/11, had been selected to go on the road trip with Veitch.
The conspiracy theorists were given the opportunity to talk to building engineers, scientists, FBI and CIA agents, demolition experts and designers of the World Trade Center. They were also allowed to talk to relatives of those who had tragically lost their lives, as well as pay a visit to the Pentagon, the World Trade Center in Manhattan and the Pennsylvania United Flight 93 site.
After all of the scientific evidence was put to Veitch, he did something completely out of the ordinary for a hardcore “truther.” He did a U-turn and changed his mind. Standing in front of the White House, on that sunny day in June, Veitch spoke to the BBC presenter and road trip leader, Andrew Maxwell. In front of the BBC camera, Veitch told him:
“I found my personal truth and you don't have to agree with me, but I can't push propaganda for ideas that I no longer believe in and that's what I do, so I just need to basically… take it on the chin, admit I was wrong, be humble about it and just carry on.”
Before the end of his road trip, Charlie Veitch held up his cell phone in the middle of Times Square, pointed the phone's camera on himself and told the world that he had changed his mind, that he had been wrong. He said:
“This universe is truly one of smoke screens, illusions and wrong paths, but also the right path, which is [to] always be committed to the truth. Do not hold on to religious dogma. If you are presented with new evidence, take it on, even if it contradicts what you or your group might be believing or wanting to believe… you have to give the truth the greatest respect… and I do.”
After Veitch posted his video, the 9/11 Truth Movement's reaction to one of its most prominent “truthers” changing his mind was one to be expected. Veitch was labeled a flip-flop, a shill sellout who was taking cash for working for the BBC. The Truth Movement did what any organization of its kind would do to someone who, for want of a better term, came to their senses. They tried to discredit him.
Veitch told Myles Power in his BBC-funded interview, how he once had too much time on his hands, “Idle hands are the conspiracy theory world's ideal way to get into your head,” he said, as he described how he started to watch Alex Jones and David Icke documentaries, as well as other scientific theory videos which he said spun a pretty convincing yarn on its conspiracies. He became convinced that the Illuminati were behind it all, with its so-called New World Order. After becoming absorbed by his interest in conspiracy theories, he took up his megaphone and camera and began to make films about them, which he said, elevated him to a “high priest” status of the Truth Movement.
But so with age, comes wisdom and reason. Veitch began to look critically at the proponents of the conspiracy theories, beginning to not only question what could have been in it for the establishment to have blown up the World Trade Center, but in a sudden turnaround, he questioned the agenda of those who now came across to him as crazier and angrier than the actual perpetrators of terror; the Truth Movement. He also said that the risk factor would be far too great for such so-called powers of the establishment, who had too much to lose, to instigate such an atrocity and then attempt to shroud it in secrecy.
He went on that the paper trail would be too vast and that there would be more likelihood of other world powers, with advanced technological methods of getting a hold of such information, should it even exist, than an organization like the Truth Movement. He concluded by saying that if things were truly as the Truth Movement had claimed, then there would be a civil collapse, should the evidence be presented, but that there is no evidence, because it was not an inside job.
Veitch said that before he accepted the BBC's offer of the road trip, that the activist, conspiracy, new age and spiritual worlds seemed to love him, but he now admits how he became arrogant and fell for the hype. He had believed that the Truth Movement was about being purveyors of truth in the world, but realized that it was closer to a religious cult, with its indoctrination methods.
Charlie Veitch's Times Square video provoked such aggressively negative responses from Truth Movement followers, who sent him messages telling him to rot in hell, that he was simply a pawn and that he was paid to do it. Within days, he was renounced by his friends and sent death threats. An email had been sent to his followers, claiming to be from Veitch and falsely admitting that he was a pedophile: a message that ultimately reached his mother, causing her utter distress.
Another follower had created a channel on Youtube, entitled Kill Charlie Veitch. On the channel, he had said that he was coming to kill Veitch and that he should enjoy his last few days. His face had also been superimposed on to a pig as it was being slaughtered. Even David Icke had posted a message to say that Veitch would deeply regret his actions, while Alex Jones told him not to even bother communicating with him, as he no longer knew him.
In an interview on AdamVsTheMan on RT, Veitch opened up about how he had spent 4-5 years looking at the conspiratorial view on 9/11 until the BBC helped present him with hard facts. He talked about how he already began to have his doubts before the US road trip, but really felt his change of heart when he was standing on top of Building 7 at the World Trade Center site, having just grilled building experts on the nature of the collapse of the Twin Towers.
Veitch has concluded that conspiracy theorists are professional victims who have a hatred of high achievers and who were likely to have been bullied at school. He put his misdirection down to his vulnerable ego and has, unsurprisingly, become very cynical and misanthropic. He may have come to his senses now, but he will always be remembered as The 9/11 Conspiracy Theorist Who Realized He Was Duped.
Veitch currently lives with his young child and fiancée in Manchester, England and is planning to become a documentary maker.

Aiyana Jones will not turn thirteen this year. Her parents will not have the mixed blessing of guiding their daughter through years of teenage tumultuousness, including disagreements about dating, negotiations about curfews, arguments over doing the dishes or cleaning her room, and navigating the ups and downs that accompany adolescent hormones. Instead, they'll continue to grieve for their baby girl—and the lack of accountability for her tragic death.
It was shortly after midnight on May 16, 2010, and the seven-year-old was sleeping peacefully in her grandmother's Detroit apartment. But a swat team mistook their apartment for the one above, hurling a flashbang grenade through the window. Then they rushed in. When he entered, Officer Joseph Weekley shot Aiyana. The bullet went straight through her head, killing her instantly.
Juries failed to reach a verdict in two separate trials. In October 2014, the judge dismissed the involuntary manslaughter charges against Weekley. Then on January 30, 2015, more than seven years after Aiyana's death, the judge also dismissed the lesser charge of reckless use of a firearm.
In other words, no one will be held legally responsible for Aiyana's murder.
Aiyana is just one of a long list of girls and women of color whose lives have been cut short by police violence. But, while the police killings of Michael Brown in Ferguson and Eric Garner in New York have spurred national outcry, incited mass protests and sparked discussions about law enforcement violence, less attention has been paid to the deaths of black women at the hands of police.
In January 2008, Ohio police shot 26-year-old Tarika Wilson while she was holding her one-year-old in her home. (The baby, who was also shot, survived.) In March 2012, 22-year-old Rekia Boyd was hanging out with friends in a Chicago park when she was shot and killed by an off-duty police officer. In February 2014, Yvette Smith, a 47-year-old mother of two, was shot to death by Texas police officers after opening the door of her home to them. In August 2014, 50-year-old Michelle Cusseaux was shot to death by Phoenix police in her own home. In November 2014, 37-year-old Tanesha Anderson died after police slammed her head into the concrete pavement. These are only a handful of examples. While there are many more, we actually don't know how many women of color have been killed by police since no agency keeps complete statistics.
These women's names and stories rarely stick in the public consciousness. Their deaths rarely raise the same level of sustained media attention and protests. These murders should spark outrage and mass mobilizing among both activists organizing against police violence and feminists demanding an end to violence against women. But, with the exception of women of color-led groups like INCITE! Women, Gender Non-Conforming, and Trans people of Color Against Violence and local organizing led by grieving family members, these deaths have fallen through the cracks of other movements. This speaks volumes about how the lives of women of color continue to be devalued.
These tragedies should be creating uproars in many movements and communities. They should trigger conversations that build bridges between racial justice and anti-violence organizing both locally and nationwide. We need to extend our conversations and movements against violence against women to include violence committed by police. At the same time, we need to include women in our discussions and organizing to end police violence. Otherwise, law enforcement violence against women of color will continue to happen—and, tragically, continue to be ignored.
In the latest blow to patent trolls, 42 state and territorial attorneys general—that's right, 42!—wrote a letter today calling on the Senate to pass meaningful patent reform. As the AGs write:
So-called patent trolls stifle innovation and harm our economy by making dubious claims of patent infringement and using the threat of expensive litigation to extort money from small businesses and nonprofits. We have received many complaints from these businesses and nonprofits, our constituents, who are desperate for relief from the misuse of the patent system. While these threats were once focused on tech businesses, they are now levied at all manner of businesses, including banks, hospitals, restaurants and hotels.
You might remember that states such as Vermont, Nebraska, Minnesota, and New York have long been leaders in the fight to take on patent trolls. They've been particularly effective because they often are in the best position to know the harm their citizens and local businesses are facing. It is encouraging to see nearly every state's attorney general call on the Senate to pass patent reform. We think they are right, and we hope that the United States Senate is listening.
BRUSSELS -- Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano is warning America's allies in the fight against terrorism that they must expand the monitoring of the global supply chain to include everyday substances that can be used to make weapons.
"It can be ... chemicals used in the manufacture of bombs, but you're also talking chemical, biological, potentially radiological (weapons)," she said, speaking exclusively to Fox News. "All the things that we need to be concerned about in today's threat environment."
It's an argument Napolitano is expected to be making quite a bit in the days to come.
On Thursday, Napolitano and officials from the Department of Homeland Security and White House will be meeting here behind closed doors with the World Customs Organization, the only inter-governmental group devoted exclusively to customs matters. Napolitano will then wrap up her week-long, security-focused trip to Afghanistan, the Middle East and Europe with remarks at the European Policy Center, a Brussels-based think tank.
Aides wouldn't offer details about what she will say, but one official said to expect a call for "expansion" of global efforts to monitor and secure potentially dangerous substances, particularly the 14 so-called "precursor chemicals" that are legal but causing so many problems in Afghanistan and elsewhere.
According to a statement from the European Policy Center, Napolitano will "share her vision for securing the global supply chain through a layered security approach to identify, deter and disrupt threats in partnership with Europe and other international actors."
A year ago, the U.S. government and world partners, led by the World Customs Organization, launched an initiative called Global Shield, focusing on chemicals such as ammonium nitrate, which can be found in standard fertilizer and is used in more than 80 percent of the homemade bombs used by insurgents in Afghanistan.
Napolitano started her overseas trip in Afghanistan, where dozens of officials from her department, particularly from Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Border Patrol, are training Afghan security forces to conduct customs operations. Napolitano got a first-hand look at the Torkham border crossing along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.
She said her department "started" its efforts by addressing precursor chemicals "because that's such a top priority, keep the tools out of the hands of terrorists."
"But as you know from last October when we had the attempt to get bombs hidden in toner cartridges onto cargo planes, cargo itself can become a target," she said. "What we're really talking about here is what's called the global supply chain, how you protect it from terrorist attack. ... Given the global nature of commerce, it's very important that that supply chain itself remains free from attack."
In the end, one Homeland Security official said, Napolitano is in Brussels to "build" and "bulk up" international efforts to track precursor chemicals and secure the global supply chain.
"How can someone smuggle a radiological weapon filled with chemicals into the United States by exploiting the global supply chain?" the official said. "There are multiple points into that supply chain, so there are multiple ways to disrupt it."
The official said the U.S. government is trying to be "proactive," employing "intelligence-based" methods, analysis of shipping data from around the world, and information-sharing.
"You get at it by forming partnerships, and you get at it by working with the community of nations," Napolitano said.

After months of offseason preparation and months of jockeying for position in the standings, GMs whose teams are on the fringes of the pennant race have to take a long look in the mirror and answer one question: Are we in or out?
Most of the time, the answer is obvious, even if it becomes self-evident only days before the trade deadline. But occasionally the mirror spits back an ambiguous response, and this year, that's the case for first-year GM Jerry Dipoto and the Seattle Mariners.
Seattle sits in third place in the AL West, 6.5 games astern of the first-place Rangers, four games back of second-place Houston. At 50–48, it's not like the Mariners are taking water over the side, but they've just sort of floated around .500 since a six-game losing streak in June took the wind out of their sails. After Sunday's action, FanGraphs' playoff projections gave Seattle just a 12.1 percent chance of reaching the divisional round of the playoffs. It's tough enough for Dipoto to pull the rip cord on the season while the team is over .500 in July, but Dipoto is in a weird position: The standings say “sell,” but the roster says “stand pat” or even “buy.”
Seattle doesn't lack for star power — Kyle Seager and Robinson Canó could break into almost any lineup in the league, while Nelson Cruz's late-career renaissance continues with a .286/.371/.543 slash line in a park that doesn't exactly prop up hitters. Hisashi Iwakuma, with a 102 ERA+ in 127.1 innings at age 35, would be an asset to any rotation, to say nothing of Taijuan Walker, the 23-year-old right-hander and former top prospect with a 111 ERA+, and Félix Hernández, whom you probably know already.
Except the Mariners aren't exactly an up-and-coming team looking to clear salary and playing time for youngsters, like last year's Phillies. Nor are they at the end of a cycle of contention and looking to kick-start a rebuild by cashing in veterans for prospects, like this year's Yankees. Their three best position players, Canó, Seager, and Cruz, are 33, 28, and 36. Cruz is locked up through 2018, Seager through 2021 (with a team option for 2022), and Canó through 2023.
Meanwhile, Hernández is under contract through 2019, and any GM who'd trade King Félix is a GM who wants to be responsible for the earthquake that knocks Seattle into Puget Sound.
Maybe Iwakuma would be attractive to a contender, but he's got $10 million team options (which could increase if he hits certain innings plateaus) for both next year and 2018, which would make him a bargain if he's even a mediocre starter. Plus, any trade would be contingent on Iwakuma waiving his full no-trade clause.
So who does Dipoto have to trade? That first-base platoon of Adam Lind and Dae-ho Lee could be useful to a contender, particularly Lee, who's on a $1 million deal. So could outfielder Seth Smith, who's OPS-ing .847 against right-handed pitching, and who has a $7 million team option if he performs well and a $250,000 buyout if he doesn't. Thirty-year-old closer Steve Cishek, a reliably above-average reliever since 2011 who's due $6 million in 2017, could also be attractive to a playoff contender. If Dipoto were to sell, all of those players would likely be on the move.
Here's the problem: While all of those players have some value, none of them has very much value. For a reliever or a platoon corner guy, you'd expect some A-ball lottery ticket prospect or a buy-low big leaguer in a my-garbage-for-your-trash trade. And although the Mariners aren't exactly an up-and-coming team, that doesn't mean they don't have reason to be optimistic for 2017. Seattle's got the run differential of a 54–44 team, which isn't too comforting right now, but it means the Mariners have played well enough that they should be two games out of first, not 6.5. And that's with both Walker and Hernández, their two best starting pitchers, spending time on the DL. It doesn't take a whole lot of optimism to see the Mariners as contenders in 2017 if they bring back the same team, more or less — and they can if they want to.
Then there's that daunting 12.1 percent chance of making the divisional round. Even this late in the season, playoff odds are (1) volatile and (2) just estimates anyway.
I'm not suggesting that Dipoto dump out the farm system for Rich Hill — and there's probably not enough in there to match top offers for Jonathan Lucroy or Chris Sale anyway — but the Mariners are constructed in such a way that there's very little to gain by selling, and very little to lose by either standing pat or making a 2012 Neal Huntington–style head fake toward buying. They could toss some minor prospect or organizational filler to a team in hard-sell mode to pick up a bench bat, giving off the impression that they are going for it without sacrificing any meaningful future talent.
Better to stay the course than spend the rest of the season adrift and rudderless.

* Experts flag concerns after reviewing U.S. record
* Urge U.S. to limit use of killer drones abroad
* Back greater oversight of NSA surveillance
* Call for prosecution of Bush-era abductions, torture (Recasts with quotes from press conference)
By Stephanie Nebehay
GENEVA, March 27 (Reuters) - A U.N. human rights watchdog called on the Obama administration on Thursday to limit its use of drones targeting suspected al-Qaeda and Taliban militants and to curb U.S. surveillance activities at home and abroad.
U.S. drone strikes have led to excessive civilian casualties and unrestricted data collection has eroded the right to privacy, the U.N. Human Rights Committee said in its first report on Washington's rights record since 2006.
“A lot has to do with lack of transparency and oversight,” Swiss lawyer Walter Kaelin, who is among the panel's 18 independent experts, told a news briefing where the findings were issued.
Referring to surveillance by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), Kaelin said: “What we are calling for is that if surveillance is undertaken, it has to be done in line with principles of legality, that there is the need for very clear detailed regulation containing safeguards for those under direct surveillance.
“We're calling also for a proportionate use of surveillance, not of everyone, but really limited to cases where such surveillance is necessary and justified.”
The Obama administration on Thursday announced details of its plan to end the government's vast bulk collection of data from phone calls made in the United States, including new procedures to get judicial approval before asking companies for such records
“The announcement by President Obama is in line with our recommendation to adopt a law. I think our detailed recommendations provide some guidance on how such a law should be, what key elements should be included,” Kaelin said.
The United States has obligations under a U.N. treaty on civil and political rights regarding those it puts under direct surveillance, even those outside U.S. territory, Kaelin said.
DRONE STRIKES
The panel called for the prosecution of anyone who ordered or carried out killings, abductions and torture under a CIA programme at the time of President George W. Bush, and to keep a promise to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.
U.S. officials did not immediately comment on the findings, which were welcomed by U.S. activist groups.
“President Obama now has an opportunity to reverse course and reshape his human rights legacy by taking concrete actions like declassifying the Senate report on CIA torture, ending dragnet surveillance and unlawful targeted killings,” said Jamil Dakwar of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).
The Obama administration increased the number of drone strikes after taking office in 2009 but attacks have dropped off in the last year. It has been under pressure to rein in the missile strikes and do more to protect civilians.
The United States should give more information on how it decided someone was enough of an “imminent threat” to be targeted in covert operations, the panel's report said.
It should also “revisit its position regarding legal justifications for the use of deadly force through drone attacks,” investigate any abuses and compensate victims' families, the committee said.
Kaelin said although the use of drones was not banned in armed conflict, the panel was concerned at the “very broad (U.S.) notion of the ‘theatre of hostilities'.”
“So it is really not about prohibiting but about limiting”.
The committee called for more investigations into intelligence operations launched by the Bush administration in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks.
Critics say the CIA's programme used harsh interrogation methods, including “waterboarding” or simulated drowning, that constituted torture banned by international law.
The report welcomed Obama's order in January 2009 to end the CIA programme, but noted only a limited number of investigations have been conducted into “unlawful killings ... and the use of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment of detainees in U.S. custody, including outside its territory, as part of the so-called ‘enhanced interrogation techniques' programme”.

Bassist Oteil Burbridge didn't know what he would do after the Allman Brothers Band, which he had been a member of for 17 years, played its final show in October, 2014. He played some one-off shows and had a brief reunion with Col. Bruce Hampton's Aquarium Rescue Unit. Then he got a call to audition in California for Dead and Company, a new band that Grateful Dead members Bob Weir, Bill Kreutzmann and Mickey Hart were forming with singer/guitarist John Mayer and keyboardist Jeff Chimenti.
“The auditions were not at all formal,” says Burbridge. “I don't think they were looking at anyone but me and [Phish's] Mike Gordon. Bob had never played with me outside of his sit-ins with the Allman Brothers and Mayer and I never played together at all. They flew me out to jam with them to see what the chemistry felt like and we started rehearsing a few weeks later.”
While modern gaming webcomics may have been the catalyst for our desire to start a webcomic of our own, my love for comics actually goes back much further. Calvin and Hobbes was my first love. I didn't read the Sunday Funnies when I was a kid, but I had a copy of “Attack of the Deranged Killer Mutant Snow Goons” that I could not put down. I have said a number of times that Calvin and Hobbes is the strip I would write, if I could.
So, when we found ourselves with a concept that fit naturally in that mold, we decided to play with it a little, for Bill Watterson. May he rest in peace. Except that he's not dead. But he's probably chilling somewhere. Despite his refusal to license his characters or run his strip into the ground like a certain heavy feline, Calvin and Hobbes is probably sufficiently popular to allow him to retire in relative comfort on book sales alone.
And who wouldn't want that?
Expand French soldiers patrol near the Eiffel Tower as part of the "Sentinelle" counterterrorism security plan in Paris, France, May 3, 2017. © 2017 Reuters (Paris) — France's National Assembly should amend abusive measures in a draft counterterrorism bill that would move a number of emergency powers into ordinary law without adequate safeguards, Human Rights Watch said today.
The Assembly's law commission was scheduled to begin examining the bill on September 12, 2017. The bill, approved by the Senate in July, is being fast-tracked and is to go to a final vote in an extraordinary session of Parliament on September 25.
“France's new counterterrorism bill grants the executive far-reaching powers to clamp down on the ability of ordinary people in France to worship, assemble, move freely, express themselves, and enjoy their privacy,” said Kartik Raj, Western Europe researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The National Assembly needs to take the time needed to scrutinize and revise the bill before it's too late.”
The current version of the Draft Law to Strengthen Internal Security and the Fight Against Terrorism would end the state of emergency formally on November 1, after almost two years, but replace it immediately with a host of measures that write exceptional, emergency practices into normal criminal and administrative law. The bill now contains two important concessions, however: the new powers will lapse in 2021, and the government has to report back to parliament annually on how it uses the new powers.
The bill would grant increased powers to prefects, the interior minister's local representatives, to designate public spaces as security zones, limiting who could enter and leave them; to limit the movement of people considered a national security threat; to close places of worship; and to search private property.
The judiciary would have no role in approving the use of the first two powers, although there would be a limited right of appeal for orders limiting where a person has to live and for closing places of worship. A judge – initially a special “liberty and detention judge”, and a Court of Appeal judge if the decision is appealed – will have limited oversight of search powers. The bill's vague definitions of terrorism and threats to national security exacerbate concerns that the powers will be used in an arbitrary manner.
The draft bill also changes surveillance legislation, border controls and processes for the retention of passenger data, and includes a new requirement for financial reporting by any organization carrying out counter-radicalization projects as a public function.
Increased powers for prefects to designate public spaces or events as “perimeters of protection” for up to a month, allowing police to search people, bags, and vehicles, lack any requirement of a demonstrably serious or imminent threat, despite Senate efforts to introduce such language. The power would be renewable, in theory, on a rolling month-by-month basis. Given the lack of any legal powers to address discrimination in the use of these powers, these new powers risk exacerbating ethnic profiling against a background of longstanding concerns about discrimination in identity checks.
The current version of the bill replaces the system of “assigned residence orders” under the state of emergency, which can amount to house arrest and have led to significant abuses, with somewhat less intrusive restrictions now called “individualized administrative control and surveillance measures.” This system provides executive powers to require a person to remain within a geographic boundary, to report periodically to a police station, to accept an electronic surveillance bracelet, and to report any changes of residence. The powers can be imposed for vague and overly broad grounds without prior judicial authorization. The version before the National Assembly now includes a right to appeal the decision to an administrative tribunal when the government seeks to renew the restrictions.
The bill increases prefects' powers to close places of worship without prior judicial authorization with the aim of “preventing acts of terrorism”. The definition of what constitutes a threat, despite minor amendments in the Senate that require the threatening ideas to be expressed in writing, lacks a clear link to the commission of a violent act, remains overly vague, and is open to abuse.
Search powers remain relatively unchanged from the earlier draft, although a requirement has been added for the judicial police officer present during a search to identify themselves formally in the written record of the search.
The powers as used in the state of emergency have drawn widespread criticism for leading to abuses while having limited impact on terrorism threats. Members of parliament who oversee their use and the Defender of Rights, the national human rights oversight body, have also expressed reservations.
Human Rights Watch and other groups have documented that assigned residence powers and the exercise of search powers have led to human rights abuses in France. Both the national and European human rights watchdogs criticized the draft bill while Senate considered it.
The entire legislative process, if completed by September 25 as anticipated, would grant the executive wide-ranging powers in an accelerated procedure that will have lasted just over three months, including the summer recess. Although limited formally until 2021, the law would potentially be open to further renewal after a review of its operation in 2020.
France already has expansive counterterrorism laws that permit the authorities to investigate, detain, and prosecute suspects, some of which have been used abusively. The French government's own website on the fight against terrorism noted in August 2016 that the government has “completed its legal arsenal and put in place an unprecedented reinforcement of its means in the police, justice, army and intelligence services.”
“The sunset clause added by the Senate should not obscure the fact that this bill would normalize measures that have only been used under exceptional circumstances,” Raj said. “During these two crucial weeks to hold the legislation up to the light, the National Assembly has a duty to the people of France make sure it preserves human rights and the rule of law.”
A Young, Wild, and Polished Manicure
Oh how I love, love, LOVE this manicure, and I'm sure you all are going to agree. It is serious perfection, and it was dreamed up by the amazing Nicole of Young, Wild, and Polished. If you are unaware of Nicole, you need to head on over to her blog or Twitter, or Instagram and take a gander at her gorgeous nails. She is the queen of the kitchen sink manicure, and of course dot-icures. Back in November, I attempted some dotted flowers and copied one of her manicures . It by far turned out to be one of my all-time favorite manis. Now, this manicure has become my new favorite.
Nicole posted this gorgeous dot mani mixed with a beautiful 3 color gradient . As a lover of purple, pink, and blue, I immediately fell in love. I stared at it on Instagram, drooled over it on Twitter, and needed to copy it. Since I received some new dotting tools from the Born Pretty Store, and some amazing new polishes from Sally Hansen, my time to attempt this manicure had arrived.
Here's how they turned out. Oh how I love my lightbox, the pictures are coming out so much better!
Bases
Sinful Colors - Black on Black
Ulta - Snow White
Gradient and Dots
Sally Hansen Insta-Dri - Blue Away!
Sally Hansen Insta-Dri - Fuchsia Flare
Ulta - Tutu Cute
China Glaze - Fairy Dust
I'm so happy with how this manicure came out. My dotting skills have far improved, along with my gradients. I can partially thank the amazing Sally Hansen Insta-Dri polishes for this.
Dotting with fast dry polishes I thought was going to be a huge problem. My Sinful Colors Black on Black which I frequently dot with tends to dry up and leave those awful little lines behind. These Insta-Dri polishes did none of that! Working with such bright colors on a black base would have shown this, but clearly you can see that I had perfect dots each time.
The Sally Hansen polishes were just AMAZING as well when it came to the gradient. As I normally do when creating a gradient, I start off with some white undies. Then, on a makeup sponge, I paint on the colors I want to gradient For this manicure, I started with a swipe of Blue Away! at the top, then Tutu Cute, ending with Fuschia Flare. After sponging twice on the nail, I didn't need to go back and touch up the gradient at all. Typically I do, but with these polishes, I had no issue. I added my top coat and the gradient blended perfectly. I was nervous that since they were quick dry they wouldn't blend as easily, but boy, they did and it was gorgeous.
Can I also say how AMAZING Born Pretty's dotting tools were?! The dotting tools I received
I cannot wait to use Blue Away and Fuschia Flare as bases in manicures. They're the perfect, bright, cream polishes. After seeing how they work with a gradient and dots, I am convinced they will make the perfect bases! Beyond gorgeous, if you need a baby blue polish or a bright pink perfect for Valentines Day, head on out to the store and purchase!!!! They must haves.Can I also say how AMAZING Born Pretty's dotting tools were?! The dotting tools I received were these! There are 5 dotting tools with 2 dotters on each size, giving you 10 different sized dots. Amazing. The polish adhered to them amazingly, and the tools themselves were simple to use! They weren't too light, and they weren't too heavy, so I was able to maneuver them with both hands with ease. If you want your own set, head on over to the Born Pretty Store to purchase some!!!

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq's army chief was quoted on Wednesday as saying he needed only days to drive Islamic State from Ramadi, the city whose fall in May exposed the weakness of the Baghdad government and dampened hopes of restoring control in the north and west.
Iraqi troops began advancing on Tuesday in an offensive complicated by rivalries and suspicions harbored by local Sunni tribes and by Shi'ite militia backed by Iran. U.S. officials, concerned also by militant operations over the border in Syria, have expressed frustration at delays in seizing back the city.
“In the coming days will be announced the good news of the complete liberation of Ramadi,” Iraqia TV cited army chief of staff Lt. General Othman al-Ghanemi as saying.
Government troops are now concentrating on the last district held by the militants in the center of Ramadi, a Sunni Muslim city on the river Euphrates some 100 km (60 miles) west of Baghdad and capital of Anbar province.
If captured, it will be the second major city after Tikrit to be retaken from Islamic State in Iraq. It would provide a major psychological boost to Iraqi security forces after the militant group seized a third of Iraq, a major OPEC oil producer and U.S ally, in a sweeping advance last year.Progress has been slow because the government wants to rely entirely on its own troops and not use Shi'ite militias in order to avoid rights abuses such as occurred after the recapture of Tikrit from the militants in April.
Iraqi officials say Shi'ite militias are reluctant to yield power amassed with Iranian backing, making it hard to forge a unified strategy. Operations are also complicated by competition for influence in Baghdad between Washington and Tehran.

Local Sunni tribes have not been involved directly in the assault, but have been active in support activities across the province - a contrast to the U.S.-backed Tribal Awakening campaign 10 years ago when they united to drive al Qaeda elements from Anbar.
Joint operations command spokesman Yahia Rasool told Reuters the city would be handed over to Anbar police and local tribes after it was fully cleared and secured.
By contrast to 2005, the Sunni tribes are now dealing with a government less given to sectarian Shi'ite loyalties.
AIMING FOR MOSUL
The ultimate aim is to clear Islamic State from Mosul, Iraq's largest northern city, and Falluja, which lies between Ramadi and Baghdad, as well as large areas of Syria - the core of what it has declared to be a caliphate.
The control of major population centers in Iraq and Syria allows it to maintain a revenue base, controlling oil resources and large, fertile agricultural areas, and possibly plan attacks outside its core territory.

Citing military statements, Iraqi state TV said government forces had killed hundreds of militants since Tuesday. It gave no casualty toll for government forces.The offensive started on Tuesday at dawn, when units crossed the Euphrates river into central districts using two bridges - one rebuilt by army engineers, and a second floating structure, an army spokesman said, describing fighting then as “ferocious”.
The troops did not make progress on Wednesday as they were busy consolidating their positions and dismantling improvised explosive devices left by the militants, said Col. Mohammed Ibrahim, a spokesman for the War Media Cell on Whatsapp. The distance to the Ramadi government complex, the target building of the troops in the city center, is 1,700 meters (just over one mile), and the presence of civilians is slowing their progress, he said.
WICHITA — Creating a group that encourages employers to hire and retain workers with disabilities is both a personal and professional endeavor for a Sedgwick County man.
Dave Phillips is chairman of the Business Leadership Network of Sedgwick County, a public-private partnership that aims to boost hiring of disabled workers. He is also is the director of restaurant marketing for Sasnak Management, the parent company of Carlos O'Kelly's restaurants, which has agreed to be the group's lead employer, The Wichita Eagle reported.
Phillips told the newspaper that his son deals with developmental disabilities and has "been the beneficiary of wonderful employers. So I was a pretty easy sell."
The start-up group's inaugural event is a luncheon in Wichita on Thursday that will feature a presentation on providing employment to people with autism given by Keith Wiedenkeller, senior vice president for Kansas City-based AMC Entertainment.
"He's kind of legendary for what he's accomplished in hiring people with autism," Phillips said.
Representatives from at least 10 major employers are expected to attend to the event.
The new group was created by the Sedgwick County Developmental Disability Organization. Its board includes officials from Manpower, Amerigroup, Kansas Elks Training Center for the Handicapped and Cerebral Palsy Research Foundation.
Its goal is to give employers opportunities to learn from one another, as well as provide resources and information.
"We're a resource and networking organization," Phillips said. "Every business can do something. Everyone can do their part."
LONDON (Reuters) - Multimillionaire Brexit donor Arron Banks wrote to Britain's Electoral Commission on Thursday to imply he was the subject of a politically motivated investigation amid speculation that Russia may have meddled in the 2016 referendum vote.

In his letter, Banks said his campaign hired an accountant and an auditor, a lawyer oversaw all spending, and its returns were submitted after discussions with the election watchdog.
The Electoral Commission, which is already looking at whether Banks' Leave.EU group received any impermissible donations, opened a new investigation last week into whether Banks was the true source of loans to a campaigner.
The announcement of the investigation came after a lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party asked the government to look into reports by advocacy group Open Democracy that the origin of some campaign funds was unclear.
Banks questioned why only his campaign group was being singled out for investigation and alleged all the commissioners at election watchdog support staying in the EU.
“The Commissioners are fully signed up ‘Remainers,'” he said in the letter. “It really is quite incredible that an organisation that exists to ensure fair play in elections should be packed full of ex-MPs and ex-council leaders – jobs for the political boys!”
The Electoral Commission said it has received Banks' letter and will respond.
Banks said politicians who support remaining in the EU are fuelling claims Russia may have meddled in the referendum and that voters were misled by a widely publicised bus during the campaign emblazoned with a slogan saying Britain was sending 350 million pounds a week to the EU.
The commission previously said it was looking at whether a company called Better for the Country Limited (BFTCL) - of which Banks was a director - was the true source of donations made to campaigners.
BFTCL was not registered as a permitted participant in the referendum but five registered campaigning groups reported receiving donations from it totalling 2.4 million pounds, the Commission said.
Banks, who was pictured with Donald Trump and leading Brexiteer Nigel Farage outside a gilded elevator soon after Trump's 2016 U.S. presidential election victory, was a registered permitted participant and gave three non-commercial loans to Leave.EU, totalling 6 million pounds.
The Commission said in April it was investigating Leave.EU's funding as well as looking at whether its spending return was complete.
The Commission has the power to impose fines and other sanctions if it finds rules were broken.
But what if Ötzi's tattoos were there for another reason—and what if there were more of them? The dozens of tattoos scientists could see might, they thought, be accompanied by more marks—ones obscured by dark patches from thousands of years of mummification.
So Melis and his colleague Matteo Miccoli from Profilocolore, a spectral imaging company in Rome, teamed up with the museum's mummy experts and used a camera technique called Hypercolorimetric Multispectral Imaging (HMI) to investigate. The idea was to analyze Ötzi under infrared and ultraviolet light, which might reveal details that couldn't otherwise be seen. Using specialized lenses on an otherwise ordinary Nikon and imaging software, Melis and his colleagues analyzed every pixel from the photos they took under seven different wavelengths of light to map Ötzi's tattoos.
And it worked. Not only did Melis and his team get a more complete view of tattoos they already knew were there—they also uncovered new markings on parts of Ötzi's body they never knew were decorated.
“At first we didn't know if we could find something,” Melis said. But after spending a whole day in a below-freezing operating room taking pictures, the team had a breakthrough. “Then, very suddenly we saw that there was something more, something never seen before when we looked through the infrared portion of the pictures.”
Before his work on Ötzi, Melis had used the HMI technique to collect clues for a more traditional sort of cold case. After Italian police found the bones of a missing man who had disappeared years earlier, Melis used the camera technique at the crime scene to identify traces of blood splattered on what looked like clean walls. The finding led a judge to reopen the case as a homicide. Melis also used the technique to reveal a Leonardo da Vinci mural hidden beneath a thick layer of soot in an Italian castle. Doctors use the technique to diagnose dermatological diseases such as melanoma that can be present beneath the surface of the skin—an application not unlike the method researchers used to identify Ötzi's tattoos. “We thought we could use the same kind of technique to discover the tattoos on the mummy, because the tattoos go under the skin,” Melis said.
Melis and his team found a total of 61 tattoos across the mummy's body—including a never before seen set located on his ribcage. They reported their findings last month in the Journal of Cultural Heritage. “The tattoo on the chest was really surprising, we did not expect to find a completely new tattoo,” said the anthropologist Albert Zink, head of the Institute for Mummies and the Iceman at the European Research Academy in Italy, and an author on the paper.
The finding may challenge prevailing theories about the tattoos' therapeutic properties. In the paper, Zink suggests that because of its location, the new chest tattoo seems to contradict the idea that the markings only alleviated lower back and joint pain. “The question is now, ‘Is this also a treatment? Or is this symbolic, or even for a religious function?'” Zink said.
Researchers already know from previous scans that Ötzi had early signs of heart disease—atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries—so perhaps, some have theorized, Ötzi's chest tattoos were connected to management of chest pain.
THE TIMES Have named Nigel Farage its ‘Briton of the Year'.
It follows a stunning performance from his UKIP party in 2014 — both at home, and in Europe.

24 party MEPs were elected to Brussels back in May — more than any other political grouping in Britain.
That was followed in October by its long anticipated Westminster breakthrough, as Douglas Carswell was elected in a by-election, having left the Conservatives.
Another domestic success followed last month, as Mark Reckless — another defector from David Cameron's backbenches — claimed a seat in Rochester and Strood.
A recent YouGov poll put support for Farage's party at 28 per cent — ten behind the Tories, and edging out Ed Miliband's Labour.
As you might imagine, the man himself is pretty happy with the newspaper's honour (which, it should be noted, isn't exactly an accolade, more of an assessment of his influence on the political scene).

I know the season's not over yet but I'm bored at work so decided to create this thread now.This season we have seen plenty of defending which can only be described as comical, so I've decided to run a poll to see which one is peoples 'favourite' comedy moment.The nominations are:1 - Rose against Arsenal (Away) in the F A Cup. To make it 2-0. Rose, as last man, gets dispossessed on the half way line, leaving Rosky to run through on goal unchallenged and us out of the F A Cup.2 - Vertonghen against Chelsea (Away) in the League. To make it 1-0. Slips, then plays a blind pass back towards goal, straight into the path of Eto, who puts it away to put Chelsea 1-0 up against the run of play.3 - Chiriches against Sunderland (Home) in the League. To make it 0-1. After receiving the ball from Lloris, passes a loose ball across the pitch straight to Catteromle who puts it into an empty net.4 - Kaboul against Liverpool (Away) in the League. To make it 1-0. An own goal in the first couple of minutes after a cross slightly deflects off of Vertonghen and comes off his heal.5 - Naughton against Southampton (Home) in the League. To make it 0-1. Miss-judges a long ball from the keeper which bounces over his head and puts Rodriguez clean through.6 - Naughton against Southampton (Home) in the League. To make it 0-2. Miss-controls a simple ball as last man leaving Lambert to slide an easy ball to Lallana to finish.7 - Walker against Manchester United (Home) in the League. To make it 0-1. United over-hit the cross but Walker controls the ball perfectly for Rooney to smash in the volley.8 - Walker against Chelsea (Away) in the League. To make it 4-0. Lloris kicks the ball up-field when being closed down by Ba. Walker, unchallenged on the half way line, heads the ball straight back to Ba, who puts it away.9 - Dawson against Liverpool (Away) in the League. To make it 2-0. After only being on the field for seconds he volleys a ball, under no pressure, behind Kaboul who isn't able to get anything meaningful on it before Suarez nips in to run in on goal and score.10 - Lloris against Manchester City (Away) in the League. To make it 1-0. inside the opening 15 seconds he kicks the ball along the floor to a City player who's shot is well saved but only parried out to Navas who produces a sensational finish to put City on their way to a 6-0 mauling.
One month. Two speedrunners. 21 Final Fantasy games.

The summer break is finally over! Formula E is back this week with a bang, with the first collective preseason test taking place at Donington Park UK.
Here's a quickfire guide to the week ahead.
What is Formula E collective preseason testing?
The sport has 10 teams, nine of whom have built their own powertrains (the new Techeetah outfit has purchased one from Renault). The constructors have all been allocated 15 days of private track testing to make sure their innards are all working properly. Collective preseason testing brings all the teams together to complete their running and try out new drivers in full view of their competitors, the media and the public.
Other events take place as well as track running. Later today, Mahindra Racing will be unveiling their new, fan-designed livery (8pm UK-time). Tomorrow morning, Venturi will be confirming a key new partner (9am Uk-time).
When is Formula E collective preseason testing?
This year there are two three-day sessions. The first begins this week, from Tuesday to Thursday this week (23 to 25 August).
Where is Formula E collective preseason testing?
Donington Park, home of the sport's technical HQ.
What time are the sessions on?
This is still to be confirmed. Last year, teams enjoyed six hours of running per day, split into morning and afternoon sessions (either 1200-1300 and 1400-1900, or 0900-1200 and 1400-1700). We'll update this when we know more.
Are the sessions open to the public?
Some of them are. The opening day of testing is limited to teams and media. Wednesday and Thursday are open to the public, with tickets available via registration at the Formula E website.
Which teams are taking part in the test?
All 10 teams signed up for season three: Renault e.dams, ABT Schaeffler Audi Sport, DS Virgin Racing, Dragon Racing, Mahindra Racing, Venturi, NextEV, MS Amlin Andretti, Techeetah (which bought out Team Aguri) and the much-anticipated new Jaguar Racing.
Who will be driving for the teams?
Most of the Formula E teams will be using their season three racing drivers, to give them as much time behind the wheel as possible before Hong Kong. Jaguar Racing will apparently be testing with Adam Carroll, who is earmarked for a race seat. GP2 drivers Mitch Evans and Alex Lynn and WEC's Harry Tincknell are said to be battling over the second seat so they'll be looking to impress.
The other question mark hovers over Mahindra Racing, where the second seat alongside Nick Heidfeld is still to be confirmed.
How can I follow testing?
If you're not planning on actually coming along to the track, your best bet is to follow the live timing screens throughout the day, which can usually be accessed via the Formula E site. We haven't heard of any plans to stream any live footage.
Of course, you can also follow Current E; our trackside team will provide updates here throughout the sessions, as well as live on Twitter (@Current_E for the main account; I'll be blasting out info too at my account, @LukeSmithF1).
Our photographic partner Spacesuit Media will also be there, so you could do worse than to follow their Twitter handles too: Shiv Gohil (@shivraj_photos), Dan Bathie (@danbathie), Nat Twiss (@nattwiss) and Lou Johnson (@LouJohnsonPhoto), as well as their main account (@Spacesuit_Media).

Summary: A new study sheds light on the neural mechanism behind why some people with autism are unable to make eye contact with others.
Source: Mass General.
Imaging studies reveal overactivation of subcortical brain structures in response to direct gaze.
Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often find it difficult to look others in the eyes. This avoidance has typically been interpreted as a sign of social and personal indifference, but reports from people with autism suggests otherwise. Many say that looking others in the eye is uncomfortable or stressful for them – some will even say that “it burns” – all of which points to a neurological cause. Now, a team of investigators based at the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital has shed light on the brain mechanisms involved in this behavior. They reported their findings in a Scientific Reports paper published online this month.
“The findings demonstrate that, contrary to what has been thought, the apparent lack of interpersonal interest among people with autism is not due to a lack of concern,” says Nouchine Hadjikhani, MD, PhD, director of neurolimbic research in the Martinos Center and corresponding author of the new study. “Rather, our results show that this behavior is a way to decrease an unpleasant excessive arousal stemming from overactivation in a particular part of the brain.”
The key to this research lies in the brain's subcortical system, which is responsible for the natural orientation toward faces seen in newborns and is important later for emotion perception. The subcortical system can be specifically activated by eye contact, and previous work by Hadjikhani and colleagues revealed that, among those with autism, it was oversensitive to effects elicited by direct gaze and emotional expression. In the present study, she took that observation further, asking what happens when those with autism are compelled to look in the eyes of faces conveying different emotions.
Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), Hadjikhani and colleagues measured differences in activation within the face-processing components of the subcortical system in people with autism and in control participants as they viewed faces either freely or when constrained to viewing the eye-region. While activation of these structures was similar for both groups exhibited during free viewing, overactivation was observed in participants with autism when concentrating on the eye-region. This was especially true with fearful faces, though similar effects were observed when viewing happy, angry and neutral faces.
The findings of the study support the hypothesis of an imbalance between the brain's excitatory and inhibitory signaling networks in autism – excitatory refers to neurotransmitters that stimulate the brain, while inhibitory refers to those that calm it and provide equilibrium. Such an imbalance, likely the result of diverse genetic and environmental causes, can strengthen excitatory signaling in the subcortical circuitry involved in face perception. This in turn can result in an abnormal reaction to eye contact, an aversion to direct gaze and consequently abnormal development of the social brain.
In revealing the underlying reasons for eye-avoidance, the study also suggests more effective ways of engaging individuals with autism. “The findings indicate that forcing children with autism to look into someone's eyes in behavioral therapy may create a lot of anxiety for them,” says Hadjikhani, an associate professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School. “An approach involving slow habituation to eye contact may help them overcome this overreaction and be able to handle eye contact in the long run, thereby avoiding the cascading effects that this eye-avoidance has on the development of the social brain.”
The researchers are already planning to follow up the research. Hadjikhani is now seeking funding for a study that will use magnetoencephalography (MEG) together with eye-tracking and other behavioral tests to probe more deeply the relationship between the subcortical system and eye contact avoidance in autism.

Abstract
Look me in the eyes: constraining gaze in the eye-region provokes abnormally high subcortical activation in autism
Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) seem to have difficulties looking others in the eyes, but the substrate for this behavior is not well understood. The subcortical pathway, which consists of superior colliculus, pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus, and amygdala, enables rapid and automatic face processing. A specific component of this pathway – i.e., the amygdala – has been shown to be abnormally activated in paradigms where individuals had to specifically attend to the eye-region; however, a direct examination of the effect of manipulating the gaze to the eye-regions on all the components of the subcortical system altogether has never been performed. The subcortical system is particularly important as it shapes the functional specialization of the face-processing cortex during development. Using functional MRI, we investigated the effect of constraining gaze in the eye-region during dynamic emotional face perception in groups of participants with ASD and typical controls. We computed differences in activation in the subcortical face processing system (superior colliculus, pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus and amygdala) for the same stimuli seen freely or with the gaze constrained in the eye-region. Our results show that when constrained to look in the eyes, individuals with ASD show abnormally high activation in the subcortical system, which may be at the basis of their eye avoidance in daily life.

Burdwan: Bharatiya Janata Party chief Amit Shah on Tuesday attacked West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, alleging she was focused on trying to save her chitfund scam ‘tainted' leaders instead of governing the state and was jeopardising national security for vote bank politics.
Kicking off BJP's membership drive in West Bengal, he warned Mamata that she cannot stop his party's ‘vijay rath' (victory march) in the state by “unleashing atrocities" on its workers and claimed that public support for his party “will drown the Trinamool Congress in the waters of Ganga".
Shah said Mamata's rule was worse than Communists'. He accused her of giving priority to vote-bank politics instead of national security and that her government did not investigate the Burdwan blast case properly and also did not do anything to save public money from going into the hands of chit fund accused.
Addressing a public rally in Burdwan, Shah said his party was ready to wage a struggle in the state.
The BJP chief said the NDA government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi wanted to do a lot for Bengal, “but Mamata Banerjee is not giving us an opportunity to do so".
“Mamata Banerjee's focus is not on development of Bengal, but on saving her people in the chit fund scam...For votebank politics Bengal government did not properly investigate Burdwan blast and objected to an NIA probe...TMC government has given priority to vote bank politics over national security," he said addressing a rally in Burdwan.
Exhorting people of Bengal to usher in a “privartan" (change), Shah said, “I am constrained to say that Mamata has given a regime that is iller than even communists. Are you ready for a Parivartan..." “While Narendra Modi has taken the country forward on the path of development, Trinamool Congress is taking the state backwards...." he said, adding that a number of industries have shut in Bengal in recent times ushering in unemployment.
Shah said, “I want to tell Mamata that in a democracy she cannot ensure victory by unleashing atrocities on BJP workers. You cannot stop BJP's ‘Vijay Rath' in Bengal with atrocities as the people of Bengal are with BJP now."
“We are ready for the path of struggle. The seas of public support in favour of BJP will drown Trinamool Congress in the waters of Ganga and no one will be able to find it."
He said Mamata's Trinamool Congress cannot bring development in Bengal, neither can it do good of the people or provide jobs to the youth.
“Give BJP an opportunity to ensure Bengal's development," he said, appealing to the people to support Modi's agenda of development. Shah today launched the party's campaign to expand its base in West Bengal, where BJP is trying to project itself as an alternative, under its ambitious membership drive.
MetroPCS may hand the major carriers some competition, with its new 4G LTE plan for budget-conscious consumers.
Available as a promotion, the carrier's new 4G LTE plan provides unlimited talk, texting, and 4G LTE data for $55 a month for a single line. Families can join in by paying $50 a month for second, third, and fourth lines. Though the deal is being offered as a promotion, the expiration date is open-ended.
MetroPCS President Thomas Keys told CNET that the end of the promotion will depend on the adoption rate by consumers. "We didn't want to set an artificial timeline," he explained.
Beyond the eventual expiration date, customers can hang onto the unlimited plan and $55 price tag for as long as they stick with MetroPCS.
The company claims that individual subscribers can save up to $2,200 over the course of a two-year contract when compared with rival carriers. Keys also told CNET that the unlimited plan "has no strings."
To take advantage of the high-speed service, MetroPCS subscribers can pick up an LG Motion 4G phone for $149. Equipped with Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich, the new LG Motion offers a 3.5-inch touchscreen, a 1.2GHz dual-core processor, a 5-megapixel camera, and a 1,080-pixel HD video recorder.
To kick off the launch of the new phone and plan, MetroPCS is offering consumers a rebate on the second of any two 4G LTE smartphones purchased. The rebate offer is good for the LG Motion 4G as well as other 4G smartphones offered by the carrier.
Consumers eyeing the new plan or the new phone can visit a MetroPCS store or hop onto the company's Web site later this week.
The list of discontinued Olympic events throws up some archaic delights
WENLOCK, one of the cyclopean mascots of the London Olympics, takes his name from a town in Shropshire that is the inspiration for the modern games. It was after visiting Much Wenlock, where he observed the annual games run by the Wenlock Olympian Society, that Pierre de Coubertin pursued the idea of reviving the ancient Greek Olympics. The games that followed in Athens in 1896 had just nine sports, covering 43 events, and all the competitors were men. Fast-forward 116 years and London is showing 26 sports comprising 302 events for both men and women. Over the years the roll-call of disciplines has changed substantially, and discontinued men's events since 1896 outnumber men's events at the 2012 games by 194 to 163. Below we show a selection of events that have, unsurprisingly, failed to survive the test of time. Live-pigeon shooting, which made its one appearance in the 1900 games, might have been welcomed by some of London's residents, however.

Editors Note: It hasn't been very long since we published this story but even in the handful of intervening months the bourbon boom has continued and bottles with any mild attachment to Pappy Van Winkle have all but vanished from the shelves. If you can find a bottle of Weller 12 (or even the relatively more abundant Antique) for less than $30, best buy it quickly.
At night, when bourbon connoisseurs go to bed, many dream of Pappy Van Winkle, a line of three exquisite bourbons (15, 20 and 23 years old, all of them colloquially referred to as “Pappy”) distilled and bottled by the Sazerac Company at the Buffalo Trace Distillery. Much of Pappy's legend comes from its high demand: when it's released, liquor stores dust off month-long waiting lists to decide who gets a bottle. But that demand is a product of quality, which many experts insist is a cut above all other bourbons. They laud its memorable nose, smooth taste and long lasting finish. Whether or not Pappy is better than other bourbons, the demand drives an incredible secondary market, where bottles of Pappy 20 and 23 often sell for ten times their retail value. In other words, unless you have a cousin in the liquor business, that's the price you're going to pay.
Or not. At the end of last year, Bourbonr Blog made headlines in the liquor community by posting a recipe for “Poor Man's Pappy“, a 3:2 mixture of W.L. Weller 12 and Old Weller Antique. It yields a 100.2-proof bourbon blend that, while not exactly Pappy 15, “comes close”. Experts called bullshit. How could two sub-$30 bourbons emulate one of the most lauded spirits in the world? The justification lies in history.
In the early 1900s, a young man named Julian “Pappy” Van Winkle and his friend, Alex Farnsley, bought W.L. Weller & Sons, a liquor wholesaler where they had worked as salesmen. They also bought the A. Ph. Stitzel Distillery, which made bourbon for Weller, and merged the two companies to create the Stitzel-Weller distillery. At the age of 91, Pappy died, leaving his son, Julian Van Winkle Jr., in charge.
In 1972, stockholders forced Julian Jr. to sell the distillery and its labels. The Van Winkle family only managed to keep one, a pre-prohibition label called Old Rip Van Winkle. Although the Van Winkle's no longer owned the Stitzel-Weller distillery, they continued to use the exquisite Stitzel-Weller stock in their mash bill for the Pappy. But in 1991, the Van Winkles faced a new problem: the Stitzel-Weller distillery stopped producing. For a while, the Van Winkles got by on old stock, but with supply running low, and demand increasing yearly, Julian III (Julian Jr.'s son) made the decision to team up with Buffalo Trace, and start using BT's wheated mash bill.
Pappy Glass Remember that kid in college that filled up empty Grey Goose bottles with Aristocat? Well, he grew up. Now he's filling old Pappy bottles with Jim Beam Black. Due to Pappy's scarcity, a secondary market for old bottles has developed on Ebay, where sellers have listed empty 20-year-old bottles for up to $120. That one went unbought, though an empty bottle of 23-year-old with two days and eighteen hours left on the listing currently has a bid of $25. Learn More: Here
As of the fall of 2011, the Pappy 15 stopped using Stitzell-Weller stock in their mash bill and started using 100 percent Buffalo Trace stock. When asked about the use of Stitzel-Weller juice in the 23-year-old during a telephone interview for an August 31, 2013 episode of the WhiskyCast podcast, Preston Van Winkle, Pappy's great-grandson, said, “This might be the last year…I'd have to look at the barrel model to be 100 percent sure. There aren't too many bottles of anything produced at Stitzel-Weller left on this Earth.”
You know what else uses Buffalo Trace's wheated mash bill? W.L. Weller whiskies. Which is to say that Pappy and Weller use the same stock. Sure, Van Winkle gets first pick of the casks, and cask selection and storage location play a large role in determining a whiskey's final characteristics, but if you can't find Pappy, or can't afford it, W.L. might be the next best thing.
So there you go. That's the justification for Poor Man's Pappy. But does the recipe hold up? With $50, a postal scale and a mason jar, we decided to find out for ourselves.
The first whiskey in the recipe is W.L. Weller 12-Year-Old ($26), a 45 percent ABV wheated bourbon distilled by W.L. Weller & Sons in Frankfort, Kentucky. Unlike rye bourbons, which get a touch of rye for a spicy, herbaceous flavor, wheated bourbons have a sweeter taste; think of the difference between rye and wheat breads. Both the sweetness and the wheatiness are on full display in this whiskey, which was tough to find even before Bourbonr‘s article, and is now near impossible. On the nose, there's caramel with a vanilla punch, as well as breakfast cereal with marshmallows a la Lucky Charms. But it's the taste that makes this whiskey special. It enters the mouth with a dry, toasty burn that turns to wheat sweetness and leaves notes of honey and caramel in the mouth long after the swallow.
The second whiskey in the recipe is the Old Weller Antique ($20), another wheated bourbon that clocks in at powerful 53.5 percent ABV. Although it has no age statement, it's aged for around seven years. Old Weller is a reddish amber color. The nose is also different than W.L.: whereas 12 is mellow and complex, the Antique has a simple vanilla scent, with a trace of nutmeg, but any more complexity gets muted by the alcohol. Surprisingly, despite the proof, it goes down smooth, stinging the tongue but also imparting a creamy mouthfeel. While it might lack the 12's complexity, it's another solid buy, and one of the best — if not the best — bourbons available for $20.
According to the recipe, one needs to marry the two whiskies for at least two weeks, which allows the 12 to mellow the Antique, and the Antique to impart flavor on the 12. For comparison, we tried the bourbon directly after the mix, and found that most of the flavor was masked by alcohol heat. But after two weeks of marrying, the 12 tempers the Antique's fiery alcohol, letting more scents come through. There's caramel and soft oak, and maybe a bit of maple syrup. In the mouth, the 12 works its magic again, taming the alcohol so that holding the whiskey on one's tongue doesn't make the eyes water. The sweetness, a function of the wheat in both individual bourbons, plays a large role, and even though the finish is a bit thin, each sip leaves us wanting another. The Poor Man's Pappy is a great, sweet bourbon, much better than either of its component ingredients.
“But is it Pappy? Not quite. GP co-founder Ben Bowers offered his tasting notes on the 15 year expression in comparison to our home-made version.
“The smell was memorable — a lot of wood and dark coffee. Then something bitter (maybe char?) followed by usual bourbon suspects like vanilla with sometime to air out. Texture was a calling card too: noticeably thick and velvety. The best trick of all was muting the punch of its 107 proof with a caramel sweetness that eventually changed back to spice and heat. It was very well-balanced and damn tasty, but not earth-shattering.”
In comparing the real deal to our Bourbonstein, it's clear that our mix nails the 15 year's candy-store character, though it lacks much of the rich texture and counterweight of the sharper, darker Pappy. So Pappy is the better alcohol — but is it worth $1,000? Maybe, for some. We're of the opinion that when you buy Pappy, you're not just buying the alcohol: you're buying the hype. You're buying the story. With demand as high as it is, if you get a bottle, it means that you went through great lengths to acquire it. Just like the elusive Heady Topper, which we covered back in November, some things are made better because of the effort required to obtain them.
Buy the Pappy, if you want, but as we sit here, swirling our delicious Poor Man's, it also occurs to us that a story about making your own blend because you refused to pay $1,000 might be as good as one about spending the dough. Until the hype dies down a bit, we're spending our money on other things.
The signature moment of Bob Bradley's tenure as U.S. men's national team coach came during the first half of the ill-fated Round of 16 match against Ghana at the 2010 World Cup. Ghana was up 1–0 thanks to a fifth-minute turnover by Ricardo Clark, followed immediately by a Kevin-Prince Boateng goal. It was the most notable mistake of the worst game of Clark's international career — a 34-game reign of terror that offers many candidates to choose from.
In the 31st minute, Bradley subbed Clark off for the steadier Maurice Edu. Any non-injury-related substitution before about the 60th minute is unusual, and anything before halftime smacks of desperation. But for as great a mistake as starting Clark was, Bradley recognized and fixed it. At halftime, he removed Robbie Findley for Benny Feilhaber — an improvement in that I can recall Feilhaber actually touching and controlling the ball in an American uniform.
Those moves nearly sent his team through — a resurgent U.S. equalized in the second half before ultimately losing in extra time — but they were necessary only because Bradley had made mistakes that left his team down a goal and two subs by halftime in the first place. That was the frustrating part of Bradley's largely successful five-year tenure: He met expectations, but always left American fans wanting more. And after Bradley's men blew a 2–0 lead to Mexico in the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup final, they got it.
Jürgen Klinsmann had it all — a superstar playing pedigree, a managerial CV that included stops at the German national team and Bayern Munich, credibility with top European clubs, and most of all, ambition. Since returning to the national soccer stage in 1990, the U.S. had been treading water, alternating World Cup knockout-stage appearances with group-stage defeats, and trading Gold Cup titles with Mexico (save for a Canada win in 2000).
Klinsmann promised to break out of that rut. He promised to revamp a parochial and ineffective youth-development system and, after years of losing out on the likes of Neven Subotic and Giuseppe Rossi, convince the best U.S.-eligible players to play for the U.S. Through these means he would hasten the coming of that messianic world-class American goalscorer that Landon Donovan, Freddy Adu, Jozy Altidore, and Juan Agudelo all have fallen short of becoming — what Deadspin's Kevin Draper described as the “Tennessee-raised future-Messi.”
And most of all, Klinsmann promised soccer's greatest snake oil: a proactive, technical approach, so-called “beautiful soccer.”
Soccer is perhaps uniquely obsessed with style points, the idea that a hard-fought 1–0 win, with the lone goal being scored on the counterattack, is somehow less virtuous than slick passing through the midfield. (It's not the only reason why José Mourinho is the bad guy in his rivalry with Pep Guardiola, but it's one of them.) From Klinsmann and the American soccer community, it was a pointed criticism of Bradley, whose biggest win, the 2009 Confederations Cup semifinal victory over Spain, was an Alamo-style rearguard action, and whose teams could not crack open lesser, defensive-minded CONCACAF opponents at will.
Klinsmann was the perfect figurehead for what the U.S. Soccer establishment viewed as a watershed moment, an opportunity to break a run of three straight pragmatic American coaches who'd come up through the college and American professional ranks and find a man who could do the hard parts of the job — not just replace Clark and Findley at the right time, but not start them in the first place, and develop better players to begin with.
But for all his ambition and (largely correct) big ideas about the direction of American soccer, Klinsmann, who also became U.S. Soccer's technical director in 2013, is not only not the guy who would've benched Clark and Findley, he probably never would have subbed them out.
Klinsmann has vacillated between talking big about the next generation of young American talent — going so far as to play DeAndre Yedlin, Julian Green, and John Brooks in the 2014 World Cup — and building around Clint Dempsey and the dreadlocked midfield gerontocracy of Jermaine Jones and Kyle Beckerman into their mid-30s. Not taking Donovan to that World Cup is garden-variety managerial pettiness in the soccer world, but Klinsmann — who used his criticism of MLS lifers like a cudgel against Donovan — started MLS lifer Brad Davis against Germany and [watches Chris Wondolowski's stoppage-time sitter against Belgium fly over the bar in a recurring national nightmare].
At the 2014 World Cup, Klinsmann played Dempsey and Michael Bradley higher up the pitch to compensate for an injury to Altidore, and he moved Geoff Cameron and Fabian Johnson all around midfield and the backline at will — occasionally playing all four of his best outfield players out of position at the same time.
Most recently, in the 4–0 loss to Costa Rica on Tuesday, Klinsmann started Matt Besler at left back. As a central defender, Besler is a solid positional defender, one of the pleasant surprises of Klinsmann's tenure, but as a fullback he's slow and frequently looks lost, and provides no attacking threat whatsoever. Apart from Altidore and the keepers, nobody's got a fixed position under Klinsmann, and a team that seeks to be versatile and adaptable frequently looks like it's got no plan at all.
Even his successes can look unintentional. Under Klinsmann, the U.S. avenged two straight World Cup losses to Ghana, thanks to two goals against the run of play separated by more than 80 minutes of Ghanaian domination. They advanced from the group because a disorganized Portugal no-showed against Germany and sent the Americans through on goal difference. They waltzed to the Gold Cup title and first place in CONCACAF's World Cup qualifiers in 2013 over the most troubled Mexico team ever, and they made the semifinal of the Copa America Centenario when Brazil joga bonito'd its way to a loss in the group-stage finale against Peru, which sent the whole draw into utter chaos.
As for that American Messi: Green has yet to make his Bundesliga debut for Bayern Munich, and fellow German American wunderkind Gedion Zelalem has made a total of four appearances for Arsenal's first team (none of them in the Premier League), and zero for the U.S. senior national team. Maybe Borussia Dortmund winger Christian Pulisic is that guy, but we've had that lifeline yanked away too many times to trust him completely.
The U.S. is coming off its worst Gold Cup finish since 2000, has failed to qualify for two straight Olympics and two straight Confederations Cups, and is still looking for its first point in the Hex, having had its myth of invincibility against Mexico at MAPFRE Stadium in Columbus breached forever along the way. If Klinsmann has brought any progress to American soccer, none of it has shown up with the senior national team.
Is bringing back Bruce Arena, the “steady-handed American” type that Klinsmann was supposed to replace, the answer? Or can Klinsmann right the ship and get the U.S. to the World Cup in 2018? I don't know. But someone's got to start coaching this team.
Internet campaign about satanic cult at Hampstead school was ‘fantasy' says judge
An internet campaign about a satanic cult operating at a Hampstead school was a 'fantasy' High Court judge Mrs Justice Pauffley ruled today Notice: PA Wire/Press Association Images
An “evil” internet campaign about a satanic cult operating at a Hampstead school was a “fantasy” and “nothing other than utter nonsense,” a High Court judge ruled today.

High Court judge Mrs Justice Pauffley said the children's mother Ella Draper (pictured) had collaborated with her boyfriend Abraham Christie to torture them High Court judge Mrs Justice Pauffley said the children's mother Ella Draper (pictured) had collaborated with her boyfriend Abraham Christie to torture them
Two young children, now in care, were forced to take part in the “baseless” campaign and had their innocence stolen by their mother, Ella Draper, and her partner, Abraham Christie, top Family Division judge Mrs Justice Pauffley ruled.
She was giving a fact finding judgment in care proceedings brought by the London Borough of Barnet involving two children, aged nine and eight, who were said to be at the centre of the cult's abuse.
The judge said that in September last year “lurid allegations of the most serious kind” were drawn to the attention of the Metropolitan Police suggesting the children were part of a large group of children abused by the satanic cult.
The children's father, Ricky Dearman, was said to be the leader of the cult and teachers at Christ Church Primary School in Hampstead and a priest at the adjacent church were said to be members.
Both children – who can only be identified as P and Q – are now in care.
The judge said the children had been forced to lie about their alleged abuse by the “cult” by their mother and Mr Christie.
The children themselves had been repeatedly named on the internet with their pictures and film clips.
But the judge said: “My sense was that the children, for the most part, were in the realms of fantasy.”
Referring to the internet claims, she said: “The assertions were that babies had been abused tortured and then sacrificed.
“Their throats were slit, blood was drunk and cult members would then dance wearing babies' skulls – sometimes with blood and hair still attached – on their bodies.”
She added: “Both P and Q have suffered significantly. Their innocence was invaded. Their minds were scrambled. Their grip on reality was imperilled.
“They were introduced to sexual practices of which they had no real understanding at a time when they should have been shielded from such things.”
But after a lengthy private hearing, when the children themselves were interviewed and examined, the judge declared: “I am able to state with complete conviction that none of the allegations are true.
“I am entirely certain that everything Ms Draper, her partner Abraham Christie and the children said about those matters was fabricated.
“The claims are baseless. Those who have sought to perpetrate them are evil and or foolish.”
She said filmed interviews of the children had been uploaded onto the internet with more than four million people worldwide viewing online material about the case.
She added: “It is inevitable that a large proportion of those have a sexual interest in children.
“Any rational adult who uploads film clips to YouTube featuring children speaking about sexual activity must be assumed to realise that fact.”
She said the children had been forced by their mother and Mr Christie “to provide concocted accounts of horrific events”.
She said: “The stories came about as the result of relentless emotional and psychological pressure as well as significant physical abuse.
“Torture is a strong word but it is the most accurate way to describe what was done to the children by Mr Christie in collaboration with Ms Draper.
“The children were made to take part in filmed mobile phone recordings in which they relayed a series of fabricated satanic practices.”
She said the mother took no part in the court proceedings and had now disappeared.
She had not been seen since early February with rumours that she had fled abroad.
Mr Christie took no part in court proceedings either. But the judge found he had physically abused the children.
She said the children's parents met in 2003 and there was an “acrimonious” split up three years later.
Ms Draper then accused the father, Mr Dearman, of the most serious kinds of sexual abuse, with “grotesque” assertions of repeated interference with them since they were babies.
But the judge completely cleared Mr Dearman of any abuse.
She said she had no doubt but that the physical injuries described by the children as having been inflicted by Mr Christie were indeed caused by him.
She rejected as “baseless” the mother's suggestion that instead their father was responsible.
She continued: “The children were made to absorb and repeat on film, and in interview, grotesque claims against so many blameless people including the father whom they love.”
She added: “All of the material promulgated by Ms Draper now published on the internet is nothing other than utter nonsense.
“The long term emotional and psychological harm of what was done to the children is incalculable. The impact of the internet campaign is likely to have the most devastating consequences for P and Q.”
She said the internet campaign has continued and as fast as online material was taken down it appeared on other websites.
“All the signs are that those responsible for posting material derive a great deal of personal satisfaction from attracting interest to their spiteful work from many thousands of people,” she added.
“It's akin to the sensation, I imagine, of a Facebook user receiving an indication that some posting or other has been ‘liked'.”
She added: “The individuals who have watched online film clips, read online articles and believed in the allegations would do well to reflect that ‘things may not be what they seem', and that it is all too easy to be duped on the basis of partial information.
“There are many campaigning people, sadly, who derive satisfaction from spreading their own poisonous version of history irrespective of whether it is true or not.”
Spend a weekend gambling in Vegas, and losing money is part of the territory; for some, it's even part of the thrill. But in this tourist-heavy town, hitting the slots and tables aren't the only risky ways Vegas can separate visitors from their cash. Over the years, conniving criminals have crafted endless ways to scam unsuspecting travelers out of their hard-earned dough. From the oldest tricks in the book to the latest cons, here's a look at some of the biggest scams, schemes and tricks on the Strip to watch out for:
Follow Andrea Domanick on Twitter at @AndreaDomanick and fan her on Facebook at Facebook.com/AndreaDomanick.
Three card monte Also known as the shell game, this scheme sounds like a relic of Old Vegas, but it's alive and kicking on the under-patrolled bridges and sidewalk of the Strip (there are even YouTube videos). On a makeshift table, “dealers” ask players to bet on a card that will be shuffled with two others. If you correctly pick out your card after the shuffle, you double your money. Sounds simple — except that during the shuffle, the dealer uses sleight of hand to replace your card altogether — making it impossible to win. If you're looking to gamble, stick to the casinos.
Caught with your pants down Watch out, ladies: One of the latest schemes sweeping casinos happens where you'd least expect — right in a bathroom stall. Crews of thieves will rush women's bathrooms, reach over the doors of occupied stalls and grab purses off the door hooks. "By the time you get off the toilet and make yourself decent to run after them, they're gone," says Officer Jose Hernandez with Metro's Public Information Office.
Date-n-ditch Picture this: You meet an attractive stranger at a bar or club, and you hit it off. He or she claims to have won big at the tables and offers to take you out to an expensive dinner to celebrate. Too good to be true? It usually is: When that charming stranger gets up to use the bathroom at the end of the meal, they don't plan on coming back — leaving you to foot the exorbitant bill.
John D'oh! One of the most common scams Hernandez and his colleagues see involves a prostitute conning her john. The client will bring the woman in question up to his room, where she'll suggest he “go freshen up.” While the john is in the bathroom, the prostitute is cleaning out his pockets, wallets and room, taking whatever she can carry before he returns. "For the prostitute, there's never an intent to exchange money for sex. Ninety-nine percent of the time, it's just to steal from the john,” Hernandez says. His advice? The obvious. "Don't bring strangers to your room.”
Bucket thieves This scheme has evolved with gaming technology over the years, but the ploy remains the same: preying on a gambler's inattentiveness. “Bucket thieves,” as Hernandez calls them, work in teams: One drops some money on the ground and asks a player if it's theirs. While the player is distracted, a second thief snatches the bucket of coins or tokens they've been feeding into the slot machine and runs. On coinless machines, thieves watch for machines with high credits, press the “cash out” button and run off with the redemption ticket — and perhaps a purse or wallet — while the player is distracted. "Keep your eyes on your machine, and never let yourself be completely distracted,” Hernandez says.
Taxi long-hauling This summer, the Nevada Taxicab Authority cracked down on drivers for long-hauling, the illegal practice of taking cab riders on circuitous routes to reap a higher fare. Most long-hauling occurs on routes going from McCarran International Airport to the Strip; the Taxicab Authority received numerous complaints from customers who found that their fare upon returning to the airport was $5 to $20 less than what they had been charged on the way there. While the Taxicab Authority set up a checkpoint at McCarran in June to discourage long-hauling, the best way to avoid getting cheated is to arrive knowing what to expect: refer to a chart on the Taxicab Authority's website to calculate estimated fares for common taxi trips.
Realtors sometimes think that the optimal solution is to convince their clients to accept the first offer made on their house. The marginal increase in the realtor's fee is tiny if the sellers wait to get a small increase in the selling price (a 3% commission on the extra $2000 that the sellers are holding out for is a measly $60. The realtor may invest more than $60 to better market the house while waiting for a slightly better offer to arrive. See the video from the Freakonomics documentary below for more on this subject.
We ended up using the optimal Secretary Problem policy to sell our house. It wasn't our plan on the offset, but it's what happened. An optimal policy to the Secretary Problem maximizes the probability of ending up with the best offer. The idea is to first estimate the number of offers you would expect to receive, at least in the timeframe that you have to sell a house; let's call this n. Then you observe and reject the first n/e offers. After that, you accept the first offer that is the best you've seen so far. I thought n would be small (2-3), but there was a lot of traffic in our house and I had to increase my estimate of n to maybe 6.
The first person to look at our house made us an offer almost immediately. It was a good offer, but the buyer wanted to close a month earlier than we were ready, which would lead to some substantial costs on our end (not counting the stress of having to make immediate moving plans and find temporary housing). The net offer was good, but not good enough for us to sell our house. We let it go. At the time, this seemed like our n/e, which meant that we should accept the next offer that was better than our first one.
We had a second offer on our house that eventually worked its way up to match the net value of the first offer. It was too low, so we rejected it (and almost gave our realtor a heart attack in the process). We then had a third offer on the house that was not worth entertaining. Later that day, we received our fourth offer. After some negotiation, it became our best so far, and we accepted it.
It's not often that I get to personally collect empirical evidence to validate an OR model. I'd like to say that it was fun, but it was mostly a stressful experience. I'm glad it worked out in the end. During the process, it was helpful to know that math backed us up on our offer rejections. We ended up with that extra $2000 (less $120 for both realtors).
Comment: When I say we “rejected” offers, I mean that we counter-offered with what we were willing to settle for and were turned down. Accepting/rejecting offers is a little more complicated when selling a house as compared to the secretary problem, where there is no negotiation.
Incidentally, the Wall Street Journal recommends using the Secretary Problem for finding a rental [Link].

Henry Knowles Beecher (February 4, 1904[1] – July 25, 1976[2]) was a pioneering American anesthesiologist, medical ethicist, and investigator of the placebo effect at Harvard Medical School.
Beecher's influential 1966 article on unethical medical experimentation in the New England Journal of Medicine — "Ethics and Clinical Research" — was instrumental in the implementation of federal rules on human experimentation and informed consent.[3] A 1999 biography—written by Vincent J. Kopp, M.D. of UNC Chapel Hill and published in an American Society of Anesthesiologists newsletter—describes Beecher as an influential figure in the development of medical ethics and research techniques, though he has not been without controversy.[4] The prestigious Beecher Prize, named in honor of Henry K. Beecher, is awarded annually by Harvard Medical School to a medical student who has produced exceptional work in the field of medical ethics. The Henry K. Beecher Award by The Hastings Center was established in 1976 in honour of the famous anesthesiologist, who was also its first recipient.
Biography [ edit ]
Youth [ edit ]
Born as Harry Unangst in Peck, Kansas in 1904, he changed his surname to Beecher in his 20s. This change was said to be for the name recognition of influential 19th-century Beechers—preacher Henry Ward Beecher and author Harriet Beecher Stowe.[4] He was, in fact, unrelated to the Beecher family.[5]
Education [ edit ]
Beecher received a BA degree in 1926 and an MA degree in physical chemistry in 1927, both from the University of Kansas. While it had been his goal to earn a Ph.D. in chemistry at the Sorbonne, Henry was "persuaded" to study medicine instead.[4] Entering the Harvard Medical School in 1928, Beecher received research fellowships in 1929, 1930 and 1931. Beecher graduated cum laude in 1932. Two of his articles published in the Journal of Applied Physiology in 1933 earned Warren Triennial Prizes. These two articles and a study in Beecher's last year of college caught the attention of Harvard Professor of Surgery, Edward Churchill, M.D., who became his professional mentor. Post-college, he trained for two years under Churchill at Massachusetts General Hospital. Henry traveled to Denmark in 1935 to work in the physiology laboratory of Nobel Laureate August Krogh.[4]
Career [ edit ]
Returning to America in 1936, Beecher was hired as Anaesthetist-in-Chief at MGH and Instructor in Anaesthesia at Harvard Medical School by Dr. Churchill. Henry became an Associate Professor in 1939 and the Henry Isaiah Dorr Professor of Anaesthesia Research in 1941—the first endowed chair in anesthesiology in America.[4]
During World War II, Beecher served in the U.S. Army with Dr. Churchill in North Africa and Italy. His experiences during the war in clinical pharmacology would inspire him to investigate placebo-like phenomena.[4]
Work in medical ethics
As professor of anesthesiology at Harvard Medical School, Beecher published a 1966 article that drew attention to 22 examples of unethical clinical research that had risked patients' lives.[6] Though heralded for the position of this article, he was severely criticized by the medical establishment for what was felt as an unfair generalization from a few select cases.[4] However, this article and the subsequent Congressional investigation laid the foundation for current guidelines on informed consent and human experimentation.
U.S. Army interrogation drugs [ edit ]
In July 2007 the public German TV-channel SWR claimed that Beecher was involved as scientific expert with CIA studies on human drug experiments in the 1950s and may have contributed with his work in the United States and in secret CIA-prisons in Western-Germany to the KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation document of 1963.[7][need quotation to verify]
According to these recent reports, and also according to US-historian Alfred W. McCoy, Dr. Beecher was scientifically responsible for human experiments with drugs (e.g. mescaline) conducted by the CIA in post-war Germany. They took place in a secret CIA-prison located in "Villa Schuster" (later renamed to "Haus Waldhof") in Kronberg near Frankfurt, which was related to the nearby US-interrogation center Camp King (West-Germany). According to a witness, during these experiments, several interrogated individuals died. This report states that since September 1951, Beecher was frequently in Camp King and prepared human experiments, deliberated with the interrogation-staff of the CIA (called "rough boys") and recommended the test of various drugs. Several times he allegedly met with former Nazi-physician Walter Schreiber (at Camp King respectively in Villa Schuster) for an "exchange of ideas". Later Beecher described Schreiber in a report as "intelligent and cooperative."
The documents presented in the TV-documentation state that the US Army had sent reports about Nazi-experiments in concentration camps like Dachau to Dr. Beecher for evaluation. The library of Harvard Medical School still possesses a report of the US-army about these Nazi-experiments that it inherited from Dr. Beecher, a report which he evaluated.[8]
According to the German documentarian Egmont R. Koch, in January 1953, a depressive patient at the New York State Psychiatric Institute and Hospital got — upon recommendation of Dr. Beecher — a mescaline-injection at 9:53, fell in a deep coma at 11:45 and died within half an hour.[7]
According to the neuroanesthesiologist George A. Mashour:
It may appear paradoxical that Beecher, who advocated the ethical treatment of human subjects, had also engaged in potentially unethical work on hallucinogens for the government. A more compelling hypothesis, however, is that Beecher advocated ethical treatment of human subjects largely because of such work.[9]
The placebo effect [ edit ]
Henry K. Beecher's 1955 paper The Powerful Placebo was not the first to introduce the idea of the placebo effect (the term had been first used by T. C. Graves in 1920),[10][citation needed][11], but its importance was that it stressed—for the first time—the necessity of double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials. In his 1955 paper, Beecher only speaks of placebo effects on specific occasions when he is contrasting them with drug effects.[12] His 1955 paper constantly and correctly speaks of "placebo reactors" and "placebo non-reactors"; furthermore, Beecher (1952), Beecher, Keats, Mosteller, and Lasagna (1953), Beecher (1959), consistently and correctly speak of "placebo reactors" and "placebo non-reactors"; they never speak of any "placebo effect"; and, finally, in his Research and the Individual: Human Studies (1970), Beecher simply speaks of "placebos".

Commonwealth Games organisers have dropped the demolition of the Red Road flats from the Glasgow 2014 opening ceremony.
Five of the blocks were to be brought down at the start of the Games in July.
The plan proved controversial, with an online petition against the demolition gathering more than 17,000 signatures.
Glasgow 2014 said opinions being expressed about "safety and security" meant the destruction of the flats would not now feature in the opening.
Police Scotland said that because of these concerns the security director for the Games asked the chairman of the Glasgow 2014 board to reconsider the plan.
Opinions have been expressed which change the safety and security context David Grevemberg, Glasgow 2014 chief executive
The 30-storey structures were built in the mid 1960s and the original eight tower blocks housed more than 4,000 people. The demolitions will now be rescheduled.
Risk fears
Opponents had questioned the message the demolition would send and described the plans as insensitive to former residents as well as asylum seekers currently living in the sixth block.
In a statement, Games chief executive David Grevemberg said: "We made it clear from the outset the absolute priority was safety and that this event would only happen during the opening ceremony if it was safe to do so.
"Over the past few days it has become clear that opinions have been expressed which change the safety and security context.
Analysis The question now is why there wasn't further consultation with the local residents and the people of Glasgow before this plan to demolish the flats was made. The other question is why is Glasgow 2014 announcing this on the eve of a milestone tomorrow, 100 days to go until the start of the Games. This is news you'd think they would not be looking to release ahead of this milestone. When the announcement was first made some people viewed it as a little strange but perhaps a stroke of genius. Others found it completely bizarre and crass. Now that the plan's been withdrawn, the furore surrounding this issue will continue.
"Glasgow 2014, Games partners and key stakeholders, including Police Scotland and Glasgow Housing Association, are not prepared to allow what was proposed to be a positive act of commemoration to create risk for all concerned, including the communities of north east Glasgow."
'Dignity' call
Former Scottish Socialist MSP Carolyn Leckie, who launched the petition, had been due to meet with Glasgow 2014 representatives to discuss the plan on Tuesday.
The petition called for the flats to be brought down with "dignity" and not as part of a ceremony spectacle.
Reacting to the decision, Ms Leckie told BBC Scotland's Sunday Politics Scotland programme: "It's the sensible decision. Because the organisers have changed their minds, presumably there's been some consensus developed behind the scenes between all the arms involved in this.
"It's an indication that people power can be effective."
It's an indication that people power can be effective Carolyn Leckie, Petition organiser
Ms Leckie said she was not worried about the reason for the U-turn, adding: "I'm just really glad they've changed their mind, they have listened and responded.
"I think, as expressed by more than 17,000 people, that it was distasteful and disrespectful to beam the demolition to a billion people as entertainment."
The event was to have be shown live on a massive screen at the Celtic Park ceremony and to a huge TV audience.
Glasgow 2014 said the demolition was a matter for Glasgow Housing Association (GHA) and would take place as part of their ongoing regeneration programme.
However, Mr Grevemberg said Glasgow 2014 would still dedicate an element of the opening to telling the story of Glasgow's social history.

Police Scotland Det Ch Con Steve Allen, security director for the Games, said: "It became clear that the plan generated a range of strong opinions which changed the safety and security context.
All we're arguing about is one aspect of the opening ceremony Alex Salmond, First Minister
"I asked the chairman of the board to reconsider its decision in order to take account of the resources and scale of the operation that would now be required, and one which would be out of proportion to the friendly atmosphere sought by the board for the Commonwealth Games."
A GHA spokesman said: "As we have stated all along, public safety is our absolute priority. The demolitions will be rescheduled and we will continue to liaise and take the advice of the police and our demolition contractor."
Monday marks 100 days until the start of the Games.
First Minister Alex Salmond told BBC Scotland: "I don't think the safety issue is face-saving, it's very important.
"But there's also the point about unifying - we're 100 days from the Commonwealth Games, we're about to have the greatest celebration that Scotland has seen of sport, and culture is part of that. And all we're arguing about is one aspect of the opening ceremony.
"This is one of the few Games in recent history which is coming in on time and on budget."
Local Labour MSP Patricia Ferguson said she was relieved by the decision and the Conservative sports spokeswoman Liz Smith described it as a "victory for common sense".
The Ray Project
While sci-fi-style advancements like bionic eyes that help restore human vision might be getting closer to reality, everyday gadgets like smartphones can still pose major hurdles to the blind and visually impaired.
A new device called Ray aims to make the smartphone space friendlier to the sight-challenged by integrating standard smartphone capabilities with the functions of specialty devices that many blind consumers now pair with basic mobile phones to create a full smartphone experience.
Rather than having to rely on audio-book readers, navigation tools, raised Braille labels, special bar-code scanners, and large-buttoned and voice-enabled MP3 players, therefore, they can turn to just one device.
The multifunction Ray combines off-the-shelf Android smartphone hardware powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon processor with a custom user interface designed for eye-free operation. The UI, developed in Israel, employs a touch screen, haptics, sensors, text-to-speech, and audio feedback to support phone calls, sending and receiving e-mails and text messages, social networking, remote device management, and more.
For example, "the user touches any position on the screen and that position becomes the starting point for selecting an audio book, messaging, or other activity," Boaz Zilberman, CEO of Project Ray, the developer of the interface, said in a statement. "Navigation is enabled by a few simple finger movements in different directions. The phone's built-in vibration capabilities and voice prompts provide user feedback and the UI learns to adapt its behavior based on users' preferences and usage patterns."
Trials of Ray are currently under way in Israel, where subscribers can use the device to access and download audio books, magazines, and periodicals from the country's Central Library for the Blind, Visually Impaired and Handicapped over an advanced mobile broadband network rather than waiting to receive CD copies in the mail.
According to the World Health Organization, 285 million people are visually impaired worldwide -- 39 million of those are blind and 246 million have low vision.
Eliza Cooper, a blind social-media consultant in New York who has critiqued new apps aimed at blind users of the iPhone, had a mixed initial reaction when I told her about the Ray.
"I believe companies should not revert to creating third-party devices for the blind which provide access to smartphone technology but look different than the ones that their non-disabled friends have," she said over e-mail. Still, given that the device claims to provide solutions to daily annoyances like identifying objects via bar codes and reading labels, she said, "I must admit that I am intrigued and would like to get my hands on one to try it out."
The Ray Project
We're living in the 21st century but in many ways we are still looking at life through 20th century glasses. It is this conflict or clash that characterizes most contemporary debates about privacy and copyright.
From Mass Production To “Handcrafted” Digital Artefacts
In the wake of the Industrial Revolution, humanity became accustomed to the consumption of products in whose production human hands had no (significant) function: from the assembly line straight to our homes.
In the 20th century this principle of a “consumer society” based on mass produced commodities was experiencing its climax, boosting sales with carefully constructed brand images and aggressive advertising campaigns that attacked all the senses.
People were buying music on vinyl, then on tape, and when the CD came out they purchased all their records again in a digital format. This process could have continued indefinitely if there had come one physical storage medium after the other.
Instead, the preferred format suddenly shifted from a physical format to a purely electric one.
As McLuhan wrote in Understanding Media: “Electricity does not centralize, but decentralizes”
Therefore, as soon as the preferred format (mainly a matter of convenience) became purely digital, such as the MP3, various movie file formats and lately the ebook, cultural commodities suddenly have become very difficult to control. This doesn't mean that people aren't trying to exert the same centralized power over cultural goods as in pre-digital or pre-electic days, but rather that these means of control are deeply anachronistic and in conflict with the very nature of these formats.
And while some of us are busy fighting natural developments – these quixotic but apparently necessary allergic reactions to everything new – others are trying to reevaluate consumption processes on the basis of a changed playing field. Thanks to the proliferation of digital devices, now everyone can create and distribute digital media themselves. In a similar way that the washing machine has allowed people to do the laundry in their own homes, the computer has allowed us to create movies, books and music from the convenience of our decentralized locations.
Free Vs Paid: a false dichotomy
In a time where cultural goods are largely independent of their physical storage medium, the concept of pricing and selling has to be reevaluated as well. When a musician doesn't pay a single cent for giving away millions of promotional “copies” of his works, the division between “advertising” and “product” is obliterated. Contrary to the razor and blades model, there's no “catch” here. Artists or intellectuals can offer their works for free, no strings attached, because through the distribution of these works they gain recognition for other (potentially non-free) works. But even when we're talking about one and the same product, there's no reason why “paid & free” is a contradiction.
In my experience this works both simultaneously and asynchronously.
Here are two examples:
1. SIMULTANEOUSLY:
When I found out that one of my books got “stolen” I decided to offer the book as a free download. The result: the book continues to sell, even better than before. In other words: the fact that something is available for free doesn't prevent it from generating income. It's the same for having articles freely available and accessible on a blog and at the same time offering paid collections for ereaders etc.
2. ASYNCHRONOUSLY:
This is a more classic but still very interesting approach that I've been experimenting with. Whenever a new book comes out I make it free at first, such as my recent short stories (there's a new one out just now). In this way, whoever stays in touch and reads this blog, etc. will be able to consume almost everything I produce without paying a single penny, whereas I'm still able to continue living (and creating more stuff) off royalties from subsequent sales.
In other words, there's a lot of work to do in reevaluating these processes, and in a way I'm grateful for draconian anti-piracy lobbies because they create the background on which projects like the Humble Ebook Bundle or my own experiments can gain a new momentum.
Why FREE and PAID Don't Contradict Has this been helpful?
“It was chaos,” said former MSU running back Levi Jackson, who scored MSU's winning touchdown on an 88-yard-run late in the gam. “I was thinking, ‘I know they can't beat us. Out of all the things in the world, they can't take this from us.'” (Photo11: MSU Athletic Communications )
Thirty seconds felt like a lifetime, the next hour like an eternity in purgatory.
Forty years later, it all seems like yesterday to the men who were in the middle of one of the most stunning and surreal scenes in Spartan Stadium history.
Michigan State players jumped for joy as the scoreboard light bulbs flashed to zero. Moments later, Ohio State's guys were doing the same.
One referee signaled a touchdown. Another waved his arms, determining the game had ended. Woody Hayes' volatile temper boiled over as he back-handed an MSU fan who had rushed the field.
All Pat McClowry knew was he and the rest of the Spartans' defense had stopped Harold "Champ'' Henson at the goal line when it mattered most. And in the process, they had just pulled off perhaps the greatest upset in school history.
Final score: Michigan State 16, No. 1 Ohio State 13.
Or was it? It would take 46 minutes to find out for sure.
One phrase from Sports Illustrated summed up what happened that afternoon, Nov. 9, 1974, in East Lansing: "The Bizarre Bowl." MSU's victory over the top-ranked Buckeyes proved to be theater of the absurd, all right. Confirmation of the outcome wouldn't be known until then-Big Ten Commissioner Wayne Duke made his ruling after consulting with officials, who had quickly fled the stadium.
"It was chaos," former running back Levi Jackson, who scored MSU's winning touchdown, recalled this week. "I was thinking, 'I know they can't beat us. Out of all the things in the world, they can't take this from us.'"
They didn't. But all of the controversy assured that this game — for both teams — would be ingrained in the players' minds forever.
BUZZ TO BATTLE
Former Michigan football star Gerald Ford had taken over as President three months earlier. Troops the players' ages were finally returning home from Vietnam. And the week leading up to that MSU-OSU game in 1974 generated an immense anticipation around East Lansing, even though the Spartans were just 4-3-1 and a four-touchdown underdog.
"I think much of the hype had to do with them being undefeated and No. 1 in the country," said MSU offensive lineman Charlie Wilson, now an associated professor at Olivet College.
For Ohio State, averaging 45 points in its first eight victories that season, it was just another ho-hum week and opponent that it planned to steamroll. The Buckeyes had won 19 consecutive regular-season games at that point. Their last Big Ten loss was in 1972 to the Spartans in East Lansing, which was running back Brian Baschnagel's freshman year.
"My memories, at least up in East Lansing, weren't the best of memories," said Baschnagel, who was a junior in 1974 and now lives and works in the Chicago area. "Woody really hyped it up and tried to emotionally get us prepared for that game."
The buzzing crowd of 78,533 filed into Spartan Stadium for the noon kickoff, which was broadcast on ABC — former MSU coach Duffy Daugherty was the color announcer, alongside play-by-play man Chris Schenkel. It was, as Jackson called it, "a glorious day" for football, with unseasonably warm temperatures climbing into the low 60s by kickoff.
Fans in the stands and the television audience at home watched the two teams slug it out early, trading first-half field goals to go into halftime tied at 3-3 thanks to MSU recovering two Ohio State fumbles. The Buckeyes would take the lead on Tom Klaban's 20-yard kick midway through the third quarter, then made it 13-3 after Henson plowed up the middle for a 1-yard TD with 9:03 to play.
That changed in a hurry.
INTO MSU LORE
The Spartans answered on their next drive, with quarterback Charlie Baggett throwing a 44-yard touchdown pass to Mike Jones. The two-point conversion pass to Jackson failed, making it 13-9 with 5:30 remaining.
MSU's defense rose to the occasion with a quick three-and-out, stopping the Buckeyes a yard short of the first down. Tom Skladany's booming 51-yard punt yielded only a 2-yard return, and the Spartans took over again at their own 12.
The south end zone, 88 yards away, would become a mob scene seconds later.
On the next snap, Jackson took a handoff from Baggett and sprinted into Spartan history. He started moving right, cut to his left and burst through a big hole between center Charlie Ane and right guard Wilson, with another seal block from tackle Greg Croxton. At the 25, Jackson gave a hesitation fake that left OSU safety Bruce Ruhl grasping at air. Jackson, as he described, was "off to the races."
It seemed like the entire crowd swallowed him whole after he scored, with his teammates not far behind.
"I thought I was gonna get killed," Jackson remembered. "Before I could turn around in the end zone, they were there. It was just a sea of people, and then you couldn't see people any more. I thought I was going to end it right there."
With 3:17 remaining, Spartan Stadium had turned into a cauldron of celebration. MSU almost improbably had taken a 16-13 lead.
But Ohio State still had one more chance, setting up one of the most memorable and disputed finishes in the history of both schools.
BUCKEYES MARCH
Daugherty, before the Buckeyes' final drive, announced what was to come next: "Woody won't go for the tie," he predicted, "Woody Hayes will go for the 6 points."
The Buckeyes started with a play that, had current review rules been in effect, would have rendered any argument about the final seconds moot.
After Archie Griffin's kickoff return gave them the ball at their own 29, quarterback Cornelius Greene dropped back to pass on first down and spotted the running backbreaking free to his right. MSU's Terry McClowry dove in front and appeared to intercept the pass. As if foreshadowing the ending, two referees signaled interception while one waved it off, claiming the ball hit the turf. It was ruled incomplete.
"I used to see him make that same catch in the street by our house in a pair of shorts and a T-shirt, without any protection," said Pat McClowry, Terry's twin brother and fellow linebacker. "He did that a million times. I know he made that (interception)."
On the next play, Griffin — the eventual Heisman Trophy winner — broke free for 31 of his game-high 140 yards, with Pat McClowry dragging him down from behind in MSU territory.
The clocked kept rolling, and so did Ohio State's offense. Henson for 3 yards, Greene back-to-back for 5 and then an elusive 9-yarder on third-and-2 for the first down. MSU's defensive players were gasping for air, hands on hips and tilted over at their waists. Less than two minutes remained, and the Buckeyes already were at the Spartans' 23.
After an incomplete pass, Greene hit David Hazel for 9 yards, down to the 14. In the announcer's booth, Daugherty pointed out that the Buckeyes had just one timeout left with 1:22 left.
Henson picked up 3 yards and a first down, then Griffin ran for 5 more to get to the MSU 6. Hayes called that final timeout. Only 40 seconds remained.
Henson got the call on a draw play and powered his way to the 1. Officials brought out the chains for a measurement, awarding the Buckeyes the first down with 29 seconds remaining. The clock again began to roll once the ball was set.
The final showdown was about to begin.
TICK, TICK, TICK
Greene stepped under center again, with Griffin, Henson and Baschnagel behind him. He handed the ball to Henson, who darted for the line. He was met with a crash. Pat McClowry's helmet slammed into Henson's first. Then Jim Taubert and Kim Rowekamp met him low. Then Terry McClowry joined his brother and others in hitting Henson high.
"I hit Champ Henson right in the head," Pat McClowry recalled, "and my eyeballs fell on the goal line. I knew his head didn't get in."
Henson, now a county commissioner in Ohio, still contends he crossed the plane. "I saw the goal line behind our players. We pushed them back, I went and got what I thought was the touchdown. Evidently not."
Officials didn't signal a touchdown. The ball was marked down at the half-yard line and the clock kept going. OSU players — after an extended unpiling from the Spartans, who were taking their time getting up — looked around confused, trying to hurry to the line for one final play. The ball got snapped with players moving, bounced off Greene's hands and right to Baschnagel. He landed on it in the end zone.
One referee signaled touchdown. Two others said time had expired. Away the zebras darted off into the wilderness, as Spartan Stadium's floor became a jungle of fans.
"The officials waved that they didn't get the last play off and the game was over. There was no question about that," MSU coach Denny Stolz recalled this week. "We left the field, Ohio State left the field. There was total bedlam going on."
What happened next, Stolz said, is "what makes it a legend."
NOT SO FAST
Commissioner Duke had been in the press box and ordered the teams to stick around as he looked for the officials, attempting to figure out what happened in those final frantic seconds in an era before replay. A stadium announcement told fans to stay in their seats.
"He was gonna go talk to the officials — it's the most idiotic thing," Stolz said of Duke. "This ACTUALLY happened by a Big Ten commissioner. The story is he ran over to the Kellogg Center trying to find the officials. Burt Smith was our athletic director then, and when we were in the locker room, I told him, 'They can find all the officials they want. They ruled the game over, we're not coming back — that's for damned sure.'"
Legendary coach Hayes ranted and raved and made his players wait in the tunnel, certain they would go back onto the field for one final play. After they entered the locker room, Duke eventually came and told Hayes that, indeed, MSU had won.
And then …
"Woody went berserk," said Greene, who is now a coach at St. Albans School in his hometown of Washington D.C. "He immediately went after the commissioner verbally and told him that we got hosed. Coach wanted to battle. He told us to put on our helmets, and let's battle them the right way.
"It was just so heartbreaking to find out 46 minutes after a game that you lost. And then you really find out that football really is a game of inches."
Baschnagel admits that he never thought his recovery in the end zone would be ruled a touchdown.
"The reality is, we didn't get the play off in time and we were in motion anyway. As far as that play is concerned, it wouldn't have been a legal play anyway," he said. "The real question was, should the officials should have stopped the clock and let us get set, because the Michigan State players had been holding us down."
THE AFTERMATH
MSU, not permitted to go to a bowl game due to conference rules at the time, finished with five straight wins for a 7-3-1 record. A 21-21 tie against Illinois prevented the Spartans from being part of a three-way split for the Big Ten title. They would have earned the Rose Bowl berth, since Ohio State and Michigan had gone more recently.
The Buckeyes wouldn't lose again until the Rose Bowl, finishing 10-2 after beating Michigan in the season finale to tie U-M for the title and earn the postseason berth. But that blemish against MSU still bothers them, even today.
"It's just one of those crazy things. You can blame the officials all you want¸but in reality, that game never should have been that close," Henson said. "That was the best game that they ever played and the worst game that we ever played. It just happened on the same day."
A number of players from both teams will return to the site of the madness next Saturday, when the current Spartans and Buckeyes again meet in a highly anticipated showdown with Big Ten and national implications. They'll assuredly reminisce over that beautiful November day in 1974 and, as they have for years, continue to sort out the details.
With one thing certain, after 46 minutes and 40 years.
"Beating Ohio State when they were No. 1," Taubert said, "that's the highlight of my career at Michigan State, other than being a Spartan."

FIFA Rejects 2018 Cup Move
Geneva — FIFA rejected calls to move the 2018 World Cup from Russia, saying the tournament “can achieve positive change.”
Some lawmakers in Germany want the hosting rights reviewed because of Russia's alleged involvement in shooting down a Malaysia Airlines plane over Ukraine last week.
Political pressure on Russia increased Friday when the European Union sought to freeze assets and restrict travel for more individuals and businesses.
FIFA said in a statement it “deplores any form of violence” and questions the purpose of relocating the showcase tournament.
“History has shown so far that boycotting sport events or a policy of isolation or confrontation are not the most effective ways to solve problems,” FIFA said, adding that global attention on the World Cup “can be a powerful catalyst for constructive dialogue between people and governments.”
The conflict between Ukraine and pro-Russia separatist rebels escalated days after the World Cup ended in Brazil.
On July 13 in Rio de Janeiro, Russian President Vladimir Putin attended a World Cup handover ceremony with Brazilian counterpart Dilma Rousseff. Both (then) sat next to FIFA President Sepp Blatter to watch the final at the Maracana Stadium, won by Germany.
FIFA, which has Russian sports minister Vitaly Mutko on its executive committee, said a World Cup in the country “can be a force for good.”
“FIFA believes this will be the case for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia,” the governing body said.
Blatter already rejected calls to strip Russia of the tournament after it annexed the Crimea this year.
“The World Cup has been given and voted to Russia and we are going forward with our work,” Blatter said in March.
Former U.S. Defender DeMerit Retires
Vancouver, British Columbia — Former U.S. national team player Jay DeMerit has retired from soccer.
DeMerit, the first player signed by the expansion Vancouver Whitecaps in 2010 and the Major League Soccer team's first captain, officially announced his retirement Thursday.
“When it makes sense, when it's right, it's not sad,” DeMerit said. “It's not something I am going to regret. It's something I am very proud of.”
The 34-year-old DeMerit will continue to work with the Whitecaps as an ambassador and has other business interests in Vancouver.

The 34-year-old Cesar played for Brazil in the World Cup. He joined Toronto in February and was 3-4-0 with two shutouts in seven Major League Soccer appearances.
Drogba Back at Chelsea
London — Didier Drogba rejoined Chelsea on Friday, reuniting one of the sport's most theatrical characters with flamboyant manager Jose Mourinho.
The 36-year-old Ivory Coast striker, who was a free agent after stints with China's Shanghai Shenhua and Turkey's Galatasaray, signed a season-long deal with the Premier League club.
“It was an easy decision. I couldn't turn down the opportunity to work with Jose again,” Drogba said. “Everyone knows the special relationship I have with this club and it has always felt like home to me.
“My desire to win is still the same and I look forward to the opportunity to help this team. I am excited for this next chapter of my career.”
With the last kick in his last game with the club in May 2012, Drogba won the Champions League title for Chelsea, scoring the decisive penalty in the shootout against Bayern Munich. During eight years at Chelsea, Drogba also won three Premier League titles, four FA Cups and two League Cups after being signed by Mourinho in 2004 from Marseille.
Now Mourinho, who was away from Chelsea from 2007-13, is reshaping the team after failing to win a trophy in his first season back at Stamford Bridge. Drogba is the proven scorer Mourinho desperately craved last season, with 157 goals in 341 appearances.
“He's coming because he's one of the best strikers in Europe,” Mourinho said. “I know his personality very well and I know if he comes back he's not protected by history or what he's done for this club previously. He is coming with the mentality to make more history.”
Drogba was Chelsea's man for big occasions, scoring nine goals in nine finals, but he is also one of the game's most inflammatory players. He has infuriated rival fans with what they view as a habit of diving and enraged referees with his aggressive foul-mouthed conduct, earning several bans from UEFA.
BC-SOC--FIFA-Argentina Sanctions,119
FIFA fines Argentina for protest banner
Eds: APNewsNow.
Associated Press
ZURICH — FIFA has reprimanded the Argentine soccer association and fined it $33,000 after its players were pictured with a political banner before a World Cup warmup match.
Several players stood behind the slogan “Las Malvinas son Argentinas” (The Falklands are Argentine) on the field at a June 7 exhibition against Slovenia in Buenos Aires.
Argentina and Britain went to war in 1982 over the Falkland Islands, called the Malvinas in Spanish. The islands have been a British territory since 1833.
FIFA rules prohibit political statements at matches it controls.
It's the second time this month FIFA has fined the Argentine body. A $340,000 fine was ordered for failing to bring Argentina players to pre-match news conferences at the World Cup.
I feel like I've been on a big Aromaleigh kick lately. The reason is that I've made a couple of orders this year, with the new Ephemera box and the Feast of Lupercal collection. While I was at it, I decided to order just a couple more samples to feed my addiction.
I've been eyeing the Serpens collection for a while. I didn't buy the whole Serpens collection, but I did choose 9 different shades to try. Luckily samples are only $1 each, so I didn't have to feel guilty splurging on less than $10 of samples.
I purchased these a while ago – sorry for the delay on swatches. Even though I ordered a while ago, I wanted to call out the turnaround time for Aromaleigh. Officially, the website says 4-8 business days. My order took exactly one week to be placed, shipped, and received. Now that is amazing!
Ordered: Jan 8th
Shipped: Jan 13
Received: Jan 15
Anyway, onto the Serpens collection!!
Theme
This is a really gorgeous collection from Aromaleigh inspired by dragons and their lore from around the world.
From the Aromaleigh website:
Serpens is our creative response to many requests we've gotten to do a “Game of Thrones” inspired collection. While we love doing an occasional pop culture collection, our true love is history and mythology. This collection is representative of that, and we hope it fills your dragon void…
Swatches (all swatched use Darling Girl's Glitter Glue on the left and NYX white base on the right)
Akurra
From the website:
Akurra is an aboriginal serpent deity who was associated with the fertility and greening of the land. In her research, Kristen has been finding that a lot of dragon mythology intersects with stories about serpent deities, in all areas of the world. Some cultures regard water serpents as dragons, and some dragons are called “wyverns” (worms) and have two short arms and wings, while some don't have wings at all.
Akurra is a greenish gold with green and gold sparkles.
Ihuaivulu
From the website:
Ihuaivulu is a South American volcano dragon, described as having a serpent-like body with burnished copper and red scales. Ihuaivulu is similar to the Greek Hydra, and has seven heads. It lives in volcanoes and breathes fire.
Ihuaivulu is a rosey copper color.
Gargouille
From the website:
Gargouille was a water-spouting dragon (more like a serpent dragon, because of its long snake like body) who appeared in the Seine River in France. It was said to terrorize boats and flood the land. In the legend, Saint Romain, the archbishop of Rouen, lured the monster to shore using a convict, and then made a cross with his fingers to tame the monster. He then led it into town where it was slaughtered. Some accounts said it was burned. The accounts of burning said that neither the monster's head nor neck would burn, so they were mounted on the town's cathedral to display God's power. The creature was then said to have been carved onto buildings to be used as a water drainage, therefore creating the modern gargoyle.
This color is copper from one angle. And it was green burnished gold with LOTS of gold and green sparkles. I didn't love it at first, but as I applied it, the more I liked it. This is one of my favorites from this collection.
Ddraig Goch
From the website:
Ddraig Goch, “The Red Dragon” of Wales, is one of the most well-known dragons of all. It is synonymous with the Welsh people, and is on their flag. This color is inspired by that flag- the red dragon on a field of white and warm green.
Ddraig Goch is a dark, warm red – like the super trendy marsala color. It has LOTS of green sparkles.
Ukashima
From the website:
Ukasima is a great white-scaled dragon that dwells in the Ukasima Lake at Yama-shiro near Kyoto, Japan. “It is said that every 50 years the dragon ascends from the lake and takes the form of a golden songbird, or a o-goa-cho. The dragon's songs, however, bring only sadness and misery to the land and are reminiscent of the mournful sound of wolf song. The sight of sound of this creature is a portent of disaster and ill fortune. The Ukasima Dragon is usually a herald for severe drought. The last reported sighting of the o-goa-cho was in April of 1834. Widespread famine and an outbreak of plague followed this last sighting of the Ukasima Dragon.”
You know I already love Ukashima. So, while I didn't order it with this batch, I decided I should swatch it here, since it fits. Here's a link to the previous post of it, just in case you are curious. This color (called Ukasima on the Aromaleigh website) is a yellowed beige loaded up with silver sparkles. It's one of my top favorite eyeshadows, actually.
Shimchong
From the website:
This is “Shimchong” a softer Serpens shade. It is based on the Chinese folk tale about the blind man's daughter and the dragon king, Sagara…Rather than doing a shade directly inspired by a dragon, we chose to do this one based on a character in a beautiful Chinese folk Tale about a dragon.. It represent's Shimchong, the blind man's daughter, who is married off to the dragon king and later returns to her Father, disguised as a lotus flower
This color is a warm rose with pink and silver sparkle with traces of blue and green shimmer as well.
Kinabalu
From the website:
Kinabalu is a giant blue-scaled dragon said to have lived at the top of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. This dragon owned a grand pink pearl that the Chinese Emperor desired.
This color is violet with a pretty blue sheen. I don't think this is a super unique color. I'm not as in love with it as I expected, although it is beautiful. I think just as my collection grows, it's harder and harder to find colors that completely wow me.
Tarasque
From the website:
The Tarasque is a bizarre chimera-like creature, described as a dragon, and found in the legends of Provence, France.
Speaking of colors that wow me, this is one of those. It's very hard to describe. It's a purpley gray with many colored sparkles, including pink, blue, green, and purple. I feel like every time I look at this color, I see something different… which really fits in with the chimera theme here. You definitely should pick this one up!
Fafnir
From the website:
Fáfnir is a dragon of Norse Volsungsaga, who is said to be the inspiration for J.R.R. Tolkien's “Smaug”. Fáfnir was originally a dwarf, the son of Hriedmar and brother of Otir and Regin, but got transformed into a dragon by the ring Andvarenaut. Fafnir had stolen a fortune given to the dwarves by the gods as a ransom for Otir's death, and the ring Andvarenaut was in the fortune. The ring then transformed him into a greedy dragon that guarded his treasure to his death. He later died at the hands of Sigurd Fåvnesbane.
To me, this color looks like a dark, metallic rose. The description on the site says there is a purple to metallic copper duochrome, but I didn't see that when I swatched. It's a nice color, though, for sure.
Belthir
From the website:
In Scottish legend, Belthir is a dragon with black scales and fiery red eyes who lurk in the mountains of Glen Coe. (But if your google Belthir, you'll most likely come up with a pile of results in relation to a video game. Our inspiration isn't that Belthir!)
This has a dark purple base and over either white base or a sticky base, it pulls dark purpled maroon. It has a lot of sparkles, especially blues and greens. This is a very complex color, which I appreciate. For some reason, I don't love it, though. I think I might be over the marsala trend already.
Final thoughts: I think I am learning more about what I like and don't like. The colors that I tend to like the best are very complex, and generally neutral. But sometimes, I find bright colors that I love too, so I won't give up on those for sure! As always, I'm very happy with my Aromaleigh purchase. My favorites from this batch are Gargouille, Tarasque, and Ukashima.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) is known for his support of free market principles, but that apparently changes entirely when it comes to bail. He is championing legislation alongside Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) that would use federal grants to effectively destroy the bail bonds industry, putting thousands of small businessmen at risk of losing their livelihoods.
“Our justice system was designed with a promise: to treat all people equally,” Harris was quoted as saying in a news release. “Yet more than 450,000 Americans sit in jail today awaiting trial and many of them cannot afford ‘money bail.' In our country, whether you stay in jail or not is wholly determined by whether you're wealthy or not — and that's wrong.”
Harris and Paul published a joint op/ed in the New York Times where the lawmakers referenced the policies of New Jersey as an example of what their proposed federal grant money would influence states into adopting. New Jersey has become a stunning example of the unintended consequences of government solutions to the supposed bail problem.
NBC New York conducted an early expose of what happened after New Jersey effectively dismantled the bail bonds system in their state. What they found was a tremendous lack of accountability, increased government control and spending, and the empowering of criminals to commit more offenses. From the report:
“On January 1 of this year, New Jersey overhauled its criminal justice system and virtually eliminated the old cash bail structure, replacing it with one that relies heavily on a mathematical risk assessment formula…
From January 1 through March 31, 10,193 eligible defendants were processed. Preventive detention was ordered for only 12.4%. Nearly 85% were given pretrial release, some with conditions…
Outraged mother June Rodgers of Millville blames bail reform for the murder of her son. He was shot to death on a street in Vineland in April after a verbal dispute with a man driving a car. Cops arrested career criminal Jules Black, who'd been picked up on a separate gun charge four days before, and released with no bail…
The state has created a Division of Pretrial Services to monitor defendants. The funds come from court fees. There have been 173 employees hired so far. The projected spending for next fiscal year is expected to be in the range of $36 million to $38 million dollars.
The Office of Administrative Courts was unable to provide any statistics on the number of released defendants who have re-offended since January 1, or the number of those who have failed to appear for scheduled court dates.”
Under Paul's proposal, $10 million in federal grant money would be earmarked toward coercing states across the country to adopt these policies. Matt Maddock, a conservative activist and bail bondsman from Michigan, has lobbied on behalf of his industry for many years. He believes that Paul's plan is misguided and unbecoming of the tea party values that got him elected to the Senate in 2010.
“Outlawing bail bond agencies and eliminating money bail is not the solution to the problem of the criminally accused from languishing in jail unable to post bail,” Maddock said. “User-funded bail bond agencies are the only mechanism that effectively reduce the number of fugitives in our communities because they have ‘skin in the game,' and they go out and bring fugitives back into custody.”
The streets may not be safer, government may not be limited, and small businessmen may have to worry about their livelihood, but at least Paul will have a decent photo-op with a Democrat and series of media appearances to boost his political aspirations. The legislation is not expected to pass.
Gay and Christian
By Sarah Rogers, staff writer | English major
“I've always known I was gay,” said Rod López, a May 2010 biblical studies APU graduate. “I've never been sexually attracted to women ever since I was a child. I knew I was supposed to like girls, but I didn't.”
Dr. Mark Yarhouse, who was invited by APU to speak to professors on homosexuality, found in his 2009 research of gay Christian college students that they had differing understandings of their sexual preference's origin. Yarhouse is the Endowed Chair of the School of Psychology and Counseling at Regent University and the developer of the Institute for the Study of Sexuality. Most participants for his research article, “Listening to Sexual Minorities on Christian Campuses,” believed their same-sex attraction was biological (10%), environmental (53%), or had not formed an opinion and could not answer the question (17%).
According to the American Psychological Association's website, other explanations for same-sex attraction have pointed to psychological problems. Since 1975, the organization has been attempting to remove homosexuality's social stigma as a mental disorder.
Gay and Christian: these two factors in identity, faith, and sexuality meld together amidst controversy. But what does it mean to be both?
Studying the Faith
López, who is currently a teacher through Teach for America, grew up in the Catholic church and transitioned to an evangelical one in high school. If he told people his sexual orientation, he would say he was struggling with homosexual thoughts and tendencies. But no longer does he define his homosexuality as a struggle.
“I think someone can be gay and Christian,” López said. “I also think that person can be not only gay, as in sexual orientation, but also can be actively gay and in a same-sex relationship.” He had always accepted he was called to celibacy, but some of his APU Bible classes challenged his understanding of human sexuality. According to López, the Christian academic world is not as unanimous on homosexuality as he previously believed.
“In Romans 1, Paul talks about people giving themselves over to sin like same-sex lusts,” López said. “When you think about the Roman world, men of equal economic and cultural status rarely had sex with each other. Often, sex was a power dynamic and they would have sex with younger boys and slaves.” In ancient Rome, López believes penetration was an act of power, not one of love. For two men to be in love and committed to each other was unheard of, as far as he knows.
The Bible is silent on the modern version of homosexuality, according to López. “Same-sex relationships now are not about power or status, but two people genuinely in love who want the best for each other,” said López. He would not say the Bible promotes homosexuality, but loving homosexual relationships did not exist and therefore are not addressed in the Bible.
“The Bible doesn't address every single thing in modernity,” said López. “Christian couples are in love, centered in Christ and want to be disciples of Christ together. I see that and I say, ‘Is that really the same thing being talked about in Romans, Deuteronomy or Philippians?'”
This is not to say López discounts the Holy Bible. “The Bible is the Word of God and I think there's life and hope to be found in Scripture, but I just don't see it applying to the situation,” López said. “I think we need to address every part of it and figure it out.”
Wrestling with biblical teachings on homosexuality also brought disagreement with his church. While at APU, López attended an evangelical church and served as a high school youth group leader. When Prop 8 was on the ballot, members of the church organized a booth in the lobby, handing out pamphlets against gay marriage.
“I didn't think it was appropriate for the church to do that,” said López. “My thing was, if a gay couple walked into church right now, they were going to feel unwelcome.” He began to bring up the subject, but as a well-known church leader, López was asked to step down.
“I was there to mentor the youth. I went for the community and I wasn't going to go if I couldn't be involved in the high school ministry,” said López. He started a house church with some friends instead. After he finishes his two-year commitment to Teach for America, López hopes to find a new church in California.
“I cannot emphasize enough the importance of a believer being with other believers,” said López. “I would never dream of doing things on my own because that's not Christian or what the body of Christ is supposed to be.”
Losing the Faith
For some, churches have been a place of exclusion and hurt. For Abigail Cirelli, a 2010 journalism and sociology APU graduate, her conception of the world was “God is love and people are gay.” She was searching for an understanding of God that allowed for both truths to be harmonious. “I was into liberation theology for a while that teaches God is the God of the oppressed and they are His cause,” said Cirelli. “That allowed me to see the coexistence of Christianity and the acceptance of the reality of the human experience, which is a spectrum of sexuality.”
Cirelli grew up in a small, blue-collar church that she always saw as a loving community. One day, her pastor mentioned they would be going through a video series on homosexuality and how to love the sinner, but hate the sin. “The first time they mentioned it, I burst into tears,” said Cirelli. “A group of people I know are good and loving people created a space that wasn't safe for everyone.”
Feeling betrayed and tricked, Cirelli couldn't understand why her church would ask her to separate her body and soul. “You can't love someone and hate who they are,” Cirelli said. She identifies as queer, being neither straight nor completely gay.
Now, Cirelli has left the church and considers herself agnostic. Treatment of the homosexual community was not her reason for leaving. Christianity felt artificial to her. Cirelli said, “I think the most holy and sacred things are or reside in the connection between people.”
Arguing the Faith
Reverend Susan Russell is on staff at All Saints Church in Pasadena with LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender) inclusion as part of her portfolio. She is also the chair of the LGBT group for the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles and serves on the Religion Council of the national Human Rights Campaign.
“Often, I get the question, ‘Show me in the Bible where it says homosexuality is okay,'” said Russell. “I will say, I can't find a text that will tell me that. I also can't find a text that will tell me we should ordain women, be against the death penalty, or abolish slavery.”
Discernment is necessary to read the Bible in context, Russell believes. Texts in the Bible state stoning was the penalty for children talking back and the idea that the sun revolved around the earth. “I believe in the 21st century we have a different understanding of the psychology and biology of homosexuality,” said Russell.
“There are a percentage of people who are, for lack of a better word, hard-wired to form their best, most authentic relationships in terms of emotional and sexual intimacy with partners of the same gender,” said Russell. “Given that that is a scientific given, I think as a theologian my response to that is, ‘Where is God in those relationships?'”
Common arguments against homosexuality tend to be Scripture-based, but Russell believes Christians should look at the wider message of the Bible. God's wider message, to Russell, is His love, justice, and compassion. “If you belong to a tradition that reads the Bible literally, I would challenge you to read it all literally. I think it becomes a challenge,” said Russell. “We take the Bible too seriously to take it literally.”
To allow the issue of homosexuality to polarize and divide the greater church is to miss the high calling of being followers of Jesus, she said. Russell said, “Good people of deep faith reading the same Bible come to different conclusions about God's will. But we should not allow ourselves to be distracted from the wider work of the church by allowing gay and lesbian families to be the sacrificial lambs of partisan politics.”
Note to the reader: This article's purpose was to look at a part of identity that is an important discussion to college-age readers and the greater church. The Collide staff chose to examine a narrow aspect of a large discussion regarding homosexuality and to answer the question, how do people identify as both gay and Christian? Most sources interviewed speak personally on this question.
CLASHES IN THE CHURCH The issue of homosexuality in the church has differed among church denominations, ranging from full acceptance to total rejection of all the LGBT community represents. According to professor of practical theology Michael Bruner, divisions also occur over church membership and ordination of LGBT individuals. The Bible says nothing about homosexuality as an orientation, explained Bruner, which leads some Protestant and Catholic churches to recognize celibate homosexuals as able to receive a call from God to be ordained. “Those who claim both identities typically understand their sexual orientation to be a gift from God, and interpret the texts in Scripture that express the sinfulness of homosexual behavior as addressing only Ancient Near Eastern and/or first century Greco-Roman sexual mores and practices, which they claim are vastly different from the mores of today's committed homosexual partnerships,” said Bruner. But the basic issue most churches confront, Bruner believes, is where to draw the line between tolerance and endorsement. “The most difficult kind of loving, in fact, often involves practicing uncomfortable discernment and setting what appear to be unloving boundaries,” said Bruner. Bruner sees Christ as the ultimate example of this balancing act. And the Church, on its best days, is able to both tolerate people while not endorsing many of the things they do. Bruner believes the Church has been called to go one step further than tolerance. The Church is called to love with conviction. For students facing the struggle of both spiritual and sexual identity, Bruner hopes they will be allowed to have such discussion in a non-threatening environment. He believes the Church should not continue to prohibit expression of a person's sexual orientation without giving them room to struggle with the reality. “We as the Church must continue to do our best to love all those who seek to follow Jesus Christ, regardless of their sexual behavior, while at the same time not countenancing any behavior that falls short of Christ's high sexual ethic,” said Bruner, even if that means that many who practice such behaviors will see this position as “patronizing and unloving.”

UPDATE 1: 2:55pm Wednesday 28th October
UPDATE 2: 6:40pm Wednesday 28th October
UPDATE 3: 4:00 pm Friday 30th October
UPDATE 4: RELEASED ON BAIL 11:30 am Tuesday 3rd November
Today the FIA arrested a Twitter activist @JalalQazi from Peshawar for posting a tweet on 22nd Sept, they placed upon him charges for violating the Electronic Transaction Ordinance of 2002 specifically clause 36: Violation of Privacy of Information and 37: Damage to Information Systems (read clauses below) these are, as per my understanding (?), non-bailable offences permitting the FIA unbridled arrest of Jalal Qazi for up to 90 days without follow-up
Digging into the issue after his arrest, it seems the case hovers around a set of tweets made by Qazi Jalal on 22nd September (tweets deleted) where he posted referencing to an engagement card of a certain Mr Faizan Malik – who could be the son-in-law of Honorable Justice Irshad Qaiser, the judge who had according to Qazi Jalal granted bail to Ihsan Ali the Vice Chancellor of Abdul Wali Khan University who was arrested a few days earlier on corruption charges. Faizan Malik is a lecturer who has also been under investigation, of the 1400 appointees who were inducted into the university during the ANP tenure – starting his tenure as a lecturer in May 2012. His CV hosted on the university website establishes the linkage of Faizan Malik as listed on the engagement card is the same as his fathers name listed there is the same, being the son of Ghulam Mohy-ud-Din Malik
On 15th September Ihsan Ali, the VC of Abdul Wali Khan University and three other educationalists were arrested by Ehtesab Commission and sent to a 14-day remand to Peshawar Central Jail for involvement in corruption to the tune of Rs 550 Million, the media published reports on this arrest partially siding with the ANP narrative and playing a sympathetic anti-educationist angle almost as if to blame Ehtesab commission for wrongdoing. The case took an interesting twist when seven days later on 22nd September, Ihsan Ali was granted bail by the Honorable Justice Irshad Qaiser. Which may have, in normal circumstances been a routine bail, but had it not been for some investigative sleuthing of Qazi Jalal who dug out an engagement card possibly establishing a conflict-of-interest between the honorable judge and her to be son-in-law Faizan Malik a lecturar at Abdul Wali Khan University, and possibly undergoing the same investigation
The on-ground reports from Peshawar are that, FIA is responding and harassing Qazi Jalal on possibly contempt of court charges started by Justice Irshad Qaiser, Ihsan Ali the bailed VC, ANP Senator Sitara Ayaz (who is ironically also subverting arrests from Ehtesab Commission under ‘stay orders' issued by Honorable Justice Irshad Qaiser, Qazi Jalal reported on the Senators case as well) the case is also being propped up fully pushed by the corrupt ANP party as they are intrinsically involved in the corruption scandal.
The more pertinent issue is if this tweet was wrong as deemed by the honorable judge, Qazi Jalal should have been asked by the honorable judge, even in pursuant of a proper legal proceeding to ask him to delete &/or apologize for this inaccurate information, but quite ironically it seems they may have chosen to bully and harass Qazi Jalal using the FIA to exercise the ETO ordinance 2002, which if you read the clauses below, there is truly no direct violation under which Qazi Jalal should be arrested, unless they choose to draw hypothetical conclusions to the wordings of the law, the best part is that a tweet gathering a mere 8 retweets was deemed damaging the repute of the people involved in the AWKU and others directly/indirectly involved that required such drastic harassment
This is a very serious development, the Cyber Crime Bill which is presently in the National Assembly of Pakistan for approval in its present form, is also a prime example of what could happen if such weak laws are promulgated – it allows irresponsible state agencies to abuse vague injunctions to harass the citizens of Pakistan on the flimsiest of excuses, the present ETO clause 36 and 37 falls well outside realm of this arrest but the agencies found enough of an excuse to arrest & harass Jalal – It could happen to you too
UPDATE 1: Wednesday 28th October 2:55pm : It's interesting to dig around to find out how Qazi Jalal had access to the engagement card, it has come to our attention that Qazi Jalal tweeted this image of the card after spotting it on his facebook friends Haybat Khan's timeline
The original poster made the update on 22nd Sept 12:47pm and Qazi Jalal made a post almost 8 hours after on 22nd Sept 9:14pm. The FIA if are interested in a credible investigation should pursue the original content from Facebook (credit for the find Sidra Imran)
UPDATE 2: Wednesday 28th October 6:40pm: Reports are coming in that all day efforts were being made by family and the local jirga to come to some understanding and have a Muafi Nama (Apology) signed between the parties, but we've just found out that Qazi Jalal has been handed over to the FIA for a 2-day remand by the court. Seems a contempt of court charge has also been tacked onto this case
UPDATE 3: Friday 30th October 4:00pm: Qazi Jalal appeared before the sessions court judge for the hearing, the Judges family has refused to accept the apology – despite having forced / convinced him to sign it in the fist place, the sessions court judge remanded him to 14-days in Peshawar Central Jail – the jail conditions are horrible, its deplorable – I personally have seen the copy of the FIR the case is only registered as a violation of ETO 36 and 37 there is no Contempt of Court Charge. The next hearing is expected to be Wednesday 4th November
UPDATE 4: Tuesday 3rd November 11:30am JALAL QAZI RELEASED ON BAIL: After much of a traumatic experience it has been reported that Jalal Qazi was granted interim bail and released from Peshawar Jail – the reports are that the family came to some understanding manipulating his release before wednesday. Keep in mind this does not mean the issue is all sorted out, it only means Jalal Qazi has been harassed enough that they choose to release him on bail for sometime
Electronic Transaction Ordinance of 2002 – Clause 36 & 37 reads

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Nine days into a cholera epidemic that has killed at least 303 and infected more than 4,700, Haitians are holding their breath and waiting to see if the outbreak can be stopped.
Haiti's humanitarian relief organizations are posed to call their response to the outbreak a success, pointing to the quick mobilization of doctors to affected areas and sufficient stockpiles of IV bags. So far the disease hasn't spread through Haiti's tent camps where 1.3 million people still live, and the organizations are hopeful they'll soon be able to contain the outbreak.
But critics say Haiti's gruesome brush with cholera represents a failure by these groups whose job is to prevent exactly this type of disaster in the first place.
There's one thing everyone agrees on: If cholera were to enter Port-au-Princes tent camps, the epidemic would explode.
“Should it arrive in a camp without any toilets or clean drinking water, there's no way to stop it,” said York College professor Mark Schuller.
But the cholera epidemic didn't start in the unsanitary and crowded tent camps of the earthquake-ravaged region. Instead, it came from a rural, rice-farming area where life for most residents continued much the same as it was before the earthquake.
David Olson, medical adviser for Doctors Without Borders, said it's unfair to blame relief organizations for Haiti's longstanding underdevelopment problems, such as the 40 percent of Haitians who don't have access to clean water and the 80 percent without proper sanitation, including toilets and soap.
“It'd be a little harsh to judge that we're not providing clean water in the rest of the country,” Olson said. “That's an ongoing development issue.”
Residents of Haiti's Grand Saline community, where at least 74 people have died from cholera, say they drink water directly from the Artibonite River — which tested positive for cholera last week — because there is nowhere to buy treated water in the area.
The coordinator for Haiti's international humanitarian relief, Nigel Fisher, said the swift response by aid organizations showed they were well-prepared to handle the outbreak from the beginning.
“There were sufficient supplies of the critical elements needed: oral rehydration salts, the transfusion solution needed, the antibiotics,” Fisher said.
To stop the disease before it reaches other parts of the country, medical nongovernmental organizations, including Doctors Without Borders, are setting up temporary clinics in the hardest-hit areas so patients don't need to travel as far. Other humanitarian groups like the Red Cross are broadcasting public service announcements over radio and sending text messages to advise people how to prevent the spread of cholera.
Fisher said the humanitarian response to the earthquake had no bearing on the emergence of cholera. But just three months ago, Fisher was taking a different tone.
"It's important to note what we haven't seen. We haven't seen a major epidemic of cholera or measles, for example, because most people are getting access to clean water, to regular health care,” Fisher told reporters on July 12.
In fact, less than half of the camps that house Haiti's internally displaced provide clean water, and nearly one-third do not have toilets — a dangerous predicament in the context of a disease that spreads through water contaminated by fecal matter — according to a recent study by Schuller, the York College professor.
“The issue is how well prepared they were before the outbreak. When you don't have drinking water and you don't have toilets, you have a very fertile ground for cholera to develop,” Schuller said.
Schuller points out that cholera cases appear almost annually in the United States without causing panic because the disease rarely spreads in places with clean water and proper hygiene. Many cholera patients at St. Nicholas hospital in the Haitian town of St. Marc — where the first victims appeared last week — said they drink untreated water from the local canal because treated water is either too expensive or unavailable where they live.
The surrounding Artibonite region has the highest number of people displaced by the earthquake outside the tent camps of Port-au-Prince. Had humanitarian relief organizations invested more money after the earthquake building clean water and sanitation projects in these marginalized regions, cholera would not have spread, said Schuller.
“What could have happened is that when 600,000 people left Port-au-Prince after the earthquake to their families in the provinces, that could have been the opportunity to empower local people in the communities.” Schuller said. “Instead they concentrated their efforts in Port-au-Prince so people were coming back.”
Etant Dupain, director of a grassroots Haitian organization that is informing camp residents about the outbreak, said the United Nations could have helped prevent the epidemic in the first place by spending more of the $1 billion it has coordinated in post-earthquake aid on sanitation and clean water projects in rural areas like Artibonite.
“Humanitarian aid in Haiti is for crises — this is why they exist, for crises like this,” said Dupain.
Cholera may be new to Haiti, but it's well known to Latin America. A cholera epidemic in the early 1990s spread to every country except Uruguay and the Caribbean, infecting more than 1 million people and killing nearly 9,000.
“You always have this period of time where you're trying to get treatment sites set up and train people and that takes time," said Olson, who has responded to cholera outbreaks in Nigeria, Uganda and Zimbabwe. "In Haiti, where there hasn't been cholera in several decades, one doesn't expect that cholera will suddenly appear out of nowhere.”
Introduction
Over the past few months, Seagate has been hard at work bringing higher capacity drives to the enterprise sector. With the expansion of their portfolio to include five and six terabyte models, these drives have now started to trickle down to consumers.
The ST6000DX000 is Seagate's first consumer 6TB hard drive to hit the market. Like the 6TB Enterprise Capacity v4, the Desktop variant includes the same six-platter design with an increase in areal density up to 643 Gbits/ square-inch. This along with a hefty 128MB of multi-segmented cache and 7200 RPM spindle speed gives the new Desktop HDD 6000GB a performance advantage over the previous 3 and 4TB models.
With that said, it should be noted that this drive in its bare form isn't available on the market. When doing a bit of research it appears this drive doesn't exist at all. However, you can get your hands-on the Desktop HDD 6TB in kit form at many online retailers.
Specifications, Pricing and Availability
As stated above, this drive, if we go by the model number ST6000DX000, which is printed on our drive, this unit doesn't exist on the market at this time. However, if we put two and two together we can get an idea of the specifications of this drive. Looking at the above image, of the Enterprise Capacity v4 specifications we can deduce that our consumer model carries similar features. Of course the nonrecoverable read errors per bit read will be 10^14 instead of the 10^15 listed for the Enterprise model. Warranty for this drive, as expected will be the standard two-years Seagate places on all consumer drives.
The Seagate Desktop HDD 6TB in kit form carries an MSRP of $299.99 with a two-year warranty.

The only talk Carmelo Anthony wants to hear is trade talk.
One day after the Knicks' new management team stated Anthony potentially could return, it appears he still has no desire to talk with Knicks president Steve Mills and new general manager Scott Perry about that possibility.
According to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, who commented on the Knicks' situation during a “SportsCenter” appearance Tuesday morning, Anthony “has made it clear to [the Knicks]: I want to go to Houston. I am not interested in talking to you about being reincorporated back into this New York roster.”
According to an NBA source, the Knicks have yet to restart talks with the Rockets after breaking them off Friday.
The Knicks are in complete rebuild mode, but management does not know if it can make a sensible deal to send Anthony to the Rockets. Sources told The Post that Anthony's camp is pushing hard for a Rockets trade to Houston. It still is unclear if Anthony will agree to a general meet-and-greet session with Perry.
A source also told The Post the Rockets are undeterred by the franchise being put up for sale Monday and will continue their pursuit of uniting Anthony with his buddies Chris Paul and James Harden. Anthony has $56 million left on his pact, but with an opt-out after this season.
Mills and Perry want to meet with Anthony, who has a no-trade clause, to gauge his temperature and see if he would be willing to expand his wish list beyond the Rockets and Cavaliers. Suggestions that the Knicks are trying to convince Anthony to remain a Knick are exaggerated, as they try to focus on, as Mills said Monday, “youth, athleticism and defense.''
There was no indication if Anthony is willing to expand his list, meaning this latest Melodrama could drag on. The Blazers and Suns are said to have some interest in getting involved in a bid for Anthony.
The Blazers originally were brought into talks to take Ryan Anderson's $60 million contract in a three-team deal but balked, crashing negotiations.
It also was reported the Rockets are prepared for the idea that “these negotiations with the Knicks could run through August, September, into possibly the start of training camp as New York tries to rebuild Melo's value.”
Despite his no-trade clause, Anthony doesn't have much leverage. If he holds out of training camp, it would cost him only money. The Knicks no longer are in win-now mode, so they would be prepared to play Tim Hardaway Jr. at shooting guard and Courtney Lee at Anthony's small-forward spot.
Though the “tanking” word obviously was not used Monday, euphemisms abounded. The Knicks' primary objective is not securing a top-eight seed next season, that entering another lottery wouldn't be harmful. There was no mention of competing for a playoff spot — just developing a young core with a renewed “focus on player development.''
Mills twice invoked the draft, saying the team would “take advantage of the fact we have our draft picks moving forward.” Next year's draft will contain two potential game-changers — Missouri freshman Michael Porter Jr. and Luka Doncic of the EuroLeague, both of whom can play small forward.
“It will take longer to do,” Mills said of a rebuild. “But I think it's something the fans of New York are ready for and will accept.”
There isn't a way Anthony wants to waste a year as a mentor at age 33 with a year or two of his late prime slipping away.
On Monday, Mills, in contrast to former president Phil Jackson's mantra, said, “I think we will be a good developing team if Carmelo is part of the team. We'll be a good developing team if he isn't. We'll be in constant communication with Carmelo and his camp, and we'll come to some resolution that works well for both us.”
Mills added there was “no set timeline for this,” and the club would not consider buying him out.
Jackson's final wish was to buy out Anthony in a move he considered addition by subtraction.
Using a stretch provision in the buyout would have gained the Knicks $15 million of cap space this summer, but also would've had Anthony's salary taking up cap space for five years.
I can only speak for drugs I have had experience with, this means that drugs like heroin and crack will not be covered….for now. If you have only just started smoking weed then I would recommend that you just stick to weed for now and master that high before you starting bring other drugs into the equation. I didn't intentionally set out to mix all of these drugs with cannabis, I just like smoking weed so when I do other drugs I still smoke. Here are my personal experiences with a bit of scientific information of how the specific drugs interact.
MDMA Crystal & Cannabis
Anyone that has ever tried some high quality MDMA will know that it makes smoking anything, even a cigarette, feel absolutely amazing. If you have some fruity strains such as Tangerine Dream and Lemon Haze you will be in heaven while smoking. The only downside is the fact that it is a struggle to roll a respectable joint while on a high dose of MDMA.
An easy way of combining the two drugs is to crush up the MDMA into a fine powder and roll it into your cannabis joint. I would NOT recommend doing this as inhaling MDMA will fuck up your lungs but I have seen a few people do it and seem to enjoy it.
I also feel like cannabis is perfect for taking the edge off while you are “coming up” on the MDMA, will also help calm any anxiety that you may feel from taking the MDMA. Smoking some weed towards the end of your high may also reinvigorate the MDMA high leading to a return of the pleasurable waves associated with MDMA. Cannabis is also going to be your best friend when you are dealing with your “comedown”, which is basically just a hangover from hell so make sure you buy it the day before you do the MDMA so you can relax and recover the day after.
“It was found that recent retrospective studies on cognitive functions in long-term drug abusers point to an additive negative effect on different types of memory, as well as a cannabis-independent decrease in learning and decision-making in MDMA users. Behavioral experiments in rodents and in vitro studies investigating the combined effect of MDMA and cannabinoid agents demonstrate modulator effects of acute co-administration on measures like body temperature, conditioned reinforcement, and presumed neurotoxicity. It is also worth noting that THC can help protect neurons from this MDMA related toxicity.
In conclusion, there are few and somewhat contradictory studies examining the effects of co-use of these drugs on cognitive measures like impulsivity, memory and executive functions or underlying neurobiological alterations, and a shortage of animal studies examining long-term effects of chronic co-administration”.
Acid & Cannabis
These two drugs work perfectly together in my opinion, the cannabis enhances the acid trip an incredible amount. If it is your first time dropping acid then I would definitely recommend waiting until you are coming down from your trip before you start smoking weed. If you smoke while tripping it will make the trip a lot more vivid and the acid will hit you a lot harder, which is ideal for the psychonauts amongst us.
Just like the MDMA high smoking is amazing however you will struggle to roll a spliff if you are tripping too hard, I would advise that you roll a few joints before you drop the acid, you will definitely be thankful later on in the night.
If you feel like you are coming down too early in your trip just try smoking a spliff, the acid high should return in waves. It should also be noted that acid does have a dark side and there is the potential for a bad trip, if you are paranoid about smoking weed while tripping then maybe you should get a bit more experience tripping first as any doubt in your mind can be exploited by the acid during a trip which can last up to 12 hours.
People talk about how amazing it is to listen to music while your stoned however they do not understand truly how good the music can be with the help of a little bit of acid.
Alcohol & Cannabis
People who just drink alcohol probably would not agree with me classing it alongside drugs such as acid and DMT however it is a drug just the same and can fuck you up just as much as anything else on the list, especially when combined with cannabis. The majority of stoners have been in a position where someone around them has ‘whiteyed' after smoking while already drunk. For the amateur smoker, smoking while drunk can be very risky.
If you smoke most days then I wouldn't be too worried about this it is normally a thing that if seen in younger less experienced smokers. Smoking after drinking is definitely still risky for everyone and I would suggest you smoke while drinking or get stoned prior to getting drunk, I have always had a much better night while doing it this way however there is no way I would turn down a joint at the end of the night no matter how drunk I was.
No one likes a hangover so make sure you have some weed around for when you wake up, a spliff in bed is sure to cure any hangover that you may have.
Cocaine & Cannabis
My opinion on this combination is going to be biased due to my dislike of Cocaine. I have never understood how it justifys its $120 per gram price tag in London, it has always just struck me as a drug for people who dont really like drugs. Why spend this much money on coke which will either give you a minor confidence boost or just sober you up and give you a recognizable buzz when you could get fucked up on acid for 12 hours for $10.
That aside I have coupled both of the drugs many times, similar to the modafinil high it just eliminates the drowsiness and lethargic feeling that accompanies certain indica strains. It gives you that extra energy to do a few things but you will regularly need to redose your cocaine to prevent yourself from coming down. However when you do start coming down I would highly recommend smoking some weed as it will take the edge of the comedown and allow you to get to sleep after a heavy night.
I wouldn't really go out of my way to try this drug combination as it ranks as one of the worst on this list, there are also a few studies that show their is an increased chance of dangerous heart palpitations when combining cannabis and cocaine.
DMT & Cannabis
DMT is the strongest psychedelic on this list and should be approached with caution as it makes acid look like childs play. I would be surprised if anyone was able to smoke weed straight after taking a hit of DMT as you are literally transferred into another dimension. I have had trips when I have ended up in a train station made solely from sound waves and another where I was transported straight into a video game so I cant really see there being any time for you to smoke.
To counter this you can roll the DMT into the weed and get high that way however the DMT trip will be nowhere near as vivid as it would be if you smoked it out of a small pipe. Would still recommend this way as the trip is not the only part of the DMT high, even without the trip you will still feel amazing. Some people may want to avoid the vivid trip associated with DMT as not everyone is comfortable with looking down and seeing your whole body is covered in scales because you are now a lizard.
Personally I prefer to just get really stoned first and then smoke the DMT afterwards, I feel like it makes the transition into being a lizard a bit easier…
Ketamine & Cannabis
I have always wondered why ketamine was a class C drug in England for so long because when it comes to getting in a bad way ketamine is the go-to drug. Maybe the fact that there were no criminal repercussions and that it was only $20 a gram meant that it was very popular with the youth. It has recently been moved into class B and as a result the price has doubled to about $40 a gram which is bad news for wreckheads across the country.
If you want to smoke a spliff after sniffing ket then expect to roll the worst spliff of your life and for it to take an incredible amount of time to roll, make sure you roll a few when you are sober so that ketty you don't have to worry about it. Ketamine doesn't have the same synergy with cannabis as other drugs such as acid and mushrooms, if you have sniffed a decent amount you will barely notice anything while smoking because the ketamine high is so strong and overpowering.
Valium / Xanax & Cannabis
If you want a good nights sleep that lasts about 14 hours but still leaves you waking up groggy then this is the combination for you. Don't expect to do anything productive when trying out this combo, if your chosen strain is an indica strain then just expect to be melted into the couch for the foreseeable future.
Using diazepam together with weed may increase side effects such as dizziness, drowsiness, confusion, and difficulty concentrating. Some people, especially the elderly, may also experience impairment in thinking, judgment, and motor coordination. You should avoid or limit the use of alcohol while being treated with these medications. Also avoid activities requiring mental alertness such as driving or operating hazardous machinery until you know how the medications affect you.
Medical disclaimer out of the way I would definitely suggest this drug combination for anyone just looking for a majorly relaxed day, just make sure you clear your schedule first…
Ecstacy (pill) & Cannabis
Obviously this is going to be very similar to smoking while high on MDMA however I though ecstasy pills deserved their own category as they aren't always just MDMA as I have found out from first-hand experience. As long as the pills are good quality it will be identical to the MDMA high however a lot of pills are cut with other drugs so the high may not be as clean as you would expect if you are used to doing high quality crystal MDMA.
Speed was always the drug that people said was the main cutting agent for pills so smoking weed is vital to take that jittery edge off that is associated with speed. Your energy levels will be ridiculously high so smoking weed can be very useful in just calming you down and making you relax a bit so you can fully enjoy the high.
I find the comedowns off pills are a lot worse than MDMA so make sure you have a few joints rolled for the morning to aid with your recovery.
Modafinil & Cannabis
Modafinil is a nootropic which is readily available on the internet, it has been likened to the “Limitless Drug” due to its ability to enhance cognition. I had taken this drug without smoking any cannabis and I definitely felt an increase in my motivation and concentration levels so I was curious to see how the high would be when it was paired with cannabis.
I took an above average dose of modafinil and then waited about an hour before I started smoking any weed, the modafinil seemed to intensify the cannabis high and remove any “couch lock” that I was experiencing from my chosen indica strain. I can only imagine that if you smoked a strong sativa while on modafinil you would have an incredible amount of motivation and energy.
Most people pick modafinil as a study aid, if you are one of these people I would base my decision to smoke weed off of what type of work I was doing. Cannabis would be perfect for doing a large amount of creative work as you will have the creative benefits of cannabis alongside the motivational benefits of modafinil. If you have more math based scientific work then I wouldn't recommend smoking as my mind tends to wander when focusing on these types of tasks.
Mushrooms & Cannabis
You cant get much more natural than this combination, if you want to connect to mother nature then clear your schedule and get fucked up on mushrooms and weed. Cannabis seems to majorly enhance the majority of psychedelic drugs mushrooms included which is perfect for anyone looking for a vivid trip. I have found that both cannabis and mushrooms give me the giggles when taken seperatley and the giggles are definitely amplified when you combine the two drugs.
Mushrooms are like acids baby brother, they are a lot more cheerful and friendly whereas acid has a dark side that you risk of encountering whenever you trip. Bad trips are a lot less common when it comes to mushrooms so anyone that is a bit paranoid about smoking weed while on mushrooms shouldn't worry about the possibility of a bad trip too much. Most of the time I just end up forgetting to smoke any weed while i'm tripping on psychedelics and only decide to start rolling a spliff when I feel like the high is declining. There are too many other things happening in your brain for you to be focused on smoking weed so don't force it.
If you want to get your hands on any of these combinations then I would reccomend checking our guide on how to buy drugs online.
How To Buy Drugs On The Deep Web
Josh Rayden runs us through his first-hand account of this past weekend's SCG Indianapolis Open, pointing out the prospects of identified Standard staples and a new wave in Legacy.
I went to Star City Games Indy this past weekend. I didn't do very well in the tournaments. This was especially depressing as I was hoping for a decent finish in any of the events to get the last points I needed to level up.
You see, I'm not actually a grinder. This was the third SCG Open weekend I've attended this year, all of which were in Indy. With a Legacy Top 8 and finishing 9th on breakers at the Legacy Open following the Invitational (which I scrubbed out of horribly), I was averaging 5 points per weekend and needed 5 more to be able to attend the second Invitational. It looks like I'll just have to go to Kansas City at the end of this month.
While my personal performance was a disappointment, the weekend as a whole was not. I learned many valuable lessons that I can pass on to you fine folks. Some of them may seem obvious, while others are not. Either way, shedding some light on these may help you make some financial decisions in the coming days.
After every SCG Open weekend and GP, I browse through the decklists and deck techs to see which sleeper cards did well. I typically try to follow the coverage so I can capitalize on breakout hits as they become public knowledge. Being at the tournament really lets you get a jump on the competition. The first big event after a new set release is particularly lucrative. And so it is with Innistrad and SCG Indy.
Standard
Walking around the hall before the standard open it was easy to see that one deck was on everyone's mind. That deck was Solar Flare. Err, wait. Wrong link. Here, try this one. Drat, wrong again. I've got it this time for sure. Click here!
For those who care about such things, Solar Flare was a deck popular during Ravnica block that had the powerful play of turn three Compulsive Research into turn four Zombify on Angel of Despair. This deck has a very special place in my heart and is the first deck I ever fully foiled out. Its name actually comes from the Japanese name for a Dragon Ball technique, Taiyo-Ken (translated as Solar Flare in English), as the deck's creator thought that Angel of Despair looked like Krilin from DBZ.
I did not play Solar Flare in Indy. I didn't like the mana base and had been testing UW Caw Blade as I felt very comfortable with the list I had arrived at. In retrospect, I probably should have audibled to AJ Sacher's list when given the opportunity. That would have posed its own problems, however, as Star City Games was sold out of Liliana of the Veil. Our group had opened two cases of Innistrad and only managed to crack three of the new Planeswalker, and those three were being used.
So here's the first thing to take away from this weekend. Liliana is good. In fact, she's very good and everyone seems to know it. Check this out:
Those prices are higher than they were prior to the weekend. Liliana was $35.00 last week and the foils were $60.00. Take a look at this:
Star City is buying Liliana of the Veil for $30.00. I don't see these numbers coming down in the next month. They may even go up a little more. After that it will begin to settle and the price will drop again, if only slightly. Liliana is the real deal and has found her home. She's very powerful and necessary to fight some of the threats in Standard, such as Geist of Saint Traft.
Geist is a card I criminally underrated the last time I spoke to you, but it doesn't pass the Liliana test.
Yep, the Liliana test.
This will be familiar to all of you. Before it was the Jace test but, from now on, whenever you play a creature in Standard you need to ask yourself how far behind you'll be if your opponent untaps and casts Liliana of the Veil.
If you want Lilianas to play with, it's still possible to find them for less than $50. But that won't be true for long. If you need them for tournament in the near future, try to get yours now before the general public realizes what's happening.
From speaking with AJ, some other things about the deck soon became apparent.
First, Forbidden Alchemy is one of the best cards in the deck (even though AJ only ran three). This will be a staple as long as it's in Standard. Try to find cheap foils and hang on to them. This doesn't have the cross-format applications that Path to Exile, Dismember and Inquisiton of Kozilek have in the past, but it's going to see tons of play for the next year or two. Forbidden Alchemy along with Think Twice means that you'll always have things to do with your mana and you can play a legitimate control game. It's nearly impossible to truly flood out with this deck and that's more important than ever with our current lack of person-lands.
Two other cards from AJ's list deserve attention, but first let me show you the deck that Julian Booher played on camera against Brad Nelson during some downtime:
Julian can't remember the last three board spots, though I feel like there were Dismembers somewhere. This is the most dedicated control deck we've seen in Standard in a long time. Julian went fairly deep in the tournament, eventually losing a match to miscounting his lands and being one mana short of activating two Nephalia Drownyards to win the game. He liked the deck and recommends the following changes: -2 Visions of Beyond, +1 Black Sun's Zenith, +1 Forbidden Alchemy. Ditch the Bloodline Keepers for more spot removal (Dismember) or other niche cards.
These decks both demonstrate that Snapcaster Mage and Curse of Death's Hold do have a place in Standard.
Tribute to Hunger is another excellent card given the number of Hexproof creatures appearing in Standard. Geist of Saint Traft and Dungrove Elder can be serious problems without an Edict effect. I'm sure you can still find Curse of Death's Hold for dirt cheap and it is going to be a role player for the next few years. Pick them up for change and flip them later when they're worth a few dollars each.
The above lists show how Snapcaster can be utilized in Standard to great effect. The Tiago Chan invitational card shouldn't be jammed into every blue deck. I saw many people over the weekend with Snapcasters stranded in their hands doing nothing of consequence. Very few decks in Standard should reasonably include more than 2 Snapcaster Mage if any are called for at all.
Legacy on the other hand, is a completely different story. Once again we'll go to a list played by AJ Sacher. This list was developed by GerryT and AJ and they were kind enough to let me play it in the Legacy Open as well.
I would recommend playing the list a few times before jumping into a tournament. The decision trees opened up by Snapcaster Mage are vast, especially with the presence of one innocuous Urza's Legacy sorcery.
When AJ first walked up to our group and asked if we had any Unearths, a few of our number asked what the card did. The card is deceptively powerful.
Imagine the following situation: You are playing a grindy control mirror and have made it to the mid-game. You have a number of spells in your graveyard along with a Vendilion Clique and a Snapcaster Mage. You lament that you have only recently drawn your Riptide Laboratory as you gaze longingly into Tiago Chan's eyes staring back at you from the grave. Your opponent ends his turn, you sigh, untap your lands and draw your card for the turn. Low and behold, it's Unearth. You cast it targeting Snapcaster Mage and your opponent looks confused. He reads the card and allows it to resolve. Tiago enters the battlefield and you target Unearth with its ability. The flashback copy resolves and you now have a Snapcaster Mage and Vendilion Clique in play for a meager two manas. Now your Riptide Laboratory is active again. Very active. You quickly overwhelm your opponent in an avalanche of card advantage.
I got to live this dream one game. In another I Unearthed a Snapcaster, flashed it back targeting another Snapcaster and then Dismembered my opponent's Knight of the Reliquary. Some astute observers have already begun buying out foil Unearth on eBay. Being from Urza's Legacy, foils in particular are rare and in high demand. Keep your eye on this one. Today, foils are $6-$7 and Japanese foils are ~$26. I expect those numbers will be much higher at some point over the next few months.
The metagame in Indy was filled with Reanimator and Storm, two archetypes that were worse while Mental Misstep was legal. People were anxious to return to old form and these combo decks were probably the best metagame call. ANT and TPS tend to perform rather well versus decks like Goblins and Zoo. I would expect Counterbalance to come out to play again soon in response.
Will Snapcaster Mage have a place in Counterbalance decks? I'm not sure, but it will continue to see ample play in Legacy. A large number of Snapcasters came up just short of the top sixteen decklists from Sunday's open. As people are able to refine their lists they will begin to perform better. Something interesting did happen to Star City's price on this card though. Let's look:
While Star City is still out of stock at $30 on the regular ones, foils are back and down $20 from where they were the last time. While this card is excellent, it can't sustain these prices. I still believe it will come down. It may settle at $20, which is very high for a rare, but it won't stay at $30 forever.
Top Takeaways from this Weekend
Liliana of the Veil is the best Planeswalker since Jace, the Mind Sculptor. Unearth is sweet and the foils will likely spike in price. Snapcaster Mage is the real deal, but his price is still inflated. Birthing Pod is going to grow in popularity. Wait, what? I didn't mention this anywhere else in the article, but if everyone in Standard is going to be packing Sun Titan and Consecrated Sphinx then Birthing Pod has the tools to compete and win. Also, watch for Birthing Pod in combination with Heartless Summoning. GerryT posted a list last week that I think could become the real deal. Surgical Extraction is not a good choice versus AJ's Solar Flare list. Surgical Extraction is a fine choice in your Legacy Snapcaster Mage deck. Turn two double Surgical Extraction with a 2/1 is a fine rate. Expect this card to see more play.
This weekend I get to play in one of the first Innistrad sealed PTQs of the season in beautiful Fargo, North Dakota. Hopefully I will learn some more things this weekend or at States that I can pass on to you.

HOUSTON (AP) — An ordinance that would have established nondiscrimination protections for gay and transgender people in Houston failed to win approval from voters on Tuesday.
The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance was rejected after a nearly 18-month battle that spawned rallies, legal fights and accusations of both religious intolerance and demonization of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.
With nearly 95 percent of precincts reporting, Houston residents had rejected the ordinance by a vote of 61 percent to 39 percent.
Supporters of the ordinance said it would have offered increased protections for gay and transgender people, as well as protections against discrimination based on sex, race, age, religion and other categories.
Opponents, including a coalition of conservative pastors, said it infringed on their religious beliefs regarding homosexuality. But in the months leading up to Tuesday's vote, opponents focused their campaign on highlighting one part of the ordinance related to the use of public bathrooms by transgender men and women that opponents alleged would open the door for sexual predators to go into women's restrooms.
Democratic Houston Mayor Annise Parker, who is gay, blamed the rejection by voters on opponents' "bathroom ordinance" campaign, which she called "fear mongering" and part of an effort to demonize the LGBT community.
"This was a calculated campaign by a small, very determined group of right-wing ideologues and the religious right, and they only know how to destroy and not how to build up," Parker told a crowd of more than 100 people at an election night watch party in downtown Houston.
Maria Gonzalez, an English instructor at the University of Houston, who supported the ordinance and was at the watch party, said she was disappointed by the measure's defeat.
"The wedge issue has always been gay people. The outsiders come in and say they don't want gay and trans people protected," she said.
The state's top two elected leaders — Gov. Greg Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, both Republicans — praised the defeat, with Abbott saying the voters "showed values still matter."
Patrick, who vaulted to power on the basis of an ardent tea party following, called the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance "liberal nonsense" that voters were right to see as never about equality, saying that was "already the law." Rather, he said it was only about allowing men to enter women's restrooms and locker rooms "defying" — in his words — "common sense and common decency."
Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, a conservative political advocacy group, said in a statement that Tuesday's defeat of the ordinance made Houston "a rallying cry for Americans tired of seeing their freedoms trampled in a politically correct stampede to redefine marriage and sexuality."
The ordinance was initially approved by the Houston City Council in May 2014, but a lawsuit to have residents vote on the measure eventually made it to the Texas Supreme Court, which in July ordered the city to either repeal the ordinance or put it on the ballot.
The ordinance would have applied to businesses that serve the public, such as restaurants and hotels, private employers, housing, city employment and city contracting. It would have allowed residents to file a complaint if they felt they had been discriminated against based on the various protected categories. Religious institutions would have been exempt. Violators would have faced fines up to $5,000.
Tuesday's referendum drew attention from around the nation, with the measure getting high-profile endorsements last week from the White House, high-tech giant Apple and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton. It also received support from other members of Houston's religious community.
Campaign for Houston, which fought the ordinance, said opponents included a diverse group of individuals, such as pastors from all denominations and local and state elected officials.

Why white meat? Photo by Thinkstock
Let me say at the outset, I don't mean to be a buzz-kill. I'm happy for you if you like white-meat turkey. I don't think less of you. In fact I think rather more of you for being able to be satisfied with so little in the way of flavor. Perhaps in a past life you were a self-flagellating friar. (I'm reading Wolf Hall can't help the allusion. Best novel I've read in years, by the way.)
But, seriously, I mean no disrespect, especially in this holiday celebration of fellowship and thanksgiving. And, yes, I'm familiar with the phrase “de gustibus non est disputandum“—there's no arguing about taste. But in the case of white meat from a Thanksgiving turkey, well, I'd argue about that.
White meat turkey has no taste. Its slabs of dry, fibrous material are more like cardboard conveyances, useful only for transporting flavorsome food like stuffing and gravy from plate to mouth. It's less a foodstuff than a turkey app, simulated meat, a hyperlink to real food.
But I am fascinated by how tastes get made and unmade, the intersection of culture, class and sensory responses. Not being a postmodernist I wouldn't call the overwhelming American preference for white-meat turkey a form of cultural hegemony. More like a mass hallucination. Why, for instance, hasn't white meat shared the same fate, the same cultural disenfranchisement, as packaged white bread?
Some of you may remember white bread. Not the white bread of crusty baguettes and the like, but the white bread of sliced, standardized loaves of cotton wool, the stuff people ate before everyone switched to baguettes and focaccia and brioche, which are, yes, often “white” but not “white bread” in the old-fashioned, mass-produced sense. I'm talking about Wonderbread bread.
White bread of this sort is still around, can still be found, but no longer enjoys any elite status. Refined white-flour bread once was regarded as the peak of social refinement by the new middle class, perhaps because it left behind the time-consuming home-baked whole-grain variety. No gritty grains, no uncracked wheat, just highly processed, snow-white identical slices. It was aspirationally upper-crusty even at tea time when the crusts were cut off.
Then “refined” became a dirty word, nutritionally at least. White bread suffered two successive falls from grace. First from upper-middle class households, in the years when “middle class” became not an achievement to be proud of but a signifier of negative attributes: White bread came to be associated with boring blandness, suburban sanitized white-picket-fence-ified phony gentility. A veritable curse upon a person or a work of art: “That's so white-bread.”
And then the final fall, evident in the successive waves of ever-more-prevalent stone-ground, hippie, New Age, whole-grain, zucchini-infused, heavily seeded, soy-enhanced brown bread. Its cause was aided by the nutritionists who scolded that eating white bread was a virtual death sentence since processing removed all nutritional value, which caused manufacturers to pump artificial vitamins into the white paste they turned out. White bread, we were instructed, was almost as toxic as the dread poison white sugar.
Even mass marketers shunned it in favor of (often artificially flavored and colored) brown bread, which came in whole-grain and “cracked-wheat” and fake bakery configurations. By this time, eating white bread, buying white bread became worse than being white-bread. It became redneck. It became a signifier of trailer-park, gas-station-convenience-store culture. Imagine a New York hostess—a hostess anywhere!—serving some of those pale squares of paper pulp at a dinner party. Might as well serve TV dinners for the main course, or a Dorito burrito bag.
I digress on the fate of white bread because what's mystifying to me is the profound enigma: Why hasn't this same dynamic affected white-meat turkey? Yes, there are the foodies who claim their “heritage” turkeys offer white meat that tastes much better than what you find on those obscenely bloated Butterballs. But at $14 a pound, a single heritage turkey can free-range up to $200 for a single family-size bird.
And then when you present your heritage bird, according to some comments I've read on foodie chat-room boards, you're liable to get comments like, “How come the white meat isn't more white?”
This is what I can't understand: Why does most of America want its turkey meat white? Why do people flock to the obscenely named Butterballs, which boast of overinflated breasts as unnatural as the silicone boobs of truck-stop strip joints or of the Kardashian sisters?
Why have we broken the chains of the whiteness that bound us to fatally tasteless white bread while still remaining imprisoned in the white-meat turkey ghetto?
A friend was trying to convince me that in fact America has lost its taste for this tasteless meat, but the Sunday before Thanksgiving I was listening to the CBS all-news radio station in New York City, and they were doing a fluff piece on the turkey buying that was peaking that weekend. And the reporter was interviewing some guy from Stew Leonards, a food mega-store that serves New York City's sophisticated suburbs and exurbs in Westchester County and Fairfield County, Conn.
And the guy was boasting that his turkeys were “bred to have 18 to 22 percent more white meat.” After which the CBS announcer made a stupid wisecrack about breasts that alone would make you want to forgo the silicone-textured mega-butterballs.
And these are ciabatta-bread people, not Wonderbread people! Do they still associate white meat with refinement? It was enough to make me wonder whether there could be a racial, if not racist, subtext here. Perhaps there is a clue in the shifting fate of the “other white meat”—pork. I'll never forget the moment when I learned the antebellum racial origin of the phrase “living high on the hog.” I had driven down the I-5 “grapevine,” that fog-shrouded mountainous interior route from San Francisco to L.A. with a couple of Communist Party women who were mothers of death row prisoners (long story). When dawn broke and we arrived in Watts, they guided me to a place called Ray's Redwood City, an all-night, almost all-black joint where the ladies of Saturday night dined with the ministers of Sunday morning (not at the same tables), and my fellow travelers ordered me a dish called “high on the hog,” a mountain of scrambled eggs topped by a fried pork chop.
It was then I learned the etymology of the phrase in America. It hails from the plantation days, when the white slave owners dined on choice pork chops cut from “high on the hog” while the slaves made do with the lower parts of the pig—the ham hocks, the pigs feet, the pork bellies, and the innards. White meat was high on the hog, but not higher on flavor than other (often darker) cuts. Indeed the “other white meat” now available most frequently in lean and tasteless pork chops and cutlets has little more taste than white meat turkey.
Despite its superior taste, dark meat has dark undertones for some. Dark meat evokes the color of earth, soil. Dark meat seems to summon up ancient fears of contamination and miscegenation as opposed to the supposed superior purity of white meat. I guess it shouldn't be a surprise that white meat remains the choice of a holiday that celebrates Puritans.
Indeed, the connotations of the pale and darker parts of the turkey constitute a meaty metaphor for the Thanksgiving feast itself. The allegedly more refined and daintier white parts, the wings and breast, have never touched the ground the way the earthier darker legs have done. And you know how dirty dirt is.
By the way, if you want to read a brilliant poetic embodiment of the real story of our “Pilgrim fathers,” a chilling antidote to white bread, white meat, and Thanksgiving treacle, I recommend you take a look at Robert Lowell's amazing, chilling poem “Children of Light” (which could have been called (“Children of White”).
Its opening lines represent the best unsentimental epitaph for the myth of Thanksgiving:
Our fathers wrung their bread from stocks and stones
And fenced their gardens with the Redmen's bones.
Maybe that's why I have a prejudice against the white-meat sacrament of the holiday that covers up the white man's crimes.
It's Lowell writing about his pilgrim ancestors who began the rolling genocidal slaughter of those nice Native Americans who made the first Thanksgiving possible.
The real Thanksgiving story is extremely dark, far darker than any leg and thigh meat.
Could fear of facing our dark history be behind the prejudice against dark meat? Or is there more to the darkness of dark meat that feeds that fear?
This is what occurred to me when I put the question to my cohort of Facebook “friends” the Monday before Thanksgiving. There was one comment in particular that made me wonder whether something deeper wasn't going on: “I hate dark meat it's slimy and viscous.”
I had always thought it was a matter of the tastelessness of white meat, but here was an instance of some profound and fundamental revulsion against the threatening sensuality of dark meat. (Which others might call juiciness—what must he think of gravy?)
The language in which it was expressed reminded me of something I had not paid attention to since my undergraduate days: Jean Paul Sartre's mad rants against “ooze” and “viscosity” in Being and Nothingness.
I Googled around and found a commentary on one key passage in Sartre's meditation on “le visqueux“—both slime and the slimy:
For Sartre, the slimy resists the standard categorizations of solidity and liquidity, maintaining itself in a disgusting physical condition somewhere between the two: “Slime is the agony of water. It presents itself as a phenomenon in the process of becoming; it does not have the permanence within change that water has but on the contrary represents an accomplished break in a change of state. This fixed instability in the slimy discourages possession.”
However nonsensical most of Sartre is, that's a great line isn't it? “Slime is the agony of water.”
Maybe that's it: Dark meat represents slime and viscosity. Dark meat embodies all the menace of dissolution into the nothingness that is the slimy ground of being itself!

The UK television phenom that is the Great British Bake Off is dead — at least, in its current form. Last night was the finale of season seven, and the baking competition series' final episode on the BBC attracted a record high 14 million viewers. It will now move to Channel 4 in a £75 million deal, but beloved hosts Mel and Sue are leaving, and so is judge Mary Berry.
Uncertainty is swirling about show's future: Without three-quarters of its beloved cast, will it ever be the same? (Only co-judge Paul Hollywood is staying on for the move to Channel 4, leaving fans to quip that C4 “paid £75M for Paul Hollywood and a tent.”) Its new network is known for the manufactured drama of reality shows like Big Brother, and many worry that GBBO will be stripped of its polite British charm.
Berry herself said she is “just sad for the audience who may not be ready for change.” Without its hosts and one-half of its judging panel, the new edition of the show may be only a shadow of its former self, and as fans take to Twitter to celebrate season 4 winner Candice Brown (and fan favorite/heartthrob Selasi Gbormittah) they're also eulogizing a show that's become a cultural sensation.
The purest outpourings of emotion can be found from fans on Twitter:
it's all over. NO MORE MEL AND SUE. NO MORE MARY BERRY. #GBBOFinal pic.twitter.com/Jide4ekeCa — SWIFT. (@MilliCullen) October 26, 2016

Some are also expressing doubt that the “new” GBBO will be able to match the big numbers put up by last night's finale:
On average #GBBOFinal had 14 millions viewers. Good luck getting those figures @Channel4 — Mike DH (@Scottish1977) October 27, 2016
Ratings. 14 million watched the #GBBOFinal.
Its biggest audience ever.
Not bad for a show that is apparently "getting stale." — Ian Hyland (@HylandIan) October 27, 2016
The end of Bake Off as we know it has also spawned think-pieces aplenty,
Charlotte Higgins goes long for the Guardian:
The show has shrugged off the bonds of mere TV, and garnered a cultural presence rarely seen since the shows of the 1970s – the so-called “golden age” of television. The Great British Bake Off is a fully fledged cultural phenomenon – and it may be the perfect show for Britain, now. We exist in a world where the difficult words “Great” and “British” cannot safely be applied to much. But they can be applied to a baking contest.
Vox:
It's a major loss for the BBC. Bake-Off was the most-watched show in Britain last year, averaging 13.4 million viewers a night. So this is more or less the equivalent to American Idol abruptly leaving Fox right at its height — and leaving Ryan Seacrest behind.
Writing for the Guardian, American Spencer Ackerman said he wouldn't miss Mel and Sue, but feared what might happen in Mary Berry's absence:
There is one immutable truth about the Great British Bake Off. Her name is Mary Berry. Everything the show tacitly argues about the compatibility of achievement and gentleness is embodied by Mary. Mary Berry is the show's Beyoncé.
Former Bake Off contestant Richard P. Burr for the Washington Post
Of all the common languages we have in the UK, be it soccer, politics, music or the weather, “Bake Off” is the one that seems to span every walk of life...Ten Wednesdays each year, the country stops for a collective cup of tea and a warm televisual hug in the form of this lovely show. The current season is already attracting more than 10 million viewers. Yet this will be the last time we get to enjoy “The Great British Bake Off” as it is.
Jess Zimmerman, for Eater:
Bake Off can exist as a show without Mel and Sue, in the sense that a show can still exist in which British bakers cook in a tent and Mary says their cake has a lovely crumb. But the fact that the show feels like a family has always been an inextricable part of its charm, the core of the warmth and humanity that sets it above other reality shows.
Channel 4 has yet to announce who will replace Mary Berry and Mel and Sue on its version of GBBO, though the rumor mill has been working overtime with speculation. Among those rumors is one that the BBC is giving Mary Berry her own Bake Off-style series — so maybe all's not lost after all.

Here's a name you can really sink your teeth into - 'Bacon Double Cheeseburger.'
This 33-year-old was once known as Simon Smith, . But, he's since legally changed his name to this fast-food favorite and proudly signs his name 'B D Cheeseburger.'
After a night at the pub, Mr. Cheeseburger's friends got him to go in on a stunt to change his name to the Burger King favorite -- -- was the first thing that popped into his mind.
"It was largely the most ridiculous thing we could think of. My friends were quite supportive of anything that makes me look silly, as good friends are."
He followed through, sending his name change application to the UK Deed Poll Service. When the forms to sign making the name change official showed up in the mail a few weeks later, he was drinking with his friends again.
The rest is history.
, Cheeseburger says he has "no regrets at all."
Misura Larga – Wide Measure
Misura Larga or “wide measure” is when you can wound your opponent by taking a step with the right foot.
To obtain wide measure, start by forming a counter-posture just outside of his measure. Advance carefully by moving the foot forward. Paying close attention to your opponent, if he is in a static guard he can use the tempo of your foot step to attack. Try to unsettle your opponent's posture, perhaps by throwing a feint, so you can attack immediately upon entering range.
Once in range, you can attack immediately if you see your opponent move his feet to settle his stance. You don't even have to wait for him to move his sword. But be careful! If he moves his feet to break measure, then he can follow with a counter-attack.
Don't attack when if moves his sword without moving his feet. Tempos of the sword are much faster than those of the foot, giving him time to parry. Or he could retreat outside measure, which could be immediately followed by a counter-attack.
If you have a strong counter-posture, and he moves only his sword, use this tempo to gain misura stretta.
Don't chase an opponent who breaks measure, it may be a trap.
Misura Stretta– Narrow Measure
Misura Stretta or “narrow measure” is when you can wound your opponent just by leaning the body.
Moving into narrow measure requires two action, lifting the foot and setting it back down. (Don't slide the foot, it may cause you to stumble on rough ground.) This makes the prospect very dangerous, so make sure your counter-posture is solid.
When you lift your foot to advance, what happens next depends on your opponent. If they attack, parry and attack in counter-time. If they retreat, turn the attack into a lunge. Since you are both moving, you should still be in wide measure despite his movement. (Note, Fabris doesn't use the word ‘lunge', but he does describe it.) If he does nothing, finish taking narrow measure.
Always advance with the foot first, then the body. Don't move them as one when entering narrow measure, it's just too risky.

The Local
We might feel disappointed at the fizzling out of the 'Occupy' protest in London, but we shouldn't complain. It has been the embodiment of the standards and practice of protest in this country. It is an education if we care to look.
Here, protest is peaceful, proportionate, action is non-violent, and struggles for justice rely on the forbearance, restraint and decency of the 'Authorities' - in 'Occupy's' case, on the civic side: the police and the state, and on the sacred/property/business side: an embarrassed Church of England.
Proportionate protest? Proportionate to what? We adhere, as civilians, to our own local standards of behaviour and low levels of risk, not to those of the people we struggle to protect. So what do we achieve? 'Occupy' became, by default, an exercise in publicising the machinations of global business. Does our approach, as we plump for marches and the occupation of neutral territory, render us worthy and courageous, but ineffectual? Street action courts publicity, but, on its own, in isolation, what does it publicise, finally? Transience? Impotence? This is an evaluation, not a denigration. The way forward is a mystery.
The Global
Much global big business is, sort of, based here in the wealthy west. The companies may be incorporated in thin air somewhere, but the people who own, control and run them have, like those in global finance, got to live somewhere, and they tend to be cosmopolitan. What is the point of conspicuous income if you don't have anywhere to 'splash out and treat yourself'? These people work at cornering resources of cheap labour, energy, water, food and raw materials, manipulating capital for specious gain as they speculate in shortages and debt - they offer the tools of repression and domination in places which come to be known, euphemistically, as 'trouble-spots'. 'Occupy' has publicised this very well.
What, however, is 'proportionate' in the places where the activities of our local global operators do the most damage? The separation of non-violent and violent protest becomes problematic. In these places, and we clearly support this: Aung San Suu Kyi, burning shopkeeper or monk, hunger strikers, or kids facing high velocity rounds with placards, here, 'peaceful protest' means choosing to suffer for change - that's violence - rather than to inflict suffering for change - that's violence. Unfortunately, those whom we idolise for their courage and sacrifice have no direct access to the power mongers, the capital mongers, who are far away, safe and sound. If these protesters survive, they get sidelined or sucked into the elites which are in thrall to the same commercial villains - as in South Africa, where 'the rainbow nation' is a trick of the light from the gated rich, old and new, pissing on the poor, as ever. The capital edifice is left intact to tighten its grip on the 'haves' and 'have-nots' alike.
At least we are sufficiently circumspect when we bang on about democracy - our 'representative democracy' - that we don't mention how we've been unable to stop this global abuse through our parliament, and that the new lands of toppled dictators are going to have one hell of a job plugging democracy into their tribal, ethnic, and sectarian environments. In these situations, plugged-in-democracy favours domination by external forces like the IMF and its cohorts, and favours conservative entrenchment, as in Egypt, mirroring troubled Europe, Britain and the USA.
Here is the crux: Change happens through the imperative for change, not the request. Our street protest, our best attempt to change government policy, is our blindness to their deafness. We can't sway that many votes. We are not a representative democratic movement, a parliamentary pressure group. 'Occupy' has been a tiny minority, despite broad armchair sympathy. Political leaders really don't have to give a toss. Should we now be talking directly to our counterpart tiny minority, the upper echelons of global businesses - rattling their cages where they live, rather than pleading with politicians to do it for us, putting the boss elite on the spot, making acceptable standards of behaviour very clear? Now there's a thought: to make the abusers, who confuse loopholes with ethical behaviour, into pariahs, to make banking very personal indeed.
That would require a lot from us, a deeper form of commitment. We should be aware that we risk brutalising ourselves, losing our way back to our old, our normal, moderate selves. Damaged lives, just like the people we watch sequentially on tv in their uneven struggles against a succession of despots. They pay high. We pay low.
Perhaps the biggest challenge here will be for the pacifist, who feels only able to lobby and march, to 'walk the walk' and 'talk the talk'. It is a big and pragmatic step for them to declare and maintain solidarity with those who accept that more is needed, that someone also has to 'do the deed'. Pacifism, here, happens to be cheap and safe. Realising that we are part of one movement is not. Again, solidarity is the source of the imperative for change. Can we occupy that space together? And can we resolve the contradiction brought about by our privileged lives? When faced with horrific abuse we Brits display an embarrassment of moderation in our protest.

Society for the Protection of Unborn Children has stepped up its campaigning calling on people to write to their MP condemning marriage equality
An anti-abortion group has stepped up their campaign to stop equal marriage from becoming legal in the UK.
Society for the Protection of Unborn Children has sent leaflets to British homes in a way of spreading their anti-gay message.
Titled ‘Stop David Cameron destroying Britain's families', the group argues legalizing same-sex marriage will have a devastating effect on children.
They fear ‘children and teenagers at school will quickly learn about “gay marriage”' and ‘gay relationships will be promoted to primary school children via storybooks'.
‘Being male or female will be meaningless, if any combination can get married,' SPUC says. ‘Marriage will be reduced to gratifying your own personal desires.'
The group says the ‘human cost of legalizing “gay marriage”' is that children will lose out because society will no longer ensure the biological mother and father bring them up.
SPUC wants people to write to their member of parliament, show their support by ordering a car sticker and donating to their group.
Peter Tatchell, veteran gay rights campaigner and director of human rights organization Peter Tatchell Foundation, condemned the group's campaign.
Speaking to Gay Star News, he said: ‘It's ironic that SPUC calls itself the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children yet it opposes the rights of born gay children and adults.
‘Its stand is totally inconsistent. SPUC is very selective about the rights and freedoms it defends.'
The marriage equality bill in England and Wales finished the committee stage on 12 March, and is due to have a report stage and third reading in the House of Commons at a date yet to be confirmed.
Alternative legislation for equal marriage is currently being consulted on in Scotland.

Many parents want to know how to get a baby to sleep through the night Leaving young babies to cry themselves to sleep can harm their developing brains, a parenting expert claims. Dr Penelope Leach says recent scientific tests show high levels of the stress hormone cortisol develop in babies when no one answers their cries. If this happens over long periods and repeatedly, it can be "toxic" to their brains, she says in a new book. Dr Leach suggested unattended extreme crying bouts of 30 minutes or more could be damaging to babies. The claims come in a new book called The Essential First Year - What Babies Need Parents to Know. Some neuroscientists describe it as toxic
Dr Leach told the BBC News website: "We are talking about the release of stress chemicals. The best known of them is cortisol, which is produced under extreme stress." "One is not talking about a wakeful baby lying there gurgling, one is talking about a baby that is crying hard and nobody is responding. "When that happens, and particularly if it happens over a long period, the brain chemical system releases cortisol and that is very bad for brain development. "Some neuroscientists describe it as toxic." The psychologist and parenting expert, who first found fame in the 1970s with her book, Your Baby and Child, said the important thing was for a parent to respond. The mother-of-two said it was not necessary for the parent to discover why the baby was crying. "If you do not respond and if you refuse to respond, the baby knows no response is coming," she added. "The reason that a baby gives up after half an hour, three-quarters of an hour or an hour is that it has given up and that its expectations have been altered. "I've heard it said that babies stop crying because they have learned that mummy wants them to go back to sleep. "Babies are not capable of that sort of learning." 'Harder work' There was no scientific evidence that suggested allowing a baby to "cry-it-out" taught them how to go sleep, she added. It was possible for a parent to make it clear to a baby that they always come, but that they would not always do what the baby wanted, she added. "You can show you are quite different at night - that you don't pick him up and play with him, try to stimulate him or get his Lego out. "We are trying to teach the baby to become diurnal - to know the difference between day and night." She said it was much harder work than closing a door on a shrieking baby but made for a better loving relationship. She said she was not "getting at parents" in her new book, just trying to provide them with good advice grounded in science.

Sprint Nextel lost out in a bid to obtain AT&T documents that would have provided the third-largest U.S. wireless carrier with additional ammunition in its battle to stop AT&T's acquisition of T-Mobile USA.
Reuters reported that U.S. District Judge Ellen Huvelle denied Sprint's request for the documents, which would have also given the company valuable insight into rival AT&T's operations. Huvelle also heard arguments by AT&T seeking to dismiss lawsuits filed by Sprint and regional carrier C Spire in an attempt to block the T-Mobile deal. She has not yet made a decision on their standing as opponents of the merger.
AT&T's planned purchase of T-Mobile is under significant threat from the Justice Department, which has sued to block the deal. Sprint and C Spire have hopped on as well with their own lawsuits.
AT&T has said it is working on two tracks in an effort to salvage the deal, the first a possible settlement and the second the building of its court case.
Sprint, meanwhile, has argued that it should obtain documents that AT&T has provided to the Justice Department so it can adequately build its own case. Sprint also said AT&T already has the documents Sprint has given the Justice Department.
Reuters reported that Huvelle declined to give Sprint the documents. "I don't see it as efficient or fair," Huvelle said in denying the motion.
Sprint, for its part, called the denial of the documents and the review of its legal standing "procedural," saying they don't involve the merits of the case itself. The carrier argues that AT&T's potential acquisition of T-Mobile would stifle innovation and hurt consumers, as it would remove a low-cost provider of wireless service.
Half a year after the 0.5 release we provide the first bugfix release which brings interpreter fixes (as usual), a few new features and resolves a crash we encountered in 0.5.
Crashes fixed
Unfortunately our Tone performace improvements had a bug which resulted in a crash when the ChipSet is smaller than the default size and the tone is changed. This broke at least Aëdemphia and Mystic Star (#1037, #1048).
Audio changes
This time the audio subsystem changes are not as significant as for 0.5.0. For the normal user basicly nothing changed. The audio system uses now a generic code which handles all the mixing of music and sound effects. This allows us to heavily simplify the code of our ports.
SDL mixer is now an optional dependency. For the Wii version we dropped SDL mixer completely, the same will happen soon for the Android version. The 3DS and Vita code were improved and the 3DS version finally supports MIDI playback and all noise-bugs when playing sound effects should be gone. The new Vita audio code results in a much better performance and less lag (#968, #1100).
Map interpreter
Screen shake, a very elementary feature of RPG Maker, got implemented. Besides Video playback this was the last event command that wasn't supported (#565). You can see a screen shake in the video below.
The move command “Change graphic” incorrectly changed the current movement frame to “middle”. The frame is now untouched which fixes a visual issue in the intro scene with the red haired woman in Velsabor (#658) and a glitchy door open animation in Deep 8 (#1114).
The PicPointer patch got implemented (#1033). This is a quite popular modification of RPG_RT which allows using Variables to point at pictures. This fixes the games Aëdemphia, Sternenkindsaga and probably many more.
The ship in Dunkle Schatten never arrived to rescue the party. Movement event commands for vehicles were simply not working (#1050).
The method “Remove all equipment” of event command “Change Equipment” was not implemented. (#1050).
Picture rotations and sine wave effects were not stopping when a “Move Picture” command didn't contain any effect. Additionally rotations take care of the remaining rotation time now and stop the image always when it is at the initial position, if there is not enough time left for another full rotation. (#1046, #1063)
The custom battles in Razas did not start because they are invoked through a parallel event which does a teleport followed by a transition. Parallel events of old maps stop executing forever when they are interrupted, which was the case for transitions. We fixed this behaviour (#1032).
Due to a bug in our performance improvement code of 0.5 we broke the transparency when rotating images that had no alpha channel. This affected the UFOs in Yume Nikki (#1077).
The room “SH1” in HOME hanged our Player, because the code to move events away lacked a sanity check and this room contained more than 10 cows which push each other (#1082).
The boat minigame in Wolfenhain did not start because boarding of vehicles during a teleport resulted in a hang (#1079).
When the hero is placed directly on a “Same level as hero” touch event the event is not executed anymore. This fixes a softlock in Rip-The-Blood's Ford in Space Funeral (#1084) and allows further progress in the game Sternenkindsaga (#1086).
Touhou Alive (東方ALIVE) did a huge amount of out-of-bounds reads in the variable array. This array is dynamically resized but our code was not optimized for this many resizes resulting in a significant framedrop (#920).
Events that are above or below the hero and have start condition “Hero Touch” don't trigger anymore while a move route is executed. This fixes incorrect teleports into cities while travelling with the airship (which is a scripted airship, not a vehicle) in Mystic Star (#1051).
The event command “Change Event Location” supports now changing of the facing direction for the “Constant location”-case (#1118).
The tutorial of The Huntress of the Hollow was impossible to continue because a bug in the handling of “Change Class” resulted in the Scout skill being removed, which must be invoked once to proceed in the tutorial battle (#1131). Additionally we fixed the “level up” and “skill learned” message box behaviour when using “Change Class” to match RPG_RT.
Battle interpreter
The “Enable Combo” battle command was implemented (#945). Skill reflection and Skill (de)buff are supported now by the battle system (#1069).
A really annoying bug in our RPG Maker 2000 battle system resulted in actors executing multiple attacks per turn. We were aware of this bug since a year but had no idea what was causing it. In the end the cause was that we removed actions from the wrong side of the action list (#933).
The hit rate calculation for normal attacks and the calculation of fatigue were incorrect (#1055). The escape algorithm was fixed, escaping is much more unlikely and escape correctly plays a sound effect now (#1103).
The skill “Eule” was not working in Wolfenhain due to a bug in the check for “BattleCommand used” (#1080).
Two additional game breaking bugs in The Huntress of the Hollow were fixed. We didn't handle the “Abort Battle” command correctly and executed the Victory handler instead which resulted in an incorrect cutscene (#1127). The battle interpreter halts now immediately when any battle end condition (Victory or Lose) is fulfilled. This game called a common event after killing all enemies and this event hanged the interpreter. Now the event is not called anymore because killing of the enemies is a victory condition (#1129). Note that this is actually a game bug… ;-)
The “Preemptive Attack” setting is now respected when starting battles in RPG Maker 2000 (#1137).
Other improvements
Our built-in font Shinonome got a proper Wave dash (〜) for japanese and missing glyphs are now indicated by a replacement glyph. Additionally some glyphs were visually improved (#1045, #1047).
The WenQuanYi font was added to Shinonome. This allows proper rendering of most chinese glyphs (#1058).
The FPS counter got a semi-transparent background to make it easier readable on bright backgrounds (#1049).
The keys Page Up and Page Down are supported now in single column selections (like the game browser or the menu). This makes scrolling in long lists more convenient (#1049).
When the map was looping, event tiles appeared half a tile too late (#716).
Due to an error in our rendering code, parallax backgrounds jumped sometimes (#761). The same issue resulted in an incorrect background in the designer room in Embric of Wulfhammer's Castle (#961).
The rendering order of Pictures and Battle Animations depends on the version of RPG Maker used. Currently EasyRPG renders battle animations behind pictures but since RPG Maker 2003 1.05 and RPG Maker 2000 1.50 the order was swapped. We added additional heuristic to handle this edge case (#1031). This is mostly noticable in the battle system of Live Together.
VX-Ace like charset behaviour (width and height are calculated based on the image proportions) can be enabled now by prefixing the filename with a $ (#1067). This is just a visual change, the Player won't adjust the rendering order for too large CharSets.
The “redo” function in the infamous reordering scene was broken and cancel correctly removes the last selected actor now (#1072).
The calculation of the string length when writing LSD files was incorrect when the strings contained non-ascii characters. This was no problem for our Player, but RPG_RT refused to read these savegames and reported “Stream read error” (#1090).
A very rudimentary input record and replay functionality was implemented. This functionality is not useful for general use yet and is used for testing purposes (#1096).
The random number generator (RNG) uses modern C++11 random APIs now which should improve the randomness and the RNG is now portable which means you get the same sequence of random numbers on any platform. This is important to get deterministic replays (#1104).
The item usage count (for items with more than one use) was handled incorrectly which resulted in infinitely usable items when loading a RPG_RT savegame (#1087).
It is now possible to speed up the game (3x) by pressing “F” or through a new touch button on Android (#1010). Because the music speed stays normal this can break a very small amount of games which use the music position in events.
Shop merchants paid the full price when selling items. The deal is now more in the interest of the merchant: The price is halved (#1110).
Event IDs were not correctly restored when loading a savegame. This resulted sometimes in the warning “Event ID 10005 is invalid” because ID 10005 refers to the current event and for this lookup you need a proper event ID. This resulted in minor issues in Yume 2kki that were fixable by leaving the virtual computer (#1131).
Panoramas were not correctly rendered when a savegame created by RPG_RT was loaded (#1071).
Improvements to RTP handling (#1139):
The environment variables for adding RTP paths support now multiple directories (delimited by “;” on Windows and “:” everywhere else).
The official English RPG Maker 2000 RTP is now supported.
Our EasyRPG RTP is now supported (though, still quite incomplete).
Basic support for mouse and touch input was added. This is currently opt-in and must be enabled through the command line arguments “enable-mouse” and “enable-touch”. These features are the first step for a multi-platform touch UI (#1057).
Android
The Android game browser supports displaying of title images in XYZ format now (#1074).
The “Report a bug” function crashed on Android 7 due to changes in the security model (#1105).
Wii
The Wii version finally supports automatic encoding detection through the ICU library. The Wii version was the only one that lacked ICU, due to the CPU of the Wii which is a PowerPC. PowerPC is “Big endian” and most other platforms (like PC or Android) are “Little Endian”. The endianess influences how bytes are stored, e.g. Big stores as AA BB CC DD and Little as DD CC BB AA, so you have to swap the data (we do this when reading LDB and other files). To compile for Wii we “cross compile”, that means we use a compiler on our PC, that generates PowerPC code for the Wii (that's faster and more convenient), but ICU doesn't support mixed endian builds (because their build system involves running some tools on the PC which don't support byte swapping). But we were finally able to find the bug in the ICU build system and now have a working version for the Wii (#1095).
PSVita
The Vita version supports now shaders. To toggle them you have to use the 4 corners of the screen. This may not be very intuitive but we still lack a generic settings Ui :). The rendering runs now in an extra render thread, this means the framerate slightly improves and shader effects will not slow down the Player at all (#1078).
liblcf
A heap corruption bug in “ReadString” was fixed (#194). The usual safety rule applies: Don't run content from untrusted sources through liblcf or in EasyRPG Player. The Player is probably easy to exploit using a malformed file but we try to keep liblcf safe :).
The calculation of the event size for non-ascii strings was wrong. This was the same bug as in the Player but in this case it fixes the problem in other tools like xml2lcf (#196).
The XML converter for LMU (Map) files doesn't write an empty ID field any more (#186), which was never intended to be used anyway and caused confusion.
A Chinese translation of Wadanohara was detected as encoding GB18030 which is not included in the ICU version used by most of our ports and resulted in an error. This encoding is now handled as Simplified Chinese (codepage 936) (#187). This game is a really bad mojibake-offender: To get correct filenames you have to extract the japanese Wadanohara archive with a Simplified Chinese encoding.
liblcf doesn't update the timestamp value of savegames anymore. This was problematic because lcf2xml wrote a new timestamp each time the files were converted instead of using the original one. EasyRPG Player sets the timestamp correcty during save now (#195).
The default value for a Battle2 animation_id is now “1”. This fixes an invalid animation error (e.g. in Space Funeral: Legend of Earth Birth) when the first animation is used as Battle 2 (#193).
In an effort to gin up interest in his newly revamped "Celebrity Apprentice" in 2008, Donald Trump entertained a controversial idea: bringing on O.J. Simpson as a contestant.
The proposal was quickly and unequivocally shot down by NBC at the time. The company released a statement in April 2008 saying, "NBC representatives have never considered O.J. Simpson for the next season of 'The Apprentice,' nor will."
But in interviews on television and on the radio, Trump talked about how he wanted Simpson — who was acquitted for the murder his ex-wife in a sensational 1995 trial — on his reality show.
"I do have to tell you about O.J. and 'The Apprentice,'" Trump said in July 2008 on the Howard Stern Show. "NBC went totally crazy when I wanted to put O.J. on The Apprentice."
Trump added that while he was friendly and played golf with O.J. before the murder trial, he abandoned him when he "realized he killed his wife."
"Why would you put him on the Apprentice?" Stern asked
"Well you know, in your business, there's a thing called ratings. And, you know you can come up with a cure for cancer — I found out a lot about your business — because, hey, I'm the biggest star. I'm now the biggest star," Trump said. "So I know that if you come up with a cure for cancer, and if you put it on, and if it doesn't get ratings, they will not broadcast it."
"So, you come with a cure for a disease, no good. Now, I know this if I put O.J. on huge ratings. Oh, forget it, 35 million people," Trump said.
"So did O.J. call you and..." said Stern.
"I don't want to go into it, but O.J. would have done it," said Trump. "I can't go into the details."
Trump refused to answer if he spoke to Simpson about the show when asked directly.
Trump said, "I hadn't spoken to him in years, I don't like people that kill their wives. Does that make sense? Does that make me a disloyal person?"
It's unclear exactly when Trump considered Simpson for his show. Simpson was arrested in September of 2007 for his involvement in a robbery at a Las Vegas hotel. In October 2008, he was convicted of all 12 charges against him.
Trump also told Extra in May of 2008 NBC had "heart attack" at the thought of Simpson on the show. "Let's say that NBC, when I mentioned O.J. Simpson, had a heart attack," Trump said. "They weren't thrilled. I'm not saying I would have cast him, either, but it was certainly somebody that would be interesting."
Simpson was a recurring topic whenever Trump would appear on Stern's radio show. Both Stern and Simpson attended Trump's 1993 wedding to Marla Maples.
In an interview from 2004, Trump recalled seeing Simpson and his wife at a restaurant in Los Angeles.
"I'm sitting having dinner and O.J. came up to me — I was sitting with very important people, big bankers, nobody that you know, big, big bankers, and we were sitting there, there were six of us, and O.J. came up," Trump said. "And he was talking to us for about three minutes, and Nicole, was with her mother I think, and she came over, and she started screaming at him, 'get over to the table, what the hell are you—' she was rough, in all fairness."
"So, he decided obviously to kill her," Trump said, laughing.
"It might have been right at the [restaurant] that he decided it," Stern responds.
"She was very tough," Trump continued. "She came over and she really embarrassed him, she was screaming at him. She didn't care. And that was before 'The Apprentice' so she didn't give a damn about me. Now she'd be kissing my ass. Now I'm the biggest star on television, she'll kiss my ass."
"You would never kill one of you ex-wives, would you?" Stern asked.
"Uhh, I could think about it," Trump replied, laughing.
"It would almost be that absurd to think that O.J. killed his ex-wife," Stern said. "It would be that absurd to think you killed your ex-wife. That's what I read in the paper today. In other words, it was out of character it seemed for O.J. Nice O.J."
"Other than all of the beatings that were called into the police station and later retracted," Trump said. "There were a number of them, Howard. Like about six times."
Trump added, "You know she did call six times and screamed: 'help, help, help he's beating me up, he's beating me up' and the next day they dropped the charges. That's not totally normal. That's not Fred and Mary Trump, do we agree?"
Why is it that some brands launch like meteors, captivating our imaginations and our wallets, only to fall spectacularly into marketing oblivion? And perhaps more importantly for marketers today: How can this fate be avoided? The answer lies in the difference between what is required to generate initial trial of a new product, versus building a relevant equity that stimulates ongoing interest and repeat business.
Looking backwards from today's vantage point, it might be easy to dismiss brands like Listerine Pocketpaks or TiVo, but at the pinnacle of their success they had a Jeremy Lin-like, out-of-nowhere stardom that had consumers all atwitter, brought riches to their corporate owners, and had competitors searching for answers. What is it about these brands that relegated them to eventual irrelevance, while other brands with meteoric success remain on top? And what does the future hold for today's meteoric brands like UGG boots or Keurig coffee?
First, we need to dispel the myth that there is any long-term “first-mover” advantage in marketing brands. This may be true at the start, but ultimately it is the companies able to adapt to changing conditions that thrive. That is to say, survival of the fittest brands, not the first brands, drives the market. Neither Google, nor Amazon, nor even Gillette was the first brand in its respective category that it now leads. So while some “boom, splat” brands were the first to popularize innovative benefits–such as digital video recording–this distinction alone is insufficient to defend against encroaching competition and a restless consumer.
In 2001, Pfizer's Listerine brand, then famously known for its antiseptic mouthwash, launched Listerine Pocketpaks breath strips. The product not only helped the brand extend into a new category, but also created awareness, relevance, and reinvigorated the parent brand's equity in fresh breath. Everyone needed to try the distinctive strip format and unique sensory experience. A true innovation blockbuster, brand awareness and trial were off the charts and year one sales exceeded $175 million, quickly establishing it as the number-one brand in the category. But by 2003, brand sales were already off by 40%-50%, fueled by intense competition with copycat products and a consumer seeking more exciting offerings from strong brands like Altoids, Tic Tac, and icebreakers. Today under new ownership, Listerine Pocketpaks remains a viable business, generating about $25 million in annual sales, but is a shell of its initial success.
One contributing factor to the brand's fall may be the polarizing product experience. However, even if some consumers were ultimately not wowed by the product and did not repeat purchase, the brand still managed to engage enough consumers to drive it to category leadership, so the answer may lie more with the brand than the product. Listerine Pocketpaks were so closely associated with a product form, rather than a brand equity, that it lacked the authority to sustain a category leadership position. The brand may have been more successful had it pinned its brand proposition on, say, Listerine freshness to-go or intimate togetherness or anything other than the product form itself, which was quickly copied.
Listerine effectively did not leverage a strong point-of-difference compared to its new competitive set (i.e., mints), beyond a hot new product form. Once the form novelty wore off, the brand did not find a way to win versus other brands doing an equally good job offering a minty fresh experience. The breath-mint consumer was then free to switch to a competitive breath strip, or align with a conventional format mint brand with strong appeal on both a functional and emotional level, such as Altoids.
Listerine is not the only “boom, splat” brand to soar behind the short-term functional difference of a unique product format. In other categories, Motorola's ultra-thin Razr phone or Pert's 2-in-1 shampoo both come to mind. In these cases, too, there was no meaningful second act following the initial success of the brand launch. Loyal consumers seeking the next level of involvement were left with nowhere to go but the competition offering newer, shinier objects for sale.

Revision: e6ffa1986af7
If Giant Sparrow's The Unfinished Swan was equal parts a celebration of both sorrow and delight, What Remains of Edith Finch is very clear with its intention to embody strictly the former. Through this, the game sends the player on a journey both real and metaphysical, taking control of Edith Finch to explore the grim past of her largely deceased and decaying family tree.
It's true Edith Finch is yet another Gone Home-style walking simulator, but by now the genre is entrenched enough that such labels should not be held against it. Rather than swipe the style of other games, What Remains of Edith Finch carves out its own niche, its own story beats and, ultimately, its own unique and morbidly affecting mood.
Little Remains of Any Finch
The first thing you should know about the Finches is that they're terribly ridden with misfortune. Though its tone is far more straight-faced, I was nearly reminded of Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, as the outcome for most members of the Finch family can only be described as impossibly grim and terribly unlucky. This is even reflected somewhat in the game's artstyle; though decidedly more Gone Home meets BioShock than anything Tim Burton, the Finch's cobbled tower of a home could easily house the likes of Count Olaf or Aunt Josephine. Better yet, you might even expect to find it within one of Tomorrow Corporation's charmingly macabre 2D jaunts. But I digress.
What Remains is structured as a series of vignettes, with each room in the Finch's home representing a deceased family member via which Edith can gather clues, insights, and even experience scenes from the past. Welcome is the variety brought to clue gathering; while it's true some genre staples appear (recordings, notes, journals, and the like), there are also creative means of obtaining info that I won't spoil here, but you'll surely tip your cap to Giant Sparrow for. Despite this, I did feel clue gathering grew a bit stale as the game progressed – I realize many players feel these segments build suspense or establish mood, but for me if they last too long the opposite begins to occur. Admittedly, it could be the fault of this particular reviewer, as I doubt the excessive combing-over of every last nook and cranny is necessary outside of an escape-the-room setting. My advice would be to search but not scour, and the pacing will likely work out for you.
The Finch mansion is spooky, but not horrifically so; despite a rather unsettling opening, the title is more Luigi's Mansion than Resident Evil or Silent Hill (except with far more death and morbid imagery). Traversal is better than I thought possible – monotony is alleviated by constant environmental stimulation, be it Edith's memories overlapping with reality or actual bits of text appearing in her line of sight to offer clues or information. There are certainly moments of familiarity straight from other games, but on the whole they're co-opted tastefully; the game moves its curious genre in the right (or at least a new) direction, and for that it should be commended.
Uncovering the Truth
With all of that said, What Remains of Edith Finch is more about story than gameplay, and the passive vignettes that detail each family member's death are going to be the highlight for most players. Some are certainly stronger than others, but stepping into the shoes of each and every Finch in their final moments before certain death delivers an eerie sensation. Something about being in their shoes, but knowing you aren't actually them but Edith's consciousness, heightens awareness and, of course, adds to the “visceral spookiness” the game is so adept at conjuring.
As I progressed room to room I came to anticipate these vignettes, hungry to know how and why the next Finch passed on, and compare that with my theories based on what I'd uncovered to that point. I'll admit as the game wore on I grew just the slightest bit weary of the formula, but thankfully this is an experience that does not overstay its welcome and knows precisely when to tie things up.
Unfortunately, neatly tied up is not exactly how I would describe Edith Finch's conclusion, and while I'm all for open-ended, philosophical, or contemplative conclusion, I can't deny that ultimately I did feel a little bit let down. I'm the sort who craves the “why” of any situation, and as such not earning a wordy, overwrought breakdown explaining the Finch's inability to not die was, to me, a disappointment. This is purely my own stance, however; some players no-doubt prefer subtle delivery that leaves the player room to interpret or imagine, and if that's you then you're sure to enjoy the Finch's tale start-to-finish even more than I did. For me though, the journey far outdid the destination, for better or worse.
Conclusion
Ultimately I consider What Remains of Edith Finch less essential than The Unfinished Swan, but certainly not less worthwhile. This is a moody, thoughtful, and often harrowing account of Edith and her tragedy-ridden kin, and if you're the sort who finds tragic or adverse accounts to be of the highest profundity, you'll likely adore what's displayed throughout this exploration of mansion, mind, and psyche.
If you're more like me, though, and deviate from the assessment of tragic events as an inherently higher form, then you may find the Finch's tale doesn't activate your almonds as much as it probably should. Still, as a spooky, logical evolution of the Gone Homes and Firewatches of the world, with an impressive short-story style to boot, What Remains of Edith Finch is ultimately worth your time if its premise grabs you.

Nokia Corp, the $44 billion company at the time of writing those lines, is suffering from constant market share decline, caused mainly by the $230 billion Cupertino, California-based Apple, through its iPhone line of mobile phones. In 1999, Nokia peaked with 203 billion Euros market value, the highest of any European company. How did this Finnish conglomerate fall from grace? Time for some lessons.
Nokia; the empire that could have been
According to a study released by Millward Brown Optimor in 2010, Nokia came in 43rd in brand-ranking, tumbling 30 places in a year, and losing 58% of its brand value. In 2009, Nokia posted its first loss since the company began reporting quarterly in 1996. In my book, it's time for the Finnish multinational communications and information tech company to learn few things from the name of their pain; Apple, which I summarize here in 6 points:
If we sue them, they will sue us back
On 22nd Oct. 2009, Nokia filed suit against Apple, accusing it of hitching a “free-ride” on its intellectual property. On 11th Dec. 2009, Apple filed a countersuit accusing it of the same. It kept on getting uglier afterwards, with both companies asking to ban the products import of each other.
Street smart CEOs tend to outdo lawyers with expensive suites
After joining Nokia in 1980 and holding many posts since, the law graduate Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo (OPK) became CEO in 2006. The very next year, 2007, marked the beginning of the Finnish giant downward trajectory after Apple launched its first iPhone in 2007. Steve Jobs, who became CEO of the decade in 2009, was called the Apple's imperious, brilliant CEO who transformed American business by Fortune magazine.
Copying with pride will get us nowhere
When questioned in August 2007 about a Nokia concept interface similarity to the iPhone, Anssi Vanjoki – Nokia's Executive VP & General Manager of Multimedia replied: “If there is something good in the world then we copy with pride.” That pride got Nokia nowhere, as they failed to deliver. When compared to what the iPhone's interface can perform, the Finnish phones did not score high.
Launching a single new model every year is better than every week
Nokia is known for coming out with too many new models, like a new model each week. A newly released Nokia phone can become something of the past in 3 to 6-month time period. On top of that, those ‘new” models usually offer very similar features and functions. Users hate to carry an outdated or not-unique-enough phones. On the other hand, the iPhone smashing success proved that many users can and will buy a new model every year.
Users want hyped touch-based solutions
Hype, touch, coolness and desirability. Those are the things missing from Nokia phones. Prior to the iPhone era, Nokia was completely convinced that mobile phone users do not want touch-screens phones. This fatal assumption was based on the lousy performance of the Windows Mobile phones back then. I believe that had it not been for Apple, we'd be still pressing keys and suffering with Symbian nightmares till the current date.
Half-Arabs can kick ass
By birth, Steve Jobs is half Syrian. The Middle East was Nokia's favorite playground, where it enjoyed selling its high-end phones with GREAT profit margins. All was good and green until the iPhone took that region by storm. It became the new trend for its users. To help keep its market share, Nokia lowered its prices and watched in pain while its profit margins dwindled, in that region – and everywhere for that matter.
Other Lessons We Can Learn from Nokia's fall
1 – Don't over-trust your customer polls and feedback
Nokia fell for what it considered its most strength point: staying close to customers and giving them what they requested, based on extensive studies and polls, and reliable feedback. My wife used to be loyal to keys-only phones, never to consider those touch-screen ones. Lately, she started to hear her colleagues and friends brag about how cool is the new iPhone.
This hype made her borrow my iPhone 3G to see for herself what this fuss is all about. When she used her two fingers to zoom in and out while going through our daughter's photos saved on the iPhone, she changed her mind completely. She bought the iPhone 4 right aftwards.
2 – Always have backup plans for dramatic changes in customer's behavior
Back in the old days, Nokia faced some lazy competition from the lousy Microsoft Mobile Windows phones, but those were (and still are) pathetic to say the least. You needed a stylus pen to navigate and launch applications. Synchronizing your phone with your PC had a 50-50 chance to fall through. Buying a Symbian application depended on how good you are at reading users' walk-through and troubleshooting guides.
Nokia did not feel a real threat from crappy Windows Mobile phones, but that totally and dramatically changed overnight when Apple launched its iPhone. Nokia should have had “reliable” plans for a situation when its loyal customers would change their minds and start purchasing touch-based mobile phones.
3 – Less is more
How many times have your read this phrase before: Less is MORE? How many experts are shouting for consumers and companies to learn from this basic principle? Now count how many companies are following it! Take for example Samsung, which is following Nokia's footsteps, launching endless mobile phone models left, right, and center. I challenge any veteran Samsung salesman to list ALL the models Samsung has launched in the last 2-3 years. For Apple's iPhone, I can do that myself.
How UC Berkeley went from free speech to costly tuition
I'm going back to the UC Berkeley campus this week for the 50th reunion of the Free Speech Movement. You may have heard in some history class about Mario Savio and the first student sit-in of the '60s. That was us FSMers.
It will be a little surreal. A university that had nearly 800 of us arrested in December 1964 is welcoming us back by hanging Free Speech banners on the building we occupied. We're coming home like a victorious football team. But it's not a real victory, because the same forces that tried to shut us up in the 1960s have a more chilling form of control over U.S. college students today than they ever had over us. Today, it's not police control; it's economic control.
Attending Berkeley cost me $62.50 a semester. That covered registration, lab fees, health care and a student body card. My tuition was free. (It was $600 for out-of-state students.) Today, in-state tuition and fees total $12,972 per year.
There's been inflation, of course, but nothing that begins to explain this huge jump. The increase also can't be explained by the cost of new stadiums and lavish buildings, which we intellectual alumni love to deplore. Nor is it due to teachers' salaries. Low-paid adjuncts do much more of the teaching today. Top academic administrative salaries, like top corporate executive salaries, have increased beyond inflation, it's true, but not by enough to account for a tuition increase from nothing to nearly $13,000.
My tuition could be “free” in the 1960s because higher education was supported by state and federal funds. But since my school days, the rich have rebelled against paying taxes. With so much government support gone, the bulk of tuition must now be paid by students themselves. But salaries have stagnated at best, so a lot of that increased tuition is financed by borrowing.
I realized how much this prospect must dampen the campus atmosphere when I opened the UC Berkeley website and clicked “cost of attendance.” Before I got to the dollar amounts, I was assured in big letters, “A Berkeley education earns our graduates an additional $26,333 each year in income over those who did not go to college.”
Since Berkeley is still an excellent school, its students will surely learn to recognize the slippery wording and limited predictive value of that undocumented statistic on future earnings. They will therefore worry about the debt they're piling up. And they're right to worry.
Thanks to intense bank lobbying , student loans are uniquely punitive. Most can't be refinanced, which means that people who borrowed at 8 percent in the 1990s are still paying 8 percent. Unlike other loans, student loans can't be discharged in bankruptcy, and a borrower's salary, Social Security and even disability checks can be garnisheed.
We went to college to discover how to do something “worthwhile” with our lives. Today's graduates, even from good schools such as Berkeley, don't have that security.
I'm looking forward to seeing old friends at the reunion. I suspect we'll spend a lot of time wondering if there was something we should have done then, or could have been doing more of since then, to make things come out differently. Maybe the indebted generation will figure it out and take our old adversaries by surprise, as we once did.

Years before prosecutors say he illegally financed an election effort for Mayor Vincent C. Gray, a local businessman allegedly secretly spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on behalf of at least seven other candidates for mayor and the D.C. Council, according to several people familiar with the payments.
Jeffrey E. Thompson, who is under federal investigation for allegedly financing a $653,000 secret campaign for Gray in 2010, allegedly made similar expenditures dating back to at least 2006, according to two people with direct knowledge of the payments who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing.
Thompson boosted the mayoral campaign of Linda W. Cropp, a Democrat, seven years ago with more than $100,000 in alleged illegal spending, the people said. He allegedly spent smaller amounts on behalf of former council member Michael A. Brown and the insurgent council candidacies of Patrick D. Mara, a Republican, and Mark H. Long, an independent, in 2008. And he allegedly spent still more in 2010 for council hopefuls Jeff Smith and Kelvin Robinson, both Democrats, and in 2011 for council member Vincent B. Orange (D-At Large).
Though the sums of money were significantly smaller than the amount that went into what has become known as the “shadow campaign” for Gray in 2010, such expenditures could reveal a pattern in which Thompson appears to have wielded vast influence for years over the District's political process.
Cropp and Mara denied any knowledge of the payments, as Gray has done regarding the alleged secret effort to help him in 2010. The other candidates either couldn't be reached or, through attorneys, declined to comment.
That keeps the focus of a
21 / 2 -year investigation into political corruption in the District, for now, on Thompson.
Prosecutors appear to be methodically building a case against Thompson, who was for years one of the District's largest contractors and who, court records suggest, is the subject of a grand jury investigation.
An individual matching Thompson's description has been mentioned on numerous occasions in court documents as allegedly funding the “shadow campaign” for Gray (D) as well as arranging illegal “straw” donations made with his own money but disclosed as coming from employees and other associates.
While declining to comment on any particular allegations of wrongdoing, Bill Miller, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office, issued a statement Friday that said: “It is clear from our office's public corruption prosecutions over the past several years that we will not excuse criminal activity as business as usual. We plan to continue vigorously investigating and prosecuting crimes that deprive D.C. voters of the fair and transparent elections that they deserve.”
Most recently, Thompson secretly paid for T-shirts, campaign signs and field workers in 2011 to help return Orange to office, the individuals asserted. In that campaign, Orange relied on some of the same players implicated in the parallel campaign for Gray the prior year.
One of those people, veteran field organizer Vernon E. Hawkins, recently has been in talks with federal prosecutors about entering a possible plea agreement in connection with his work on the Gray shadow campaign, according to several people familiar with the negotiations who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation continues.
The deal, which will not be final until a judge accepts it, is expected to be made public as soon as this week, according to two people with knowledge of the investigation. If charges are filed, Hawkins would become the latest in a series of Thompson associates to be implicated in the scandal.
William E. Lawler III, Hawkins's attorney, declined to comment on the allegations that his client was involved in unreported expenditures for other campaigns. He also declined to comment on whether Hawkins has signed a plea agreement with federal prosecutors or whether there are any plans to do so.
Thompson's alleged activities were often, but not always, coordinated with his longtime associate Jeanne Clarke Harris, a public relations consultant who admitted in federal court last year to participating in the shadow campaign for Gray by funneling Thompson's money through companies she owned.
Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., an attorney for Thompson, could not be reached and generally does not comment on his cases. Harris attorney Mark H. Tuohey III did not respond to an e-mailed request for comment.
City campaign finance laws impose limits on donations and spending and require political committees to report their activities even if they are not officially coordinated with a campaign.
In recent months, prosecutors have obtained guilty pleas from two other Thompson associates who admitted being a part of what U.S. Attorney Ronald C. Machen Jr. called an “assembly line” for donations run out of Thompson's firm.
Brown, the former council member who had been a Democrat but ran as an independent in 2008 and 2012, also admitted to secretly accepting money from Thompson. He told prosecutors that Thompson provided him with a $20,000 payment, sending it through a company Harris owned. Brown then reported it as a donation of his own money to his 2008 campaign.
Little has been publicly aired, however, about alleged illegal spending in support of other candidates Thompson favored in the years before the 2010 mayor's race and in the 2011 at-large council contest.
The money, according to the people familiar with Thompson's spending, allegedly went to support a variety of activities, from campaign literature and canvasser stipends to election-day food and transportation for voters and poll workers.
None of the candidates received support to the extent that Gray did, the individuals with knowledge of the expenditures said, and the candidates Thompson backed did not always win. But the alleged undisclosed assistance appears to have allowed the city businessman to skirt campaign finance limits and not reveal to incumbents that he was backing their long-shot challengers.
Federal investigators are aware of the alleged unreported spending on behalf of some of the other candidates and have reviewed receipts and other records that document some of the payments, according to two people close to the investigation. The three-year statute of limitations to file misdemeanor campaign finance charges has expired in most cases.
Cropp, the former council chairman who lost to former mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) in the 2006 mayoral primary, said she had no knowledge of any illicit spending made by Thompson for her campaign. “We had a campaign that was above board,” she said Wednesday.
She called Thompson a “good fundraiser” for her campaign but said she was unaware of any other activities he had undertaken.
“In that campaign, I was busy,” she said. “I had never been busier. All I wanted to do was my job as chairman, and I campaigned very hard.”
Campaign finance records show that Cropp's 2006 campaign made a series of publicly reported payments to one of Harris's firms, Details International, totaling more than $68,000 for a wide range of services listed as advertising, campaign materials and rentals.
Off the books, the sources asserted, Thompson spent more than $100,000, covering additional costs for campaign materials and transportation for canvassers and voters.
Mara, who won the 2008 Republican primary but lost to Brown in the general election, said he was not aware of any payments Thompson made on behalf of his primary campaign.
Former council hopefuls Robinson and Long, who went on to serve as Gray's driver during the 2010 mayoral race, did not return messages seeking comment. Smith could not be reached. Brian M. Heberlig, an attorney who represented Brown in his June guilty plea to a federal bribery charge, declined to comment because of his client's ongoing cooperation with the government's investigation.
Thompson, according to two people with knowledge of the arrangement, backed Orange during his 2010 run for council chairman. But the more serious effort came in 2011, the individuals said, when Orange won a special election to fill the at-large seat vacated by Kwame R. Brown (D), who had defeated Orange in the chairman's race.
Some of the same figures known to have had roles in the Gray shadow campaign helped Orange that year, according to several individuals with direct knowledge of both campaigns.
According to interviews with several Orange campaign workers, Hawkins was a regular attendee at high-level campaign meetings, helping to organize field outreach and participating in strategy discussions. Harris, too, was seen on several occasions at the campaign's Georgia Avenue office, several workers said. At least three other Orange 2011 staffers had also worked on the Gray shadow effort, those workers said.
Andi Pringle, a political consultant who worked for the 2011 Orange campaign, confirmed that Hawkins advised the Orange campaign and said that she saw Harris at the campaign office before the election.
Hawkins, who was employed at the time as an administrator for Union Temple Baptist Church in Anacostia, does not appear on campaign finance reports Orange filed for the 2011 campaign. Workers said Hawkins was reticent to be formally associated with the campaign, asking not to be included on mass e-mails and, in at least one instance, telling workers in a meeting they were to refer to him only as “Eugene.”
At least two Orange workers have been interviewed by federal authorities in recent months. One reported being shown invoices and receipts for political activities that were not listed in the campaign's public financial disclosures.
Orange and his campaign aides have not been named in court documents. Orange did not respond to several phone messages and e-mails seeking comment. Joseph F. Johnson Jr., the campaign's chairman, declined to comment.
In June, Orange acknowledged he had met with federal prosecutors about his past campaigns. “Certainly the U.S. attorney is doing their due diligence,” he said at the time.
Orange previously disclosed that, during the 2011 campaign, he accepted $26,000 in contributions, largely through money orders, that were later connected to Thompson or Harris. During his reelection campaign last year, Orange said he considered those donations — some of which featured similar handwriting and sequential serial numbers — “suspicious and questionable” upon closer examination, but he later claimed vindication after a city audit.
Wow! Just.. Wow. This exchange has lived up to my hessitant expectations and beyond. I was already very excited to participate; thinking of all the horrorstories about people getting shafted during previous exchanges I thought to myself "SEND ALL THE THINGS!" and apperantly my match thought somewhat of the same.
After waiting anxiously for about a week after I saw my package was sent, it finally was here! IT WAS HERE! Jumping in joy from the pretty wrapping to carefully tearing it open and seeing what's inside; a pretty card and a white t-shirt... I didn't see the printing yet and decided to keep it that way to read the letter first. But curiousity somewhat killed the cat when I saw a flashy tag sporting the Hard Rock Cafe Logo. Puss in Boots couldn't have put on larger, more happily surprised eyes then I had at that point.
A million times and more thanks to SweetSnowDemon for being the thoughtfull person she is. I can't even imagine what it must have been like in Japan right after the eathquake(s) and I love that my match chose for charity in the process. My boyfriend and I both got the World of Warcraft pets to support Japan as well and I like thoughtfullness in that way; without going out of your way or anything and knowing you're doing something good.
Thanks SweetSnowDemon for being totally awesome and making my week! This was more than worth the anxious waiting.
HUNTSVILLE, Ala. — President Trump campaigned on Friday night for Alabama Senate candidate Luther Strange, in a race that has pitted him against his most loyal supporters and that holds the potential to upend the political dynamics for Republicans facing election in 2018.
The endorsement of ‘Big Luther' could prove to be a big boost for the interim Alabama senator, who is trailing his opponent, former state judge Roy Moore, in some public polls. But even Trump seemed unsure that the endorsement was the right move.
“I'll be honest, I might have made a mistake,” Trump told the crowd at one point during his nearly 90 minutes of remarks.
“If Luther doesn't win they're not going to say, we picked up 25 points in a short period of time,” he added, referring to the media. “If his opponent wins, I'm going to be here campaigning like hell for him.”
After some musing, he seemed to catch himself.
“Luther will definitely win,” Trump said.
It may not have been exactly the ringing endorsement Strange's campaign had hoped for, but it would have to do.
Trump is jumping into the special election at a time when Strange could use all the help he can get before the primary election on Tuesday night. The Alabama Republican is favored by establishment Republicans including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), but has been pilloried by Moore, who has fashioned himself as an outsider Republican in the mold of Trump himself.
For his part, Strange has draped himself in Trump in an effort to win over the president's ardent supporters. So much so that the Friday night rally bore few signs that its purpose was to boost his candidacy.
Everything about the rally — the mega stadium, the massive American flag, the “Make America Great Again” hats — screamed Trump. There were few signs that the rally was for anyone else, except for the giant Trump campaign-styled “Vote for Luther” sign that hung in the background.
The president delivered a signature rally speech, meandering from topic to topic, prompting laughter, and chants of “Lock her up!” from the crowd when he mentioned his former Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. He denounced the “dishonest media” who he said would not broadcast images of the crowd (though they often do). And he complained about the treatment of first lady Melania Trump in the media.
Then, without much warning, Trump returned to his prepared remarks touting Strange.
“Luther wants to end business as usual, stop the insider dealing and Luther Strange is determined to drain that swamp,” Trump said, in a brief interlude.
Trump talked at length about Strange's willingness to vote in favor of the Republicans' bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act without seeking any favors in return. He said his endorsement of Strange came despite his unwillingness to wade into an ongoing primary.
“We have to be loyal in life,” Trump said. “He never went quid pro quo, he just treated me great.
“And I'm calling him. He was down like quite a bit and I said I'm going to endorse you,” Trump continued. “I shouldn't be doing it … The last thing I want to do is be involved in a primary.”
But Strange had given him one of the “coolest” moments of the last six months of his life, Trump told the crowd. So he came to Alabama to get out the vote for Strange in the final days of the primary campaign.
But, quickly, Trump was back to his usual campaign fare.
He boasted of his electoral college win.
“They said there was no path to 270 but there was a path to 306,” Trump said.
He admonished Clinton for failing to travel to Wisconsin during the campaign and dismissed the idea that Russia interfered in the election to help him.
“In case you were curious, no, Russia did not help me,” Trump declared.
He returned again to Strange, who apparently watched the rally from somewhere offstage.
Both men were on message on one important point: The Senate majority leader was persona non grata.
“He's not a friend of Mitch McConnell, he doesn't know Mitch McConnell until recently,” Trump said, decrying the “bad rap” that Strange's opponents had saddled him with as an establishment candidate. “He doesn't know him, he just got there!”
Moore, a controversial former state judge, boasts the support of prominent pro-Trump figures, including two ex-White House staffers, chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon and his terrorism aide, Sebastian Gorka.
At a rally in Montgomery on Thursday night, former Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin pitched the race, and Moore's candidacy, as a fight for the soul of Trumpism.
“A vote for Judge Moore isn't a vote against the president,” Palin said. “It is a vote for the people's agenda that elected the president. It's for the big, beautiful movement that we're all a part of. The president needs support to keep the promises that elected him. So we're sending Trump someone who has our back, not Mitch McConnell's … Make no mistake, ‘Big Luther' is Mitch McConnell's guy.”
The dissent among Trump allies even came from within his own Cabinet.
Housing and Urban development Secretary Ben Carson issued a statement on Friday backing Moore's candidacy, an extraordinary endorsement that came just hours before Trump was set to arrive in Alabama to campaign for Strange.
“Judge Moore is a fine man of proven character and integrity, who I have come to respect over the years,” Carson said. “He is truly someone who reflects the Judeo-Christian values that were so important to the establishment of our country.”
Recent polling in the state shows Strange trailing Moore despite the political muscle backing him.
Republicans worry that if Strange falls to Moore, the race could launch a tsunami of outsider challenges to incumbent Republican lawmakers in the next midterm election.
Trump warned the crowd that Moore would be vulnerable to losing to the Democratic candidate in the general election while Strange would sail through to victory.
“Roy has a very good chance of not winning in the general election,” Trump said. “Roy is going to have a hard time, but I will be backing him if he wins.”
And he lamented that Strange, who he noted had fought against public corruption in his previous career as attorney general of Alabama, had been saddled as an establishment candidate. Strange was appointed by the Alabama governor to fill the seat vacated by former senator Jeff Sessions, who has become the U.S. attorney general in the Trump administration.
“Friends of mine have told me very strongly that if Luther wasn't appointed in office … he'd be leading every poll by 50 points,” Trump said. “But the fact that he got appointed hurt him.
“If Luther didn't take an appointment, if he just ran, it wouldn't be a contest,” Trump said.
As Trump faces the prospect that his chosen candidate might not emerge the victor, he has fixated on what his endorsement has done to help Strange catch up in the polls.
“If Luther doesn't make it, they're going to go after me,” Trump said, referring to the media. “He went to third, second and now it's almost pretty even right?”

The University of Houston will lead a new Gulf Coast hurricane research institute to examine flood mitigation, hurricane modeling and public policy as part of a multi-state effort to respond to damages wrought this year by hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria.
Seven universities in Texas, Florida and Louisiana — including Rice University — will contribute a combined $1.87 million to finance collaborative projects, with additional funding expected from external grants.
The institute puts Houston at the center of hurricane research, which had been scattered across the state and region after storms killed dozens of people, disrupted local economies and caused billions of dollars in property damage.
"Academics are nonpartisan — we think about data and information, we guide the conversation, we don't have a vested interest in one solution versus another," said Hanadi Rifai, a UH civil and environmental engineering professor and the center's director. "(We will be) a very important resource to entities that don't have that capacity."
Other universities joining the institute are Texas Tech University, the University of Texas at Tyler, Louisiana State University, the University of Miami and the University of Florida. The center will be based in UH's engineering college.
Rifai said UH is still reaching out to other campuses that may be interested in joining.
Harris County Judge Ed Emmett said more study could mean better storm predictions.
"Harvey was nothing but a tropical storm days before it hit," he said. "And then suddenly it became a hurricane...If we had someone to tell us what it is that caused Harvey to blow up into a hurricane instead of a tropical storm, that would help us."
BEFORE & AFTER: Satellite photos show extreme damage of Hurricane Harvey
The center builds on a wide-ranging research effort in Texas that began after Harvey's floodwaters receded.
Professors and students in Texas spread around the state to examine environmental, economic and social issues, and UH's Rifai said she expected the center to fold in some of the work that has already started.
Researchers have tested water, tracked social media cries for help, examined mangroves and the Port Aransas coast and evaluated damage to libraries. An oral history project at UH will track Harvey's human impact.
Philip Klotzbach, who specializes in the Atlantic hurricane forecasts at Colorado State University, called the pace of research after Harvey and the development of the center "jaw-droppingly quick."
The National Science Foundation issued requests for proposals after Harvey, Irma and Maria.
Moving forward, Klotzbach said that collaborative research is needed in forecasting storm strength, understanding why residents do not heed warnings and studying building codes.
"There's a lot of interest," he said. "Given what happened and the level of damage we saw in your neck of the woods, people are moving very quickly."
New findings have been released frequently this fall — including a landmark paper presented Wednesday at the annual American Geophysical Union in New Orleans.
Researchers found that global warming made Hurricane Harvey's more than 50 inches of rain three times more likely to occur when comparing today's climate to that of the 1880s. These extreme rain events will continue to occur if climate change continues unchecked, they found.
That's why policymakers "need to consider climate change in our design of infrastructure," said Antonia Sebastian, a Rice post doctoral researcher who is a coauthor on the paper.

NATURE RULED, MAN REACTED: Harvey was Houston's reckoning (HoustonChronicle.com)
The institute's beginnings reach back to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, when Rice, LSU and UH academics began working together.
John Pardue, an LSU civil and environmental engineering professor, recalled the good relationships and smart ideas that followed. One development was Rice's Severe Storm Prediction, Education and Evacuation from Disasters center, through which specific faculty at various institutions work on storm research.
Pardue said he hopes to expand on SSPEED's work with the new center, both in the types of faculty who will submit proposals and in widening the scope of research to Florida.
"In some respect this builds a bigger plate for that effort," he said. "Miami, New Orleans, Houston — there are three distinct situations there. By focusing on those three case studies, we could really cover a lot that could be of real help to (more than) those cities."
Philip Bedient, director of the SSPEED center, is leading Rice's involvement in the new institute, a Rice spokesman said. Bedient was unavailable for comment Wednesday.
Rifai, the UH director, said emergency preparedness has come "a long way" since Katrina and that the center's research should continue to look forward.
Participating institutions are public and private, regional and elite. Each is contributing financially to the center's projects; UH put in $500,000.
Administrators say they hope research from the project will inform policy on preparation and damage mitigation.
"The solutions may not lie with one faculty laboratory at a particular university," said Amir Mirmiran, UT-Tyler's provost.
Faculty at UT-Tyler have already focused their research on strengthening residential and commercial buildings to withstand hurricane forces, including better roofing systems, he said.
Faculty from the universities will evaluate research proposals and recommend which ones proceed. Projects considered by the institute will fall into one of six categories: mitigation, assessment, prediction, prevention, educating residents and recovery.
Center leaders say any faculty member from a participating institution can apply for hurricane-related research funding as long as the proposal involves collaboration with a professor at a different participating institution. Applications from professors for the first round of project funding will be due early next year.
Amr Elnashai, UH's research vice president, said he envisions such projects as a data-driven program to help officials relocate displaced residents or a simulation tool for decision makers that would show the outcomes of possible scenarios in times of crisis.
Emmett said he hopes the center will provide information that can help emergency management officials gauge potential risk from approaching storms.

Brian Crecente's time with Polygon is just about up. The gaming site's executive editor today posted Brian Crecente's time with Polygon is just about up. The gaming site's executive editor today posted a series of tweets indicating he will be moving on from the site he helped launch in 2012.
"Packing up my stuff for a last visit to the @Polygon office today," Crecente wrote. Earlier in the day, he had teased that he had big news to share, adding, "That feeling when you're leaving somewhere you love to go somewhere that's amazing."
One possible destination for Crecente is Rolling Stone-owned Glixel, which recently One possible destination for Crecente is Rolling Stone-owned Glixel, which recently laid off its key staff and shut down its San Francisco offices with the intention of continuing the brand out of Rolling Stone's New York headquarters. Crecente's tweet about his last visit to Polygon included a picture of his laptop, Nintendo Switch and other items, along with a copy of Rolling Stone, prompting some replies speculating that he would be going to Glixel. The New York-based Crecente seemed to confirm that in a follow-up tweet , saying, "No hint is subtle enough when you're dealing with the internet. ;)"
Crecente was a founding editor with Polygon, heading up its news operations from the time of its launch. Prior to that, he was the editor-in-chief of Gawker's gaming blog Kotaku for seven years. Crecente also has a background in hard news, having served as a police beat reported for the Ft. Worth Star-Telegram, Palm Beach Post, and Rocky Mountain News.
[UPDATE]: Crecente has since confirmed that he has joined Glixel as its new editorial director.
The last 20 years or so of Reds baseball have provided us countless derivations on a particular theme: the scrub starter. The Reds have been notably bad at developing quality pitchers for a good long while (consider: the best pitching prospect developed by the Reds between Tom Browning in the mid ‘80s to Johnny Cueto in the late ‘00s was Brett Tomko) and so we have had the great displeasure of seeing an absurd chorus line of scrub starters kick their heels on the Cincinnati rubber. Some personal favorites: Joey Hamilton, Chris Michalak, Kirk Saarloos, Adam Pettyjohn, Jerry Gunglesprout, and Danny Serafini.
It seems just about every year, the Reds reach way down to the bottom of the barrel to get one of these scrubs to pick up a start or ten. They look overmatched, they get shelled, and they get waived. It seemed to me that these past few years, Tim Adleman was that guy.
Listen: this guy was drafted in the 24th round in 2010 by the Orioles. He pitched about 150 innings between two seasons for them before they gave him the shitcan. He spent his age-24 and 25 seasons in independent ball. That's two prime development years living in Lincoln, Nebraska and El Paso, Texas throwing junkballs at high school heroes and deluded jocks. Hell, Timmy himself was probably called that and worse. He spent 2013 playing for the New Jersey Jackals of the Canadian-American Association. As a reliever. He threw well enough to catch the eye of a Reds scout and he signed with Cincy just after the 2013 season ended. But, c'mon: this guy's pedigree just screeeeaaaams Scrub Starter.
And, well, I guess something happened. He started 2014 with Pensacola and he was good. He spent 2015 with Pensacola again, and again he was good. In 2016, he was good in Louisville. In fact, his career to date in the Reds minor-league system has been really, really good. In almost 300 innings between AA and AAA, his ERA is a shade over 2.50. Last year, he got his first call to the big leagues. At 28 years old, he made it. And, well, he was kinda good. He made 13 starts with an ERA of 4.00.
This season, his spring training was a disaster. He kinda got himself outta whack tinkering around with a fourth pitch. So even though the rotation was notably decimated by injuries and they had to press 40-year-old Bronson Arroyo into service, Adleman started the season in Louisville. Which, I mean, of course. Indyball dude is never given anything. So Tim went down to Louisville and earned himself a spot back in the rotation.
And, well, dang. He has been pretty good. In 3.5 starts (in his first he only threw 57 pitches) he has a solid 4.22 ERA. The Cardinals bopped him around a bit on April 28, but otherwise he has looked good. His K/BB is an impressive 5.0 and his 1.125 WHIP would earn Cy Young votes in a full season. The only concern for him so far has been the longball: he has surrendered five tomaters already. Of course, that is on an absurd 16.7% FB/HR percentage, which is kinda out of whack with everything else. There is a not-crazy-at-all future where this guy, Tim “Straddlin” Adleman, settles in as a solid starting pitcher.
Taking a look over at FanGraphs stabilization page, you see that some of these really good numbers Adleman has put up so far are well within the range of stabilization. His low walk rates and decent strikeout rates have a pretty good confidence number of continuing like this. So far for his career, his WHIP is 1.187, which is Johnny Cueto territory. The batted-ball numbers are gonna need more batters faced to really smooth out, but there is plenty to suggest here that he may well not be a fluke. That concerning home run rate still has some time to settle down, too. And if he can keep a few more of those long fly balls in the park while keeping free passes to a minimum, baby, you got a stew goin'.
Look, I'm not saying this guy is a rotation anchor. But I'm not saying he's a mirage, either. Hell, Paul Wilson once threw a complete game five-hitter. But in a system that is in the process of sorting through a dozen young and talented arms, they would be wise to give him an honest to goodness shot. For every Eric Milton and Justin Germano, there is a Bronson Arroyo. Well, it's really more like 20:1. So for every 20 Eric Miltons and Justin Germanos, there is one Bronson Arroyo.

An increasing number of British servicemen are seeking help
They sit around his bed and stare at him.
"One of them used to come up to my face but he had lips and no eyes, just sockets and they were badly burnt", he recalls.
Without the sleeping tablets, the British serviceman would be up several times a night with these nightmares - often waking up screaming.
Cpl Meighan had 10 tours of duty during his 14 years in the army.
He witnessed the consequences of allied bombing on the so-called Highway of Death, the road out of Kuwait City where retreating Iraqi columns were decimated during the first Gulf War.
It was when he returned home from this campaign that the nightmares began.
He is one of the 260 regular clients of retired Sqn Ldr Steve Pettitt, the east of England's Welfare Officer for Combat Stress, the ex-services mental welfare charity.
Sqn Ldr Pettitt spends his days driving around the region visiting men and women who are suffering psychological problems arising from their time in the armed forces.
Usually it is Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) which develops after someone has been exposed to some sort of traumatic event.
Sqn Ldr Pettitt said: "I have clients who at the sound of a plastic water bottle going pop in the street might hit the ground because they think it's a mortar."
They send us out to war but they don't pick up the pieces when they come back
Cpl John Meighan
Those affected can see relationships breaking down along with problems with alcohol, violent outbursts, difficulties in holding down a job, even homelessness.
Sqn Ldr Pettitt currently works with Northern Ireland veterans and people who have served in Bosnia and the first Gulf War.
But he believes the intensity of fighting in Afghanistan, and the operations in Iraq over the past five years, will see a big increase in his caseload.
He said PTSD can take hold more than a decade after the sufferer has left the forces.
Combat Stress nationally is facing a 27% increase in referrals in the past two years with 175 Iraq and 29 Afghanistan veterans currently being helped.
The charity has had to deal with nearly 1,000 new cases in the past year alone and more than 8,000 veterans are now registered with them.
Among the Iraq and Afghan vets being helped by Combat Stress, the eldest is 60, the youngest 21. Their average age is 32.
Regular mental health services can often not meet the needs of veterans
Half of Combat Stress' £6.5m annual expenditure is met by the Ministry of Defence and last October the Veteran's Minister Derek Twigg announced a 45% increase in the government's contribution.
Additionally, six special treatment centres are being set up around the UK as part of a two-year pilot scheme, with each one offering specialist therapy.
If these centres are a success, then the scheme will be expanded.
This is a recognition that regular NHS mental health services are often not able to meet the specific needs of veterans.
Sqn Ldr Pettitt said: "We've found that a client will go to the NHS and find they've nothing in common with what's being discussed in the therapy group, that the therapist doesn't understand at all what the person has seen."
Some of the experiences recounted by veterans during NHS group therapy sessions have been so horrifying that it left everyone in the room traumatised.
Cpl Meighan said he felt abandoned when he developed PTSD.
He said: "They send us out to war but they don't pick up the pieces when they come back."
He has a son who is a soldier currently serving with the Royal Anglians.
Kenny Meighan said some of his colleagues suffered mental distress following a recent tour which saw hard fighting in Helmand Province.
He said: "You live in a room with eight men and you see them sleeping and you see them having nightmares, shouting out.
"It just worries me because I've seen it first hand with my father - I don't want to come out like that and I don't want my friends to come out like that."
EARTH CITY, Mo. -- Working with their fourth coordinator in as many years, the St. Louis Rams' defense spent the 2014 offseason trying to play catch up. While there was plenty of talk about coordinator Gregg Williams' scheme being rooted in similar philosophies as Rams coach Jeff Fisher, the differences in how it was run were a bit undersold.
The result was a defense that struggled mightily out of the gate, went on a dominant run but was ultimately too inconsistent to carry the Rams to an improved record. With Williams returning, the emphasis has been on starting fast, a task that should be made easier by the fact that continuity abounds at every position.
Instead of spending an offseason getting to know one another, Williams and his coaching staff were able to zero in on what their players do well and what they don't. There was no guesswork this time since Williams actually spent an entire season coaching his players.

So Williams and Co. spent a chunk of the offseason putting together video cut-ups for each player. The individualized videos included strengths and weaknesses for each player and conversations about how to improve on the weaknesses and expand on the strengths.
Williams believes that time spent together should lessen the chances of a slow start and jumpstart a defense that to this point has looked capable of great things though it hasn't really achieved them.
“There's also more of a buy-in when a coach talks to you individually," Williams said. "It's one thing for a coach to talk to all the defense. It's one thing for a coach to talk too just to his position area. But the coaches went the extra mile, each one of the assistants that work for me, and went to an individual report on an individual player because not all players are the same."
Williams used the example of defensive tackles Michael Brockers and Aaron Donald to illustrate his point. While they're both playing the same position, that's true in name only. Donald is an up-the-field penetrator with the primary function of causing disruption. Brockers has more of a dirty work job detail which requires him to take on multiple blocker so others, including Donald, can make the play.
Factoring that into account, Williams points out that it's not just about playing different roles but coaching those players in a way that helps them in their jobs rather than coaching all defensive tackles the same way.
"They play the same position, but their technique, the way they play is different," Williams said. "So how do we go about impacting growth and development on each individual guy? I thought our coaches did a really good job of that. But more importantly, it was fun for me to see the players buy into that."
The self-scouting process didn't stop with cut-ups from the 2014 season, either. Williams and his staff put together individualized reports on each player detailing his progress through the course of the offseason program. That updated report included notes on areas of growth and areas that still need to work so players could streamline their focus when they return for training camp at the end of the month.
As part of his work, Williams has also been able to spend more time devising schemes that best utilize all of his players, including backups who might not project to play much on game day. While much is made of the players getting to know the new coach, the coach also took some time to get to know his players and how to use them. There was only so much Williams could learn from film before last season.
Now, Williams has a much better read on such matters and has been able to dig deeper into his bag of tricks. According to Williams, he has 42 packages available that involve different combinations and schemes but they don't always get used for fear of creating confusion. During the spring, the Rams worked with about 18 of them as Williams wanted to focus on simplifying things as another method of starting faster.
All told, the Rams should be far better equipped to get off to a fast start defensively than they've been in recent years.
"It's light years on where we were last year because they didn't know me and I didn't know them," Williams said. "Just from a terminology, are we speaking the same language? Do we understand what we really want? It took a little bit of time for all of us to get acclimated last year. Now we're hoping we can start off faster this year because there's a knowledge, a base of information that we all know is the same.
"The other thing is, and I've said this before to you guys, ‘When will it ever be more important to them than to us?' The good teams that I've ever been on and some of the greatest defenses I've ever been a part of, it was much more important to them than it was to me. These guys have kind of taken ownership in that, so it's been fun."

MOSCOW (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin, who whiled away the time playing the piano while waiting Sunday for the Chinese leader, says he has not decided yet what he would play when he meets U.S. President Donald Trump.
U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met Putin with in April, followed by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's meeting with Trump at the White House several weeks later.
The date for the much-anticipated meeting between Trump and Putin has not been set but it's likely that they would meet at the G-20 summit in July in Germany.
Asked Monday by reporters which song he would play when he meets with Trump, Putin said they “need to meet first, talk and then choose the tune to match.”
Blogs The Large Hadron Collider has been operating for a few months now, and it hasn't ripped apart the space/time continuum – not where I live, anyway, and that's mostly all I care about. Of course, it could be that it's still early, and that the cumulative effects of accelerating particles really fast could still spell the end of everything. Until that happens, the LHC is generating enough data to keep scientists busy from now until doomsday (unless doomsday is in the next couple of years).
A recent story from Forbes tech correspondent Lee Gomes brought home the scale of the LHC and the storage challenge. The 150 million sensors each take 40 million pictures per second – which results in what anyone will admit is a fairly large amount of data. In terms of pictures per second, we're talking six thousand trillion: a six with 15 zeros, or 6x1015. That's only slightly more pictures than my mom takes at a family reunion using her 15-year-old 35mm camera – and far less annoying.
According to the story, most of this data is just uninteresting noise. But it all has to be sifted through to figure out which bits are worth a closer look. The total amount of ‘good stuff' should amount to around 15 petabytes per year.
To crunch through this treasure trove of data, the WLGC (Worldwide LHC Computing Grid) utilizes systems in more than 130 sites across the world, totaling more than 100,000 processors. Data from collider runs is sent to Tier 1 sites at a rate of 4GB/sec, where it is archived to tape for future analysis.
These same sites also feed data out to secondary sites as needed to feed their research appetites. There are some interesting videos on the CERN site discussing the grid and the challenge of handling LHC data.
So far the LHC has yet to find the Higgs boson or other particles or forces predicted by theoretical physics, but that's the cool thing about having a Large Hadron Collider – it means you can finally test to see how closely reality conforms to theory.
If they do manage to figure out the true nature of the universe by recreating conditions that existed at the moment after the Big Bang, you can be sure it will be covered in The Reg… unless there's some late-breaking scandal involving salacious text messages and nude starlets. In that case, we'll cover the universe thing a few days later. ®
Literature
Silence
It rings in your ears,
Like empty static
A simple nothingness;
Oblivion.
But if you listen long enough,
When your heartbeat slows
And your mind grows dull,
You will hear new sounds.
Sounds unlike anything before.
Almost comprehensible, but not quite.
Seemingly human,
But not quite
Whispers will echo around you,
Overlapping in a fight for dominance;
Turning to screams.
Unintelligible utterances
However, listen closer
You will understand them
You will understand their cries
Their emptiness.
You will understand their agony
Their longing
You will understand,
But not until it is too late.
A voice cannot exist on its own,
And each scream, each echo
They all belong to someone;
Something
Deception, trickery
The voices were echoing your future
Their screaming, your screaming
Their suffering, your suffering
The absence of sound
But the presence of pain
No longer a simple nothingness
Now brimming with dread
You cannot bear to listen
Any longer
But the voices
They have consumed your consciousness
Ben Kuzma talks to Canucks general manager Jim Benning about the search for a left winger.
Jim Benning doesn't have a crystal ball.
If he did, the Vancouver Canucks' general manager might see a clear vision of what's required to bolster his NHL club. He would see a winger with size, edge and scoring ability. He would then go into sticker shock at the price for aging unrestricted free agents because the Canucks have about US$4 million in available salary-cap space and need to come to contract terms with restricted free-agents Andrey Pedan and Alex Grenier.
It means a trade is the only road Benning can travel. And even that can include a number of potholes because trying to pry a player out of another organization in a win-win scenario is rare. You might have to retain salary of a player dealt. You may have to take on baggage to complete a deal and, of course, you always hope to unload a significant salary and open a roster spot.
Despite the versatility of floppable right-wingers Anton Rodin and Alex Burrows, the greatest need for the Canucks is a true second-line left winger. On a better team, Sven Baertschi would be a third-liner and allowed to build on a career 15-goal season without the pressure to take his game to another level in the hard-hitting and fast-skating Pacific Division. Benning acknowledged as much.
“We'd like to add a proven scorer who brings some grit to take the pressure off Sven, so he can keep developing at his own pace,” said Benning. “He took a big step last year and wants to prove to people that he has more to give. But I don't know where he's going to end up (next season). At some point, that (second line) is where he's going to be, but maybe he plays on the third line with the capability of playing on the power play and potentially scoring 15 to 20 goals for us.”
Ben Kuzma and Jeff Paterson take a look at how the 2016-17 Canucks roster is going to shake out on the latest episode of the Pat-cast.

To make a trade happen to provide that career cushion, the Canucks could move Jannik Hansen. At 30, he's coming off a career 22-goal season fuelled by playing with Henrik and Daniel Sedin and has two more years left on his contract at a $2.5-million cap hit and $3 million annually in actual payout. That's very attractive to other clubs. But so is Hansen's versatility, two-way effectiveness and breakaway speed on the penalty kill. Benning didn't dangle Hansen at the trade deadline or the draft and he won't now.
“We're not moving Jannik,” he stressed. “I thought he was excellent for us last year and with the way the game is going with speed and skill, he fits that description perfectly. And we have him under a good (cap) number the next couple of years, so we're not looking to do anything.”
Which tells you everything about the plan to be more competitive. Adding 30-goal winger Loui Eriksson, 30, in free agency and big defensive defenceman Erik Gudbranson, 24, via trade — and also keeping both goalies — means the accent to maximize two years left on the Sedins' deal is obvious. Rolling the one-year contact dice on Rodin with a $950,000 cap hit means the Swedish Elite League most valuable player with 16 goals and 21 assists in 37 games could displace another winger.
But where does he play? If the Canucks land a second-line winger and Baertschi moves down, wouldn't it make more sense to play Rodin on the right side and on the third line behind Eriksson and Hansen?
“Rodin is a skilled player and quick with a good release on his shot and we've seen our league gravitate toward that type of player,” Benning said of the 5-foot-11, 181-pound Stockholm native, whom the Canucks drafted in the second round in 2009. “I think he can be an effective player in the top nine and that's where I see him fitting in.”
The right side is deep with Eriksson, Hansen, Jake Virtanen, Emerson Etem, Derek Dorsett and Burrows. The left side is a curiosity. Brendan Gaunce was moved there in the minors to develop a better grinding game, but he also looked good in the middle down the stretch. It's also fair to ask how sold the Canucks are on Etem and how much they really need Virtanen's size versus a need to develop a total game.
“We've been talking to some teams and it would be a hockey trade,” summed up Benning. “The first part of free agency was guys signing and the second layer is going to be teams wanting to move contracts or bodies. Teams know what we're looking for and we'll see how it goes.”
OVERTIME: The Canucks confirmed one-year, two-way contract extensions for left-winger Mike Zalewski, 23, and goalie Richard Bachman, 28. Zalewski, who played three NHL games last season and had 16 goals and 17 assists in 58 games with the Utica Comets, is a two-way depth player and will receive US$632,500 at the NHL level and $100,000 in the AHL. Bachman had another year left in his deal and the extension —$650,000 (NHL) and $450,000 (AHL) — will give the Canucks a stopper under contract for 2017-18 to meet the criteria to expose a goalie in the Las Vegas expansion draft. Bachman went 17-12-5 last season with the Comets and had a 2.75 goals-against average and .900 save percentage.

THE FIRST-PERSON SHOOTER spectacle that is Ilya Naishuller's Hardcore Henry certainly comes at a strange time. Amid US-EU sanctions against Russia, escalating international tensions (Ukraine, Syria, Armenia), and resurgent Cold War rhetoric on all sides, explodes a Russian-American film collaboration claiming to be the first of its POV-stunt-camera kind. While “you,” as the eponymous cyborg Henry, combat the minions of an albino Russian warlord in an attempt to rescue the princess (that is, “your” sex-kitten scientist wife, a painfully embarrassing role executed here by pop sugar Haley Bennett), the vivid Moscow backdrop affords the opportunity for a wild pastiche of overlapping clichés and embraced appropriations. Russia, Eastern Europe, and the Balkans have long been the preferred landscapes for ultraviolence and prostitution in the Western imagination (cf. Slavoj Žižek). Sometimes “the West” projects its brutal fantasies onto Russia; sometimes a willing Russia gleefully seizes on those fantasies and runs parkour with them.
As threadbare as Hardcore Henry 's plot may be, it misses few of the requisite Cold War–era anxieties. An effeminate, if unimaginably powerful, tyrant seeks to take over the world. Akan — whose name is uncomfortably close to Arkan, the real-life Serbian paramilitary warlord indicted by the UN for crimes against humanity during the Bosnian wars — is a bleached and unrecognizable Danila Kozlovsky, an otherwise lovely Russian theater and film actor with several dozen films to his name. For some reason, he is an albino with telekinetic powers, but no matter; he commands inexhaustible armies of Russian fighters, brainwashed cyborg mercenaries, and the equally interchangeable bodies of writhing white-wigged sex workers who afford the usual visual distraction. (The cast credits include Girl in Brothel 1 through 29; no joke.) The film's sole hope and hero is the invisible Henry, whose eyes we inhabit. An American cowboy 2.0, Henry is so much the strong silent type that he doesn't have a voice box. Or memories.
Where the Russian and American imaginations come together particular well, it seems, is in gleeful misogyny. The punch line of the entire 90-minute visual stimulation tornado (spoiler alert) is that “you” get to throw “your” lying whore of a wife off a helicopter. (First-time writer and director Naishuller cast his own wife, actress and singer Darya Charusha, in the presumably more enjoyable role of “Katya the Dominatrix,” one of two women who briefly join the orgy of ultraviolence as participants rather than as victims or décor.) The night that I saw the film, some members of the theater audience howled in pleasure at this climactic conjugal finale. Others, blessedly including my own husband, had long ago fallen asleep.
¤
What makes Henry so hardcore is that his resurrection and conversion to cyborgdom has left behind little in the way of human parts; the reimagining of the action film by way of video game likewise retains less of the former than we might expect. The scorn heaped on the movie in the Western press has been notably virulent — if fairly justified — and suggests another kind of distancing projection. Critic after critic has called Hardcore Henry a movie for folks too lazy to play their own video games. (Watching other people play is a thing, and some even make a living from it: the YouTube genre “Let's Play,” or LP, is comprised mostly of video playthroughs with added player commentary.) For many if not most viewers, however, the first-person perspective gimmick works for about the length of a music video, but not much longer.
As for the claims to technological and cinematic innovation central to the film's marketing campaign, critics have rightly pointed out that the subjective camera has a long history in 20th-century film. Not least among Hardcore Henry 's precursors is the 1947 American film noir Lady in the Lake , Robert Montgomery's directorial debut based on Raymond Chandler's novel with the same name, which was shot entirely from the protagonist's perspective. (Most viewers miss Hardcore Henry 's explicit nod to Lady in the Lake by way of a conspicuous film poster incongruously decorating a Moscow apartment interior.) Sustained for feature length, the subjective camera appears to be at once visually familiar and emotionally distancing to anyone not an adolescent male.
Therein, I would argue, lies one explanation for the critical virulence in the United States. Just as the Twilight films phenomenon forced us to acknowledge both the appetites of preteen girls and our own resulting distaste, Hardcore Henry 's first-person enforces a subjectivity that leaves many moviegoers anxious and angry. “But I don't want to torture him with pliers” is not an option here — nor is it possible to forget that many, many audiences do. Why are we so afraid of teenage boys these days? From Gamergate to school shootings, the answer is as glaring as Hardcore Henry 's narrative flaws or lack of character development. What strikes me in review after wittily scathing review is that, at least in the aesthetic realm, adult elites can have their revenge: “your” fantasies are puerile, if frightening, “Henry.”
¤
Naishuller's cinematic debut met with a dramatically different reception in Russia, where Hardcore (released sans the protagonist's name) was a popular and critical success. One tempting reading of the difference in reception is that contemporary Russian media culture is less repressed in its misogyny — or, to put it another way, more tolerant and comfortable with Hardcore 's masculinist bender. The single scene sliced by the censors before the film's Russian theatrical release was one in which Henry prevents three Russian policemen from committing rape. The fact that Naishuller thought to include it at all already suggests that he might be more interesting than reviewers abroad assume.
For all the American and international presences among the cast and production crew, the film is on some level thoroughly Russian. Hardcore has native roots in Moscow and a home audience to whom the sly allusions, from the casting's inside jokes to the lovingly specific city locales, are profoundly pleasurable. The ensemble of Russian rock, pop, film, and theater stars cast in hilariously atypical roles includes Charusha, who also wrote the music; Naishuller himself; Sergey Shnurov, the lead singer of the rock group Leningrad; and even a cameo by the very highbrow experimental theater and film director Kirill Serebrennikov as a tank driver.
Naishuller and company were in turn so dedicated to getting their shots that they took real physical risks and sustained injuries during the filming. Legendary stuntman Sergey Valyaev and actor Andrei Dementiev reputedly shot the spectacular chase scene on Pushkin Bridge without safety cables, feeling that nets and cables ruined the effect. More than one Russian reviewer read the film as an extreme tribute to the city — Moscow as it has certainly never been filmed before.
In his other life, 32-year-old Naishuller is the frontman of the indie-punk band Biting Elbows. He caught the eye of Kazakh-Russian mega-producer Timur Bekmambetov with the music video that he directed for the band's songs “The Stampede” and “Bad Motherfucker.” In one month alone, the video's stylized POV violence and dark kinetics collected more than 12 million views on YouTube. Bekmambetov, the director and producer of the popular 2004 Russian urban fantasy Night Watch (credited with reviving the ravaged Russian film industry after the breakup of the Soviet Union) as well as crossover Hollywood hits like the 2012 Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter , reached out to Naishuller to ask if he could pull off the same trick for a feature-length action film. As the story goes, Naishuller initially said no, thought about it, and changed his mind. He didn't pull it off, dramatically speaking, but it doesn't matter. Mercenary decision or not, the release of a 90-minute reel of constant choreographic directorial ingenuity has made Naishuller a real name overnight.
It's all too easy to conjecture that Hardcore speaks particularly well to a generation that grew up with the troubled talent of filmmaker Aleksei Balabanov, the post–Soviet Russian answer to Quentin Tarantino, as well as with Tarantino's own stylish revenge fantasy films. (When frequent Tarantino actor Tim Roth appears in a flashback as Henry's father in the only bit of Hardcore filmed in the United States, it's both disconcerting and not surprising at all.) This is a film for — and by — the generation that came of age either during or just after the economic free-for-all of the 1990s. The disillusionment and cynicism that followed Russia's “transition to democracy” is too familiar and depressing a story to warrant repeating here; recent statistics on decreasing life expectancy, extreme poverty, and rising suicide rates reflect just how much worse life has become for average, non-elite Russians since the end of state socialism.
As in previous centuries, misery breeds nationalism and its attendant gender politics. Orgies of masculinism abound across all manner of post–Soviet cultural productions, from highbrow literature to video games of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. variety. (Like Hardcore , S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is a first-person shooter in the survival horror genre. The game was developed by the Ukrainian GSC Game World, and is based loosely on Arkady and Boris Strugatsky's 1971 novella Roadside Picnic , Andrei Tarkovsky's monumental 1979 film adaptation Stalker , and the real Chernobyl nuclear disaster.) The same attitude is arguably reflected in Russia's recent anti-homosexual propaganda laws: homophobia is the flip side of the masculinist cult. Henry's sole sidekick Jimmy, a manic shape-shifting role written especially for South African actor Sharlto Copley, has to protest loudly that he is “straight as an arrow” and brag of his frequent intercourse with the blanched Russian Barbies — because so much manliness (and the occasional Sinatra number) might make us suspect otherwise.
The production history confirms that the film's virile display extends well off-screen. The invisible role of Henry's perspective demands that an unlucky cameraman run parkour wearing Valyaev's specially designed GoPro “Adventure Mask.” But not even extreme-operator Valyaev (a co-producer of the film) could bear the load for long. After his neck pains became excessively hardcore, Valyaev ceded the camera to the actor Dementiev, who, unsurprisingly, had also trained in parkour. Dementiev, too, eventually buckled and reputedly lost a tooth during one of the fight numbers; he shot the rest of his scenes sedated on painkillers. In the end, it took a small army of stuntsmen and Naishuller himself donning the fearsome Adventure Mask before they could capture all the shots necessary to create Henry.
Mind you, all of this is hardly “political culture” or a purely Russian phenomenon, though it is richly culturally decorated here. Hardcore Henry is but one of many signs of the international rise of reactionary postmodernism. After all, the American publics that rushed to the theaters for Hardcore Henry are hardly the same as those writing the reviews. We'll never understand any of it if we don't admit that, for its participants, reactionary postmodernism is tremendously fun.
¤
In the United States, the name Hardcore was already taken, and so Hardcore Henry came to its overseas audience a tad more personalized. But while Hollywood has seen its own rise of parkour heroics in recent years, not least with Daniel Craig's James Bond (again the direct descendent of Cold War precedents), the action genre film as such doesn't appear to work without a hard body to look at. Despite the camera perspective, if anything, Hardcore Henry fails to be immersive enough. For audiences less clued into or amused by the distancing irony, the jokes fall flat — or worse yet, strike a nerve.
For if we do allow that Naishuller is mocking the clichés that he employs rather than hanging onto them for dear life, we might wonder next who is laughing at whom. Whose ludicrous, brutalist fantasy Russia is this? Whose cultural perspective do we really inhabit through Hardcore Henry 's subjective camera? Even the bizarre leitmotif of extreme whiteness (the Brothel Girls; the villain Akan — who has been compared physically to Kurt Cobain, Klaus Kinski, Julian Assange, Andy Warhol, Crispin Glover playing Andy Warhol, and Magneto) suggests a racializing gaze leveled at grotesque, visually foreign Russian villains.
To be sure, Henry's very inhumanity and superior technology make him the better fighter, but he's having a lot less fun than anyone else. The “hero” simply isn't there. We are laughing at ourselves.

FC Dallas began the month of July with an emphatic win over one of the top teams in MLS with a 3-1 win over Toronto FC.
Roland Lamah added two more goals and Maxi Urruti added his tenth of the season in the win.
Lamah put FC Dallas up early in the 5th minute. Maynor Figueroa set up the play with a long ball through the Toronto defense to Urruti. The Argentine then laid the ball back to the to Lamah who was wide open to score his fifth goal of the season.
Lamah doubled up his tally in the 21st minute. Mauro Diaz sent in a long ball through the Toronto defense to find Lamah who beat Chris Mavinga on the right wing before slotting home a shot to the far post by Alex Bono.
Toronto nearly got on the board in the 40th minute on a counter attack. Michael Bradley split a pair of Dallas defenders to find Armando Cooper in the middle of the field. Cooper then played it on the right to Sebastian Giovinco. The former MLS MVP's shot ended up going just wide of the far post.
Ten minutes into the second half Toronto cut Dallas' lead in half with a goal from Marco Delgado. Giovinco got the ball on the left side of the goal. He then played it across the goal where Delgado was waiting to finish it.
Dallas was able to get an insurance goal in the 77th minute on a counter attack from Michael Barrios and Urruti. Carlos Gruezo helped set up the play as he found Barrios free in a two-on-three situation with Urruti. The Colombian got the ball and then played it through to Urruti who was able to beat his defender and then hammer it home past Bono.
FC Dallas returns to action next week as they host their annual July 4th match when they take on D.C. United.
#MeToo Movement Is Person Of The Year, 'Time' Says
It has created a wave of awareness and brave confrontations over sexual harassment and assault, taking down powerful men in the process. And now the #MeToo movement has been named Time magazine's Person of the Year for 2017.
On its cover, Time called the people behind the movement "The Silence Breakers." Its story features women and men who have spoken out — including activist Tarana Burke, who started the hashtag 10 years ago.

#MeToo rose to prominence as a social media campaign in the wake of high-profile accusations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. After actress Alyssa Milano popularized the hashtag, thousands of women began sharing their stories about the pervasive damage wrought by sexual harassment and by "open secrets" about abuse.
The movement's empowering reach could be seen in the platform on which Time announced its choice: the Today show. It was just one week ago that NBC fired the morning program's longtime and powerful co-host, Matt Lauer, over a detailed complaint of "inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace."
While the most high-profile #MeToo stories have come from women and men who work in the movies and media, the Time article also features women who work hourly jobs, some of whom want to remain anonymous. The magazine's cover portrait includes strawberry picker Isabel Pascual, lobbyist Adama Iwu and former Uber engineer Susan Fowler along with Ashley Judd and Taylor Swift.
"The reckoning appears to have sprung up overnight. But it has actually been simmering for years, decades, centuries," Time's Stephanie Zacharek, Eliana Dockterman and Haley Sweetland Edwards write. "Women have had it with bosses and coworkers who not only cross boundaries but don't even seem to know that boundaries exist."
Marking a possible cultural shift back in October, NPR's Sarah McCammon quoted associate professor Lisa Huebner saying of #MeToo, "It helps a lot of people individually, I think, and it also will help us to mark publicly that this is a widespread occurrence, and it's not OK."
The shortlist of candidates for the distinction included:
The Dreamers
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos
Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins
North Korean leader Kim Jong-un
Protest leader Colin Kaepernick
Special counsel Robert Mueller
Chinese President Xi Jinping
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia
President Trump
Time also conducted a reader poll, which the magazine says was won by Mohammed bin Salman, with 24 percent of the votes. Second place went to the #MeToo movement, followed by a three-way tie among Kaepernick, Mueller and the Dreamers.
In the magazine's tally, Trump was the runner-up.
The final decision comes weeks after Trump — who was named Person of the Year in 2016 — said he "took a pass" on being named again in 2017. Trump, who had called it "a tremendous honor" to win last year, said the magazine had been in touch to say he would "probably" win.
The president's comment prompted Time to clarify, "The President is incorrect about how we choose Person of the Year. TIME does not comment on our choice until publication, which is December 6."
A new report published by the Intercept reveals the FBI's wide-ranging powers from the surveillance of journalists to the treatment of informants after the investigative news site acquired a trove of confidential FBI documents.
The 11-part series led by Intercept reporter Cora Currier sheds light on the bureau's vast secret powers, following a months-long study of confidential documents.
The papers include the FBI's governing rulebook, known as the DIOG, and classified policy guides for counterterrorism cases and handling confidential informants.
The investigation exposes the FBI's spying on journalists, its deportation of immigrant informants when they are no longer of use, and other instances of invasive surveillance on targets without need to show suspicion of wrongdoing.

Spying on journalists
The Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide reveals the alarming powers the FBI has to spy on journalists. Classified rules dated from 2013, show that agents need approval from only two internal officials to gain access to a journalist's phone records with a National Security Letter.
The FBI's general counsel and the executive assistant director of the bureau's National Security Branch are required to sign off on the NSL, according to the document. This allows the agency to bypass the normal procedure of going to the courts for a subpoena or search warrant before accessing the information.
If the FBI is trying to uncover a confidential media source by targeting the journalist, it requires additional approval from the assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's National Security Division. However, if they are trying to identify a leaker by targeting the records of the potential source, and not the journalist, the Department doesn't need to be involved.

The 2013 NSL rules for the media mention only telephone toll records.
Thousands of NSLs are issued by the FBI each year often targeting tech companies for data on a user's internet usage and browsing history. These come with a gag order forbidding the company to disclose the request until the FBI lifts the order.
A spokesperson for the FBI, Christopher Allen, would not confirm to The Intercept if the rules had been changed since 2013 but said that they are “very clear” that “the FBI cannot predicate investigative activity solely on the exercise of First Amendment rights.”

FBI treatment of informants
A number of documents reviewed by the Intercept raised concerns about the civil liberties of people sought out as informers. The Confidential Human Source Policy Guide, a classified FBI manual dated September 21, 2015, outlines the process agents must follow in recruiting, handling and separating themselves from informants.
Practically anyone can be targeted as a potential informer – even minors without the knowledge of their parents – if permission is granted from supervisors, according to the manual. Agents are advised to investigate possible informants and gather information on them which can be used to pressurize them if they are unwilling to comply.
Agents can also covertly recruit informers online, using an alias and disposable email, but are allowed to provide a limited amount of information.
FBI blames ‘hostile entities' on decision to withhold information on #SanBernardino iPhone hack https://t.co/1ZH8Zx34Ib — RT (@RT_com) January 31, 2017
The guide devotes a whole chapter to the topic of immigration. Agents are prohibited from working with informants who do not have legal immigration status so are required to assist with this process by liaising with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) before recruiting them as an informer.
However, according to the manual, this is more often than not “temporary immigration relief” and, once they are of no more use to the bureau, agents are ordered to assist ICE in finding them.
“If the [informant]'s location is unknown, the [FBI agent] must work with ICE to locate the individual,” the classified manual reads.
The guide also reveals details of two programs which widen their scope regarding immigrants who can be of a benefit to the agency.
One allows agents to bring “inadmissible or deportable” informants into the US while the other allows an immigrant who otherwise would not be allowed to leave the country and return, to go to another country on FBI business and be permitted US re-entry.
Complaints of the FBI using immigration status as leverage to recruit informants have surged in recent years, according to the Intercept.

This film happened to express some recent thoughts I've been having regarding sin and the nature of forgiveness as well as regarding the possibility of an idyllic small town life. The smaller the number of variables, the more chance of effecting a utopian ideal you might think. The same weaknesses exist everywhere and in all of us. I don't make Grace's mistakes as much anymore. I'm not out to change the world or martyr myself for the greater good. I just do what I can with what I have and try not to be a rat's ass (see quote from last post).
The way the movie is filmed is fascinating. Even though it's stafe-like, you'd still have to shoot it on film for it to work. Brilliant. Dogville is like America seen through the eyes of the brilliant Shirley Jackson.
Anyway, the format of my commentaries is still in flux. I hope it's not too incoherent.
In combinatorics, the factorial number system, also called factoradic, is a mixed radix numeral system adapted to numbering permutations. It is also called factorial base, although factorials do not function as base, but as place value of digits. By converting a number less than n! to factorial representation, one obtains a sequence of n digits that can be converted to a permutation of n in a straightforward way, either using them as Lehmer code or as inversion table[1] representation; in the former case the resulting map from integers to permutations of n lists them in lexicographical order. General mixed radix systems were studied by Georg Cantor.[2] The term "factorial number system" is used by Knuth,[3] while the French equivalent "numération factorielle" was first used in 1888.[4] The term "factoradic", which is a portmanteau of factorial and mixed radix, appears to be of more recent date.[5]
Definition [ edit ]
The factorial number system is a mixed radix numeral system: the i-th digit from the right has base i, which means that the digit must be strictly less than i, and that (taking into account the bases of the less significant digits) its value to be multiplied by (i − 1)! (its place value).
Radix 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Place value 7! 6! 5! 4! 3! 2! 1! 0! Place value in decimal 5040 720 120 24 6 2 1 1 Highest digit allowed 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
From this it follows that the rightmost digit is always 0, the second can be 0 or 1, the third 0, 1 or 2, and so on (sequence A124252 in the OEIS). The factorial number system is sometimes defined with the 0! place omitted because it is always zero (sequence A007623 in the OEIS).
In this article, a factorial number representation will be flagged by a subscript "!", so for instance 341010 ! stands for 3 5 4 4 1 3 0 2 1 1 0 0 , whose value is
= 3×5! + 4×4! + 1×3! + 0×2! + 1×1! + 0×0! = ((((3×5 + 4)×4 + 1)×3 + 0)×2 + 1)×1 + 0 = 463 10 .
(Note that the place value is one less than the radix position, which is why these equations begin with 5!.)
General properties of mixed radix number systems also apply to the factorial number system. For instance, one can convert a number into factorial representation producing digits from right to left, by repeatedly dividing the number by the radix (1, 2, 3, ...), taking the remainder as digits, and continuing with the integer quotient, until this quotient becomes 0.
For example, 463 10 can be transformed into a factorial representation by these successive divisions:
463 ÷ 1 = 463, remainder 0 463 ÷ 2 = 231, remainder 1 231 ÷ 3 = 77, remainder 0 77 ÷ 4 = 19, remainder 1 19 ÷ 5 = 3, remainder 4 3 ÷ 6 = 0, remainder 3
The process terminates when the quotient reaches zero. Reading the remainders backward gives 341010 ! .
In principle, this system may be extended to represent fractional numbers, though rather than the natural extension of place values (−1)!, (−2)!, etc., which are undefined, the symmetric choice of radix values n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. after the point may be used instead. Again, the 0 and 1 places may be omitted as these are always zero. The corresponding place values are therefore 1/1, 1/1, 1/2, 1/6, 1/24, ..., 1/n!, etc.
Examples [ edit ]
The following sortable table shows the 24 permutations of four elements with different inversion related vectors. The left and right inversion counts l {\displaystyle l} and r {\displaystyle r} (the latter often called Lehmer code) are particularly eligible to be interpreted as factorial numbers. l {\displaystyle l} gives the permutation's position in reverse colexicographic order (the default order of this table), and the latter the position in lexicographic order (both counted from 0).
Sorting by a column that has the omissible 0 on the right makes the factorial numbers in that column correspond to the index numbers in the immovable column on the left. The small columns are reflections of the columns next to them, and can be used to bring those in colexicographic order. The rightmost column shows the digit sums of the factorial numbers (OEIS: A034968 in the tables default order).

These are the right inversion counts (aka Lehmer codes) of the permutations of four elements. The factorial numbers of a given length form a permutohedron when ordered by the bitwiserelationThese are the right inversion counts (aka Lehmer codes) of the permutations of four elements.

For another example, the greatest number that could be represented with six digits would be 543210 ! which equals 719 in decimal:
5×5! + 4×4! + 3x3! + 2×2! + 1×1! + 0×0!.
Clearly the next factorial number representation after 543210 ! is 1000000 ! which designates 6! = 720 10 , the place value for the radix-7 digit. So the former number, and its summed out expression above, is equal to:
6! − 1.
The factorial number system provides a unique representation for each natural number, with the given restriction on the "digits" used. No number can be represented in more than one way because the sum of consecutive factorials multiplied by their index is always the next factorial minus one:
∑ i = 0 n i ⋅ i ! = ( n + 1 ) ! − 1. {\displaystyle \sum _{i=0}^{n}{i\cdot i!}={(n+1)!}-1.}
This can be easily proved with mathematical induction, or simply by noticing that ∀ i , i . i ! = ( i + 1 − 1 ) . i ! = ( i + 1 ) ! − i ! {\displaystyle \forall i,i.i!=(i+1-1).i!=(i+1)!-i!} : subsequent terms cancel each other, leaving the first and last term (see Telescoping series)
However, when using Arabic numerals to write the digits (and not including the subscripts as in the above examples), their simple concatenation becomes ambiguous for numbers having a "digit" greater than 9. The smallest such example is the number 10 × 10! = 36288000 10 , which may be written A0000000000 ! , but not 100000000000 ! which denotes 11! = 39916800 10 . Thus using letters A–Z to denote digits 10, 11, 12, ..., 35 as in other base-N make the largest representable number 36 × 36! − 1. For arbitrarily greater numbers one has to choose a base for representing individual digits, say decimal, and provide a separating mark between them (for instance by subscripting each digit by its base, also given in decimal, like 2 4 0 3 1 2 0 1 , this number also can be written as 2:0:1:0). In fact the factorial number system itself is not truly a numeral system in the sense of providing a representation for all natural numbers using only a finite alphabet of symbols.
Permutations [ edit ]
There is a natural mapping between the integers 0, ..., n! − 1 (or equivalently the numbers with n digits in factorial representation) and permutations of n elements in lexicographical order, when the integers are expressed in factoradic form. This mapping has been termed the Lehmer code (or inversion table). For example, with n = 3, such a mapping is
decimal factorial permutation 0 10 000 ! (0,1,2) 1 10 010 ! (0,2,1) 2 10 100 ! (1,0,2) 3 10 110 ! (1,2,0) 4 10 200 ! (2,0,1) 5 10 210 ! (2,1,0)
The leftmost factoradic digit 0, 1, or 2 is chosen as the first permutation digit from the ordered list (0,1,2) and is removed from the list. Think of this new list as zero indexed and each successive digit dictates which of the remaining elements is to be chosen. If the second factoradic digit is "0" then the first element of the list is selected for the second permutation digit and is then removed from the list. Similarly if the second factoradic digit is "1", the second is selected and then removed. The final factoradic digit is always "0", and since the list now contains only one element it is selected as the last permutation digit.
The process may become clearer with a longer example. For example, here is how the digits in the factoradic 4041000 ! (equal to 2982 10 ) pick out the digits in (4,0,6,2,1,3,5), the 2982nd permutation of the numbers 0 through 6.
4041000 ! → (4,0,6,2,1,3,5) factoradic: 4 0 4 1 0 0 0 ! | | | | | | | (0,1,2,3,4,5,6) -> (0,1,2,3,5,6) -> (1,2,3,5,6) -> (1,2,3,5) -> (1,3,5) -> (3,5) -> (5) | | | | | | | permutation:(4, 0, 6, 2, 1, 3, 5)
A natural index for the group direct product of two permutation groups is the concatenation of two factoradic numbers, with two subscript "!"s.
concatenated decimal factoradics permutation pair 0 10 000 ! 000 ! ((0,1,2),(0,1,2)) 1 10 000 ! 010 ! ((0,1,2),(0,2,1)) ... 5 10 000 ! 210 ! ((0,1,2),(2,1,0)) 6 10 010 ! 000 ! ((0,2,1),(0,1,2)) 7 10 010 ! 010 ! ((0,2,1),(0,2,1)) ... 22 10 110 ! 200 ! ((1,2,0),(2,0,1)) ... 34 10 210 ! 200 ! ((2,1,0),(2,0,1)) 35 10 210 ! 210 ! ((2,1,0),(2,1,0))
Fractional values [ edit ]
Unlike single radix systems whose place values are basen for both positive and negative integral n, the factorial number base cannot be extended to negative place values as these would be (−1)!, (−2)! and so on, and these values are undefined. (see factorial)
One possible extension is therefore to use 1/0!, 1/1!, 1/2!, 1/3!, ..., 1/n! etc. instead, possibly omitting the 1/0! and 1/1! places which are always zero.
With this method, all rational numbers have a terminating expansion, whose length in 'digits' is less than or equal to the denominator of the rational number represented. This may be proven by considering that there exists a factorial for any integer and therefore the denominator divides into its own factorial even if it does not divide into any smaller factorial.
By necessity, therefore, the factoradic expansion of the reciprocal of a prime has a length of exactly that prime (less one if the 1/1! place is omitted). Other terms are given as the sequence A046021 on the OEIS. It can also be proven that the last 'digit' or term of the representation of a rational with prime denominator is equal to the difference between the numerator and the prime denominator.
There is also a non-terminating equivalent for every rational number akin to the fact that in decimal 0.24999... = 0.25 = 1/4 and 0.999... = 1, etc., which can be created by reducing the final term by 1 and then filling in the remaining infinite number of terms with the highest value possible for the radix of that position.
In the following selection of examples, spaces are used to separate the place values, otherwise represented in decimal. The rational numbers on the left are also in decimal:
1 / 2 = 0.0 1 ! {\displaystyle 1/2=0.0\ 1_{!}}
1 / 3 = 0.0 0 2 ! {\displaystyle 1/3=0.0\ 0\ 2_{!}}
2 / 3 = 0.0 1 1 ! {\displaystyle 2/3=0.0\ 1\ 1_{!}}
1 / 4 = 0.0 0 1 2 ! {\displaystyle 1/4=0.0\ 0\ 1\ 2_{!}}
3 / 4 = 0.0 1 1 2 ! {\displaystyle 3/4=0.0\ 1\ 1\ 2_{!}}
1 / 5 = 0.0 0 1 0 4 ! {\displaystyle 1/5=0.0\ 0\ 1\ 0\ 4_{!}}

So you had an iPhone and now it's gone–broken, lost, sold, history. Coincidentally around the same time you activate your new non-Apple phone, you notice your iPhone-wielding friends have lost total interest in talking to you. It's not their fault–it's Apple's.
You see, you didn't realize you were never texting these people in the traditional sense: You were iMessaging them. And now that you've left the Apple ecosystem, the chain of communication has been broken, and you can't seem to figure out how to fix it.
That's because iMessage is different than texting in one major way–it doesn't actually send its message over the same SMS infrastructure that texting does. Instead, iMessage is more like Gchat–it works over your 3G/4G connection–and it hijacks your text messages before they go out over traditional SMS. When you get your new iPhone and start texting, you notice that with Apple-owning friends your messages appear in blue. That's how you know you're iMessaging. When service is bad, or you talk to an Android or dumbphone user, you'll notice your message bubbles revert back to Green–normal text messages.
Here's the problem: When you stop using your iPhone, iMessages continue to be delivered over iMessage–they don't revert to SMS automatically, just because your iPhone is off, broken or deactivated.
This has been a problem since at least a year ago, and searching the web will net you any number of hapless iPhone owners on messageboards far and wide, trying to figure out where their messages are going.
One solution is to delete the old device via your Apple support profile. But for most people who have their Mac nearby, there's a quicker solution: Open the Messages app in OS X, find the account settings, and uncheck your phone number from the active handles on your account.
If you don't open Messages often, doing so will result in a cascade of missing texts–these are messages that haven't been getting delivered to your non-iPhone, but have ended up on your iMessage-enabled Mac, otherwise the last place you'd go to receive a text. Now the lightbulb should go off. Perhaps you get a little pissed. Apple is punishing you for ditching your iPhone by cutting you off from your friends, and they want to make it feel like you need to be on an Apple device to talk to the people you care about.
× Zimmerman pulled over in Texas for traffic violation, given warning
(CNN) — George Zimmerman — who was acquitted earlier this month on murder charges tied to Trayvon Martin's death — was stopped this weekend for a traffic violation in northern Texas, according to the Forney, Texas, police department.
Dashcam video released by police shows Zimmerman and the officer talking briefly before the officer tells him to shut his glove compartment and “don't play with your firearm, OK?”
Then, after returning to his patrol car, the officer returns to tell Zimmerman to “slow down” and sends him on off with a verbal warning.
In a tweet, Zimmerman's defense team said Wednesday that they wouldn't make any comments on their client's whereabouts and would protect his privacy “for his safety.”
His brother, Robert Zimmerman Jr., explained what happened with a brief tweet of his own: “A heavy foot … Nothing more.”
The episode began shortly after noon on a partly cloudy Sunday, when the officer turns on his sirens and says, “Get 'em,” as Zimmerman's 2008 gray Honda pulls away.
Moments later, the officer pulls up behind Zimmerman's car, which is by then parked in the breakdown lane with its hazard lights on, as seen in the dashcam video.
The officer asks for a driver's license, and after a short exchange with Zimmerman and recognizing the name, he says, “What a coincidence.”
“The reason you were stopped is for your speed,” the officer adds later. “And as long as you don't have any warrants, you'll be served a warning.”
The entire thing — from when Zimmerman was stopped to when he was cleared — took all four minutes, according to the police report.
Forney City Manager Brian Brooks said he couldn't answer several questions about the incident, including about the type of gun that Zimmerman had, in part because the incident was short and no citation was issued.
A spokesman for Zimmerman's legal defense team said he had not confirmed directly with Zimmerman that he'd been pulled over in Texas but, after looking at the dashcam photo, said he believes “it's probably George.”
Zimmerman last communicated with his defense team last Friday, when he was still in Florida, said the spokesman, Shawn Vincent.
A Florida jury found Zimmerman not guilty of second degree murder on July 13 for fatally shooting the 17-year-old Martin in a Sanford, Florida, neighborhood. The case stirred fervent emotions on both sides — from the 29-year-old's supporters who argued that he had a right to protect himself, to others who argued he profiled the black teenager, then willfully ignored a police dispatcher's advice by pursuing him.
The passions contributed to an “enormous amount of death threats” against Zimmerman and his family, his parents told ABC News earlier this month.
On Wednesday, the Zimmerman family reiterated that they remain under pressure.
“Our family receives many death threats,” the family said in a statement. “We all continue to take our security seriously and to ensure our safety in accordance with the law.”
This week's traffic stop marks the second time George Zimmerman has made headlines since his acquittal.
George Zimmerman was mentioned in news stories for helping, with another man, a family of four get out of an overturned vehicle in Sanford, said Seminole County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Heather Smith.
Zimmerman did not witness the July 17 crash, and he left after making contact with a sheriff's deputy, Smith said. No injuries were reported.
NEW YORK (Reuters) - CTIA, the U.S. wireless industry group, said it plans to combine its two annual trade shows into one autumn event starting in 2014, as it vies to become a stage for product launches before the end-of-year holiday shopping season.
The trade group, whose members include the top U.S. wireless service providers such as Verizon Wireless, AT&T Inc and Sprint Nextel, said on Wednesday that its first combined show will take place in September 2014 in Las Vegas.
It has traditionally staged a trade show in the spring and autumn each year but its biggest event, the spring CTIA Show, has been increasingly overshadowed by the Consumer Electronics Show held in Las Vegas each January, and Mobile World Congress held in February in Barcelona.
The announcement comes less than a week before the kick-off of the 2013 Consumer Electronics Show, which starts January 8.
CTIA said it sees the timing of the 2014 show as a good platform for exhibitors “to debut mobile consumer products and services heading into the annual holiday buying season.”
Sprint, the No. 3 U.S. mobile service provider, already said on Wednesday that the 2014 show will be key to its plans for announcing its latest products and services.
CTIA, whose first trade show was held in May 1985 in Washington, D.C., has not disclosed its attendance numbers for the last few years.
“I'm Satish Kajla, a Hindu by birth, but I'm a Muslim now”.
Earlier, his identity among fellow Hindus was that of a Dalit, an untouchable, an outcaste, a landless labourer in a village of Haryana, who was deprived of his basic rights and facilities that the government has granted them. But, now the white skullcap on his head, a kafia (scarf) around the neck has changed at least his religious identity.
This is not just about one Kajla, but many like him, who have recently embraced Islam in Delhi, after leaving their ancestral village Bhagana in Haryana forever.
They have embraced Islam by choice, not by force. According to them, they were compelled to do so, to escape the wrath of fellow Hindus — the upper castes in village Bhagana.
Kajla, a 34-year old Master of Sanskrit, with a B Ed degree, sporting unshaved look, wearing an unclean white Kurta and a pair of trousers can be found sitting under a canopy at a corner in Jantar Mantar — the place allocated by the Delhi government for demonstration and protests.
Despite embracing Islam, why Kajla and others continue to have Hindu names.
“We've recently embraced Islam (8 August) and haven't changed our Hindu names, simply to tell the government and the people that we were originally Hindus and haven't got converted to Islam to be a part of religious politics. We've embraced Islam, after having faced atrocities for years and not getting any justice. We've been socially ostracised and were compelled to flee our ancestral village, maybe forever,” Kajla told Firstpost.
His fractured right arm, supported by a plaster, is evidence of the fact that even after escaping from his village Bhagana, his ill-fate continues to chase him. As the Dalits from Bhagana village, who have been on a sit-on dharna since 16 April, 2014 demanding justice, were allegedly beaten up by the Delhi police and ‘unidentified goons'.
The confidence of these Dalits has been badly shaken, as even after being beaten black and blue allegedly by the police and some ‘unidentified goons' on the night of 9 August at Jantar Mantar, these poor families couldn't muster courage to file an FIR against the accused.
“All of a sudden, the policemen and a few unidentified men started beating us with lathis and told us to vacate Jantar Mantar immediately. Besides others, I was also beaten up badly and my left arm got fractured. A few volunteers of Swaraj Abhiyan, who tried to intervene, were also beaten up badly,” alleged 65-year old Mahender Kajla, father of Satish.
These poor villagers of Bhagana had been facing atrocity of the upper caste Jats for years, but the worst happened in 2011, when a 280-acre government land (Shamlaat Zameen), which used to be a playground and was meant for social functions of the Dalits, was usurped by the upper-caste villagers.
“The Khap Panchayat of Bhagana distributed the land among themselves, to which we strongly protested. As a result, the upper-caste members of the Panchayat and village strongmen started unleashing atrocities on our families. The village women were harassed, girls were raped and men were beaten up. Firing took place in 2014. They made our lives difficult and 137 families had to escape,” said Virendra Singh Bagoria, another nouveau Muslim.
According to the villagers, the upper-caste Hindus – comprising mostly the Jats — called for a ‘social boycott' of the Dalits. If anyone was found helping these Dalits, a fine of Rs 1100 was imposed on that person. “We were deprived of all facilities — from drinking water to a barber, from organising our social events to work in the agriculture farms. The Chamar Chowk meant for our social festivals was seized by them and a wall was constructed to prevent our entry. There was social and economic sanction on us. Even, complaining to the police and the administration was of no help. Instead, we were implicated in false cases,” he said.
The Dalit families left the village and moved to Hisar, where they started demonstration near Mini Secretariat, demanding justice.
“We had met then Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, other ministers and officials. But, no action was taken against the culprits. Some of our members were arrested and false charges were slapped on them. Then we decided to move to Delhi and started our demonstration at Jantar Mantar,” said Rajesh, another convert.
Life became worst for the Dalit women. Atrocities against the remaining Dalit families were scaled up by the upper caste members of the village, who were also big landholders. The village witnessed alleged gangrape of four minor Dalit girls on 23 March, 2014. For the protection of these women, the Dalit families left Bhagana and took shelter elsewhere.
Even Delhi didn't prove to be safe for these villagers, comprising Scheduled Castes and Other Backward Classes.
“On 8 August, 70 people belonging to Bhagana embraced Islam. That night police arrested 12 among us and we were told that we couldn't stage any demonstration. Later, a few people claiming to be from the Vishwa Hindu Parishad came and asked us for ‘Ghar Wapsi' – re-conversion. They threatened us of dire consequences, if we don't get back to Hinduism. We told them, it would be possible, only, if out of the four Muths (religious seats) of the Hindus, two were given to Dalits,” added Bhagoria.
Lata (name changed), a 19-year old girl, who has taken shelter at a relative's place at Faridabad said, “We were under constant threat of molestation and rape. Police failed to take any concrete action. It was unsafe to step out of our houses even during the day. To protect ourselves, we're forced to leave our village.”
The Dalit villagers are frustrated and dissatisfied with both the Congress and the BJP, as none could provide them justice.
Added Kajla, “Earlier, we had met Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi and other ministers in the UPA government. But, nothing happened. Later, when the BJP formed government in Haryana, we met Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar four times. He agreed with our problem, but failed to do anything due to pressure from Khap Panchayats. Baba Saheb's (BR Ambedkar) writings inspired us. He too had faced severe discrimination during his time and embraced Buddhism. But, we didn't choose any other religion, because, these were off-shoots of Hinduism. Only, the Islam can be a fitting reply to Hinduism, and fellow Muslims welcomed us without any discrimination. We'll continue our fight for justice, come whatever may happen.”

For some reason, I have vivid memories of roll call from elementary school. It was a daily drill that gave each student a chance to rehearse his identity by riffing on the word "here!" Whether you sang it or burped it, you had to make it memorable. Or at least, that's how I felt about it.
But it's a nostalgia I may not share with my kids, as tracking devices have begun to dispose of the ritual all together. Last month, a preschool in Richmond, California installed a curiously expensive, high tech system to track the attendance of its students. And it could serve as a pilot program for others to come.
Upon arriving in the morning, according to the Associated Press, each student at the CCC-George Miller preschool will don a jersey with a stitched in RFID chip. As the kids go about the business of learning, sensors in the school will record their movements, collecting attendance for both classes and meals. Officials from the school have claimed they're only recording information they're required to provide while receiving federal funds for their Headstart program.
However, the story has caught the attention of both the ACLU and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who have expressed alarm at the potential infringement of privacy rights. Together, they have submitted a letter of concern to school officials, including a request that they clarify what security precautions were put in place with the program.
This is not the first time a school has tried to track its students with RFID. In 2005, according to the AP, another grade school in California handed out RFID badges and was met with an equal amount of outrage from the ACLU and privacy rights watch dogs.
Aside from privacy issues, the project has stirred debate about resource allocation. The RFID system was installed with funds from the Federal stimulus program and carries a price tag of $50,000. Moreover, it was designed to replace a task which, from the outside, seems only minimally taxing to budget and personnel—and which, in my case, served to create lasting memories.
Developed by a SAE International sponsored committee of experts, the Architecture Analysis & Design Language (AADL) was approved and published as SAE Standard AS-5506 in November 2004. Version 2.1 of the standard was published in Sept 2012.
The AADL is designed for the specification, analysis, automated integration and code generation of real-time performance-critical (timing, safety, schedulability, fault tolerant, security, etc.) distributed computer systems. It provides a new vehicle to allow analysis of system designs (and system of systems) prior to development and supports a model-based, model-driven development approach throughout the system life cycle.
Benefits of AADL
The SAE AADL standard can lower development and maintenance costs by
providing a standard, precise syntax and semantics for performance-critical systems, so that documentation can be well defined
providing the ability to model large-scale (multi-contractor) architectures from many aspects in a single analyzable model that can be incrementally refined
capturing the “architectural API” needed to evaluate the effect of change, such as the emergent properties of integration (e.g., safety, schedulability, end-to-end latency, and security)
allowing early and life-cycle tracking of modeling and analysis
analyzing the system structure and runtime behavior, complementing functional simulation
providing a great complement to reference architectures and component-based or product-line development
Actual users and AADL-related projects
As an international industry standard, AADL enjoys growing acceptance in avionics, aerospace, medical, nuclear, automotive, and robotics communities. You can find out more presentation materials and more details under the wiki section dedicated to the standardization committee works, and all publication materials related to AADL.
The standardization committee has an active participation from industrial and academic partners, including Adventium Labs, Aerospace, Airbus industries, Boeing, Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute, Chinese Academy of Science, Dassault Aviation, Edgewater, Ellidiss, European Space Agency, Honeywell, INRIA, ISPRAS, ISAE, IRIT, Kansas State University, NASA, Rockwell-Collins, Rolls-Royce, Russian Academy of Science, TELECOM ParisTech, Toyota, U.S Army, University of Pennsylvania. Also, the committee is in active collaboration with other standardization bodies including the ARINC653 working group, the SAVI initiative and The Open Group Real-time.
The Court convenes for a session in the Courtroom at 10 a.m. The session may begin with the announcement of opinions - decisions in argued cases - followed by the swearing in of new members to the Bar of the Supreme Court. Unless otherwise noted, the Court generally hears two, one-hour oral arguments, with attorneys for each side of a case given 30 minutes to make a presentation to the Court and answer questions posed by the Justices. These sessions are open to the public.

The Minister for Foreign Affairs has described comments made by the Czech Republic's President after a meeting with Libertas Leader Declan Ganley as inappropriate.
On the second day of his visit to Ireland, Mr Klaus claimed the Lisbon Treaty would not enhance freedom and democracy and said he supported Mr Ganley, an anti-Lisbon campaigner.
Speaking on RTÉ Morning Ireland, Micheál Martin said every welcome had been extended to Václav Klaus, who is on a state visit to Ireland.
He said there was a private dimension to every state visit, but the very clear political comments made by Mr Klaus at a news conference were an inappropriate intervention.
The Minister said the Government knew in advance that Mr Klaus had controversial views about a number of issues.
Fine Gael has urged Mr Martin to register a complaint with his Czech counterpart over the remarks.
While Mr Klaus denied he was breaching the protocol of a state visit by speaking out on the issue, Fine Gael Foreign Affairs spokesperson Billy Timmins criticised what he described as inappropriate behaviour.
In a statement last night, Mr Timmins said the Czech President has created a very definite perception that he strongly sympathises with groupings and individuals who are opposed to Government policy.
Mr Timmins said he believed the actions of Mr Klaus in meeting in a very public fashion people who have opposed, not only the Lisbon Treaty, but every Government initiative on Europe, may well be a breach of long-established protocol.
For a couple of years now Valve has been developing and promoting the concept of what has become their Steam Universe. The Linux-based SteamOS running on top of console-sized Steam Machines for the living room, controlled with the Steam Controller. Now after becoming subject to Valve Time and delayed from 2014, today Valve and their partners are announcing that Steam Universe is finally launching later this year.
Steam Controller
First and foremost, let's start with the Steam Controller. The final version of Valve's controller is pretty much identical to what we saw at GDC 2015, featuring what has become the controller's signature touchpads, along with an analog stick, motion controls, haptics (vibration), and what Valve is calling dual-stage triggers, all communicating with host systems over Bluetooth. Though ultimately lacking the touchscreens of Valve's original design, the final controller retains the touchpads and the same goals Valve had held to since the start: making more traditional mouse-driven PC games playable on the couch with a controller. Valve has put up a short promotional video showing it in action, and it will be interesting to see if it works as well in real life as Valve would like it to. When not part of a Steam Machine bundle, Valve will be selling the Steam Controller stand-alone for $49.
Steam Machines
Next up, this brings us to Valve's Steam Machines initiative. With last year's delays we've seen a few of the initial Steam Machines reissued as Windows machines in the interim, but now with Valve finally ready to ship on their end, the full collection of Machines will be available. In terms of design all of these Machines are all small form factor designs intended for the living room, with the actual designs being a mix of existing SFF designs – such as the Gigabyte BRIX Pro or the Falcon Northwest Tiki – while other designs being brand new entirely.
Meanwhile as far as performance and costs go, the initial wave of Machines runs the gauntlet from low-powered, console-like computers to high-end machines that are meant to take a stab at 4K rendering. The cheapest machines start at $449, such as the Alienware in its low-end, Core-i3 powered configuration, and also the iBuyPower SBX. Meanwhile at the middle of the pack are machines like the Zotac SN970 at $999, and finally at the high-end the sky's the limit. With many of these designs accepting desktop class CPUs and video cards, the price tag on the top configurations can go into the thousands of dollars, with Falcon Northwest quoting $4999 for what will be their top-end Tiki.
As one might expect, all of the Steam Machines are shipping with one Steam Controller, with additional controllers available from Valve for $49. Meanwhile the very first Steam Machines from Alienware and Syber are already available for pre-order from GameStop and Syber respectively, while the rest are slated to be available in November. The pre-order machines are said to be a “limited quantity” (though we don't know just how limited), and will be shipping on October 16th, for gamers who are willing to order the machines before the reviews and formal launch. Otherwise we're expecting to see everything else go out around November 10th.
Steam Link
Finally, we have the Steam Link, Valve's in-home streaming receiver for Steam. Intended to be used with Steam's existing, built-in streaming technology, the Link is designed to allow playing Steam games in other locations away from the host PC/Machines, be it things like spare bedrooms or locating the host in said spare bedroom and putting the Link in the living room. The Link features a 2x2 802.11ac for wireless connectivity, or a 100Mbit Ethernet port for wired fallback, along with a trio of USB 2.0 ports and of course the necessary HDMI port.
Valve will be selling the Link on its own for $49, while a package with the controller will be $99, and somewhat surprisingly for a consumer device these days, Valve's even throwing in HDMI and Ethernet cables. As with the Steam Machines, the Link is available for pre-order through Valve or at GameStop, with a limited number of the devices shipping on October 16th.
Lutamesta's psychedelic drawings are reminiscent of Loius Wain's art works. (Take a look at his art in The Schizophrenic Psychedelic Art of Louis Wain) Both Lutamesta and Louis Wain use cats as their main subjects, depicting the cats' fur, whiskers and facial features with stylized, psychedelic patterns. Both artists focus on the cats' faces, enlarging the eyes and ears to create unusual caricatures of the creatures.
The term “psychedelic art” refers to any art that mimics the hallucinations and visual distortions experienced by a person under the influence of psychedelic drugs like LSD or magic mushrooms. More often than not, psychedelic art includes repetitive patterns and bright colors. Shapes and objects in psychedelic paintings often have halos of color or highly detailed patterns within the shape. In the case of Lutamesta's psychedelic art, each part of the art work is made up of dozens of smaller parts, each of which fit together like a trippy jigsaw puzzle to create the finished image.
Lutamesta is an artist from Japan who says that her home town is riddle with underground tunnels. Her favorite animals are cats and birds. Visit Lutamesta's online art gallery from more trippy and psychedelic art.

The senate voted this morning to proceed to debate on a package of gun control measures, centered around expanding background checks and toughening penalties, by a 68-31 vote. Debate and amendment will (almost certainly) officially begin tomorrow, and last several weeks, as hundreds of amendments - in good faith and bad - will be submitted.
Here's the roll call on today's vote. Sixteen Republicans voted in favor, while only two Democrats - senators from red states Alaska and Arkansas who are facing reelection next year - voted against.
These votes are hardly suggestive of how wavering senators would hypothetically vote on a final package, however. So far only two Republican senators - Mark Kirk of Illinois and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania - are in favor of eventually passing some sort of measure and sending it to the House. And several other red-state Democrats who voted "yes" today, like Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Jon Tester of Montana, are no sure thing for the final package.
The big amendments to watch going forward will be one on the more streamlined Manchin-Toomey proposal announced just yesterday, as well as longshots on restoring the assault weapons ban and instituting a cap on gun magazine capacities.
As of this writing, the Second Amendment still exists, despite this measure moving forward.
DESPITE missing the finals, 2015 was a successful year for the Bombers in AFL Fantasy.
The team from Tullamarine was the equal fifth team for Fantasy points scored and boasted the sixth highest scoring player, Brent Stanton (MID, $591,000). The durable midfielder produced his best Fantasy season of his 12-year career, pleasing his many coaches.
More Fantasy prices:
> Carlton: Will Brendon play the kids?
> Brisbane Lions: Fantasy Pig and friends
> Gold Coast: Sunshine and Fantasy points aplenty
Dyson Heppell (MID, $564,000) produced another stellar season, proving he will be a Fantasy star for many years to come.
Brendon Goddard (MID, $552,000) and David Zaharakis (MID, $415,000) have lost their forward status, leaving Zach Merrett (FWD/MID, $501,000) as a premium holding dual position. Merrett was a breakout player in 2015, averaging 90.4 in just his second season.
A couple of blasts from the past should be on your watch-list leading up to the first lockout. Nick Kommer (FWD, $125,000) hasn't played since 2013 and by all reports, has been looking impressive this pre-season.
Mitch Brown (DEF/FWD, $194,000) is priced nicely to consider as your fifth or sixth defender. As a replacement player in the 2015 NAB Challenge, he knocked up a Fantasy ton in the first game for the depleted Bombers.
With plenty of changes at Bomberland, it will be an interesting season for Fantasy. Will the team's Fantasy game continue to flourish under their new coach John Worsfold? If so, there is plenty of gold to be uncovered.

A walk-up start in the back six of each and every one of my Fantasy teams, Michael Hibberd (DEF, $440,000) experienced a disappointing year, averaging 79.5. As quite a few of last season's premium defenders are now MID-only, Hibberd will hopefully return to his previous best, having averaged 87 and 89.3 in 2013 and 2014.
We are lucky enough to be able to select Jobe Watson (MID, $492,000) in our Fantasy Classic squads at his cheapest price since 2008. The captain's season, which included four scores under 65 in his last five games, ended early due to a shoulder injury. Monitor Watson's pre-season, and if he's good to go he is a steal at under $500K.
Winding up at the Bombers as a restricted free agent, Matthew Leuenberger (RUC/FWD, $301,000) is keen to assume the role as the No.1 ruck at his new club. In a career that has seen him hit plenty of Fantasy highs, 2015 was a disappointment as the big man spent a lot of time forward for the Lions, with Stefan Martin the go-to guy. The bonus is that the 27-year-old is named with both ruck and forward eligibility and is looking to lead the ruck department at a bargain price.
Sydney Swans premiership player Craig Bird (FWD/MID, $321,000) switched to Essendon during the NAB AFL Trade Period. At the Swans, the 26-year-old's role varied. He was often used as a tagger and only managed six games last season. Bird has been earmarked to play as a ball-winning midfielder and looks likely to make a significant amount of Fantasy cash in the red and black.
In a shake-up of how first-year players are priced in Fantasy Classic, Darcy Parish (MID, $260,000) is the most expensive draftee – and for good reason. Taken at pick five, the midfielder has a natural Fantasy game, averaging almost 100 points in the TAC Cup, and will be worth selecting when he debuts.
In his eight-year career David Myers (MID, $266,000) hasn't been in too many Fantasy teams, but every man has his price. Both of his games were affected by injury in 2015, including the round-one match in which he had just one kick before donning the red vest. Myers is under-priced and could be a cash cow for your midfield this season.
Despite making a sound contribution in 2015, Shaun McKernan (RUC, $441,000) is priced awkwardly for someone who is possibly a depth player. There is currently a line through his name at Warne Dawg Park.
TUESDAY: The Traders are back to reveal St Kilda's Fantasy prices and positions.
A transit "desert" is a relatively new concept, defined as an urban area full of transit-dependent people (usually city residents who are low-income, elderly, disabled, or all of the above) but lacking sufficient transit service. The report mentioned by the Tribune doesn't identify the exact transit deserts in Chicago, saying only that the term applies to "significant portions" of the metro area. Perhaps the final report, due at the end of the March, will be more precise.
The Chicago area's mass transit agencies are doing a poor job of serving the commuting needs of the region — portions of which are "transit deserts" — while planning efforts are haphazard, a new report says.
The Chicago Tribune reports that Chicago is not on pace to meet its goal of doubling transit ridership by 2040. A little early to call things, sure, but the fact is the transit network isn't connecting workers with jobs. The Tribune says that "most jobs in the region can't be reached in a 90-minute commute" (and Brookings recently quantified "most" at a more precise 77 percent ). According to a report drafted for a regional transit task force, Chicago suffers from too many "transit deserts":
Or perhaps precision here is just too difficult a task. As it happens, a pair of transport scholars recently tried to pinpoint Chicago's deserts — and had a tough time of it.
Using GIS, the duo merged demographic data with transit system data to locate potential deserts in the city (as well as those in Charlotte, Portland, and Cincinnati). The idea was to find specific blocks where high transit demand among dependent riders overlapped with a low supply of transit service. The biggest service gaps they found were in the neighborhoods of Edgewater Beach (well north of the city center), and West Loop and Near North (both downtown).
Here's the transit desert map; the darker the shade, the greater the service gap (via the Journal of Public Transportation):
Thing is — as the researchers themselves admit — Edgewater Beach is known to have pretty decent transit service. The core is well-served, too, for the most part. In an effort to isolate transit deserts down to a block-by-block level, the researchers might have made their measurements too fine. "Thus, certain areas that, in reality, are served well by transit, are shown as bereft of service," they write.
The Tribune, meanwhile, reported some potential transit deserts in the low-income or remote areas where one might expect them. It specifically mentioned several neighborhoods at the far South Side of the city, including Roseland, Pullman, West Pullman and Altgeld Gardens — areas with very high minority populations. It also mentioned western McHenry County, a traditional agricultural center far outside the city center.
Suffice it to say, identifying transit deserts with GIS remains a work in progress. The effort might seem superfluous, given how easily one can point to general gaps in a city's transit network as the Tribune did, but there's a tremendous value in precision here. With transit funding in limited supply, targeted investments become that much more important. It's always going to be hard to serve transit deserts, but determining exactly where they are is a key first step.

The Minnesota Wild aren't the same team the Chicago Blackhawks eliminated in the Stanley Cup playoffs in 2013, nor are they the same team the Blackhawks eliminated in 2014.
This version of the Wild is a more experienced and rounded team. They are well ahead of the group that gave the Blackhawks little problem in five games in the first round two years ago, and have lived and learned and added an elite goaltender since battling six games with the Blackhawks in the second round last season.
The Wild have taken a step each season and now feel they're as prepared as ever to take that next one. But to do that, they'll need to knock off the Blackhawks, a team that has proved itself at the highest level in the playoffs and has had the Wild's number.
The Wild understand the significance of having to go through Chicago to advance.
"That's a big part," Wild forward Zach Parise said after eliminating the St. Louis Blues on Sunday. "These guys are, every year, they're Cup contenders. For us to want to get in that conversation with them, we've got to beat them. Again, it'll be a good series. It'll be a tough series."
The Blackhawks also realize that beating the Wild for a third consecutive season won't be easy.
"The way they played at the end of the year coming into the playoffs, that they made it through that round and beat a very good team, now that we face them, I feel like they're getting better and better in a lot of ways every year," Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews said Monday. "I think it's going to be the toughest test we've seen in a long time, so it's up to us. We know there's another level we need to get to."
Fancy stats
One of the main reasons for the Blackhawks' recent playoff success against the Wild is that Chicago has been able to contain Parise, the Wild's most talented offensive player.
The Blackhawks held Parise to a Corsi percentage of 50 percent or worse in eight of the teams' 11 playoff games the past two seasons. He had a minus-5 goal differential against Chicago in 2013 and a minus-2 differential last season. He also recorded just one goal in 2013, and one goal and three assists in 2014. Against other teams in his playoff career, he's had 24 goals and 29 assists in 68 games.
Parise will obviously be looking to produce more this time around. He is coming off a strong series against the Blues. He scored three goals and had four assists in the six-game series. He also had a plus-2 goal differential.
"He's one of those guys we want to key on, for sure, and try to make his job as tough as we can," Toews said.

MVP
The Blackhawks possess plenty of stars, but there will be no bigger player on the ice than Wild goaltender Devan Dubnyk when the puck is dropped in Game 1.
Dubnyk has transformed the Wild over the past three months. He went 27-9-2 with a 1.78 goals-against average and .936 save percentage after being acquired from the Arizona Coyotes in mid-January. He held the St. Louis Blues to fewer than two goals in all four Wild wins in the first round.
The Blackhawks know all about him, too. The Wild beat Chicago twice in recent months thanks to Dubnyk. He stopped 56 of 57 shots against the Blackhawks.
"I think the whole league had that challenge at the end of the year," Blackhawks coach Joel Quenneville said Monday. "If he sees the puck, he's going to make it tough on you. That's the one thing we've got to do. We know when you play him, you don't expect to score a lot of goals. But you want to make sure you don't give up much."
For the Blackhawks, Patrick Kane has picked up right where he left off before suffering a fractured clavicle in late February. He was tied for the league lead with 64 points in 61 games when he was injured.
His first game back was Game 1 of the first-round series against the Nashville Predators. In the six-game series, he had two goals and five assists. Kane has had mixed results against the Wild in the playoffs the past two years. He had three goals and one assist in six games last season, and zero goals and five assists in five games in 2013.
Gut check
As the Wild continued piling up wins in January and February, many believed their good fortune would eventually run out. Well, it's almost May and they haven't stopped winning.
Since Dubnyk started his first game for the Wild on Jan. 15, they have gone 32-11-3. They not only turned their season around but also made themselves Stanley Cup contenders.
The Blackhawks are as much a psychological hurdle for the Wild as anything. The Wild haven't been able to surpass Chicago for two years running and, just their luck, they run into the Hawks for a third year in a row. Still, it's hard to see the Blackhawks as the team that derails the Wild's run.
Secret weapon
Blackhawks forward Bryan Bickell was undoubtedly ecstatic when he discovered who the second-round opponent was. Bickell loves playing the Wild more than any other team, by far. Against Minnesota the past three campaigns, he's had eight goals and two assists in 12 regular-season games, and seven goals and three assists in 11 playoff games.
"It's one of those things, you can't say why, but certain guys, certain teams -- they seem to jump out of you," Quenneville said recently in trying to explain Bickell's success against the Wild.
The skinny
The Wild have improved, especially by adding a world-class goaltender, and the Blackhawks aren't as deep as they once were, especially in their defense pairings. Unless the Blackhawks drastically improve on their defensive effort and goaltending consistency in the first round, they will have a tough series. Wild in 7.
I was able to get an interview with the wonderful Laura Waller from Real World St. Thomas and the Challenge Battle of the Seasons (2012). This interview was incredible, Laura goes into great detail about her experience on the Real World, how she gotcast, and digs deep on some of her biggest regrets.
To start off, Laura's Real World season, was somewhat poorly cast and poorly set. The entire cast had a lack of diverse characters that could come together, while being literally stuck on an island. She also acknowledges that maybe dating a guy on her season may have not been the best choice, but there was literally nobody for her to interact with when you're locked on an island and only have the option to drink or nap.
In the last two years, Laura has become a mother and still looks great. She loves some reality television as a fan of the Bachelor. She still watches the Challenge these days, though she has little connection to the cast. She was a sweetheart who was really candid in this interview and almost makes you mad that she was not given a better opportunity to do more of these shows.
Something I found of hers online:
Her RW Audition. Whenever you can find these of someone, they must watches.
Q/A
Q: First, I want to say thank you for replying to me, and taking these questions. Now, how are you doing lately? How has your life been the past few years?
Laura: To be honest life has been pretty great lately! I've got a wonderful boyfriend who is fantastic with my beautiful baby girl. We are looking to buy a house once his lease is up so February can't come soon enough!
Q: What was the casting process for you like with Real World St. Thomas? Were you a fan of the show before watching?
Laura: Before I applied, I hadn't really watched the Real World. In March I was watching Vegas 2 after work one day and wondered how to get on the show so I looked online and saw they were doing casting calls for the San Diego season. There weren't any castings in my area so I sent in a decent paragraph about myself and waited. Once San Diego started I thought ‘that would have been fun but oh well' but in August I got a random call and surprise surprise it was Bunnim Murray! I had a Skype interview, one in person interview, and a final interview in LA. Finally in January, I got the call that I made the cast and a couple weeks later we were on our own private island!
Q: So I think you and your fellow cast members are aware that Real World St. Thomas was not a top 10 Real World Season. Would you rather have been somewhere else, and how limiting was it living on an island?
Laura: Ohh man I cannot tell you how much I wanted our season to be in Miami. I guarantee it would have been soooooo much different. For one, we could barely understand the locals and they wanted nothing to do with us. I think we may have seen maybe 5 good looking guys out of the 2 1/2 months we were there — talk about slim picking! I went on 3 dates with semi decent looking guys just to get out of the house and Trey tried to sabotage each of them! St. Thomas was gorgeous but there wasn't much to do. Believe it or not we were almost stranded on our island and we took naps on naps. If it was even slightly raining we couldn't go to the main island. The resorts were on the other side of the island and to get there we had to take an hour cab ride to get there for $20… don't forget we had that on the way back as well. Even the shopping was out of our price range everything was for tourists — Prada, Rolex, etc are not for the poor! I used to be pretty damn good at getting free drinks and flirting with random strangers, but the bars we were allowed in usually weren't packed — Trey was a tight ass with his money so I had to buy my own, haha. We also couldn't take shots in our house it had to be beer or a mixed drink…. it is not a good time when you can't slam a few back before jumping on your half hour boat ride to the main island.
Q: I saw you were hanging out with Wes a couple months ago? How did you guys become friends? I know you guys did the Challenge together, but he was eliminated after three days.
Laura: I met Wes on BOTS and thought he was nice, he wasn't in the house long enough to get to know him better. We met up a few months after filming when I was in Kansas City for a pool party. This time I reached out to him to see if he wanted to meet up when my boyfriend and I came to town. We actually had a fantastic time and I definitely can't wait to go back and see Wes and his group of friends again!
Q: Were you ever offered to do another Challenge? You didn't really make sense for a ton of the formats, but I saw your names was tossed around at one point for Exes 2 with Trey.
Laura: Some of the formats I wasn't a candidate for but I was an alternate for three seasons and each one I got passed up for. I was baffled when Trey and I were alternates for Exes…. If you look Trey and Laura up in the dictionary it will say the definition of a fucked up relationship, haha. I really screwed myself over with the whole Trey thing. It took away from what I wanted out of initially applying for the RW — to be on the Challenge. I have always been competitive and if I had focused my game I would have had some major enemies… even my closest friends don't want to be around me when I'm pissed. I come off as sweet but oooh boy I can put lots of mean girls to shame hahaha.
Q: Who do you still talk to from the MTV Universe?
Laura: Not many. Marie, Toya, and Robb occasionally but that's about it. I've been so out of the loop that there's not much to talk to everyone about. Also, being in Nebraska limits the amount of challengers I get to hang out with.
Q: I saw that you are a Bachelor/Bachelorette fan! What do you think of this season? Do you have a favorite Bachelor/ette?
Laura: The Bachelor/Bachelorette is my guilty pleasure! This season was alright I am a bigger fan of the bachelor. Definitely cant wait for bachelor in Paradise to come out… I am intrigued on how they are going to edit the whole Corrine and DeMario shenanigans! I was excited for Luke's season but he got the shaft.
Q: Your boyfriend, yourself, and your child are all very beautiful. This isn't a question, just congratulations.
Laura: Thank you. Yes, Nick is my boyfriend he came back into my life when Veya was 6 weeks old and has been unbelievable ever since. Believe it or not Nick was my substitute teacher in college. I definitely earned extra credit, haha.
Q: What's your favorite midnight snack & to combo, if you're binge watching something, what is it going to be?
Laura: I really like frozen mac n cheese bites and Doritos…. cheese and wine are like my crack and I am proud to call myself a junkie!
Q: Before this ends, I wanted to say thank you again. Now what's something that people never learned about you, that you wish they knew. And/or, what's a bigger message you wish to send to people in general?
Laura: Hmm… that's a tough one.. I love my daughter, but don't be a fool & wrap your tool! Haha. Seriously, something about me… I am learning how to golf and have already promised my boyfriend that I will go pro and he can be my caddy. Lets just say he's not ready to quit his day job just yet. Haha.

NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — A new bill to be introduced Thursday in the City Council has angered many in the NYPD.
It calls for officers to get consent before they conduct some searches, CBS2's Dick Brennan reported Tuesday.
The bill covers cases when police don't have a warrant, are not making an arrest, or don't have probable cause.
In those cases, people do have the right to reject a search, but this bill would demand police notify them of that right, and even get proof, perhaps in writing or recorded audio.
The idea that police would have to ask permission to search certain suspects infuriates the police union.
“This is one more time that the City Council is trying to protect criminals rather than New York City police officers,” Patrolmen's Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch said.
Last year, as a part of a so-called Community Safety Act, the City Council passed two bills aimed at limiting stop, question and frisk, including establishing a police monitor.
But this bill takes another step, requiring law enforcement officers to provide notice and obtain proof of consent to search individuals when there is no warrant or probable cause.
“It's a way of trying to get at, in terms of the interactions of the police officers and those that they are patrolling and those that they are policing,” Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito said.
But until she sees the exact wording, the council speaker said she is withholding judgment on the bill, along with Mayor Bill de Blasio.
“We obviously have to protect the rights of our people, but we also have to make sure we are not undermining in any way for law enforcement to do its job,” the mayor said.
Local residents told CBS2 they have mixed views on asking permission.
“Good idea, because it protects our right to privacy by the First, Fourth and 14th Amendment,” said MacArthur Young of Prospect Park.
“No! Who's gonna give permission to ask him if it's okay? Who's gonna do that?” added Renee Andrews of East New York.
“If they ask the answer is certainly gonna be no, so I don't know what the point is,” said John Mikhael of Alpine, New Jersey.
Currently, the bill has only 21 sponsors. It needs 26, and that could depend on what signal the mayor sends. He may feel pressure to avoid giving the perception to the rank and file that he's anti-cop, Brennan reported.

(KUTV) A Utah marriage and family therapist was arrested on charges including rape and forcible sodomy after a former patient disclosed he had abused her during treatment.
On Sept. 25, detectives with the Utah County Sheriff's Office arrested Jason Scott Calder, 41-years-old, of Bountiful, Utah.
Calder is a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist who, until recently, worked at a youth treatment center in Utah County.
A 16-year-old girl who had been a patient of Calder's told her new therapist that Calder had perpetrated sex acts against her numerous times between March 2017 and late June 2017.
The victim told investigators this abuse occurred during scheduled therapy sessions while she was a resident in the same inpatient youth treatment facility where he worked at the time.
According to police, Calder was arrested and booked into the Utah County Jail on the following charges: 1 count of rape, a first degree felony; 10 counts of forcible sodomy, a first degree felony; and 1 count of forcible sexual abuse, a second degree felony.
Calder's employment at the residential treatment center was terminated, but he recently was employed at a residential treatment center in Salt Lake County.
Bail for Calder has been set at $100,000.00 Cash Only.
Detectives ask if there is anyone else who believes they may have been abused by Calder, or if anyone knows of someone who might have been victimized by Calder, to contact the Utah County Sheriff's Office at (801)851-4010.
The biggest and heaviest Cygnus commercial cargo craft ever built by Orbital ATK is coming together at the Kennedy Space Center as the launch pace picks up steam for its critical ‘Return to Flight' resupply mission to the space station for NASA. Cygnus is on target for an early December blastoff from Florida and the Orbital ATK team is “anxious to get flying again.”
“We are very excited about the upcoming [OA-4] cargo mission and returning to flight,” said Frank DeMauro, Orbital ATK Vice President for Human Spaceflight Systems Programs, in an exclusive interview with Universe Today.
The vehicle's last major component, the service module, has just arrived at Kennedy for final prelaunch assembly.
“We have an obligation to our NASA customer and most importantly the crews aboard the International Space Station (ISS).”
The ‘Return to Flight' mission, dubbed OA-4, fulfills Orbital ATK's commitment to “meet our cargo requirements to NASA under the Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) contract” following the catastrophic launch failure of the firms Antares/Cygnus Orb-3 resupply mission to the space station moments after liftoff one year ago from Wallops Island, Virginia on October 28, 2014.
In order to get the Cygnus logistics spacecraft back into service for NASA as quick as possible, Orbital switched rockets and the vessel will be carried to orbit for the first time by a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket – now slated for liftoff on December 3, 2015 from Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida at approximately 6 pm. ET.
“We are confident on the Dec. 3 launch date. And ULA is doing really well on the launch vehicle side,” DeMauro told me.
“The team has been chomping at the bit to get flying again. It's been awhile.”
Indeed this enhanced Cygnus variant – flying for the first time in its longest configuration – is jam packed with the heaviest load ever heading to the space station, due to a combination of the loftier lift capabilities of ULA's Atlas booster and the lengthier cargo module.
“We have a lot of cargo that we are planning to bring up!” DeMauro emphasized – “over 3500 kilograms.”
“We are taking advantage of the increased lift capability of the Atlas V. So with the enhanced Cygnus we are able to go from 2700 kg [with Antares] to 3500 kg of cargo [with Atlas V].”
This first flight of the longer, enhanced variant of the Cygnus spacecraft will deliver more than 7,700 pounds (3500 kilograms) of essential crew supplies, equipment and scientific experiments to astronauts on board the ISS.
A key mission milestone leading up to launch was achieved on Wednesday, Oct. 14 with delivery of the Cygnus service module (SM) to Kennedy's Space Station Processing Facility (SSPF).
The SM is the last major component of the Cygnus spacecraft required for launch and its now arrived on time for several weeks of integration work with the cargo carrying logistics module for pre-launch processing at the Florida space coast.
The Cygnus SM was manufactured at Orbital ATK's Dulles, Virginia headquarters and provides the spacecraft's avionics, propulsion and power systems. It propels the combined Cygnus vehicle to berth at the ISS.
The SM has also been upgraded with the lightweight UltraFlex solar panels flying for the first time on the OA-4 mission.
“These UltraFlex new solar arrays are being using as part of the design modifications introduced for the enhanced Cygnus. The plan was to reduce the mass of Cygnus to increase the cargo carrying capabilities of the entire spacecraft.”
The UltraFlex solar panels are 3.7 meters in diameter and approximately 25 kg lighter than those previously flown.
The next assembly step is to join the SM to the first ever extended variant of the Cygnus pressurized cargo module (PCM). The lengthened PCM enables delivery of the heaviest cargo load ever by Cygnus to the crews living and working aboard the orbital science complex.
“The enhanced Cygnus PCM is 1.2 meters longer, so it's about 1/3 longer,” DeMauro told Universe Today.
“So you get that [heavier cargo load] by increasing the modules length and volume. And it's based also on the packing scheme of the cargo.”
It can't be emphasized enough that resupply flights are the essential lifeline to the station, without which it cannot exist. The cargo missions stock the station with all manner of equipment, science experiments, food, clothing spare parts and gear for the international crews of six astronauts and cosmonauts.
The October 2014 launch mishap was traced to a failure in the ‘Americanized' and Russian-built NK-33 first stage engines of the firms Antares rocket, and ground flights to an immediate halt.
“Our response to the Antares failure was to figure out how to get the required cargo delivered to NASA in the timeframe that they needed,” DeMauro emphasized to Universe Today.
“So we went out and said, OK we have an obligation to our customer and the crews, most importantly, up on the ISS.”
“And so we thought hard and got to work immediately after we lost Orb-3 and came up with a plan to really utilize the existing Cygnus hardware.”
“We realized that Antares was going to need some time to get through their design work to accommodate the new RD-181 engine.”
“So we said we'll partner with another launch vehicle provider to give Antares the time they need to get back flying. So we picked Atlas and we took advantage of the increased lift capability with the Atlas V.”
“So we went back to our cargo module provider [Thales Alenia] and asked “how can we fit more cargo inside.”
The Cygnus PCM is manufactured by Thales Alenia Space at their production facility in Turin, Italy under a subcontract from Orbital ATK.
“So we had a design and we had a plan – but we needed more!” DeMauro explained.
“So like a solid provider, they [Thales Alenia] came back with alternatives for ‘fitting more cargo in the same size module' by making relatively low risk and modest changes to the internal secondary structure design of the cargo module.”
Therefore the Orbital team and their ULA and Italian partners responded to the Antares disaster in a creatively proactive manner to stuff the same Cygnus with an 30% additional cargo amounting to over 800 kilograms – in the same volume.
“So we are able to go from 2700 kg to 3500 kg. It's been a lot of hard work but the team is anxious to get going again.”
And the astronaut and cosmonauts crews aboard the ISS are truly the top priority of this entire effort to keep NASA's human spaceflight program alive and thriving.
“Our plan from the gitgo that we laid out in the concept of returning to flight – was got the cargo delivered to NASA that we were required to and do it in the time frame we were required to.”
“We are anxious to get flying again not only for our own sake, but really for NASA and the crew!” DeMauro told me.
Orbital ATK was awarded a $1.9 Billion supply contract by NASA to deliver 20,000 kilograms of research experiments, crew provisions, spare parts and hardware for 8 flights to the ISS through 2016 under the Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) initiative.
Three new flights have since been added by NASA, for a total of 10 Cygnus resupply missions through about 2018.
Orbital ATK's commercial competitor, SpaceX, is likewise under contract with NASA to deliver 20,000 kg of supplies to the ISS with the SpaceX Falcon 9/Dragon architecture.
But SpaceX also suffered a launch failure this year in June 2015 following the CRS-7 ISS resupply liftoff from Cape Canaveral.
So NASA desperately needs both commercial cargo partners to safely resume station resupply launches.
I was an eyewitness to both calamities and plan to be onsite at the Kennedy Space Center press site for the OA-4 liftoff on Dec. 3.
ISS commander and NASA astronaut Scott Kelly and his comrades will surely welcome the Cygnus supplies in about 6 weeks time!

It's interesting that much of what we see and hear from Jiu Jitsu black belts comes from well known guys and world champions. We form much of our understanding of what it means to be a black belt from these guys. It's certainly a worthwhile goal to aspire to the achievements of the greats. There is much to be learned from listening to Rickson, Saulo, Marcello, or any of the big name black belts. Their experience and knowledge of the game is invaluable. They are experts in what it takes to get to the highest levels of the art.
What is often missing is the voice of the hobbyist. The student who has a full time job, maybe a family or other demands and chooses to not dedicate the bulk of their life to the art. This is where the vast majority of people who study Jiu Jitsu live. Either by choice, circumstance, or necessity we are part time grapplers. We enjoy the art as much as anyone and aspire to be the best grapplers that we can be but we are realistic that we don't choose to train in a way that will make us the next world champion. This is the realm of the hobbyist.
It's okay to be a hobbyist. There is no shame in it and it doesn't make you any less of a Jiu Jitsu student. Everyone has their own role to play in the art. A good thriving school has many hobbyists in its ranks. We need people who are successful parents, professionals, educators, tradesmen, students, doctors etc. These people give the school a wonderful diversity and richness that it wouldn't have if everyone was full time athlete. A healthy school has people of all ages, races, incomes, men and women, hobbyists and dedicated athletes. Each has an important role to play in creating a rich tribe that nurtures everyone's aspirations and respects everyone's path through Jiu Jitsu. With that said here's the voice of a part time hobbyist black belt:
Confessions of a hobbyist black belt
We have a hard time with all levels of student. In a roll I can have a very tough time with even white belts. There are times when I try my best and can't get a sweep, or submission that I want. I can find myself unable to execute basic techniques. I can be flustered and stymied by something that a white belt does naturally. Yesterday I rolled with two different white belts that I could not submit from guard bottom. I tried my best for triangle chokes, armbars, uma platas, and couldn't pull them off. Their posture was too good and I couldn't break it. What I'm trying to say is that black belt doesn't always mean that you dominate the other guy. I'm not likely to get tapped out by a white belt but I can be frustrated by them pretty consistently. Much of the time Jiu Jitsu is still a struggle regardless of who I'm rolling with. From the outside it may look like I'm having an effortless time in a roll but I can assure you it's almost never that way.
There is a lot about Jiu Jitsu that we don't know. I remember when I first got my black belt thinking how different it felt than what I had imagined. I thought I'd have a real mastery and understanding of Jiu Jitsu at black belt. Nothing could be further from the truth. I've been a black belt for several years now and there are so many things I don't understand. I still can't manage a collar choke from guard bottom. I can't do an effective hip bump sweep in a live roll. I have no idea how to execute a berimbolo sweep. Honestly, I'm still perplexed by guard passing. Most times I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing. I get guard passes all the time but it feels mostly like luck or that I'm finding them somehow in the midst of a struggle. It rarely feels like a well planned and coordinated attack.
We constantly struggle with training/life balance. There are many times that I'd like to go to the gym but make other choices. I see many younger guys at the gym 5 or 6 days a week. I'm lucky if I make 3. Usually it's 2. I always want to be at the gym and would be happy to be there 5 nights a week but the stuff I'd have to give up to make that happen are too important. Many nights I have to weigh spending time with my family or spending time at the gym. It's a hard sell to leave my family responsibilities for an entire evening. As much as I love going to the gym I have to make different decisions many times. I don't want to look back 10 years from now and think that I got really good at Jiu Jitsu and was a mediocre family man. I'll be honest though it's a constant struggle. I see the younger guy's games improving rapidly and feel a bit stagnant at times because I'm not training as much. It can be a bit of an ego buster if I'm not careful. Even at black belt I can tell myself that I'm not good enough, or dedicated enough, or not a good asset to the gym because I don't prioritize it in the way some people do.
We have to train and roll different. I don't have the time in training to constantly explore and find new techniques. I do experiment and look for new solutions but much of my training time is spent refining what I already know. In fact I'm constantly trying to make my game smaller so there is less to maintain. I probably have about 3 submissions. Maybe 3 guard passes. Most things I can do effectively on only one side. Making my game smaller makes it easier to maintain and grow on even 2 days a week.
When I roll I can't go fast and hard. If I do I'll gas after one or two rolls. Instead I roll at about 50 to 60% most times. This allows me to roll as long as I want. I can roll for hours at this pace. It also allows me to build a game that is not based on conditioning, or speed, or strength. It's a game I can keep as I age and it doesn't take a ton of conditioning and strength work. This means though that the young athletic purple belt will catch me in stuff. They'll get the guard pass sometimes. They'll get submissions. I could match them if I wanted to. I have about one or two rounds in me at young guy athleticism and speed. If I needed an ego boost I could burn up my tank in a pissing contest.
I choose not to though. I've come to learn that the younger guys respect me for my experience and knowledge and not because I can dominate them at will. I have value to the gym in that. I have found my place. My place is to get people's game better as efficiently as possible regardless of strength, size, speed, conditioning, and frequency of gym attendance. I can do this because it's how I chose to build my game. It's an advantage I have over Rickson and other full time instructors who have a great luxury of time. Mine can't be wasted because I choose to dedicate only a small amount of it to Jiu Jitsu. I think this is good Jiu Jitsu though because to me Jiu Jitsu is about getting the most benefit from the least amount of effort. In that hobbyist black belts can truly shine.
Postscript
I've been surprised at how much this post has resonated with people. I've gotten both positive and negative responses. It's interesting how we all bring our own baggage to what we read. People can read the same text and get completely different things from it. I wanted to clarify a few points to clear some things up. I think my writing was a bit too succinct and maybe missed a few points of clarification.
When I said that I had a tough time with white belts I'm not saying that I get dominated or lose a match to white belts. When you get to black belt level you have more nuance in your game than that. Simply beating a white belt is of little consequence. What I mean is that I can't always impose my game at will. I wanted to dispel the myth that a black belt can do whatever he wants at any time to beginning students. This is simply not true. Not for any of the black belts that I've known. It may be true for the 1% at the top? I really don't know. For the rest of us I can assure you it isn't true. It looks like this from the outside because the black belt is usually always winning. What is happening behind the scenes though is the black belt is changing tactics as they run into barriers. Even with a beginner there can be lots of barriers. These barriers are the “frustration” that I'm referring to.
When I say that I can't do a collar choke from guard bottom it doesn't mean that I don't know how. I have taught the technique many times and know the technical details of how it works. It's just not something that I include in my game because it has never clicked for me. People think that black belts are good at every technique that they know or every technique that they show others. This is simply not true. We have to know a bunch of techniques in order to be good coaches. It just isn't possible to have all of them in our games. It just doesn't work that way. Instead we learn a bunch of techniques so that we can pass them on to our students but in our personal games we choose a small subset. For me personally I keep the subset small and try my best to make things work in as many different situations as possible. A smaller personal game is easier to maintain and refine with limited time on the mat. I can teach you a flower sweep well even though I hardly use it at all.
When I talk about rolling slowly I'm not saying that you can/should never go hard. I roll once a week or so with our competition team. We have comp team classes that are designed specifically for people who compete. These rolls are designed to be fast paced and hard. I do it because I enjoy it and the competitors benefit from rolling with me. In these classes I'll push myself to exhaustion. I don't think it's necessary in order to learn the art though. Jiu Jitsu is about efficiency in technique and energy. If you only roll hard then you develop a game that requires it. If you also roll light you can develop a game that works well at that pace. I'm interested in the latter because it will be a game I can have when I get older. If I wanted to compete or if I wanted a fast pace game I'd have to train differently. Training hard and “leaving it all on the mat” simply isn't necessary in order to advance in Jiu Jitsu. It may be necessary if you want to be the 1% but for the vast majority it isn't at all.
Lastly, I am perfectly comfortable tying on my black belt. I have watched my coach tie it on quite a number of people over the years and not a single one didn't easily deserve it. There is nothing special about me that he would give it to me if I didn't deserve it. I welcome anyone who is in the Portland area to come in and get a roll with me at any time though if they need to satisfy their curiosity. Or they can contact me and I'll give them a list of black belts whom I've rolled with. As a black belt you have to never be afraid to throw your hat into the ring. I'll never back down from a friendly roll with anyone for fear of not looking like a black belt. That fear thwarts growth and has no place on the mat.
Incidentally, I heard a story from a long time black belt this weekend. He was talking about a bout he refereed at a tournament a while back. The match was between a well known world champion black belt who's name everyone would immediately recognize if I said it. The black belt was matched up against a no name purple belt. The black belt got destroyed by the purple belt. It happens. Black belts aren't indestructible and the cult that exists around the belt is unhealthy as it sets up unrealistic expectations. We all lose. I wouldn't have it any other way.
(it was my first digital art that I completed - wow....really old)
Day 2!! WOOP WOOP!! Today's prompt is:And the first thing that I though when I read "in action" was "grappling hook"... don't ask me why, I had just woken up. One thing lead to another and this is what came out!I really liked this one! I think I'm starting to learn how to do backgrounds! And if you're watching me for a long time or looked at my old art, you probably noticed that I love drawing pony versions of characters from other shows. I have lots of pony versions from SU characters...lots... even my icon is a pony version of Rose Quartz!And it's been a long time since my last Gravity Falls art... Anyway, I am pretty happy with it!Well, I hope you like it and see you tomorrow!
A Saudi man is trying to sell his son on Facebook at the meager price of 73 million UAE Dirhams, or about $20 million.
Saudi Arabia has always had a conflicted relationship with Facebook. In March 2008, a Saudi woman was killed by her father for chatting on the social network, an incident the government held up as proof of the “strife” the use of Facebook caused.
By November 2010, the country's communications and information technology commission decided to take action against the Web site and blocked Facebook because of “moral concerns,” but then unblocked it the same day.
A campaign last year for a woman's right to drive in the country spread via Facebook, increasing the conservative kingdom's distrust of the network.
And a story such as Al Shahry's may only add to the “moral concerns” of the government.
The sale of children is illegal in Saudi Arabia, but the U.S. Department of State reports that the Sauidi government does little to discourage it. Saudi Arabia is designated a Tier 3 country for human trafficking, meaing the government doesn't meet minimum international standards of human trafficking or seek to uphold them.
Russia Today suggests that Al Shahry may have put the advertisement on Facebook as a ploy in the hopes that it would inspire a wealthy Gulf Sheik to assist him with his finances.
While Saudi Arabia's GFP was $622 billion in 2010, largely due to its oil reserves, an Egyptian who posted Al Shahry's story on Twitter wrote that the story proved that “not all Saudis ‘bleed oil.' ”

For all the talk that has surrounded many new additions to the Toronto Raptors, there have been an equal amount of rumours about who may be leaving this summer. At this point, it seems as though the team's roster is pretty well locked in, with the exception of a few Summer League stars fighting to cement their spots. Somewhat unexpectedly, James Johnson has not been moved this summer and rumours around the likelihood of him being traded have been nonexistent recently.
It is hard to believe that Johnson has a long-term future in Toronto, though the team could certainly use him. Unfortunately, last season, it became public knowledge that Johnson once again hit a riff with head coach Dwane Casey, which is part of the reason his playing time began to dwindle. By the end of the season, he was often scratched in lieu of less talented and less defensively skilled players.
It really comes down to a question of mental state. Johnson has the skills necessary to receive ample playing time in Casey's system, which is evidenced by the many minutes he played near the start of the season. But, if he can't get along with the coach, he has no business staying in Toronto. Anyways, this isn't new for Johnson, since he was sent away during his first stint in Toronto after similar issues came to light. Still, at the start at last season, it seemed he had turned a new leaf.
Hopefully, Ujiri has kept Johnson because the player has once again committed to building a good relationship with his coach. If Johnson can put his past problems behind him for good, the team will be in a much better spot. After all, he did record a player efficiency rating of 17.9 last season. Plus, Johnson averaged 14.6 points and 6.8 rebounds per 36 minutes. Basically, when he got on the court, he was solid.
Johnson's best attribute is his tireless lockdown defence. He is an absolute workhorse on the court, possessing the strength and agility to cover shooting guards, small forwards and power forwards. Last season, he averaged a block per game, which is further evidence of his imposition on opposing players.
It will be tough to tell the status of Johnson's future with the Raptors until he shows up for training camp. If he and Casey both say everything is okay, we will take it at face value, and assume Johnson will play far more than 19.6 minutes per game this season.
It's been a while since we have shown any real gameplay... So be ready for a whopping 2 hours of it!
We have recorded a commentary playthrough of the wave 2 demos that was released to a selected audience a while back, inspecting all of the things that can be found in it, as well as a lot of fun facts from behind the scenes along with hints about the future...
The playthrough has been split into 6 about 20 minute parts, and we will be releasing a new part every two days, with the first two parts being out right now!
In order to not clutter our website with carbon copy posts, we will be updating this post as new parts go up, as well as our social media accounts.
And part two! This time, there is some action as well...
And part three, with even more action!
Four!
Five!
Final!
We originally recorded this a long time, nearly 2 months ago, but unfortunately due to scheduling and multiple hardware problems it was delayed up until now. But despite that, we sincerely hope you will enjoy this short two weeks inside tour into the demo!
eBay is rolling out a new payments requirement, and not only are some sellers upset - some buyers aren't happy about the new policy either. Contributing to the controversy is the fact users say eBay has not notified them about the change.
The issue of Immediate Payment Required (IPR) came up during eBay's weekly chat session on Wednesday. A seller said he had been "pulled back into an old Beta test" that forced him to require immediate payment on all Buy It Now (BIN) listings, which forced shoppers to use the checkout cart to request a total for combined items.
An eBay moderator said it wasn't a test - it was a new change eBay was rolling out:
"We tested this a ways back but have recently made changes to help in our efforts of reducing Unpaid Item cases. There isn't an option to opt out of this feature but I encourage you to have your buyers use the cart and ensure your combined shipping rules are set up so that it's automatically being combined for your buyer."
The moderator replied to follow-up comments:
"Due to feedback from our sellers, we want to limit the number of non-paying buyers and in order to do that, we're pushing them through the checkout flow before showing the item as purchased/sold. We understand that it can impact some businesses more than others and we've shared that feedback with the relevant team."
One seller questioned eBay's premise that sellers had requested the change, reminding the moderator that sellers already had had the option of requiring immediate payment. "Ummmmm ...... that function is already there for the SELLER to choose, not to have eBay choose it for them."
"Immediate payment is automatically required on items priced below $1000, that have a specified shipping cost, and where PayPal is the only payment method offered."
In a separate thread, when sellers wondered if the change was a bug, an eBay moderator confirmed the change was intentional. And when a user pointed to a seller whose listings were exempt, the moderator confirmed that not all sellers were impacted the same way:
"We are still in the process of rolling this out to every seller. While I do not have specific timeframes for when this will be expected to be completed, more and more sellers will be moved over to the new process as time goes on until 100% are included."
It appears to be a poorly communicated change from eBay applied in an inconsistent manner. But will it benefit sellers by reducing the incidents of deadbeat buyers?
BERLIN: The Make in India Mittelstand (MIIM) launched to encourage German small and medium industry (SME) to India has evoked major interest in Germany, giving further boost to bilateral business ties, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday."Germany is contributing in a big way to the Make in India. The Strategic Market Entry Programme -- MII Mittelstand -- started in September 2015 to facilitate entry into the Indian market has been a major success," Modi said addressing the India-Germany business summit also attended by German Chancellor Angela Merkel Over 83 German companies have expressed interest in joining the programme, 73 have officially enrolled, while 47 companies' investments are in advanced states of implementation," he said.Modi noted that the Indo-German Managers Training Programme had led to increased investments and creation of joint ventures by companies from both countries."More than 500 Indian managers have benefited from this programme," he said.Describing Germany as among India's "most important partners" globally, which is the 7th largest source of foreign direct investment (FDI) into India, the Prime Minister cited the examples of German majors in India."Bosch, Siemens, BASF... they have also started exclusive R&D facilities in India. Mercedes-Benz have started their second facility in Chakan (Pune) which will double their capacity to 20,000 units per annum," Modi said.Noting that India attaches great value to the German partnership and has had several meetings with CEOs from that country, Modi said that India had been progressively easing its rules on doing business to encourage foreign investment."Last week, we decided to abolish our Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) in order to increase overseas engagement in India. FDI inflows into India reached $60 billion in 2016-17," he said.According to the Indian government, the MIIM programme has so far mobilized investment of about euro 650 million and helped create 4,000 employment opportunities in India.

If you are seeing “Coinbase” cryptocurrency exchange website offline, well you aren't the only one. It appears that the Coinbase website and App have started to go offline time to time with thousands of users. It's unclear what could be the reason for the website to lag. However, it could be due to massive traffic being hit on the Coinbase website.
For high traffic websites, powerful servers are needed in order to hold such large amount of load. Mostly when thousands of users are using it to buy and sell BitCoin, Ethereum or LiteCoin. If that's the case, we hope Coinbase is working on its servers for better user performance. After all, they do earn per transaction whenever a user adds credit from their cards to their Coinbase wallets.
At the time of publishing this news article, the Coinbase was offline in Australia. Although, we aren't sure if it was offline in other parts of the world. Therefore, it would be great if our readers around the world can keep us updated in the comments below.
Currently, no official statements have been made from the Coinbase team. However, we are looking forward to a statement from the team regarding the downtime. We will update this article as soon as new updates are available regarding Coinbase.
Update:- Coinbase remains offline worldwide for over an hour. No statements have been given by the team yet. Thousands of users remain under stress as the Litecoin exchange rates are scrolling up, while Coinbase remains offline. Coinbase is used by thousands of users worldwide, allowing them to exchange their physical money into BitCoin, Ethereum, and LiteCoin instantly.
Update:- Coinbase team has added a new status:
Litecoin buys and sells are temporarily disabled. We apologize for any inconvenience.
Update:- Coinbase website and App are back online. However, buying and selling Litecoin remains temporarily disabled.
Update:- Coinbase appears to have started working fine with everyone. Users can now buy and sell Litecoins.
DiCola's study isn't perfect. It analyzes answers from roughly 5,300 musicians who volunteered for the survey, meaning it lacked the element of random sampling that most social science work strives for. The participants were overwhelmingly white (88 percent), male (70 percent), and old (the largest demographic was 50-to-59-year-olds). Almost 35 percent were classical musicians, and another 16 percent were jazz artists. In short, this isn't going to offer a crystal clear financial portrait of your up-and-coming Pitchfork darling.
Nonetheless, the results do offer insight into how workaday guitarists, saxophonists, singers, songwriters, and timpani players -- 42 percent of the group earned all of their income from music-related work -- earn a living. And music sales (or streams) are usually a small but by no means insignificant piece of the picture.
They seem to be most important for both the highest- and lowest-earning artists. The graph below breaks the study's participants into income brackets based on how much they make from music specifically, with 1 percenters earning about $330,000 a year, median earners taking in 49,500, and the bottom group making under $4,500. Composition and songwriting royalties, in black, and recording royalties, the bold black and white stripes, make up close to 10 percent or more for every income group. It's the middle 40 percent that appears to rely on them least.
If you add add in session work -- a slightly muddled category which includes studio recording and live playing -- the portion of income tied directly to music sales gets close to 20 percent or more across the board. Most musicians still make the majority of their money off teaching, live shows, merchandise, and (especially for the classical folks) salaries.
DiCola also breaks the survey down by genre, to try and separate out the classical artists from, say, the bar bands. As you see, recording is most important for the rock and pop crowd, as well as composers and songwriters. That should make intuitive sense -- laying down guitar on a Ke$ha album is going to be a lot more lucrative than playing along with Chris Lightcap. It also means the artists most Americans listen to probably rely disproportionately on recorded output.
Will more revenue for the industry eventually mean bigger checks for musicians? That's far from clear at this point. The early deals labels have struck with streaming services like Spotify, for instance, haven't paid off well for artists, and their growth at the expense of digital downloads or CDs (yes, they still exist) could cut deeper into musicians' livelihoods. But the broader point to remember is this: How you get your music, and what you pay for it, really does matter to the people who make it.
His chemotherapy ended on May 16. He will undergo a blood test and CT scan on Monday. If all is clear, doctors will remove the port for his chemo on Wednesday.
And then?
Chad Bettis is a major-league pitcher. His goal is to pitch again this season for his team, the first-place Colorado Rockies.
Article continues below ...
“The way I see it, it's going to happen. I think it's a realistic goal,” Bettis told FOX Sports on Wednesday. “At what point in time during the season I would be coming back is all kind of up in the air. But it's something that I'm going to be pushing to get to.”
Bettis, 28, is recovering from testicular cancer. He underwent surgery and had one of his testicles removed on Nov. 29. Doctors told him on Dec. 22 that the surgery was a success, but on March 10, while in the middle of spring training, he learned that his cancer was back.
Three rounds of chemo were prescribed, three weeks per round. Doctors installed the port on the right-handed Bettis' left side, under his clavicle, to make it easier for him to keep throwing. He said he is up to a distance of 75 feet, and starting to work with greater intensity. He also is lifting heavier weights and building cardiovascular strength by riding an exercise bike.

Timetable? There is no timetable, cannot be a timetable, at least not yet. Bettis, though, said the recovery rate for his type of cancer is greater than 90 percent. In a telephone interview, he sounded cheerful, optimistic, determined, almost as if his next start was a few days away.
Rockies general manager Jeff Bridich said that he, too, expects Bettis to return this season, citing the pitcher's work ethic and inner strength.
“It's more about the guy than it is about the cancer,” Bridich said. “Who knows with cancer? There is only so much you can control. But we are expecting this man to achieve what he wants to achieve. And we know that he wants to get back on the hill this year.”
The Rockies, without Bettis and injured right-hander Jon Gray, have emerged as one of the biggest surprises in baseball while carrying three rookies in their five-man rotation.
Bettis, who upon his return will be the team's oldest starter, watches every game on TV, drawing comfort from the team's success but longing to contribute.
“It makes it easy in the sense that everybody is doing an unbelievable job. It's awesome to watch everyone step up … fun in the sense of watching all my buddies compete and have fun out there,” Bettis said.
“But at the same time, it's hard. I so wish that I was a part of it. That's kind of what my drive is moving forward. How can I help us, whenever that is?”

A baby is a blessing
When Bettis received the news in March — the news that his cancer had returned, just as he was preparing to start the season — he was not as crushed as one might expect.
Yes, he thought his surgery had put him in the clear. But Bettis and his wife, Kristina, already had prepared for chemotherapy and radiation, researching both treatments after his initial diagnosis, not knowing at the time that doctors would recommend surgery.
Bettis actually preferred surgery, viewing chemo as “scary.” But when he learned of his recurrence — and his need to undergo chemo — he and Kristina at least had an idea of what lied ahead.
“It was definitely difficult hearing that news. We thought he had beaten it already,” Kristina said. “But we remained calm, put our faith in God and knew that he could bring us through this — and he did.”
Kristina said that Chad never stopped smiling, remaining strong and positive throughout. Then again, the couple had reason to smile.
On March 29, nine days after Chad began chemo, Kristina gave birth to the couple's first child, a daughter named Everleigh Rae.

“I don't think she's ever going to understand how big of a blessing she was to us,” Chad said. “It was a breath of fresh air. I can't put it into words.”
Everleigh Rae, in fact, played a role in her father's recovery, before she was born.
If not for Kristina's pregnancy, Chad almost certainly would not have discovered the small, hard bump on his testicle when he did.
Chad said he decided to check himself only after accompanying Kristina to a doctor's appointment.
“He asked Kristina if she ever did self-breast exams,” Chad said. “I thought to myself that I haven't done a self-examination in a long time. That night was the night I found the lump.”
As Chad went through his recovery, Kristina said that her pregnancy only added to the couple's resolve.
“It actually just encouraged us even more — we knew we had to be strong because we had our little girl coming,” Kristina said. “And when she came she just brought us joy.
“Chad was so happy. We both were. We weren't stuck on, ‘Oh my goodness, he has cancer.' We weren't upset day to day because of his cancer. We were very happy that he was doing well and thankful we were all together as a family and living life.”

Battling through chemotherapy treatments
Inevitably, though, the chemo took its toll.
Bettis received the treatment Monday to Friday in the first week of each cycle, Tuesdays only in the second and third.
The first week, Bettis said, would be “pretty brutal,” at times leaving him feeling terrible and exhausted.
In between his first and second cycles, he ran his hands through his scalp while taking a shower, and a huge chunk of hair fell out.
The next morning, he shaved his entire head.
His experience, though, was not entirely negative. Bettis maintained his weight throughout, kept throwing, stayed active — and he had been in excellent shape to begin with.
Bettis' father, Cody, said that his son benefited from the competitive mindset he had developed as an athlete over the years.
“There might be a moment of uncertainty. Then a few hours later, it's, ‘What do we need to do? Let's just get it done,'” said Cody, who owns a software company with his wife, Nadine, in Dallas.
Life is beautiful with these ladies! Love my girls! Week 3 in the books! Let's keep pushing forward! 👊🏻 you are the best @kristinagabrielle A post shared by Chad Bettis (@cbettis35) on Apr 4, 2017 at 10:48am PDT
“He's very pro-active and very positive in all aspects. I feel like that it's a little bit from growing up in sports, having all sorts of training, that sort of attitude instilled.
“It was very helpful in a case like this. You could look at the worst-case scenario and think things are over for you vs. what it really is, just another step to get through.”
Oh, Bettis is a fighter, all right.
Bridich learned that the day that he met the pitcher, when Bettis came to Coors Field to sign his first professional contract after the Rockies selected him 76th overall out of Texas Tech in the second round of the 2010 draft.
At the time, Bridich was working under general manager Dan O'Dowd as the Rockies' director of baseball operations.
“There came a point where it was just kind of he and I and maybe one other person in this small conference room,” Bridich recalled. “He started talking about how he was going to prove all the other teams wrong — and some of ‘em two times over, for passing on him.
Just got done with my last day of chemo!! My family and I want to say thank you for all the support and prayers! We're eternally grateful for y'all. We are excited to move forward and start the process of getting back. Again, thank you! We love you! 👊🏻 #letsgettowork A post shared by Chad Bettis (@cbettis35) on May 16, 2017 at 9:47am PDT
“It was his life's mission to prove those teams wrong. He had a huge chip on his shoulder. He had this inner sense of belief that he was going to become what he felt he should become, which was a very talented, very good major-league pitcher.
“I never forgot that. You have a kid come in, and he's saying these sorts of things in your first-ever interaction. And it's not some sort of sheepish thing. It's looking in you straight in the eye, dead serious about it. It left an impression.”
Bettis missed the entire 2012 season with a shoulder injury, then made his major-league debut on Aug. 1, 2013. Last season he finally stuck in the majors for good, leading the Rockies with 14 wins and 186 innings while compiling a 4.79 ERA.
This season?
Cody Bettis, at least, believes that his son might return sooner than people think.
“I honestly think after the All-Star break might be feasible,” Cody said. “Even though I think it's pushing it a bit. I think it's quite possible.”
Gray will rejoin the Rockies first; he is expected to return from a stress fracture in his left foot by mid-June.
Bettis' recovery would provide another boost.
“When we get Jon Gray and Chad Bettis back, that's no different than adding two impact starters in a trade,” Bridich said.

Taking it day by day
Bettis, like all cancer survivors, knows better than to look too far ahead.
Still, a man can peek, can't he?
For many players and their families, few moments can top the player's major-league debut, when a lifelong dream comes to fruition.
“You're standing there,” Cody Bettis said, “and you can't believe they made it.”
For Chad and his family, though, the moment he pitches again for the Rockies might prove even more memorable.
“I cherished my call-up so much,” Chad said. “But when I take that mound, it's going to be more than that. It's going to be one of the days I remember for the rest of my life.”
He is grateful to Bridich, who maintained almost daily contact, sometimes texting a simple, “How are you doing?” and other times trying to pump him up before another round of chemo, the way a GM might try to pump up a pitcher before a start.

Chad and Kristina also mentioned the support of others — Chad's teammates and their wives, manager Bud Black and his coaches.
The next step for Chad — well, one of the next steps — is to give back.
He plans to start a foundation to benefit the Testicular Cancer Society. And he has reached out to Pirates right-hander Jameson Taillon, 25, who recently underwent surgery and tested positive for testicular cancer.
All that awaits on the baseball side is the completion of Bettis' comeback.
“I kind of selfishly hope that it's in Coors Field, that our fans can experience that with him. That would be pretty special for a lot of people,” Bridich said. “But first things first.”
Bettis, as long as he is cleared by his doctors, will fly to Colorado from his home in Gilbert, Az., a week from Friday, then map out a plan with club officials. He expects that he will want to be aggressive and that the team will want to be conservative. But everyone will be united by one goal: Getting him back on the mound.
Kristina will be in attendance the day he returns, accompanied by the newest member of the Bettis family, who will be attending her first major-league game.
On that day, in that moment, the story will come full circle.
“I can't wait to cheer him on with little Everleigh,” Kristina said.
Following the recent release of ARKit by Apple, I'm very excited to announce the release of Sketchfab AR on iOS. With close to 2 million 3D models to explore, this makes us the largest AR library on the planet. And given our integration with pretty much every possible way to create 3D content, it also makes us the easiest and most seamless way for creators to publish AR content on iOS, without needing any code.
Given the reach of the iOS ecosystem, this is a big milestone for us. Half of the iOS users, so roughly half a billion devices, will have access to iOS11 and ARKit, and as a result we are able to bring mobile AR to a massive audience.
Mobile AR lets you navigate 3D content in a much more natural and intuitive way than a 2D screen. You can move around any object or scene with 6 degrees of freedom, just like you would in real life, or in VR, but without the limitations of either. It's really a new medium in that sense. AR also provides a great way to get the sense of scale of a virtual thing, which is very hard to do without the additional context provided by mixed reality.
How it works
The AR feature is available on iOS for any Sketchfab model. Download our iOS app to get started, then open any model, and click on the AR icon in the top right corner. Aim at a horizontal flat surface until you see the Sketchfab floor appear, then simply tap on it to place the model. You can then zoom in and out by pinching, or tilt to rotate. And most importantly, you can walk freely around the model which will be locked in space. If you want to reposition the model, just re-tap the screen to bring the floor back, then re-tap on the floor to reposition the model.
Sketchfab's app might be the best way to try ARKit – TechCrunch
Pro tip
You can easily record your in-app AR experience using the new iOS screen recording feature, you just need to enable this though the settings (how to here). You can tag your tweets with #madewithSketchfab 🙂
Known limitations
There are a few known limitations:
The surface needs to be horizontal. The iOS AR functionality only lets you pick between horizontal and vertical, and we went for horizontal.
The surface needs to be large enough and not too plain, otherwise it won't be detected.
Given the fact we are using a webview in a native app to offer the feature, there is tad more lag than a full native experience. We are working on ways to reduce it.
Right now there is no way to define the scale of your AR models at launch, you need to do this on screen with pinch. In future versions we will use our VR editor and support the scale defined there.
Some models are too heavy for mobile browsers, and crash in the app, so they'll crash in AR as well. We are constantly working on ways to improve this. The app offers a “VR/AR ready” filter to only browse content that will run very well.
In order to optimize for performance, we disable post process effects for AR.
ARKit is only available for iPhone 6s and above, and iPad 2017 models running iOS 11.
Here is a collection I put together of a few models which look either good or are fun in AR. For artists, a quick tip is to add a dropped shadow to your models, which will make the AR effect much more powerful. We are thinking about ways to bring this as a feature in the app.
With the introduction of ARCore by Google recently, we plan to introduce the feature in our Android app soon.
And if you are an AR developer just looking for content to use in your AR apps, Sketchfab already offers more than 100k models available for free download.

PALMYRA, PA—Saying it was important for her students to understand their increased expectations at the start of the new school year, Pine Street Elementary school teacher Veronica Potter reportedly spent Sunday evening putting the finishing touches on a speech that will inform her incoming class they are not in third grade anymore. “Many of you are 10 years old now, and I expect you to act like it,” said Potter, rehearsing the speech that will emphasize how the students' responsibilities will extend not just to academic performance, but to behavior and classroom participation as well. “There's going to be homework every night and we're going to do several science units outdoors, which will require a lot of focus. You may have gotten away with excuses or outbursts last year, but this is fourth grade now. Okay?” Sources confirmed that Potter, worried about overwhelming her students too much on the first day, later revised her speech to put more emphasis on the spring field trip to Gettysburg.

WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT
Nummer 39 met rijst wordt geuzennaam
Deelnemende Chinese restaurants door heel Nederland bieden 39% korting op hun nummer 39 van het menu aan, met of zonder rijst. Een koopje! Door deze actie drijven we de spot met de opmerking waarmee we zelf bespot worden en laten we zien dat de volledig geïntegreerde, jonge generatie Chinezen trots is op haar achtergrond. Hiermee dopen we ‘nummer 39 met rijst' om tot nieuwe geuzennaam.
De opmerkingen van Gordon in de RTL-show Holland's Got Talent hebben de afgelopen weken geleid tot felle discussies. Sommigen spreken van discriminatie of kwetsend, anderen noemen de opmerkingen een grapje. Verschillende jongerenorganisaties in Nederland slaan hun handen ineen en willen deze discussie op een positieve manier voort zetten, onder het genot van een heerlijk hapje.
De Vereniging Chinese Horeca Ondernemers (VCHO) steunt hiermee de Chinese Radio & TV (CRTV), de Chinese Politieke Integratie & Participatie Fonds (CPIPF) en het CinemAsia Film Festival, die de maatschappelijke discussie over Gordon's misplaatste grappen in Holland's Got Talent hebben gestart. We willen laten zien dat Chinezen niet vies zijn van een grap, zolang beide partijen erom kunnen lachen.
Doe met ons mee en proef van dinsdag 17 tot en met donderdag 19 december 2013 de rijkdom en
verscheidenheid van de nummers 39 van de Chinese keuken!
NOOT: Dikke Van Dale, Nederlands Woordenboek: ‘Een geuzennaam is een scheldnaam die de beledigde als erenaam is gaan gebruiken'.
De geuzennaam ‘nummer 39 met rijst' staat symbool voor verzet tegen denigrerende opmerkingen die weggewuifd worden als grap.
Tel-Aviv-based startup Synereo announced today its first ‘attention economy toolkit' component. Qrator is an app for users to monetize original content and get rewarded for sharing and finding content on the web. It will be released as beta in June.
According to Synereo, Qrator's first onramp from the existing internet is a browser extension that follows the user while browsing through content hosting platforms such as YouTube, Soundcloud and the like, and enables them to ‘amplify' content pieces such as videos, music clips or articles, using AMPs – Synereo's native cryptocurrency.
Join the iFX EXPO Asia and discover your gateway to the Asian Markets
‘Amplification' in this respect means that the user has the ability to stake an amount of AMPs on a given piece of content, spread it through various social channels, and collect a dividend if the piece of content is liked or reposted. Alongside, the original creator of the content receives a share of every Amplification fee paid.
Suggested articles Why Brokerages Outsource Their Broker TechnologyGo to article >>
Users can monitor their statistics on the Qrator Dashboard and analyze the added value they've created in terms of reach and traffic, and understand how their curation activity affects their AMP dividends.
“Our main goal at this stage is giving users a taste of how a network in which they are compensated for content creation and curation feels like. Additionally, Qrator will allow us to build a cross-platform social graph and bootstrap network effects on top of existing services. With this information and user base, Synereo will be able to hit the ground running with its decentralized social networking app – already populated with users, their social environments, identities and histories – all securely stored on the blockchain, privately owned, accessible and controlled by them only,” said Dor Konforty, Synereo CEO.
After the closed beta release, Qrator will be connected to a decentralized Content Delivery Network, allowing users to directly upload content to a distributed hosting service, bypassing existing centralized networks such as YouTube entirely. With content hosted on the Synereo CDN, and user identities and social graphs being stored on a blockchain secured system, Synereo's next step will be an independent social network with attention economy implementations.
Theodore, 21 (8/3/95), has collected one assist (0-1=1) with six penalty minutes (PIM) in eight appearances with Anaheim this season. Since making his NHL debut last season, the 6-1, 194-pound defenseman has earned 3-6=9 points with a +4 rating and eight PIM in 27 career NHL games. Selected by Anaheim in the first round (26th overall) of the 2013 NHL Draft, Theodore has scored 13-42=55 points in 71 career AHL games with San Diego (2015-present) and Norfolk (2014-15). In eight games with the Gulls this season, Theodore recorded seven assists (0-7=7) with a +3 rating and eight PIM.
Wagner, 25 (5/27/91), has collected two goals (2-0=2) with six penalty minutes (PIM) in 19 games with Anaheim this season. The 6-0, 200-pound center has earned 6-2=8 points with 36 PIM in 71 career NHL games with Anaheim (2014-2015, 2016-present) and Colorado (2015-2016). Selected by Anaheim in the fifth round (122nd overall) of the 2010 NHL Draft, Wagner has also appeared in four Stanley Cup Playoff games with Anaheim.
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) complaints filed in federal court have skyrocketed under President Barack Obama despite his promise to have “the most transparent administration ever,” according to a comprehensive analysis by a Syracuse University research unit.
A total of 498 FOIA lawsuits were filed in 2015, the highest number since 2001, the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse study made public Wednesday. The 421 suits filed in 2014 previously held the highest annual total.
The most recent two-year total represents a 54 percent increase over the total of 595 FOIA lawsuits filed in 2009 and 2010. See the accompanying chart below.
The FOIA requires federal departments and agencies to make available requests of all official documents, not covered by a handful of exemptions such as for law enforcement, privacy and protection of commercial secrets. When requested documents aren't made available as required by law, requestors often go to federal court seeking a judicial order to compel production.
“The 919 FOIA cases filed in the period fiscal year 2014 – 2015 also far outnumber those filed during the last two years of the previous Bush administration. There were only 562 such matters filed during fiscal year 2007 – 2008, yielding a 64 percent increase for the most recent period,” TRAC said announcing the results of its analysis.
The Syracuse University research unit was founded by former New York Times investigative reporter David Burnham in 1989.
A total of 2,609 FOIA lawsuits were filed during Obama's administration from 2009 to 2015, compared to 2,091 filed during the Bush administration from 2002 through 2008. The highest annual total of the Bush years was 387 in 2005.
“This is the most transparent administration in history,” Obama said in 2013 during a Google Plus Fireside Chat. “I can document that this is the case. Every visitor that comes into the White House is now part of the public record. Every law we pass and every rule we implement we put online for everyone to see.”
Obama did begin posting information to the Internet about White House visitors but only after a lawsuit was filed by the nonprofit government watchdog Judicial Watch.
Critics have frequently reminded Obama of his transparency claim, a fact TRAC noted, “the administration's record has been a contentious matter ever since President Obama's first days in office, when both he and Attorney General Eric Holder made sweeping claims about the ambitious FOIA policies they would follow in the years ahead.”
“In a short memorandum to the heads of all Executive Branch departments and agencies, the president said the Freedom of Information Act ‘should be administered with a clear presumption: in the face of doubt, openness prevails.'”
TRAC also cautioned, however, that an increase in the number of FOIA lawsuits being filed isn't necessarily an indicator of less government transparency during a particular presidential administration.
“Because of possible changes in public attitudes about the public's right to obtain government records, its willingness to challenge government's failure to provide transparency, as well as changes in the Freedom of Information law and case law, the increase in federal FOIA court filings does not necessarily mean that the current administration is more or less secretive than those of the past,” TRAC said.
“But the rising counts well may indicate that this administration has not lived up to the ambitious open government promises made when President Obama first came to the White House,” TRAC said.

We interviewed Natus Vincere's young star Denis "seized" Kostin to find out how the ex-CIS giant expects to fare at ESL One Cologne 2014.
Natus Vincere truly broke through as a contender by winning the previous SLTV StarSeries season with best-of-three series wins over NiP and Titan in early May in Kiev.
They followed the performance up with a second place finish at DreamHack Summer, but were greatly handicapped with Ioann "Edward" Sukhariev missing at ESEA Invite S16 Finals.
After being upset by London Conspiracy, Na`Vi earned a spot in Cologne by besting the now deceased ESG in a close series. Continue reading for an interview with Denis "seized" Kostin.
seized's Na`Vi hope to finally pass the groups at a major
How have you prepared for ESL One Cologne so far? Do you have a bootcamp planned for the final days leading up to the event? Do you feel adequately prepared? Denis "seized" Kostin: We started our bootcamp on August 5 in Cologne at nFaculty gaming house. We still have a few days of practice remaining which we will use to prepare as good as we can. The preparation was not the best from the beginning so we still have things to improve. After a long hiatus from international competition, G3 took place last weekend. What do you make of the results? Were you surprised by anyone? What comes to mind when thinking about the event? Denis "seized" Kostin: I am surprised at London Conspiracy's result at LAN, because they have beaten us online and we have never played them before. We really wanted to attend G3, but all things went the wrong way for us unfortunately. I've watched the streams and I've seen a lot of cool things about the organisation like the soundproof booths, the stage, crowd and the venue from photos At ESL One you've been placed in group B together with Copenhagen Wolves, London Conspiracy and LDLC. Can you go through each team one at a time, and tell us what you think about them, and your chances against them? Denis "seized" Kostin: Our group is very balanced and I think everyone can beat everyone, so it will be tough group. LDLC are showing very strong results that we can see from DreamHack Valencia which they won over Epsilon in the finals. They have a good sniper that is very hard to play against, and they have good chemistry around Happy as IGL. Copenhagen Wolves have a very strong line-up on paper, they can inflict a huge amount of damage against all teams at the tournament so they can be the dark horses of the tournament. London Conspiracy they have already showed us that they can beat any team at the LAN if they keep playing like they did in London. What are your expectations going into the event? I realize everyone will say they are in it to win it regardless of stature, but would you be happy with a quarter-finals exit? Top four? A spot in the grand finals? Denis "seized" Kostin: Passing the groups will be a happy part of the tournament for me since we have never been in the playoffs of a Major tournament. For us a top 4 finish will be a really good result, but still we have the might to be the Champions. Do you have a clause in your contracts regarding the sticker money that will be coming in from ESL One? Is that something you had added later on specifically with Cologne in mind, or did it exist in the first place? Denis "seized" Kostin: Thats something I cannot [discuss].
It's now been weeks since ESL announced the new map pool, featuring de_cobblestone and de_overpass. Now that you've had a chance to practice them, what do you think about them? What do you think about the new map veto system? Do you think these changes will work for or against you? Denis "seized" Kostin: From new maps I started to like Overpass because of tactical side of the map. It's dynamic, it's not hard to make fakes and use smoke tactics, and it's more about teamplay and communication. I do not really like cobblestone because of the huge amount of camper spots, huge distance, and bad visibility. About the veto system I think it will add a lot of random results as in groups as in playoffs, but mostly in groups because of Bo1 and the random last 3 maps pool. Adding new maps is good, but adding new maps with a new veto system was a very bad decision for such a huge event without having some experiences with this. I think this system will work against us because of removing one of our good maps (train) and adding 3 new maps that we havent played that much and we had to start to play them in such a short period of time before ESL One. At both of the previous majors we saw a new team win a title (fnatic, Virtus.pro), propelled by new players rising to stardom (flusha, schneider, byali, Snax). Do you expect another new team to rise up this time and if so, who could it be? Denis "seized" Kostin: No, I do not really expect anything new. I see HellRaisers finishing in the top 4 because of their strong and strict practice plan which they have been having for a month already. They are also showing a strong performance in online matches so a worse result will be a dissapointment. From new players I would point at fxy0 from Epsilon E sports, he's showing really strong AWP plays and in general he seems to be a strong player. You're one of the favorites going into Cologne, but the last two majors have been huge disappointments for you. Are you doing something differently this time? What if you get knocked out in groups again? Denis "seized" Kostin: This time we have taken fewer days of bootcamp, but more effective. We decided to improve more our psychological side than the in-game side, because I think it was the main factor that we have lost in Katowice on full line. There were problems with confidence and the pressure on us about this event, because failing once again will have probably a bad end. With you becoming a star, GuardiaN a top AWPer and Edward in shape, you're arguably as skilled as anyone. Zeus is a great leader, and starix an experienced winner. Is there any reason not to expect you to end up on the podium in Cologne? Denis "seized" Kostin: The only problem we could have at this event will be ourselves. If we play the best we can, we can beat anyone in the tournament, but I believe we can show the game we can play the best at this event.
seized's Na`Vi will begin their campaign at ESL One Cologne by facing off against Copenhagen Wolves on Thursday at 12:00. In group B with them are also LDLC and London Conspiracy.
In case you missed them above are links to all our previous pre-ESL One Cologne interviews. Coming up next will be an interview with Epsilon's Richard "shox" Papillon.
Today's Eco BS From The Telegraph
By Paul Homewood
Part II from the Telegraph's woeful weekend!
It is written by Maurice Tulloch, who is chief executive of international insurance at Aviva:
The insurance industry exists to manage risk; as far as possible we aim to prevent or minimise the impact of losses before they happen. Burning fossil fuels gives rise to short, medium and long-term risks for insurers, investors, and our customers and society alike. And yet governments continue to promote the production of oil, gas and coal with subsidies.
The OECD estimates that $160bn to $200bn (£123bn to £154bn) a year goes towards supporting fossil fuel production and consumption in OECD countries and key emerging economies. This actively contributes to air pollution, health problems and premature deaths, as well as the increase in extreme weather events that comes with climate change. This policy costs taxpayers twice – firstly for the subsidies, and then again as public funds are needed to deal with health costs and climate change.
Just recently, the Health and Environment Alliance launched a report that laid out the costs of the health impacts that come from fossil fuel subsidies. In the UK, health costs arising from fossil fuel driven air pollution are almost five times higher than the subsidies paid. Over $6bn of public money is spent on the industry, and the health costs from premature deaths linked to air pollution run to over $30bn.
Globally, it is estimated that every year there are 6.5 million deaths from respiratory infections, strokes, heart attacks, lung cancer and chronic lung disease that are directly attributable to the combustion of fossil fuels. Besides the immediate public health impacts of bad air, the broader effects of climate change come with real costs.
A recent report by the Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change made a compelling case that global morbidity and mortality rates are intimately linked to climate change.
Warmer temperatures create water scarcity and food insecurity in certain regions, resulting in malnutrition and even starvation. Deadly heatwaves have become a threat to one third of the world's population. Viral pandemics are being exacerbated by warmer temperatures, as mosquito-born diseases like Zika and dengue fever thrive in a hotter, wetter world.
Ending subsidies to fossil fuels would produce a broad win for society
These combined impacts are taxing public health systems and private insurers alike, on top of the costs of property damage and loss brought about by sea level rises and storm surges, flooding, and other extreme weather events. Yet world leaders continue to underwrite one of the contributing causes.
The report argues that ending subsidies to fossil fuels would produce a rare quadruple win for society. First, national budgets could grow and deficits shrink with increased revenue from taxes currently unpaid by oil, gas and coal companies, generally delivered in the form of tax breaks and concessions.
Second, those budgets could go further with less to spend on the healthcare costs associated with local air pollution. Third, the current and eventual costs of reacting to and adapting for the impacts of climate change would be reduced.
Finally, the public would be healthier and more productive in the workforce, providing even more of an economic boost.
None of this is straightforward. There are people who rely on subsidised fuel. Any transition needs to be managed carefully to mitigate any social impacts and to ensure continuity of energy supply. And we must recognise the knotty issue of carbon entanglement, where governments and asset owners may be vested in the status quo.
The fact remains that having a price that reflects the true cost of the fuel would enable these discussions to happen with more transparency.
The G7 have, in fact, already promised to end fossil fuel subsidies by 2025. We should congratulate Canada, for example, for announcing moves to end its own subsidies in its recent budget. Italy, which next chairs the G20, has published a subsidy inventory.
These are steps in the right direction. They won't solve the problem of climate change alone, and more countries need to get involved. But the fact remains that subsidies are ultimately unsustainable.
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/08/11/fossil-fuel-subsidies-relic-past/
It is hard to know where to start with this pile of garbage. As usual though, the commenters talk a lot more sense!
The OECD estimates that $160bn to $200bn (£123bn to £154bn) a year goes towards supporting fossil fuel production and consumption in OECD countries and key emerging economies.
What other countries do is purely up to them, and has nothing to do with us. Many of these subsidies go to consumption, as cheap affordable energy is important for people all around the world. Such subsidies have nothing to do with subsidising fossil fuels as such.
Is Tulloch really suggesting that people be forced to pay more for energy, presumably as a way of reducing their consumption. Is he suggesting that they be forced to rely on even more expensive renewable energy?
This actively contributes to air pollution, health problems and premature deaths, as well as the increase in extreme weather events that comes with climate change.
Most such health problems around the world arise not from fossil fuels, but from burning wood and dung.
There is little real world evidence to support the notion that clean power plants and transport are having the effects implied.
There is also no evidence either that extreme weather events are increasing, as even the IPCC is forced to admit.
Just recently, the Health and Environment Alliance launched a report that laid out the costs of the health impacts that come from fossil fuel subsidies. In the UK, health costs arising from fossil fuel driven air pollution are almost five times higher than the subsidies paid. Over $6bn of public money is spent on the industry, and the health costs from premature deaths linked to air pollution run to over $30bn.
The Health and Environment Alliance is yet another green lobby group, and is funded by the EU. They clearly are not a reliable source.
They claim that $6bn is spent “on the industry” in the UK. As we will see, this is nonsense, as there are no such subsidies at all.
Globally, it is estimated that every year there are 6.5 million deaths from respiratory infections, strokes, heart attacks, lung cancer and chronic lung disease that are directly attributable to the combustion of fossil fuels.
It may be estimated, but there is no evidence whatsoever to back up this claim.
A recent report by the Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change made a compelling case that global morbidity and mortality rates are intimately linked to climate change.
Warmer temperatures create water scarcity and food insecurity in certain regions, resulting in malnutrition and even starvation. Deadly heatwaves have become a threat to one third of the world's population. Viral pandemics are being exacerbated by warmer temperatures, as mosquito-born diseases like Zika and dengue fever thrive in a hotter, wetter world.
Another report that has been utterly debunked. Global food production has been growing steadily for years. There have always been local famines, and always will be – there is zero evidence that these have anything to do with the little bit of warming seen in recent years.
Regardless of what the climate is doing, it is modern technology, equipment and fertilisers (all courtesy of fossil fuels) which have improved food output and generally raised living standards across the world, to a degree that could not have been envisioned a few decades ago.
Does Tulloch propose that we cut back on fossil fuels and return to those earlier times?
He also claims that there will be water scarcity in a wetter world! As for those viral pandemics, scientists who study these things would say he was talking through his hat.
The report argues that ending subsidies to fossil fuels would produce a rare quadruple win for society. First, national budgets could grow and deficits shrink with increased revenue from taxes currently unpaid by oil, gas and coal companies, generally delivered in the form of tax breaks and concessions.
Notice the last sentence, generally delivered in the form of tax breaks and concessions.
In other words, fossil fuel companies are not on the whole subsidised, they actually pay tax. Talk of tax breaks is a deliberate ploy to draw readers' attention away from this fact.
In the UK, for instance, all companies pay Corporation Tax, based on the profit they make. The profit is, of course, calculated by deducting expenses from revenue. There are various rules, applying to all companies, as to which costs are allowable for deduction, and whether they can be deducted up front or over a period of time.
There is nothing unique about any of this as far as oil, gas and coal companies are concerned. And they most certainly are not subsidies, or even tax foregone. But don't take my word for it; the UK Government, the EU and the IEA all say the same:

Naturally, for an industry like North Sea oil, with its high upfront development costs, back end decommissioning and long life cycle, there needs to be some industry specific rules and a certain amount of flexibility. (The pharmaceutical industry is a similar case).
But in overall terms, since the start, North Sea oil producers have consistently paid more tax than other companies, via extra taxes such as royalties, supplementary charges and petroleum revenue tax.

In addition to this, motorists pay nearly £30bn a year extra in vehicle duty.
Tulloch is clear that he wants to reduce fossil fuel usage. Yet if he gets his way, it will put at risk billions of tax revenue. Perhaps he would care to explain how he plans to make up for this shortfall.
The Telegraph seems to be making a habit of offering space to all sorts of renewable lobbyists, allowing them to print highly biased and often woefully inaccurate columns.

Amazon said to have held merger talks with BlackBerry maker RIM, while Microsoft and Nokia also considered a bid
BlackBerry maker Research in Motion has turned down takeover overtures from Amazon.com, while Microsoft and Nokia considered a bid for the troubled smartphone maker, according to sources.
Amazon hired an investment bank this summer to review a potential merger with RIM, but it did not make a formal offer, one of the sources told Reuters.
It is not clear whether informal discussions ever led to specific price talk.
A RIM investor who declined to be named said the company was now essentially up for sale.
"This story puts RIM in play, because shareholders are going to put it in play," the US-based investor said. "It's over. This is now a company where the activists are in charge."
Battered shares in the Canadian smartphone maker jumped 10% in after-hours Nasdaq trade after the Reuters report.
But RIM's market value has plunged 77% in the past 12 months to value it at about $6.8bn (£4.3bn) – below its "book value" of assets – following a series of disappointing quarterly reports, delayed phone launches, weak sales of the PlayBook tablet and other missteps.
The shares tumbled last week on weaker-than-expected quarterly results, which saw profits crash by 70%, and the announcement of a delay in the launch of the new BlackBerry 10 phones until late 2012.
RIM's board wants co-chief executives Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie to focus on trying to turn around the business through the launch of new phones, better use of assets such as BlackBerry Messaging and restructuring, two sources told Reuters.
RIM and Amazon declined to comment.
The Wall Street Journal reported that Microsoft and Nokia, which have teamed up to produce phones running the Windows Phone software, explored the idea of a joint bid, and that senior executives from all three companies "frequently meet to discuss ways to enhance their partnerships".
One source confirmed to Reuters that Microsoft and Nokia had explored the idea of a bid.
While RIM could strike technology licensing deals and other kinds of commercial partnerships to boost revenue, an outright sale or joint venture is not thought to be on the cards for now.
"They have had approaches from folks who have wanted to have discussions," said one head of technology investment banking at a Wall Street bank. "The issue is it is hard to find a value that makes sense with a falling knife."
Activist shareholder Jaguar Financial has called for a sale of RIM as a whole or in separate parts, such as the handset business, the network services operation, or the patent portfolio. It is due to have a key meeting with RIM early in January over its management.
RIM's managers have told interested parties they do not want to sell or break up the company, the sources told Reuters.
After last week's news, the board instructed the co-CEOs to set aside any options for a sale, one person briefed on the situation said.
"Selling the company or an economic joint venture is probably not in the cards right now," the source said. "Until you stabilise the platform, people are going to be very nervous about spending $10bn or more."
Some potential corporate and private equity suitors are holding out for RIM's valuation to fall further, sources said.
The Wall Street Journal said that RIM had approached Samsung, the world's biggest smartphone seller, and HTC, the biggest seller of Android phones in the US, about licensing its forthcoming handset operating system, now due late in 2012
But it added that RIM shows no signs of abandoning its handset business.
The sources told Reuters that Amazon and RIM are still discussing ways to expand their commercial ties, which include a service launched last year to make Amazon's music catalog available to some BlackBerry users. RIM recently launched a service called BlackBerry Music which offers music to handset owners.
Amazon launched the Kindle Fire tablet in November, which, along with the content the company can package with it, is seen as a potentially formidable contender to Apple's iPad and iTunes store.
Amazon does not make smartphones, but recently there have been rumours that it might extend into that space to round out its offering. Amazon has $6.3bn in cash reserves, so any bid for RIM would have to be debt-funded or use a cash-and-shares offer.
As for RIM, it feels it could better leverage its assets, such as the BBM instant messaging and the network operation centres that allow for messages to be processed, the sources said.
RIM could also look at licensing out its QNX operating system after the late 2012 launch of BlackBerry 10, which will be the first smartphones using that software, to give handset makers an alternative to Google's Android operating system.
RIM's co-CEOs have spent months listening to ideas from investment bankers, strategic parties and private equity firms. These discussions are now viewed as distracting for management, sources briefed on the situation said.
One of them said the board has backed both Lazaridis and Balsillie, but is of the view RIM needs to develop a "deeper bench" of executives.
The State Historical Society of Missouri is working to digitize the thousands of records in their archives. Along the way, staff has rediscovered many significant documents, including one written by an American founding father.
State Historical Society Manuscript Specialist Elizabeth Engel has experience working with centuries-old documents. When she discovered a letter while going through the Society's archives, it wasn't the paper's 1789 date that surprised her, it was the author. The letter was written by Benjamin Franklin to George Washington only seven months before Franklin's death. Engel initially suspected the letter was an original, but discovered it was a copy Franklin created by pressing a thin sheet of paper on the wet ink of the original.
"I started digging a little bit and it turns out it's a letterpress copy and so it was actually created by Franklin probably within hours or up to a couple days of when he actually wrote the original letter to Washington," Engel says.
Sen. Stuart Symington donated the letter to the society in 1979 where it fell out of memory as it sat in the archive for more than 30 years. Engel says none of the State Historical Society's current staff members knew of the letter before she rediscovered it in July, but it has already become a popular item.
Engel says the high historical importance of both Franklin and Washington made the letterpress copy a favorite among schools and tour groups. Senior Manuscript Specialist Laura Jolley says the document doesn't have any particular ties to Missouri, but says it gives insight to lives of early American political figures.
"To have just a little bit of that at the society as an example of what they were doing and what they were thinking I think is pretty special," Jolley says.
During REM sleep, dreams are the epitome of living in the moment, of harnessing the power of now. During these dreams, consciousness is concerned solely with the immediate present. Once we awaken, humans—"and supposedly only humans," according to a German study out in Nature Neuroscience—inhabit a different mode of consciousness that allows higher-order cognitive functions like abstract thinking, volition, and self-reflective awareness.
But sometimes, we humans can have lucid dreams. These dreams take place during REM sleep, but we are aware we are in a dream. We can even control the dream's plotline.
EEG and fMRI studies have shown that there is elevated activity in what's called the lower gamma frequency band, notably in frontal and temporal regions of the brain, during lucid dreams. Gamma band activity is modulated by sensory input and internal processes like working memory and attention. It is most often viewed as a byproduct of neural activity; it is not clear if it contributes to brain function.
Activity in the frontotemporal region is related to executive ego functions; it is characteristic of being awake, and it's not usually seen during REM sleep. So the question obviously is: does lucid dreaming trigger this atypical electrical activity, or vice versa? And either way, is it required for lucid dreaming?
To find out, these researchers subjected people to frontotemporal transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) at various frequencies ranging from 2-100Hz. Controls got sham conditions—simulated stimulation without current flow. Unlike an older method of brain stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, tACS has no side effects like noise or tactile sensations that might disturb the subjects' sleep. Brain activity was then monitored by continuous electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), and electromyography (EMG). The subjects were woken up and asked to rate their dream consciousness.
Stimulation with 25 and 40Hz increased activity in the lower gamma band, which is not generally seen during REM sleep. More significantly, it increased five out of eight factors associated with lucid dreaming: insight into the fact that one is dreaming; control over the dream plot; sense of realism; access to waking memory; and dissociation akin to taking on a third-person perspective.
Rapid eye movements were maintained throughout the stimulation and dream sequence, so subjects were definitely still in REM sleep. The researchers conclude that their induced gamma band oscillations altered awareness during sleep.
An increase in lower gamma band power was significantly stronger in the presence of lucid dreaming, but it was also detectable in its absence. Lower gamma-band stimulation thus might act to enhance neuronal synchronization, which then "sets the stage for lucidity in dreams." So if you're planning to incept Alec Baldwin, just make sure to avoid first stimulating frontotemporal gamma activity—you definitely do not want him to be lucid.

When FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association) was formed in 1904 it's membership was comprised of only seven teams, all from Europe. Over the next 20 years more and more national sides joined FIFA and the 1924 Olympic football tournament was the first one to involve non-European teams with Uruguay, the United States, Turkey and Egypt all taking part. Uruguay won the gold medal and would go on to retain it four years later.
But the Olympic football tournament, organized by FIFA starting with the 1920 edition, was only open to amateurs which meant many of the world's best players were unable to take part. Therefore in 1926 FIFA – led by their president Jules Rimet and the secretary of the French Football Association, Henri Delauny – decided to create their own tournament which would be open to all players, amateur and professional. After two years of deliberations FIFA announced that the new tournament, the World Cup, would begin in 1930 and take place every four years.
Five countries – the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Uruguay – put themselves forward as hosts of the tournament. Both the Netherlands and Sweden then decided to withdraw themselves from the race and instead decided to offer their support to Italy. However, Jules Rimet's preference was Uruguay as not only would this give his new tournament a more global flavour it would mean that the host country was probably the strongest national side in the world at that time, thanks to their gold medals from 1924 and 1928, albeit with a team of amateurs. Despite this success it was still a rather surprising choice of host with Uruguay having a population of only 2 million and due to a shortage of suitable stadiums all the games would have to be played in the Uruguayan capital Montevideo.
The first World Cup in 1930 was the only one for which there was no qualification. Instead of a qualifying tournament all FIFA members were invited to take part with a deadline of 28th February 1930. At that time FIFA consisted of 41 members made up of 25 from Europe (but not including England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland who had withdrawn from FIFA in 1928 following a dispute over payments to amateur players, they wouldn't return until 1946), one team from Africa (Egypt), two from Asia (Japan and Siam – modern day Thailand), six from North and Central America and seven from South America.
Many of the teams from the Americas showed interest in participating in the tournament but in the end only eight (Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru and the United States) actually applied. The sole African FIFA member, Egypt, also decided to enter. The four beaten applicants for hosting the tournament plus Hungary refused to enter as a protest against the decision to award it to Uruguay. Other countries such as Austria, Czechoslovakia, Germany and Switzerland were put off by the exhaustive three-week sea voyage needed to reach Uruguay, as well as the fact that the players involved would have to be away for up to three months in total, despite the Uruguayan FA offering to pay all travelling expenses.
They even approached the Football Association to ask them to take part despite the fact that England was not a member of FIFA at the time but the request was quickly dismissed. A number of other countries such as Belgium, France, Yugoslavia and Romania were as yet undecided. By the time the entry deadline of had been reached no team from Europe had decided to enter the tournament. The South America representatives threatened to withdraw from FIFA in protest at the reluctance of the Europeans to take part, which they considered to be an insult. Something needed to be done, and quickly.
Jules Rimet, the president of FIFA, whose imitative initially led to the creation of the World Cup tournament finally managed to persuade his home country of France to enter although their coach, Gaston Barreau (he was replaced by Raoul Caudron), and their best defender, Manuel Anatol, chose to stay at home. FIFA's vice-president, Rodolphe Seeldrayers of Belgium, also convinced his own country to take part. Their best player Raymond Braine, who had scored 141 in 142 games for Beerschot in his eight years with the club, was banned from the tournament after opening a café in order to supplement his income which, as Belgian clubs were only amateur at that time, only included unofficial payments based on performance. The Belgian FA then decided that players who carried out such a practice would be banned from the national team.
In Romania King Carol II only took possession of the royal throne one month before the tournament started. One of his first acts as king was to grant an amnesty to all Romanian players who had been suspended from football for whatever reason. He also persuaded the companies, including an English oil company, for which many of his best players worked to give their employees paid leave to take part in the World Cup by threatening to close them down if they refused. He then chose the Romanian squad himself. Carol also had a hand in persuading Yugoslavia to enter although their team was made up only of young Serbians as the Croatian players refused to play for the national team.
The Romanian squad set sail from Genoa on 21st June aboard the Italian steamboat Conte Verde. The ship would then stop in the Côte d'Azur to pick up the French team, the FIFA president Rimet, the trophy named after him and the three other non South American referees (the final one being the Romanian head coach Costel Rădulescu). In Barcelona there was another stop to collect the Belgians. After crossing the Atlantic the Brazilians came aboard in Rio de Janeiro. The Conte Verde finally reached Montevideo on 4th July, just over two weeks after setting off.
By the time the Yugoslavians had decided to take part in the World Cup the Conte Verde was fully booked and so they had to look for an alternative mode of travel. After a three-day train journey to Marseille they set sail on the mail steamship the Florida. They were supposed to be joined onboard by the Egyptian team but their boat from Africa was slowed down due to a storm in the Mediterranean Sea and they missed their connection. This meant that the tournament would go ahead with only 13 teams.
The first ever World Cup game was played between France and Mexico on July 13th, 1930 at the tiny Estadio Pocitos stadium. The stadium, which was owned by the reigning Uruguayan champions Penarol, had a capacity of only 1000 and it was a crowd of this size who saw the 22 year-old French forward, Laucien Laurent of FC Sochax, score the first ever World Cup goal after 19 minutes to help France to a 4-1 win in Group 1.
But it would be Argentina who would go on to win Group 1, made up of four participants (Chile being the other team involved), thanks to three wins out of three. The other three groups contained only three teams. Yugoslavia, whose complicated trip to the tournament obviously did not hinder them too much, won Group 2 thanks to victories over Brazil and Bolivia. Uruguay came out on top of Peru and Romania in Group 3 whilst the United States triumphed over Paraguay and Belgium in Group 4.
In the United States 3-0 win over Paraguay confusion over the identity of the scorer of the American's 2nd goals meant that, for 76 years it was thought that the first ever World Cup hat-trick had been scored by Guillermo Stábile of Argentina in their 6-3 win over Mexico two days previously. It was only in 2006 that the 2nd US goal was finally credited to Bert Patenaude, who had scored their other two goals against Paraguay thus giving his the credit of the first hat-trick instead.
Yugoslavia, the only European team left in the competition, were thrashed 6-1 by the hosts with Pedro Cea scoring a hat-trick Amazingly the score-line was repeated in the other semi-final with Argentina triumphing over the hapless United States. After being 2-1 down to their South American neighbours at half-time Uruguay scored three second-half goals to make the final score to add the first ever Jules Rimet trophy to their two Olympic gold medals. Stábile's 37th minute goal gave him eight in total for the tournament, three more than Pedro Cea of Uruguay.

On 15 May, 2017, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) heard India and Pakistan in relation to the request made by India to the ICJ, to indicate provisional measures pending the final decision of the court on the alleged violations of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, 1963 (VCCR) in relation to the trial of Kulbhushan Jadhav. Primarily, India has requested for Pakistan to ensure that Jadhav is not executed pending the final judgment of the ICJ.
At the outset, it must be clarified that the main dispute is not a “criminal appeal” to the ICJ; the ICJ can only assess if there were issues in relation to “consular access” in the arrest, trial and sentencing of Jadhav. In the past three cases involving the same convention – Bread, LaGrand and Avena — the ICJ specifically clarified that it does not act as a court of “criminal appeal” but only adjudicates upon the violations of the treaty obligations, which in this case is the VCCR. In fact, considering that this not a criminal appeal, the ICJ has never annulled a sentencing decision in such cases; it has only declared aspects related to consular access being violated (for example, absence of communication with the accused), and has only ordered “review and reconsideration of the convictions and sentences” by the respondent country using the method of its choice.
Similarly, it must be borne in mind that the mandate of the proceedings on the 15 May was much narrower than the final proceedings; it was simply to decide upon the provisional measures requested by India. The object of such proceedings was to protect the object of the litigation. Traditionally, there have been three conditions to be fulfilled for the ICJ to indicate provisional measures: Prima facie jurisdiction of the ICJ on the matter; linkage of the provisional measures to the claim/rights which form the subject matter of the dispute and urgency. In some cases, the ICJ has also tested if the rights asserted by a party are at least plausible.
This piece will briefly discuss, and analyse the key arguments made by India, and Pakistan on these parameters.
Prima facie jurisdiction
In any case before the ICJ between sovereign states, the issue of consent to the jurisdiction of the ICJ assumes prime importance.
The basis of such consent can be found in Article 36 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice (Statute). To a limited extent, the question of jurisdiction is also material to the proceedings related to provisional measures. In a request for the indication of provisional measures, the ICJ does not have to finally satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction. However, this does not imply that the ICJ may indicate provisional measures unless the provisions invoked by the applicant country appear, based on first impressions, to afford a basis on which the jurisdiction of the ICJ might be founded. For instance, if the court finds that it has a prima facie jurisdiction in this case – Pakistan will have an option to challenge the same; and the decision on jurisdiction at this stage is without prejudice to Pakistan's right to contest the jurisdiction of the ICJ at a later stage in the proceedings.
In this case, India solely relies on the Optional Protocol concerning the Compulsory Settlement (Optional Protocol to the Vienna Convention on Consular Access) in its arguments, which confers jurisdiction of the court pursuant to the Statute. Pakistan is incorrect when it argues that such a jurisdiction conferred by the Optional Protocol to the Vienna Convention on Consular Access can be limited by limitations/reservations to the compulsory ipso facto jurisdiction of the ICJ under another provision of the Statute; and incorrectly places reliance on the reservations relied upon by India in the Aerial Incident of 10 August, 1999 case brought to the ICJ by Pakistan. The Optional Protocol provides for an independent basis of jurisdiction, and the reservations do not cancel out the same. In fact, the Optional Protocol has been the basis of the jurisdiction in earlier cases before the ICJ where the US, the respondent state, had reservations to the compulsory ipso facto jurisdiction in relation to disputes involving multilateral treaties.
India also clarified that the basis of jurisdiction was not the bilateral Agreement on Consular Access, 2008 (Agreement) between India and Pakistan. Pakistan's counter, however, is on the point that India has never alleged a violation of the Agreement, even though it amplifies the understanding of the VCCR. By such an argument, Pakistan seems to suggest that India is inappropriately “treaty shopping”.
At the outset, it must be noted that international law does not preclude India from choosing an enforceable treaty and approaching the ICJ for its violation, as India could not have claimed the violation of the 2008 Agreement to settle this dispute at the ICJ. However, the court may consider that the Agreement is “special law” overriding the “general law” i.e. the VCCR; and the Agreement is the specific treaty regulating the bilateral relations between India and Pakistan in relation to consular access. Such an argument, if successful, can pose limitations on the jurisdiction of the ICJ as the Agreement provides no basis for jurisdiction and the compulsory ipso facto jurisdiction under the Statute is inapplicable owing to India's reservations to such jurisdiction. There may be some merit in this argument. Unfortunately, the text of this Agreement is not available for us to analyse this argument in detail. However, India gave a strong argument when it said that this Agreement reinforced the VCCR, which allows subsequent treaties to “confirm or supplement or extend or amplify” the provisions of the VCCR which has, in fact, been accepted by Pakistan.
Pakistan also did not establish that the Agreement provides for contrary and different obligations from the VCCR; and that the Agreement provides for permissible modifications of the multilateral convention as per the law of treaties. Therefore, as long as it is seen that the Agreement does not amend or modify the obligations under the VCCR, India can choose which treaty it wants to base its claims on.
Pakistan also argued that the VCCR was inapplicable in cases of terrorism and espionage which Jadhav is charged with. However, there is no express bar in the VCCR for its in-applicability in such cases. Though it is admitted that the previous cases involving Bread, LaGrand and Avena did not involve accusations of crimes related to terrorism and espionage; and that there is no ostensible basis in international law for Harish Salve's assertion that the graver the charge, greater is the need for punctilious adherence to the Vienna Convetion – India still has a strong claim for the purpose of these proceedings. It must be noted that these arguments don't confirm/deny the prima facie applicability of the VCCR. Such arguments are ideally reserved for the final proceedings.
Plausibility of success and the linkage of the provisional measures to the claims/rights in the main dispute
Pakistan argued that India had asked for the suspension of the sentence of death awarded to the accused; and the ICJ, as discussed above, cannot be a “criminal appellate court”. Since the ICJ cannot order such an unprecedented annulment, Pakistan argues that there is no realistic, plausible prospect of obtaining such relief from the ICJ. However, in arguing so, Pakistan ignores that there are other aspects to the claim/relief by India seeking declaratory reliefs, and other directions whose legality cannot be questioned at this stage. Ensuring that Jadhav is not executed is also imperative for the adjudication of those claims. It must also be noted here that provisional measures requested by India were indicated by the ICJ in all the past cases relating to VCCR violations, where parts of the final relief sought by the applicant countries were almost like the ones that sought by India in this case.
Pakistan additionally submitted that there was “no apparent and/or realistic nexus between the request for provisional measures and the rights/relief which the provisional measures are intended to ensure the preservation of.” However, it did not substantiate on this, besides mentioning that the final relief was “aspirational”. This was a weak argument as well. India, in its submissions, has successfully shown that there is a prima facie application of paragraph 36 of VCCR in absence of the alleged communications on charges, verdicts, and the alleged denial of consular access in many instances. Arguments raised by Pakistan about the alleged passport Jadhav was apprehended with, or about the applicabity/in-applicability of the VCCR in cases of terrorism and espionage are not material at this stage, and may have bearing in the final stage of the proceedings.
Urgency
Another important factor that needs to be considered is whether the requirement of provisional measures is “urgent”. “Urgency”, as has been understood by the ICJ in several cases requires the ICJ to see if there is an urgent need to prevent irreparable prejudice to the rights that are the subject of the dispute, before the court has had an opportunity to render its final decision. This urgency, as Pakistan argues, must be measured in terms of imminence, but one must not lose sight of the fact that an assessment of urgency must factor the possibility that the court might not have the opportunity to render the final decision in a matter of months. Therefore, the fact that no execution dates have been fixed, as argued by Pakistan, is not necessarily a circumstance that would preclude the ICJ from indicating provisional measures requested by India. Even in Avena, provisional measures were indicated in relation to the Mexican nationals who awaited execution in six months from the day the request for provisional measures was filed.
Lastly, it must be noted that India has a strong case for urgency, as Pakistan has not once convincingly indicated details about Jadhav; and whether Jadhav can, in fact, seek or receive remedy underwrit remedy in Pakistani courts, or through discretionary clemency proceedings.

According to preacher Harold Camping, yesterday the Rapture occurred. During the Rapture, all good Christians ascended to Heaven to be with God while the wicked were damned to remain on Earth to experience the end of the world in October.
"This is absolute proof that I am correct," said Camping. "The rapture definitely took place, but there just wasn't a soul worth saving so it went unnoticed. The world will still end in October, as planned."
When asked why he, as a good Christian, hadn't ascended at 6PM California time, Mr. Camping offered little explanation, simply saying, "Why I am still here is irrelevant; all I can do now is take the 80 million dollar surplus my organization has collected from religious donors to the Cayman Islands where I intend to work tirelessly spreading the word of God before the End of Days in October."
Despite numerous prayers placed to His office, God has yet to respond with any comment on the Rapture.

In the wake of a nearly $5 million city payout to a bicyclist injured by damaged sidewalk, San Diego Councilman David Alvarez wants a new policy shifting the responsibility of repairing sidewalks almost entirely to the city.
Alvarez says the existing policy, which makes adjacent property owners responsible for repairs in all but a small number of circumstances, has resulted in too many damaged sidewalks and large injury payouts by the city.
The council approved such a payout early this month to a man who was launched 28 feet on his bike by tree-damaged sidewalk in Del Cerro. The man, who got $4.85 million from the city, tore spinal cord ligaments, lost several teeth and suffered a possible stroke during the 2014 crash.
RELATED: San Diego OK's $4.85M for bicyclist injured by sidewalk
Such payouts and injuries can be avoided or made much less frequent by having the city take more responsibility for repairs, Alvarez said.
Making property owners responsible leads to inaction because they are reluctant to incur the costs and go through the complex process of hiring a contractor and obtaining city permits.
The city's existing policy, adopted in 1975, makes the city responsible only when sidewalks are damaged by utility work, heat expansion, changes in grade or when trees are next to city-owned property or at street intersections with no adjacent property.
Alvarez would shift the policy to say that the city is responsible unless it is determined that the damage was caused by the adjacent property owner or a third party.
Despite rarely being responsible for damages under the existing policy, the city has often agreed to split the costs with property owners to accelerate repairs.
Alvarez said cost-sharing isn't enough and that the city needs to clarify that it's responsible in nearly all cases so that repairs get done quickly.
“The City's policy concerning sidewalk maintenance is ineffective and has resulted in many sidewalks across San Diego remaining damaged and unsafe, which results in injuries to residents on a regular basis and the need to pay out high priced settlements for personal injury,” Alvarez said in a memo to Council President Myrtle Cole.
Cole said she anticipates placing the proposal on the agenda of an upcoming meeting of the council's Rules Committee, but no date has been set.
Regarding the recent settlement, bicycling on the sidewalk is illegal in most of San Diego's commercial areas, but is allowed in residential areas as long as cyclists “exercise due care” and yield the right of way to pedestrians

During the psychedelic 60s, Kerry Thornley and his wife Cara lived for a period of time in the former home of his grandparents in the Watts section of Los Angeles.
The Watts house became a blend of memorabilia and psychedelia. Antique window glass was decorated with pieces of translucent contact paper, to give it the effect of stained glass, as multicolored sunlight streamed through the strips of dangling paper. An ornately carved wooden mantle clock had the word “NOW” written on a round placard which covered its face. An old-time radio stood in the corner of the dining room, but now instead of playing Amos ‘n Andy and Fibber McGee and Molly, the big old box was tuned into Peter Bergman's Radio Free Oz, booming music by Ravi Shanker, Simon and Garfunkel, and The Beatles.
With plenty of room for guests to roam around, the Watts house became a psychedelic social club. One frequent visitor was Bud Simco who recalled:
“Kerry was charismatic and had the ability to attract diverse personalities, people who would normally not be associated with each other, except by the force of Kerry's personality. For example, there were so-called hippie types tripping under the dining room table, holding burning candles in their hands, while right-wing types were holding forth in the kitchen. One such character I recall had never been to Watts before, and showed up wearing a bulletproof vest and armed with a .45. He seemed reasonable enough, in conversation, but he was taking no chances (having never been around hippies before). There were people from all walks of life… including a pilot for the Flying Tiger Airlines, a student from MIT, some swingers, a fashion model, some writers, some SDS student types, and various and sundry others whom I did not know. One of my guests at one particular gathering was a former motorcycle gang member who lost his foot in a motorcycle accident, and his beautiful American Indian wife, who was at the time a co-worker of mine. He had never seen such an assorted group of people in his life, for example, but with his tambourine, magic mushrooms and a Donovan LP loudly playing, asserted his presence along with all the diverse others in one righteous happening. The thing is, everyone was tolerant of the other, regardless of individual inclinations and/or politics. At such an event, many people would never even interact with other groups, in other rooms, although many did. That was the one universal factor re: being present at one of Kerry's gatherings, either at his home in Watts, or perhaps at one of the original ‘Be-Ins' at Griffith Park.”
At the Griffith Park Be-In, Kerry Thornley cut a singular swath, equipped with a sign bearing a perfectly surreal statement that seemed to say one thing while also saying something else entirely, just the sort of irreverent psychedelic koan that Kerry became famous for throughout his life. His sign read:
Stamp out quicksand.
Ban LSD.
Fellow Discordian Louise Lacey also attended the Griffith Park Be-In. She recalled:
“The weather was perfect. We were all stoned. A single engine plane came and circled, and I thought it was the media, keeping track of us, but then a man all in white dropped down with a parachute and the crowd roared with approval. Later I learned that an old friend of mine from Marin County was the pilot. He got that plane out fast, because it was illegal to parachute within the city limits. “The Be-In was fascinating because I had never seen such a large collection of freaks. I couldn't keep from grinning. I was particularly interested because some hard-assed sociologist had said that when you were on LSD you were extremely susceptible to being led. I was watching for people being led. “I saw a group of people organized into a crack-the-whip game. Twenty or twenty-five people formed and a man with a megaphone was giving them instructions. (Definitely planned.) ‘Move up the hill, move down. Hang on tight. Join with more people.' I couldn't tell if anyone was listening or just all having fun. The people at the end of the line were moving so fast they kept being thrown off, tumbling down the hill in the grass, laughing hysterically. Then some of the crack-the-whip people let go of the hands of the people around them and drifted off. The megaphone man yelled more loudly. ‘Hang on, don't let go.' More people drifted away. He was screaming now. The group all dropped hands and disappeared in the crowds and the megaphone man was screaming at the top of his amplified voice, ‘Come back! We are playing a game here!' But the people were gone. I didn't worry any more about what that sociologist had said. “Many groups of people were gathered as families of friends. It was the first time I had seen this form of organization. So there were tents, and lean tobe and lots of signs pounded into the dirt, describing one thing or another to identify who the friends were. (This is where Kerry's sign fit in.) As I didn't live in LA, I didn't recognize anyone other than Kerry's friends, who didn't stay around his sign, but it didn't matter. I ‘knew' the strangers as friends, and we laughed and hugged and shared doobies, and listened to music and I moved on. Nobody got hurt, everyone had a good time (except, I imagine, the man with the megaphone). As the day progressed, I gravitated back to Kerry's sign and others did, too, and we shared what we have experienced, eventually gathered our stuff and drove home to Kerry's. A most successful day.”
In March 1967, the Los Angeles Free Press ran an article about how you could get high from smoking banana skins, including instructions on how to prepare the stuff. Kerry decided to give this new craze a go, and in the company of co-conspirator Louise Lacey visited the local Safeway supermarket, as the two of them cleaned out the produce section of their banana supply, then brought home the banana bounty, removed the fruit and baked the inner portions of the skins on cookie sheets just as the Los Angeles Free Press article had instructed.
While this cosmic concoction was cooking, Kerry and Louise went around the Watts neighborhood, ringing door bells and offering skinned bananas to any interested parties. As Louise recalled: “This was a mostly black neighborhood, who knew Kerry, at least by sight, but still they weren't interested. He explained that it was an experiment, and that no one had messed with the bananas (which were getting brown), but they thanked him and shut the door, again and again, so we gave up.”
Kerry's friend Becky Glaser remembered walking into Kerry's house and discovering that every container conceivable was filled with peeled bananas. Becky said she will always remember the wild look in Kerry's eyes, when she walked in and asked him:
“And what the hell are we gonna do with all these fucking bananas?!” “Well, I'm urging you all to eat them.” “And what's gonna happen if we eat them?” “I'll get rid of them!” “Yeah, but what are you going do with the peels?” “Aha! That's the important part!”
As Kerry's brother, Dick Thornley, remembered: “Kerry enthusiastically invited me over for some Mellow Yellow that night. The invitation came after they had baked it. I recall the stuff was essentially powdered charcoal by the time it came out of the oven. It was nearly impossible to light, let alone smoke.”
The Mellow Yellow craze is now considered an urban legend that was promoted by the Los Angeles Free Press article and Donovan's groovy tune of the same name. According to the liner notes of Donovan's Greatest Hits, the rumor you could get high from banana peels was started by Country Joe McDonald of Country Joe and the Fish.
Whatever the origin of the Mellow Yellow mythos, Louise Lacey remembers that inhaling the banana skins was anything but mellow. As for copping a buzz, the only one who got off on the stuff was Kerry, who after toking down on a Mellow Yellow reefer, proclaimed, “I'm high!” Leave it to Kerry to be the only person in the history of the Mellow Yellow craze to actually get off on the stuff. Of course, this wasn't out of the ordinary, because—as Becky Glaser recalled—“Kerry got high off of everything.”

45-year-old Terry Lee Repp was arrested at Tampa Bay Comic Con this weekend, ahead of a panel featuring Kate Beckinsale. The Tampa Bay Times reported the news after the panel was delayed several hours so that Beckinsale could file a police report. Repp has stalked Beckinsale across the country, touching her back and talking about stabbing her in Salt Lake City in 2016, and being detained by police in Houston later that year for stalking the actress.
Repp is currently being held on $5,000 bond as authorities attempt to upgrade his charge to aggravated stalking, a felony, from a misdemeanor, according to The NY Daily News. Beckinsale's panel, Q&A with Kate Beckinsale, was eventually held at 6PM Saturday, allowing fans to hear stories about her experience in the Underworld franchise.
About Jude Terror A prophecy says that in the comic book industry's darkest days, a hero will come to lead the people through a plague of overpriced floppies, incentive variant covers, #1 issue reboots, and super-mega-crossover events. Scourge of Rich Johnston, maker of puns, and seeker of the Snyder Cut, Jude Terror, sadly, is not the hero comics needs right now... but he's the one the industry deserves.

With the union cabinet approving a proposal to amend the RTI Act to keep political parties out of its purview, the controversy about six national political parties having been declared “public authorities” by the CIC has taken a rather serious turn. Political parties, acting though Parliament, are on the verge of undoing a law that Parliament itself had given to the nation. The argument that the law should apply to all other bodies in the country but not to political parties sounds very strange. It can only add to the suspicion that political parties actually have something to hide from the citizens of the country, which is not a healthy development for democracy in the country.
The intense debate that followed the CIC's decision of June 3 generated a lot of misconceptions about the decision. Some of these border on being myths. Three of the most misleading myths are:Myth No. 1: The decision makes the CIC a second boss of political parties in addition to the existing one, the Election Commission of India (ECI).
Reality: There are thousands of public authorities in the country. It is citizens who ask public authorities for information, the CIC does not ask them. The decision empowers citizens to seek information. Even the ECI is not a “boss” of political parties; it functions within the limits of the Constitution and judgments of the courts.
Myth No. 2: All kinds of stupid questions will be asked which will jeopardize the functioning of political parties.Reality: The RTI Act is not a foolish or childish document. It was passed by the Parliament of this country and assented to by the President. It has been hailed as one of the best in the world even outside the country. It had anticipated, like all laws do, the possibility of misuse. It makes provisions for the public authority to refuse to give information if the information is not appropriate, damaging to the public authority or to national interest. But reasons have to be given for such refusal, and these reasons have to be acceptable to the appropriate authority, and not arbitrary based on whims.
Myth No. 3: Political parties give all necessary information to the ECI and income tax authorities, and citizens can get it from them.Reality: This is not true. The Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) got copies of income tax returns of political parties through a long-drawn RTI process in 2008. It was discovered from the IT returns that sources of only 20 per cent of the total income, on average, were disclosed in the IT returns. The sources of the balance 80 per cent remain shrouded in mystery. This is what led ADR to seek more information from political parties.
They refused saying they would not do so as they were not public authorities. This is what led to ADR's complaint to the CIC. All appropriate information is not available to citizens. The CIC's decision is indeed a very significant step forward in strengthening the political and electoral systems. It certainly has potential risks but so did the RTI Act when it was enacted. Like all laws, this decision will also evolve with time and use, as all legislation evolves with essential litigation.
Even if any of the political parties covered by the decision felt aggrieved by it, the correct legal course of action would have been to file a writ petition in the high court. Even the Government of India could have done that. Trying to amend the Act to specifically exempt political parties from its purview smacks of arrogance and high-handedness. It creates the impression that the political establishment considers itself above the law of the land; possibly for the simple reason that it controls the law making process though the parliament.
Political parties are essential for democracy, particularly for a representative democracy such as ours. To connect of political parties with the people is critical for the social contract of democracy to work. The decision of the CIC increases the prospect of that connection being made. All right thinking citizens, including parliamentarians, must oppose all attempts at undoing or diluting it.

Wolf plans listening tour to gauge gubernatorial run
Dan Wolf, former Democratic State Senator and current Cape Air CEO is actively considering a run for governor and will kick off a speaking tour across the state at a Cambridge Democratic City Committee meeting on Thursday, he confirmed to POLITICO Massachusetts.
“I'm curious, in the aftermath of the Trump election nationally, in the where we are in Massachusetts with the Democratic legislature and Republican governor, I'm really curious as to where people's minds are and what they're thinking about,” Wolf said.
Story Continued Below
Long considered a potential candidate, but largely silent since the November election, Wolf will speak on Thursday night alongside another potential candidate in Newton Mayor Setti Warren, as well as Cindi Roy Gonzalez, the wife of the Democratic field's only declared candidate, Jay Gonzalez, according to an agenda of the Cambridge Democratic City Committee meeting.
Of the three potential Democratic challengers to Baker, Wolf called himself “probably the least likely to run. I feel very strongly that we need to be changing the focus and the conversation.”
Baker has not yet announced whether he will run for a second term but is widely assumed to be running, and he has been actively fundraising, including in Washington, D.C. on Friday during the National Governor's Association meeting. He currently has $4.7 million in his war chest.
Wolf, a wealthy businessman, has only $1,480 in his campaign account as of December 2016.
When Massachusetts Democrats huddled in Philadelphia for the national convention, Wolf's name was bandied about as a potential gubernatorial candidate, though Setti Warren emerged as the most vocal of the group .
A state senator for six years, Wolf also ran for governor in 2014, but dropped out of the primary after a conflict of interest arose around his company, Cape Air, and a contract with Logan Airport. That issue has since been cleared by the State Ethics Commission, which approved a new regulation in 2014 that would allow circumstances for public employees to have financial interests in government contracts such as Wolf's.
Since then, Wolf was one of the few elected Democrats supportive of Senator Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential primary. Wolf did not mention Sanders on Tuesday, but said he wants to continue conversations around income inequality and fair wages, as well as universal pre-K and environmental issues.
“My concern now is that everyone's attention is focused on what's happening in Washington and we cannot forget in Massachusetts it was a 61 percent Clinton victory," he said. "We can still be focused on the primary core economic issues from before the election, and that's the conversation I want to have.”
Wolf also indicated he wants to have a conversation around the much-hailed deal that brought General Electric to Boston, known as Project Plum and hailed as a bipartisan success between Republican Gov. Charlie Baker and Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, a Democrat.
“I find it troubling the Democratic Party is celebrating the corporate handout to GE to get them to come to the city of Boston,” Wolf said, adding that if the state wants to address wealth and income inequality with housing and transportation infrastructure issues, “none of that get addressed by bribing corporations to come to Massachusetts.”
Wolf said a decision on his candidacy is still a ways away, in part because he disagrees with the high cost of a lengthy campaign season, and also because he wants to travel around the state to listen to the concerns of potential voters.
“I have come to Cape Air full time” since leaving office, Wolf said, “and that really is my primary focus now and primary responsibility," he said. "But during the evening hours I'm going to have conversations at Democratic town committee meetings and other venues. With my experience running for governor and at the State House, I have perspective and I'd love to hear from others in the party.”
Buying Your First Drone
You want to get into flying FPV drones or quadcopters. You don't know where to start. You get on YouTube and watch FPV videos. You see the super talented Lumenier pilots (Charpu, Juz) doing some crazy things flying in awesome locations. Google QAV250, end up at GetFPV, not sure what to buy so you get everything recommended by GetFPV for the QAV250. This is where most beginners mess up.
That was me when I first started looking into buying a drone. I knew nothing about FPV drones but wanted to fly as soon as possible. Just buy whatever the pros are flying and the parts GetFPV recommend. If they recommend it, it's gotta work and be good right?
Here's the truth, they want you to buy the Lumenier branded parts because they make a lot of money off them. They are pretty much rebranded parts. For example, the Lumenier FXC1806 2300KV are rebranded T-motor 1806 2300kv motors. Look at the specs, they are exactly the same. Only difference is the Lumenier is $35 whereas the T-motor is $25.
Don't get me wrong, the parts they recommend will work together and flies good. BUT there is a better way!
Disclaimer: I have nothing against GetFPV or Lumenier. I just want to prevent others from making the same mistake I made.
First educate yourself and learn the basics of an FPV quadcopter. I wish I learned all this before I started buying parts. It will save you a lot of money and have a much better FPV quad.
Let's take a look at a breakdown of the parts GetFPV recommends vs a custom built drone.
GetFPV Custom Frame QAV250 $150 QAV250 $150 4 Motors FXC1806 2300KV $140 Cobra 2204 2300kv $84 ESC 12A $68 BL20A $52 Flight Controler CC3D $35 Naze32 $25 Battery 1300mAh 3s 35C $17 Tattu 1300mAh 3s 75c $25 4 Props 5x3 Carbon Fiber $52 Gemfan 5040 $6 Receiver FrSky D4R-ii $25 FrSky D4R-ii $25 Transmitter Taranis X9D* $225 Taranis X9D $200 Total Base QAV250 $712 $555.50 OSD NONE OSDoge $70 LC Filter $16 Built-in OSDoge Camera Sony CS-600 $50 Sony 600TVL $35 Video Transmitter ImmersionRC 600mw $70
ImmersionRC 600mw $70 Antenna IBCrazy Bluebeam $65 Spironet Antenna $40 Total with FPV $913 $770.5
* This Taranis X9D comes with the X8R receiver. You can use it but this RX is huge compared to the D4R-ii.
The total does not include the monitor/goggle. There are so many different options you can go with this we'll leave it out of this comparison. (A budget option would be a LCD monitor. If you have cash to spare, a pair of FatShark Dominator SE‘s would be sweet.) The total recommended by GetFPV is $913 vs $783 for the custom built option. The difference is $154. That's a pretty big saving. Let's take a deeper look at what you get with the custom option.
Pros of a custom built QAV250 vs the recommended GetFPV QAV250
Motors – Low profile 2204 Cobra or SunnySky motors. The Lumenier 1806 motors have a taller profile so they are much more susceptible to getting damaged in crashes. Bent motor shafts can be replaced (even though it's a pain in the ass) but if you bend the motor casing, forget it. It's not worth the trouble trying to fix it. Cobra 2204 2300kv with 5040 props will blow any 1806 motor away. Not even in the same class in terms of flight performance.

Both support OneShot and Active Braking/Damped Light, but the Lumenier still runs SimonK, which is pretty old school. BL20A uses BlHeli (easy to program) and is more powerful at 20A. This is very important when your flying skills improve and want to move to bigger props and more powerful motors such as the Cobra 2208 2000kv motors. BL20A are lighter also, 2 grams each. The Lumenier 12A can't handle 6″ props on 4s. I know. I smoked two flying 4s.

Easier to tune, has built-in voltage monitoring and a buzzer output. Even Lumenier team pilot Charpu switched from the CC3D to the Naze32.

45c vs 35c Props , this one is a toss up. Carbon fiber props are awesome. But if you are a beginner, do not get CF props. It can get very expensive very fast because you will break a lot of props. For the price of one set of CF props, you can but 13 sets of 5040 props.

For the price of one set of CF props, you can but 13 sets of 5040 props. OSDoge – Even though this is optional, I highly recommend this. All my quads, except for the Vortex, uses this. OSDoge's main function is displaying on screen display in your goggles/monitor but it has many other useful functions. The OSDoge has a built-in LC filter for the FPV part, shows you battery voltage, current flight mode, RSSI (radio signal strength indicator), flight timer and you can tune your PIDs right from the OSD (on screen display) with your transmitter. Tuning PIDs is a pain in the ass and takes forever without this. It stacks perfectly with the Naze32 and reduces FPV wires giving you a super clean build.
So with a custom build QAV250 you get OSD, better motors, more powerful ESC's, better flight controller and save $142. It's a no brainer to me. Take it from someone who is building a 2nd QAV250, this is the way to go.
I know custom build might sound intimidating to a beginner but it's built pretty much the same way as the GetFPV recommended way. Actually with the OSDoge it's easier and cleaner. Check back soon for the build. I will show you step by step how to build this little drone beast in part 2.

Bengaluru: A Kannada film actress was recently in the news for filing a police complaint alleging that unknown persons had morphed and circulated “nude” pictures of her on social media. Some months back, a legislator from a constituency near Bengaluru had approached the police against hackers who had siphoned off Rs 190,000 from his bank account.
These cases made news because the victims were well-known personalities. Otherwise, cyber crime has become so routine in India's IT capital that it hardly caused a ripple–1,001 cases were registered in 2015, close to three a day. Most complaints were of cheating by impersonation, followed by complaints of identity theft.
In this concluding part of our series on crime in Bengaluru, based on police data accessed by 101Reporters and IndiaSpend through Right to Information filings, we analyse and map cyber crime in the city.
Bengaluru tops India in cyber crime
The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) pegged the number of cyber crimes reported in Bengaluru at 1,041–higher than Bengaluru police figures–giving the IT city the top spot in cyber crime among the largest Indian cities. Hyderabad stands a distant second with 354 cases and Kolkata third with 111, followed by Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai with 90, 26 and 29 cases, respectively. In all, 11,592 cyber crimes were registered across the country in 2015, 8.9% of these in Bengaluru.
Bengaluru police said the high number of complaints filed in the city implies that people here were more aware and forthcoming about lodging a report.
However, Karnataka Home Minister G. Parameshwara admitted in the state assembly on June 8, 2017, that 3,552 cases of cyber crime registered over the last two-and-a-half years had resulted in no conviction because the authorities were “not able to reach the root of the problem”. This points to the need to build expertise among the police to prevent and solve cyber crime.
Impersonation, identity theft most common
Most complaints registered in Bengaluru have been of cheating through impersonation. Falling under Section 66D of the Information Technology Act, 574 such cases were filed in the city in 2015. The next biggest offence was identity theft, such as making a social media profile in someone else's name. As many as 336 such cases were filed under Section 66C of the Information Technology Act.
More than half the cyber crime (550 cases) was reported to have occurred between 6 pm and 6 am. Sarjapur Layout, mostly populated by the city's IT workforce, was where the highest number of cyber crimes was reported–131 complaints.
Another area that techies call home, HSR Layout, reported 116 cyber crimes. Old Bengaluru locality Jayanagar saw 53 reports of cyber crime.
While top startup hub Koramangala reported 29 instances of cyber crime, the crowded vegetable market area Kalasipalyam reported five instances of cyber crime–showing that there is no clear correlation between where cyber crime is committed and reported.
Areas such as the bustling KR Market, Yashwanthpur Industrial Area and Bapuji Nagar did not report any cyber crime.
Cyber crime and location
Police point out that cyber crime need not have been committed at the place where a complaint is lodged. “Just because HSR Layout has a high number of cases doesn't mean it's an unsafe area,” M.D. Sharath, deputy superintendent of police, Cyber Crime Police Station on Race Course Road, told IndiaSpend. “Crimes might have occurred in HSR but the criminals could be operating from a different location.”
What the police are doing
Sharath outlined the steps the police have taken to tackle cyber crime. “Any victim of cyber crime can post a complaint online…. We also have two cyber crime police stations that work 24×7,” he said.
However, some IT experts believe the police are not adequately equipped to prevent and solve cyber crime. “Cyber-violence is not considered an actual crime and many policemen are not aware of the IT Act because of an unfamiliarity with the subject,” Anita Gurumurthy of IT for Change, a Bengaluru-based non-profit organisation promoting information and communication technologies, said, “Police officers must recognise that online violence is not trivial. They must be aware of the amendments to the IPC, and of specific provisions of the IT Act that can be invoked in such cases.”

WASHINGTON ― If there was anyone who should be up to speed on the latest intelligence information, it would be the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.).
But that's not how Burr sounded Thursday night in his only reelection campaign debate with Democratic challenger Deborah Ross.
Perhaps it is a new version of the “Donald Trump Effect.” But where school kids and immigrants feel bullied, Republican lawmakers who both condemn and endorse the GOP presidential nominee instead become somewhat addled.
Burr started off on solid ground when moderator Jonathan Karl, of ABC News, asked him if, despite Trump's denials, Burr agreed with the national intelligence community's official statement that Russia was behind the recent hacks of Democratic officials.
“I will stand by what statement [the director of national intelligence] has made,” Burr said.
But then he wandered off into confusing territory, talking about Iranian hacking. Karl tried to bring him back on point by quoting the top Democrat on Burr's committee, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), who said earlier Thursday that Russia was trying to sway the presidential election for Trump.
Then Burr seemed to no longer understand the joint statement that the director of national intelligence, James Clapper, released, which said “the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from US political organizations.” I also said that the “thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the U.S. election process.”
Burr, who is an official adviser to Trump on national security, insisted it was only about hacks of voter registration files.
“If you're talking about the hacks of the Democratic Party, I'm not sure that the director of national intelligence specifically addressed who's to blame for those,” Burr said.
“You don't think the Russians are behind the DNC hacks?” Karl pressed.
“I'm not in a position that I could make a comment on it,” the Intelligence Committee chairman said.
Karl then read the official intelligence community statement to Burr, who still declined to accept its veracity.
“I'm not sure that the reports that you read are from official sources,” Burr said.
He also had confusing responses when his opponent, Ross, mentioned the hacking.
“Donald Trump has encouraged people to hack into our email servers,” Ross said, apparently referring to Trump's recent invitation to Russia to try and find email that Hillary Clinton deleted from her State Department days.
“I think I heard Ms. Ross just say that Donald Trump has allowed people to hack into our email system,” Burr said, smiling incredulously. “I'm not sure how that happened.”
And maybe it's because he's an official adviser to Trump, but Burr also misspoke in a manner that suggested Trump was already in command.
“Jonathan, you know me,” Burr said. “I will help whoever is in leadership to try to bestow what I know and what I have learned as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and I've done that for the Trump administration.”
Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S.
This is a nice plush of a squid from the video game Splatoon. I noticed a couple of things were different with the squid I got compared to the one pictured. For example, the squid is supposed to have a tag that says World of Nintendo on it. Mine didn't have that tag, instead it had a Splatoon tag and some Japanese writing on the tag. Another thing I noticed is that the color of the plush is darker than the one pictured. The tentacles are also different because the tentacles on mine are a little purple at the bottom. I'm NOT angry with the plush I got. Some people might be like "Oh, its not like the one in the picture, I'm going to give it one star and a bad review." I'm not like that.

On Tuesday, September 11, 2012, a delivery truck carrying mail addressed to the New Jersey Division of Taxation was involved in an accident on the New Jersey Turnpike and caught fire. The contents of the truck were destroyed beyond recognition, with the exception of a small number of certified mail pieces, some of which could be identified as mail intended for Taxation and other State agencies. The U.S. Postal Service notified the State about this incident on September 20, 2012.
Postal officials reported that the destroyed mail originated in North Jersey and had been picked up from street collection boxes located in the following counties: Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Hunterdon, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Passaic, Somerset, Sussex, Union, and Warren.
The Division of Taxation cannot determine which returns, payments, correspondence, or other submissions were destroyed in the fire. Taxpayers who mailed a tax return, payment, or sent other correspondence to the Division of Taxation from North Jersey in early September and who think their mailing may have been affected by the September 11 mail truck fire should proceed as described below.
You can choose to allow more time to see if your original submission is processed, or you can resubmit a duplicate of the mailing immediately. The Division advises taxpayers to allow two bank statement cycles for payments to be processed. However, you can submit a duplicate payment sooner if you choose. The Division will waive late filing and late payment penalties on filings and payments received on or before October 15, 2012.
Many returns and payments, including estimated payments, can be filed electronically through the Divisions Web site at:
If you decide to stop payment on your original payment check, you must contact your bank to find out how to place a stop-payment order and the amount of the charges, if any, that would apply.
If you receive a billing notice from the Division of Taxation for late filing and/or payment because of mail destroyed in the fire, you must respond to the notice in writing to request an abatement of the penalties. Write September 11 Mail Truck Fire in the subject line of your response and explain the circumstances. Indicate when and where the original package was mailed and provide any other pertinent details. If you sent a payment check with your original mailing, include a copy of that check, if available. Otherwise, include a copy of the portion of your checkbook or check register that shows the date of the original payment.
If you have additional questions, call the Divisions Customer Services Center at 609-292-6400 or e-mail the Division

The 12 Beers of Christmas by the Gladstone hotel was an event I had looked forward to all year. It's one of the very few beer events where you don't have to buy tickets. Basically, you pay $10 to enter and then sample all the beer you want.
Last year when we went I was invited by Shawna. She had told me it was a beer event but not that it was unlimited samples. I have to say, it was a very pleasant surprise and a wonderful evening. We discovered breweries we hadn't tried before and had a great time laughing at all of the ugly sweaters.
This year (2014) was slightly different.
On the Facebook page they had created for the event people had badgered them about being able to pre-purchase tickets for the event. Last year it had only been cash at the door. They eventually folded and offered tickets through Event Bright. While this is incredibly convenient it ended up causing issues for basically everyone.
When we arrived the night of the event we were saddened to see a MASSIVE line outside of the Gladstone. We assumed this was for people who had not purchased tickets but when we asked someone in line we discovered it was for everyone. They had one line for both people who had tickets and those who wanted to buy tickets.
This is an incredibly inefficient way to do things. People with tickets should not have to stand around and wait while those without tickets pay.
Eventually they realized the problem and split the line in two. This lead to the line becoming WAY shorter and moving a lot faster.
In a 3-hour event we got in over a half hour late even though we arrived early. This means we only had 2.5 hours to enjoy the beer.
While I need to stress that I LOVE that this event is unlimited sampling, and the cheesiness of the sweaters and overall atmosphere was amazing, I do have some other complaints to make.
The first was the lack of craft brewers. While it was nice to see Junction, Black Oak and other favourites there, many of the small guys we discovered last year were not there. This could be because of a few reasons but the conspiracy theorist in my brain thinks it may be they raised the rates to have a booth.
The other was that of timing. As I said, we got in about a half hour late on a 3 hour event. The event was supposed to close down around 10pm, but for some reason all the breweries l eft at around 9:30. This could be the brewers fault, they could simply have run out of beer, but that seems a bit strange seeing they ALL stopped at the exact same time.
This means we lost another half hour. Meaning we got only 2 hours of event time in what was supposed to be a three hour event.
I don't want this review to be ALL doom and gloom though. One good thing they did over last year was to expand the space so that there was far more room to move around and a lot less crowding. They also made sure to limit ticket sales so that the crowding was kept to a minimum. That was one complaint I'd had the year before.
I also got to try a new beer at the event. Black Oak had bottles of their Nox Aeterna, a beer that had only been released one week before. Will be reviewing it once I can take proper tasting notes on it.
As I mentioned above, I did enjoy the atmosphere. People were dressed in the ugliest Christmas wear they had, the DJ was spinning some of the cheesiest Christmas music I have ever heard and the TV's were all playing classic Christmas clips and movies.
Overall I have to say I had a lot of fun. I will probably end up going again next year. I do hope they get better organized with the lineups and tickets and are able to get more craft breweries interested.
Rep. Robert Pittenger said Charlotte protesters "hate white people because white people are successful and they're not." | Getty North Carolina lawmaker: Charlotte protesters 'hate white people'
North Carolina GOP Rep. Robert Pittenger said protesters in Charlotte are motivated by racism rather than anger over the fatal police shooting of Keith Scott, an African-American man.
"The grievance in their mind is the animus, the anger," Pittenger said during an interview with the BBC. "They hate white people because white people are successful and they're not."
Story Continued Below
Pittenger -- who is under investigation by the FBI and IRS over his ties to his former real-estate firm -- insisted that the "welfare state" has turned American citizens into slaves.
"We have spent trillions of dollars on welfare, where we put people in bondage so they can't be all that they're capable of being," Pittenger added. "America is a country of opportunity, of freedom, of liberty. It didn't become that way because of a great government that provided everything for everyone."
When asked later about the comments, Pittenger's office sent a statement apologizing for the incident.
“What is taking place in my hometown right now breaks my heart," Pittenger said in a statement. "My anguish led me to respond to a reporter's question in a way that I regret. The answer doesn't reflect who I am. I was quoting statements made by angry protestors last night on national TV. My intent was to discuss the lack of economic mobility for African-Americans because of failed policies. I apologize to those I offended and hope we can bring peace and calm to Charlotte.”
Scott's death has triggered several days of rioting in Charlotte. Republican Gov. Pat McCrory has declared a state of emergency and the National Guard has been called in to assist local police.
Charlotte police officials have refused to release a videotape of Scott's shooting, calling it not "definitive."
After running unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in 2008, Pittenger was elected to Congress in 2012. Pittenger, 68, serves on the Financial Services Committee.

This week's ARMS update is going to be pretty extensive. In addition to adding Max Brass, his ARMS, and a new stage, a new versus mode is also incoming.
Producer Kosuke Yabuki spoke about the new mode with Eurogamer:
“I can talk about it a little bit now – Max Brass is the main part of tomorrow's update, but there is a new versus mode where in a fight between two or three players there's a Hedlok mask players battle over, and when you get the mask your own character can turn into Hedlok. If one player turns into Hedlok it'll be up to the other players to take him down. The Hedlok mode won't just be available in one v one versus modes – it'll be available online and in every multiplayer mode.”
Yabuki also reiterated that the new update will include balance tweaks. As for what's planned in this area, he said:
“One thing with a balance update – if you say we've nerfed this character, fans of that character won't be happy about it! That's something we're aware of, and with this update the balance adjustments are done in a way not to make any character less good than they are at the moment. “One thing I definitely think about, and that I'm not a fan of, is when it's possible to win using one technique over and over again, repeating the same thing and winning like that. That's something, in terms of the game balance, that we're thinking about and trying to adjust it so that's not possible.”
When Eurogamer brought up how Ribbon Girl can keep airborne on one particular stage and Kid Cobra being able to repeatedly jump and punch for a win, Yabuki said: “We don't want to completely stop him from doing that, but adjusting the balance so it's not quite so powerful.”
Finally, Yabuki believes that Kid Cobra may not be as popular following the update's release:
“After the update, that will probably change. I'd like to create an environment where one particular technique or one character with a certain combination of Arms isn't too dominant, and that everyone can enjoy the game using a wide variety of characters and techniques.”

A local real estate agent has a plan that may attract more entrepreneurs to Shockoe Bottom.
Faye Hager is launching a new co-working space in the long-vacant two-story building at 19 N. 17th St. near the 17th Street Farmer's Market.
She'll call it the Butcher Meeting Place – the property was once home to a butcher shop – and plans to put in five or six desks on the first floor that will rent for $200 to $300 a month.
Hager said she hopes to attract young entrepreneurs who don't keep a traditional office to the space.
“I think there is a great need for this office space,” Hager said. “People don't want big offices and they don't want to be in a cubicle.”
Hager bought the 90-year-old building on Jan. 12 for $115,000. She expects it to cost $150,000 to renovate the property to create the 1,600-square foot co-working space and a 1,200 square-foot apartment on the second floor.
The office space is also planned to have a large conference room, small kitchen area and two bathrooms with showers.
Hager said she plans to apply for federal and state historic tax credits for the project. William Bullifant of Renew Homes is doing both the contracting and the design work for space.
The rise of other local co-working concepts, such as Gather nearby at 409 E. Main St., inspired Hager's idea. She said she's encouraged by the number of apartments in Shockoe Bottom and the growing restaurant scene in Church Hill.
“This being in Shockoe Bottom will just add to the mix,” Hager said. “And if the baseball diamond happens to come, then it's going to be there.”
An agent with Virginia Real Estate and Development, Hager is no stranger to downtown real estate. She was the agent that sold the nearby Weiman's Bakery property to developer Louis Salomonsky for $1.9 million in the thick of the baseball stadium debate.
Hager is also the founder of Richmond International Hostel, which is currently under construction at 7 N. 2nd St. and set to open in July.
Renovations on her new building are set to begin this month. Hager said she hopes the downstairs will be completed in four months and the apartment is planned to be done two months later. She said the apartment would probably rent for about $1,600 a month.
A Toronto-area family who lost four family members — including three children — in a horrific car crash last year has filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against the drunk driver convicted in their deaths.
The Neville-Lake family is seeking more than $25 million from Marco Muzzo and his family's drywall company, Marel Contractors, arguing their negligence caused the crash that killed nine-year-old Daniel Neville-Lake, his five-year-old brother Harrison, their two-year-old sister Milly and the children's 65-year-old grandfather, Gary Neville.
In its statement of claim, the family says Muzzo was drunk, speeding and driving without corrective lenses after returning from his bachelor party in Miami last September and "created a situation of danger and emergency."
Jennifer Neville-Lake and her husband Edward Lake are seeking more than $25 million from Muzzo and his family's drywall company, Marel Contractors. (Nathan Denette/Canadian Press)
It also alleges Marel, which owned the SUV involved in the crash, failed to maintain the vehicle and allowed Muzzo to drive at a time when the company should have known he was impaired.
The suit was filed in April, just weeks after Muzzo was sentenced to 10 years in prison on four counts of impaired driving causing death and two of impaired driving causing bodily harm.
The statement of claim contains allegations that have not been proven in civil court.
Heres a hypothetical situation. Suppose you had $1.5 million. At todays gold price that would buy approximately 1,000 ounces of gold. Suppose now that President Obama, the Congress, and the Federal Reserve began managing the American economy in such a way that by the end of President Obamas second term, the dollar was back to where it was when President George W. Bush began his first term. Were that to happen, your $1.5 million could purchase 5,660 ounces of gold.
So, do you think you should have to pay taxes on the increase in the value of your money?
If the idea strikes you as crazy, let us refer you to the legislation introduced today at the Senate by James DeMint, Rand Paul, and Michael Lee. Its called the Sound Money Promotion Act, and The New York Sun is happy to lay claim to being the first newspaper to endorse it. The measure, as it is characterized in a press release posted by Senator DeMint, would remove the tax burden on gold and silver coins that have been declared legal tender by either the federal government or state governments.
On its face it might seem an odd bill. But looks at the hypothetical situation above from the opposite end of the telescope, so to speak. It seeks to block tax authorities from treating gold and silver coins as though they were mere commodities and start treating them, at least in tax law, as though they were what the Founders of America thought they were, which is money. Gold and silver coins are already treated this way, as legal tender, inside the state of Utah, whence Senator Lee was elected.
This is because Utah was the first state in our modern time to exercise its constitutional power to make gold and silver coins legal tender. It did so earlier this year, ahead of as many as a dozen states that are at various stages of looking in to the question of how to protect themselves against the collapse of the United States dollars that are being issued by the Federal Reserve. They are all being energized by the fact that the value of the dollar has collapsed to barely a fifth of what it was, if that, at the start of the 21st century.
One of the states considering making gold and silver coins legal tender is South Carolina. That was remarked on by Mr. DeMint, one of its senators at Washington, in introducing the bill. He attributed the dollars collapse in recent years to the governments reckless over-spending, continued bailouts, and the Federal Reserves easy money policy and said that in addition to fiscal discipline the country would need monetary discipline to restrain further destructive monetizing of our debt. The legislation, he said, would encourage wider adoption of sound money measures.
The press release introduced by Senators DeMint, Lee, and Paul noted that Standard & Poors has recently downgraded Americas outlook to negative from stable, meaning, the senators asserted, there is a one in three chance of an actual credit downgrade in the next two years. They asserted that the Federal Reserve is now buying 70% of U.S. Treasuries, set to surpass the holdings of both Communist China and Japan combined.
How far the three senators will get with the Sound Money Protection Act is hard to say. Its implication  a recognition of gold and silver as the true constitutional money  is, in the current context, radical. But it's no more radical than the Founders, who, when they twice used the word dollars in the Constitution, were referring to a coin containing 371 ¼ grains of silver. They codified that as the definition of the dollar in the Coinage Act of 1792. They also referenced gold in the 1792 Act, with a value of 15 times that of silver. We are in a time when understanding the concept of constitutional money will point the way to the policies needed to steer our country out of its current difficulties.

Pleaser Women Lose out – The Difference Between Pleasing and Giving
I see a huge problem among us women, especially when women are in a relationship. This problem is the problem of pleasing all the time. Most women would pass this off as ‘oh it doesn't apply to me', I'm a cool woman and I would never be one of those silly pleasers!
However, in my experience, many women like to think they're not acting like pleasers, but they actually are. Part of this comes from not really understanding the difference between pleasing and giving. (Click here to take the quiz on “How High Value High Status Am I on Facebook?”)
And more often than not, truly giving to someone is counter-intuitive. It's not something many of us have been taught. And many women mistake pleasing for giving.
The trap: Your own feminine mindset. What is valuable to men in a relationship is not the same as what is valuable to women. Most women will read this and nod, yet continue (for the rest of their lives) to give to their man in the same way they always have, which is in a way that the man perceives little value, and wonder why the relationship is failing, why they're becoming another divorce statistic, or why their man is withdrawing or leaving, or cheating. (read my article about how to deal fear of being alone)
It's not anyone's fault. How are we supposed to know what we've never been taught?
Anyway. In your relationship, being a pleaser is a very quick way to destroy the attraction. Most of us would just rather ignore the loss. Denial is a common option. Denial feels certain, after all.
If you want to be a treasured friend to somebody, being a pleaser won't get you there.
Pleasing and giving are two very different things. But they do have one thing in common: each of these actions fulfill 1 or more of our 6 human needs, and as such, I believe there is no truly selfless act. Even if a man dies for his wife – dying for someone is one of the most self-sacrificing acts there are. However, even in a situation like this, we are serving ourselves in some way. However small.
What I've noticed is that most of us operate more from a pleasing place than a giving place, and we are not consciously aware of it.
(There Are Exactly 7 Signs That A Woman is Perceived as Low Value to Men. Do You Know What They Are? (& How to Avoid Them Like the Plague)? Click here to find out right now…)
The real difference: Pleasing vs Giving
Pleasing is about you. When you try to please someone, you're coming from a place of fear – fear of loss of love, and desperation or neediness, and you are looking for something in return; whether that be a reaction, or approval, or to get out of trouble (a mistake I've made) and a sign that you actually ‘did ok'.
Note: it's not that you can't ever need or want somebody's approval or have fear – the point is that you don't want to live there, and consistently act from that state of emotion.
Giving, however, comes from a place of pride. Giving is what you do when you truly care about somebody, and their future, and what they really need – not what they want, and not even what they seem to want or say they want.
Examples of pleasing…
1) A good example of pleasing would be: the woman who makes plans with her friends, but when her man calls to meet up, she changes her plans with her friends because, inside, she feels bad for saying ‘no' to him. Why? Because she feels she might lose his love. Poor friends! (read my article about don't be a woman who fits in)
2) Another example: Stacking up too many plans with loved ones and “doing too much” for the people around you. You are attending to so many demands and ‘requests' of your loved ones that you can't keep to your plans and end up late for people or having to cancel on people – and worse still, you are so much of a pleaser that you are way too scared to call up and say ‘I'm so sorry, I'm going to be late by 30 minutes' (and make sure it doesn't happen again) that you end up disappointing people because you kept them in the dark.
So much for ‘pleasing'.
3) The classic example of pleasing: parents giving their children everything they want (or almost everything). And saying that they do it out of love. I'm not saying they don't love their child; but this act itself, more often than not, comes from a place of not wanting to lose the child's love, affection or even the attachment of the child. After all, the more dependent someone is on you, the more safe they are. At least we sometimes trick ourselves in to believing this.
Too bad children are so dependent on you. Until they're not.
The ‘K' Word
The classic phrase used by a pleaser is: ‘keep him happy' or ‘keep her happy'.
A lot of women strive to ‘keep' a man happy. Can you see what I'm getting at here?
If you're not a pleaser, there's nothing wrong with the word keep, because you're genuinely keeping someone – in the sense that you give so much to someone that they're a raving fan of you – but a pleaser woman's ‘keep' is very different from a high value woman's keep.
(Do You Know What the 2 Most Critical Elements of Any Intimate Relationship Are and How They Will Make or Break Your Love Life? Click here to find out right now…)
Pleaser women become low value women
We all value givers, even if their actions make us angry and resentful at first, because givers are valuable women. I mean truly valuable. However, we don't truly value pleasers. People who seem to value pleasers are people you don't want in your life. They're most likely leeching off your insecurities and your desperation for love and approval. It's easy to manipulate pleasers. We don't ever respect people we can manipulate. Let alone value them.
Giving is an act, a message, a gesture, done from a place of pride – knowing that giving won't take away anything from you. Giving is something you do because you already have so many internal resources that you can afford to give to others. See, pleasers have little to no internal resources (little value), because the ‘feel good' moment from pleasing only lasts so long and it's like a bottle being emptied the minute it is filled, and then needing to be filled, again and again.
I can attest to the difference between pleasing and giving because I've done both in my life. I've gone and pleased people and felt the awful after- effects. It never works out – even if it does for a day. In fact, I've ‘pleased' – only to find that those ‘friends' I wanted to please actually don't really value me. No wonder. I wasn't even valuing myself!
I've given so much also, that I recognize just how rewarding the act of truly giving is. I've given in ways that no-one would expect me to. I can say that it always works out. Like I heard once: “what you give, you get to keep. What you fail to give, you lose forever”. Giving adds to your sense of pride, but pleasing never does.
So what is giving?
Examples…
1) Giving could be making someone else feel significant, giving them resources to feel good and to feel appreciated, rather than trying to ‘keep them happy' out of fear of losing them. So, you give to them despite your fear of losing them (and therefore your actions are coming from a place of resourcefulness and high value, rather than fear).
2) Giving could be telling your man that you need time to yourself, to re-charge so that you can come back to the relationship with more to give, instead of seeing him every time he says he misses you. (Click here to take the quiz on “Am I Dating a Commitment Friendly Man?”)
3) Giving could be not having sex with your man at all this time, rather than laying there like a dead horse while he does his thing, like he's having sex with a blow-up doll or a rigid post.

How to give instead of Pleasing:
Now, learning how to truly give to a man (or to anyone at all) is not something you can easily learn overnight. It's a big topic, much too big for this article in itself, and it's a learning process.
Nonetheless, here is a start on what you need to do to become a giver rather than a pleaser:
1) Get out a piece of paper, right now. Write down every decision you have made (or that you can remember) out of a need to please someone in the last month. Next to each of those decisions you've listed, write down the consequence of that decision. How did you feel after making that decision?
How did the person you wanted to please react? Did the reaction you wanted last? Did the reaction you hoped for even occur at all?
2) From now on, instead of focusing on how you might ‘upset people', what you must do in this moment to prevent someone from being unhappy with you, or how you might ‘disappoint people' or ‘make people dislike you', start using some new language. As soon as you notice yourself reacting out of fear, ask yourself, what would really benefit me as well as this person right now? What would truly benefit our relationship? (Click here to register to watch the Commitment Masterclass for free.)
For example, you may be scared to speak up in a situation where you feel your opinion is not as ‘clever' or ‘right' or that by speaking up, people will ostracize you. In fact, truly giving to these people would be to actually stand up with certainty and either share, or tell the truth. Whatever the situation calls for.
By the way! I just want to ask you a question: can you share with us why the word ‘keep' in the phrase ‘keep him happy' is dangerous? Share with us below, your experience with pleasers and givers. Looking forward to hearing from you.

Although Wichita Falls is my hometown, most of my years have been spent abroad, and now being back, I am fascinated each day by new things I am learning about this wonderful city we call home. Music means the world to me and I don't often associate Wichita Falls as being known for its musical history, but am now completely amazed by my new finding.
I was having a conversation with a dear older friend of mine who is not only a musical enthusiast, but quite a player also, and I happened to mention I lived near York Avenue. Well, a light went off and he was elated to tell me the story of a famous recording studio back in the day that happened to be, at one time, down the block.
I believe mostly all of us have heard of the greats stopping through over the years, like Elvis, but who would have thought Buddy Holly, in late 1954 and April of 1955, would have ventured to Wichita Falls with Don Guess and Sonny Curtis and recorded some of their very first songs before their Decca recordings.

The Studio is now a private home, but in 1953, it was the dream-child of a couple by the name of Sally, who took on the role of studio manager, and Lewis Nesman, who was the primary owner and chief engineer. Other musicians such as The Sprague Brothers, Lew Williams, Slim Whitman and more also recorded and frequented Nesman studio.
There was an article all about Nesman Studios in the June, 1990 edition of Rockin' 50s Magazine. You can read the full article posted by Wichita Falls Records here .
I love coming across amazing historical moments like these, something I was completely unaware of and had never heard about. My dear friend recollected that one of his most cherished moments ever was standing in that studio and on that very stage knowing Buddy Holly had been there in the not-so-distant past.
The song American Pie “The Day the Music Died” written by Don Mclean was all about February 5,1959 when the world lost not just Buddy Holly and Richie Valens, but also “The Big Bopper” Richardson and the pilot that was flying them to their next show, Holly had chartered the flight.
A former priest will finally pay for his sins.
John Bernard Feit, 85, was convicted Thursday in the decades-old murder of Irene Garza, a Texas teacher and beauty queen who had visited his church for confession.
The jury handed down its ruling Thursday evening after deliberating for about 6 1/2 hours at the Hidalgo County Courthouse in Edinburg.
Feit was accused of strangling the 25-year-old woman on April 16, 1960 after she visited Sacred Heart Catholic Church in McAllen.
Garza never returned home. Her body turned up five days later in a canal, The Monitor reported.
An autopsy determined that Garza, who was Miss All South Texas Sweetheart 1958, was beaten and raped while unconscious and asphyxiated.
Prosecutors presented evidence that elected and church officials suspected Feit of killing the woman but wanted to avoid prosecuting him because it would harm the church's reputation and elected officials politically.
A former monk also told jurors that Feit confessed to him three years after the killing and showed no remorse.
Feit had been accused of attacking another young woman in a church in a nearby town just weeks before Garza's death. He eventually pleaded no contest and was fined $500. He left the priesthood in 1972.
The disgraced priest is scheduled to be sentenced Friday. He could be sentenced to up to 99 years or life imprisonment.

It was the typical January Detroit Auto Show experience outside.
Finding a place to park. Steam rise creeping out of manhole covers. Cold. Dark. Hunched shoulders trying to maintain body heat walking Washington Boulevard.
I was with my father.
He's been dealing with heart problems the past few years and this night he was chipper. He had a twinkle in his eye, happy to be out and about and wore his new big poppa shirt. We had a great time that night as fathers and sons do around automobiles. As boys do.
He was proud, I was proud. I work on the General Motors marketing team and our product is something my family can rally around. Talking about Search Engine Optimization and Display Media strategies is not necessarily something to discuss with family, but a vehicle…. everyone has an opinion.
My father, now retired, was an architect and has always been a farm boy from Greenville, Ohio. Having grown up with tractors and combines he knows quite a bit about the internal combustion engine. He is my automotive resource and is eager to point out features on car engines like variable valve timing, how Americans are obsessed with chrome, and telling the quality of a vehicle by the tightness of the seams and its lines.
On this cold night as we navigated downtown Detroit to the Bucharest Grille for the legendary Bucharest Shawarma claiming the crown over coney dogs I thought, “Wow, I've been a part of this city almost twenty years now.” It's changed. I've changed. Landmarks that night were marks for my memory.
Some thirteen years ago I tended bar at the Ponchartrain across from Cobo Hall where the autos were under bright tungsten lights. There my bald-headed bar mentor boss hopped over the counter and got in a customer's face to get the F out of his bar. I have melancholic memories of sitting on the dock smoking cigarettes in our ties and black aprons on our breaks. One jheri-curled co-worker with a girl's name tattooed on his chest with a little red heart would work on his carburetor in the loading dock smoking a dangling cigarette. Working on his car carburetor in a tie and black apron and going back into the restaurant to wait on his tables in between.
The 4am breakfasts we'd have at the Met Cafe in Greektown after nights of clubbing or driving desolate ghost streets to the life soundtrack of Detroit techno. I remember getting into it with Nation of Islam guys proselytizing about our cigarette smoke negativity and Farouk, the owner from Dearborn, would tell them to get the F out of his restaurant because we were loyal customers.
Or the house party in Woodbridge where music was banging, bodies grinding, kegs pouring and then the cops came. Uh Oh? Nope. The cops wanted to know who had the new yellow Camaro out front and could they race it. I love this city.
And having lived in Detroit you know about getting your car stolen, your buddy getting a gun pulled on him, somebody goes to jail, a co-worker getting car jacked and shot five times, and a co-worker getting murdered and tortured after picking up a young kid in a club. Lots of ghosts and gritty memories.
I heard on NPR one time how Detroit, the Arsenal of Democracy, was once the center of industry and arguably the source of America's wealth and power. 70 years ago this city built the infrastructure to bomb places like Berlin and Tokyo and now it's flip-flopped. Look at those cities and compare Detroit. It is profound, karmic really, but on a night like this with my father I felt and thought about the evolution, the change, the sense things aren't necessarily coming back how we want or expect. As we looked at all those gorgeous vehicles and their engineering you can feel we're not going back to the apocalyptic vibe this city had in the 80s and 90s. Detroit will be a model of how to transform. Watch.
The energy of our city's temple at the Detroit Institute of Arts, the Diego Rivera Mural, is palpable. Across the street at Scarab Club I once philosophized to dawn with a friend and a tall Johnny-Cash-Style Artist in Residence. Diego Rivera's hand-carved signature is overhead in the rafters among other artists. You sense something great happened there. Today you can go to high-tech meet ups like Detroit Startup Drinks and meet patchouli smelling urban farmers moving in from rich New York and Connecticut suburbs with dirt caked into their fingernails. The mural captures their spirit.
At the show my father and I walked over to the dark grey Corvette Stingray on display as so many did those two weeks. Having seen the reveal I was shocked at my emotional reaction at seeing it in person. It makes your heart drop and go, “Damn, that's a bad ass ride.” In the past two years I've seen myself turning into a “car guy” as I'm surrounded and live and breathe it. However, I've never really been a sports car guy. I tend to fall into the CTS-V or loaded Lacrosse category. But after seeing that Stingray I was a 15-year-old kid with Stephanie Seymour posters scotch taped to his bedroom wall with popped out eyes thinking “Damn, that's a bad ass ride”.
I was looking around at all the industry types at the Auto Show and thought of the co-workers and agency folks I work with, many of whom I would now consider friends and confidants. These automobiles tend to personify us, our world, our economy, our culture, our country. We strive to have the fierce elegance of a Corvette or the refined ruggedness of a Sierra. At work I see it in the camaraderie, in the focus, the long hours, the clothes, the ipads, the cell phones, the meetings, the conference calls, the big data, the elevator rides over Hart Plaza and the sacred PowerPoint decks. I thought of our industry ancestors from the Mad Men era, the Don Drapers, and felt a connection with those giants when the mantra was “As GM goes, so goes the nation“. As my dad looked at that Corvette with me he got teary eyed. He really paused and his lips quivered.
“You guys are going to run out of that. That's one of the finest cars America has ever produced.”, an Ohio farm boy said to the Detroit kid.
I love this city. Watch.

Cheating on someone, or being cheated on (read more about infidelity here), represents one of the more traumatic events that can occur in any romantic relationship. Although the reported incidence rate of infidelity varies considerably by sample and relationship type, suffice it to say that affairs are not uncommon in marital and non-marital relationships. And people (in those relationships) suspect it's common – when asked, people generally presume that people cheat frequently (hence the prevalence of tabloid magazine lists on ‘how to spot a cheater').
Yet, despite the apparent widespread presumption that staying true to another is no easy task, people likewise presume their own partners are highly unlikely to stray. A number of studies, mostly focused on married individuals, have documented a clear gap between the frequency of infidelity (i.e., people admitting they have cheated on their spouses) and individuals' expectations that their partner has cheated. Basically, people believe others cheat, and even report doing it, but still don't tend to think it has happened, or will happen, in their relationships.
In a recent study published in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, researchers identified daters' (vs. married spouses) thoughts about the frequency of cheating in their own and others' relationships. The researchers also wanted to see how well individuals' expectations about what happens in their relationship might map on to reality. They surveyed nearly 200 individuals, ages 17-32 (89 males; 108 females), who had been dating their partners an average of about 22 months. Most indicated they were in an exclusive relationship…but were they? – keep reading!
As part of a larger study, all participants were asked a series of questions about infidelity in their own and others' relationships so the researchers could compare what daters think happens in their own vs. others' relationships. Here are some of the key findings:
Not surprisingly, almost all the daters indicated that it is very important their partners don't cheat on them.
As such, most participants (more than 9 out of every 10) said they'd want to know if their partner has ever or does cheat on them.
Yet, despite how much people care about infidelity, the majority of participants (roughly 7 out of every 10) indicated that they had not had an explicit conversation with their partner about what “counts” as cheating or what they expect from their partners in the fidelity department.
Summary: People care a lot about (in)fidelity, but aren't likely to discuss it with their partners. You may be thinking “Why would they discuss such things when of course everyone knows you're not supposed to cheat?” Never mind the fact that there's an enormous amount of variation in what constitutes cheating, but it gets more interesting:
These very same participants guesstimated that the average person of the opposite sex (in a similar type of dating relationship) has a roughly 40% chance of ever cheating on a romantic partner.
And about 9% of the study participants reported having actually cheated on their own partner at some point in the past.
cheated on their own partner at some point in the past. But when asked directly, only 5% of participants believed that their own partner had cheated or will cheat at some point in the relationship.
In other words, daters in this study were unlikely to talk about infidelity with their partners but, at the same time, presumed that the likelihood of cheating in the general population was fairly high. And they reported actually cheating at twice the rate than they thought their own partners would cheat. Add this pattern of results to the lowest published rate of infidelity in dating relationships — 14% — and it becomes pretty clear that folks are engaging in some fairly (risky) wishful thinking.
Do these results mean that people should be walking around looking for cues that their partner is a philanderer? Not at all. But the findings do highlight the degree to which people are motivated to really want to believe their relationships and partner is better than others. And that wishful thinking may blind individuals to real warning signs.

Secret documents from the Military Police report. They show which information was sent from Afghanistan to the Bundeswehr Operational Command in Potsdam. One says: "Only the inner circle to have knowledge of these procedures. No passing on to third parties."
German Special Forces were involved in the controversial Kunduz air strike which caused the deaths of 142 people, it has been revealed.
What is the KSK? The Kommando Spezialkräfte (KSK) is the elite unit of the Bundeswehr. It was formed in 1996 and is based in Calw in Baden-Württemberg. The unit consists of 1,100 men, with around 400 in the commando companies. 1 / 3 vorheriges Element nächstes Element
More news Fatal accident in Turkey Coa mine explosion and collapse leaves 19 dead Turkey has been hit by a fatal accident as an explosion and collapse at a coal mine leaves at least 19 people dead, according to a Minister.
More details are still emerging about the deadly bombing in Afghanistan following the resignation of former Defence Minister Franz Josef Jung after a cover up.
It has now come to light that the elite Kommando Spezialkräfte (KSK) unit played a role in the attack on September 4 which killed 142 people including civilians.
BILD can reveal how the KSK intervened in the strike on two fuel tanker trucks in an overnight covert operation.
At least five officers and NCOs advised Colonel Georg Klein, commander of the German military forces in the Kunduz region.
All five belonged to a secret unit codenamed Task Force 47, or TF47, which had Colonel Klein as its presumptive head.
TF47 comprises approximately half of the KSK soldiers, whose goal is to hunt for Taliban leaders and terrorists. The unit has its own command centre with advanced equipment at the German camp in Kunduz.
The first tip arrived from an Afghan informant on the evening of September 3. The Taliban had reportedly hijacked two gasoline tanker trucks which had then become stuck on a sandbank six kilometres from the German camp.
TF 47 soldiers requested help from an American B1B bomber. In the 90 minutes it took the plane to locate the tanker trucks, Colonel Klein was called to the TF47 command post.
During the night Colonel Klein took over as acting commander of TF47. An internal review by the Bundeswehr said that according to NATO rules, Klein would be allowed to order an attack only in this role.
A TF47 officer spoke approximately seven times by phone throughout the night with the Afghan informant who identified four of the Taliban leaders who were with the tankers, as well as other details.
Although the soldier still remains unnamed he was questioned at length by both NATO and German military police investigators. The fact that he has remained anonymous is directly related to his KSK membership status.
At the TF47 command post, a KSK man led the secret mission protocol.
The new information verifies a previously unknown fact that the elite forces played an important role.
In the first military police report drawn up immediately after the bombing, it was not apparent from the documents which people contributed to decision-making on the night of attack.
The TF47 mission protocol will be withheld from NATO investigators due to German national security issues.
Task Force 47 is mentioned in the 575-page secret NATO Final Report, but without any reference to the KSK.
According to information provided to BILD, then-Defence Minister Franz Josef Jung was informed of the KSK's participation but did not make this knowledge public.
What does his successor have to say about the new details?
A spokesman for Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg told BILD: “Task Force 47 was also the subject of the briefing to the co-ordinators of the Defence Committee on November 6.”
The fact that a unit of elite KSK troops was serving with TF47 was not mentioned.
Karim Popal, a lawyer and advocate for the victims, told the Hannover ‘Neue Presse' newspaper that there were at least 137 civilian victims killed, as well as 22 missing and 20 injured.
“We alone have registered 91 widows of victims of the bombardment as well as 163 orphans.”
Popal spent six weeks in Kunduz investigating the incident along with fellow lawyers, and said he was absolutely certain his team's research was correct.
“We have identification documents of victims and relatives and we are also prepared to conduct DNA tests.”
No one wanted “money to flow to the Taliban”, explained the lawyer, who is from Bremenand of Afghan origin.
“It is about helping the families, helping the widows and the many orphans.”

At the time Amriki was killed last April , he had been exchanging messages with Mr. Yazdani in India for more than a year, patiently offering encouragement as his recruit tried and failed to get a visa first to Greece, and then to Turkey in an effort to reach Syria.
One of eight children, Mr. Yazdani, who is now 30, grew up in a cramped apartment in the slum of Aman Nagar B, in a narrow alley that smells of sewage in Hyderabad's Old City. He beat the odds, earning an engineering degree and landing a job as a quality inspector in Saudi Arabia for nearly four years, before returning to India.

While abroad, he began watching the Islamic State's online propaganda, and soon he became consumed by a desire to leave it all for the caliphate.
“Since then, I was inclined to join Islamic State and work for the cause of religion,” Mr. Yazdani told investigators from India's National Investigation Agency, according to his interrogation record, which was obtained by The Times and was first reported by NDTV, a New Delhi-based television company.
He logged into Twitter and searched the hashtags #ISIS and #Khilafa, the terrorist group's preferred spelling of caliphate. In a few keystrokes, he made contact with Amriki.
“I created a Telegram ID,” Mr. Yazdani told investigators, “and sought his guidance to reach Syria.”
After months of frustrating and failed attempts to help Mr. Yazdani get a visa, Amriki's directions changed course: “He asked me to work for I.S. by staying in India itself.”

It was a period in which the Islamic State was refining the way it exports terror, increasingly relying on cyberplanners with local knowledge . Just before his death, Amriki handed off Mr. Yazdani to a different handler, known only by his Telegram screen name, “WindsofVictory.” His identity has not yet been confirmed by Indian officials, though they believe he is Indian because he spoke fluent Hindi.
The new handler guided the eight-member cell as it took shape, exchanging messages with Mr. Yazdani as the engineer recruited his family members and friends. They named themselves “Jund-ul-Khilafa-Fi-Bilad-Hind,” the Army of the Caliphate in India, according to the interrogation records, which misspelled part of the Arabic name.
At the end of May, Mr. Yazdani received a message telling him to go to the Nanded Airport, about 200 miles away. He and an accomplice, Habeeb Mohammed, 31, drove all night. After they reached the airport the next morning, the handler told them to head to the Railway Division Office. Near that office, he said, they would see a plastic bag hanging from a tree, according to the transcripts of the men's interrogations.
“It was informed by the handler that opposite to DRM office, there are two trees and on one of the trees there would be a white color polythene sheet (used for wrapping fragile articles),” Mr. Mohammed told investigators. “We spotted the place, and I, first on the pretext of urinating, went to check for the consignment.”

When they opened the bag, they found two pistols and 20 bullets, according to their account to law enforcement. It was one of at least four drops that the handler set up for them.
Because the pistols were rusted, they say the handler instructed them to travel to the railway station in the city of Ajmer, about 600 miles to the north. This time they were told to bring 65,000 rupees — around $1,000 — and leave it near the railway track sealed in a plastic bag, which would be picked up and used as payment for weapons.
Because the communication always had to go through the handler, the members of the Hyderabad cell never directly interacted with the arms seller. When they were arrested, they could not provide any clues as to who had left the contraband, Indian investigators said.
The Hindi-speaking handler guiding the men in Hyderabad also insisted on using a kaleidoscope of encrypted messaging applications, with Mr. Yazdani instructed to hop between apps so that even if one message history was discovered and cracked, it would reveal only a portion of their handiwork.
As soon as Mr. Yazdani indicated he was willing to undertake an attack, the handler instructed him to download ChatSecure, a messaging app to be used when they spoke by phone. When he used his laptop, he was told to contact the handler via Pidgin, another encrypted tool. He was told to create an account with Tutanota, a secure email service. And the handler taught Mr. Yazdani how to use the Tails operating system, which is contained on a USB stick and allows a user to boot up a computer from the external device and use it without leaving a trace on the hard drive.
Once that system was in place, the handler told Mr. Yazdani to prepare a handwritten oath of allegiance, known as a “bayah,” to the Islamic State's leader.
It was signed by the members of the cell using their noms de guerre, and then Mr. Yazdani was told to scan it to his laptop, using Tails to obscure the operation. Next, he was told to upload the image to www.gulf-up.com , which allows users to upload files and produces a URL that can be shared with a third party. The link to the URL was to be sent via the secure email.
By methodically working through URLs archived on the website, The Times was able to find the image of the one-page handwritten document containing the Indian men's pledge of allegiance to the Islamic State. The file was uploaded around the time that Mr. Yazdani told investigators he had done so, and the document matched his description of the wording he had disclosed to the authorities. Until they were alerted to its existence, Indian investigators were not aware that the document was still archived on the website, they said.

The men's families have denied that they played any role in a terrorist plot, and accuse the authorities of planting evidence against them.
One Indian investigator, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief reporters, said officials were able to crack the full extent of the case only because Mr. Yazdani and his accomplices confessed during interrogation, divulging the passwords to their accounts after their arrests last summer.

7:04 P.M. U.S.-led forces conduct 21 airstrikes near Kobani
American-led forces conducted 21 airstrikes focused on halting Islamic State advances at Kobani, Syria, in the last two days, the U.S. military said on Tuesday, warning the situation on the ground is fluid as militants try to gain territory.
The strikes Monday and Tuesday, which also included Saudi Arabian fighter planes, destroyed two militant staging areas, destroyed or damaged three Islamic State buildings and damaged three other compounds, U.S. Central Command said in a statement.
It was an unusually large number of airstrikes reported since U.S. military planes began daily attacks on Islamic State fighters who have taken over parts of the strategic town close to the Turkish border. Thousands of refugees have been forced to flee over the frontier.
The military said there are indications the airstrikes have slowed Islamic State advances in Kobani but cautioned the situation on the ground remains fluid as militants try to gain territory and Kurdish militia were "continuing to hold out."
The statement said one strike hit a modular oil refinery near Deir al-Zor, a city to the south of Kobani. A strike in Iraq, southwest of the northern oil center of Kirkuk, destroyed two Islamic State vehicles, it said. (Reuters)
6:30 P.M. 'Islamic State's oil revenues hit by coalition airstrikes'
The U.S.-led campaign of airstrikes against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has disrupted the organization's oil revenues, a report by the International Energy Agency said Tuesday.
From about 70,000 barrels per day of production this summer, mostly in Iraq, the area under control of the Sunni extremists had shrunk to about 20,000 barrels per day, the IEA estimated in its October oil market report.
The agency credited the international bombardments with "frustrating the jihadists' ability to operate oil fields and refineries and disrupting a smuggling operation that had raked in daily revenue estimated at between one million and three million dollars."
A crackdown on oil smuggling by Kurdish authorities in northern Iraq and the government of neighbouring Turkey was "further constricting the militants' revenues," the report said. (DPA)
2:25 P.M. Airstrikes hit Islamic State targets in Syria
Activists say the U.S.-led coalition has launched several airstrikes on positions of Islamic State militants in northern and eastern Syria, most on the town of Kobani.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and the Local Coordination Committees say some of the airstrikes targeted the eastern town of Mayadeen.
The Observatory said the airstrikes struck oil refineries near Mayadeen, sparking a huge fire. The group and Idriss Nassan, a local Kurdish official from Kobani, said Tuesday that intense airstrikes hit members of the Islamic State group around the town. Nassan said Kurdish militiamen captured the Tel Shair hill that overlooks the town and brought down the black flag of the Islamic State group. (Ap)
1:10 P.M. Yemen rebels take port city, province near Sanaa
Yemeni security and military officials say Shiite rebels who recently overran the capital have now seized a key port city on the Red Sea and a province south of Sanaa in a stunning new blitz. The development indicates the Shiite Houthis may be determined to carve out a mini-state within Yemen, taking advantage of the weakness of the central government and the disarray in the army and security forces.
Yemeni officials say the rebels on Tuesday overran the Red Sea port city of Hodeida, west of Sanaa. South of the capital, they took Damar province and its provincial capital. The officials say soldiers and police vanished from the Damar city streets. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media. (Reuters)
10:56 A.M. UK anti-terrorism police arrest six in Syria-linked op.
British police arrested three men and three women on Tuesday in a counter-terrorism operation linked to the civil war in Syria. Counterterrorism officers detained the suspects in London, Portsmouth, on England's south coast, and in Farnborough, west of the British capital. The group, aged between 23 and 57, were being held on suspicion of range of terrorism offences.
"Officers would like to reassure residents that the police activity today is in relation to conflicts overseas and is not linked to any immediate threat to local communities or anywhere else in the UK," the South East Counterterrorism Unit said in a statement.
Britain raised its international threat level to the second-highest classification of "severe" in August, meaning an attack was considered highly likely. British Prime Minister David Cameron has said Islamic State militants battling for territory in Syria and Iraq pose a grave security risk to Britain.
On Monday, London police arrested three men as part of what they said was an ongoing investigation into "Islamist terrorism". The men, aged 24, 21 and 25, were arrested in central London on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. (Reuters)
9:59 A.M. Turkish planes hit Kurdish targets in southeast Turkey
Turkish warplanes attacked Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) targets in southeast Turkey on Sunday in the first significant air operation against the militants since the launch of a peace process two years ago, Hurriyet news website said on Tuesday.
The air strikes caused "major damage" to the PKK, Hurriyet said. They were launched after three days of PKK shelling on a military outpost in Hakkari province near the Iraqi border, it added.
There was no immediate comment from the military on the report. (Reuters)
9:50 A.M. Obama to meet anti-Islamic State coalition partners
President Barack Obama and his military commanders will meet Tuesday with defense chiefs from more than 20 nations participating in the fight against the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq.
The daylong meeting comes as the White House tries to tout progress in the U.S.-led campaign against the militants, while also girding the public for a military effort that could extend well beyond Obama's presidency. Administration officials said the meeting would focus on military strategy and ways to bolster the campaign to counter the extremists.
Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said the meeting would be an important effort to further coordinate and organize the international fight against the Islamic State militants.
"They will be working through those specific areas and defining specific contributions that these nations will make," Hagel told reporters at the end of Monday's meeting with defense ministers of the Americas in Arequipa, Peru. (AP) Read the full article
9:46 A.M. Iran warns Saudi Arabia over accusations of Mideast meddling
Iran's state news agency is reporting that the Islamic Republic's Foreign Ministry has warned Saudi Arabia that comments calling it "part of the problem" in the Middle East may damage diplomatic ties.
The report Tuesday by IRNA quotes Deputy Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian saying: "The remark by Saud al-Faisal, if it is carried precisely, is in contradiction with diplomatic negotiators between the two countries."
Al-Faisal, Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, accused Tehran on Monday of having forces inside Syria, Iraq and Yemen, and insisted that Iran is "part of the problem" in trying to defuse a myriad of Mideast crises. (AP)

6:32 A.M. Turkey: No permission given to U.S. to use air base against IS
NATO allies Turkey and the United States differed Monday on where they stand on the use of a key air base, with Turkish officials denying reports from the United States that there was a new agreement on its use for operations against Islamic State militants.
The impasse suggests that major differences remain between the two sides. Turkey has said it won't join the fight against the extremists unless the U.S.-led coalition also goes after the Syrian government of President Bashar Assad, including establishing a no-fly zone and a buffer zone along the Turkish border.
The United States has been pressing Turkey to play a larger role against the Islamic militants, who have taken control of large swaths of Syria and Iraq, including territory on Turkey's border, and sent several hundred thousand refugees fleeing into Turkey. (AP) Read the full article

4:00 A.M. Yemeni president appoints new ministers as part of peace deal
Yemen's president on Monday appointed a diplomat and former oil minister as prime minister after securing backing of Islamists as well as Shi'ite rebels who control the capital, a move welcomed by the UN Security Council which called for the new government to implement a roadmap to peace and democracy.
The appointment of Khaled Bahah, Yemen's ambassador to the United Nations, is part of a peace deal brokered by the United Nations after Shiite Houthi rebels swept through the capital Sanaa and took over army barracks, ministries and vital state institutions last month. Their takeover came amid increasing terrorist attacks carried out by Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, which the Security Council condemned.
Bahah will have 30 days to form a government in the restive Arabian Peninsula nation after rival political groups gave their backing to his selection by President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, state media reported. (AP)
2:00 A.M. Qatari Emir visits Saudi Arabia to discuss Syria
Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani arrived Monday in Saudi Arabia and met with King Abdallah bin Abdel Aziz, the Saudi Press Agency (SPA) said.
It was al-Thani's second visit to Saudi Arabia in the last three months.
An Arab diplomat based in Beirut told dpa the visit, which was described as "brotherly" by the official Qatari news agency, is aimed at discussing regional issues such as the conflict in Syria.
A source inside the opposition Syrian National Coalition (SNC) said the failure to elect a new prime minister for the opposition's interim government during their meetings over the last three days in Turkey prompted these Saudi-Qatari talks. (DPA)
10:40 P.M. Saudi FM lashes out at Iran over "occupying forces" in Syria, Iraq and Yemen
Saudi Arabia's foreign minister on Monday lashed out at regional rival Iran, accusing it of having forces inside Syria, Iraq and Yemen, and insisting that Iran is "part of the problem" in trying to defuse the myriad Mideast crises.
Saud al-Faisal said that Tehran should pull its troops — which he called "occupying forces" — from the three Mideast nations stricken by conflicts and violence if it wants to be part of the solution. He did not elaborate on his allegations. (AP)
Over the weekend, Colorado was blessed with a pair of new breweries and we're excited to share them with you. First up, Odyssey Beerwerks in Arvada, who hosted their Grand Opening on Saturday, May 25th.
We stopped by to meet with Co-owner Chris Hill and sip on Odyssey's lineup of brews.
First things first, let's talk about the beers. Hill currently has 6 beers on tap at the brewery.
1. Helios Hefeweizen – 4.7% ABV, refreshing, traditional German hefeweizen, with notes of banana, bubblegum and clove.
2. Brick Lane ESB – 4.2% ABV, malty, nutty and moderately bitter.
3. Ghost Rider Pale Ale – 5.1% ABV, 37 IBU's, crisp, clean, sessionable and hoppy American Pale Ale.
4. Psycho Penguin Vanilla Porter – 5.5% ABV, brewed with smoky Mexican vanilla beans; sweet and silky.
5. Caber Tosser Scotch Ale – 8.9% ABV, thick, sweet and malty Wee Heavy that hides its high ABV well.
6. Nebula Belgian Black Double IPA – 8.2% ABV, 72 IBU's, brewed with six sweet malts and 4 varieties of hops; hoppy, yet balanced with a distinguishable Belgian yeast flavor.
Odyssey Beerwerks is the third brewery to open in Arvada, preceded by Yak & Yeti and Arvada Beer Company. Hill said last weekend's Grand Opening was a huge success, with a line pouring out the door and more than 800 craft fans turning out to celebrate the new brewery.
Odyssey Co-owners Chris Hill and Josh Van Riper have been homebrewing together for more than two decades and during that time, they've managed to fine tune and perfect some pretty tasty recipes. When they were ready to go the commercial route, the duo decided to go large right out of the gate, with a brand new 15 BBL brewhouse. They're hoping to avoid outgrowing their brew system in the near future, which is an all too common problem facing new breweries these days.
Hill says Odyssey will begin canning their beers this summer, with a target date of July 4th for the initial launch. They'll be using a two-head canning system from Cask out of Canada. The setup, which is similar to the one being used at Denver's Wynkoop Brewery, will help get Odyssey brews out into the Colorado market, so keep your eyes peeled.
In the near future, Odyssey plans to release an IPA, a flavorful Caribbean Lager (for those beer geeks seeking something light or looking to convert their macro drinking friends) and an Imperial Stout. Keep up to date with all the Odyssey news by following their Facebook page. Visitors to the brewery can also look forward to upcoming trivia nights, live music and other events.
Stop by Arvada's newest brewery and check out what's on tap. You can enjoy the spacious tasting room or take in the beautiful Colorado weather outside on the patio. Either way, make sure to say “Hi” to Chris and his sweet brew dog while you're there.
Odyssey Beerwerks is located at: 5535 W 56th Ave, Suite 107, Arvada, CO 80002. *Don't use Google Maps for directions.
Cheers!
Considering the 2014 NFL Draft just ended and it's still the middle of May, we've got a lot of time left until the Detroit Lions have to trim down their roster to 53 players. There are OTAs and a mandatory minicamp coming up, and the Lions obviously still have training camp and the preseason before having to get down to 53 players. A lot could happen over the next few months, and right now we just don't have a ton of information about how the new coaching staff wants to assemble its first 53-man Lions roster.
With that disclaimer out of the way, I actually went ahead and made my first 53-man roster prediction of the year for the Lions. It's more of a complete guess than informed speculation at this point in the offseason, but if nothing else, the exercise helped highlight what camp battles might be the most intriguing for the Lions this summer. Check it out (my picks to make the team are in bold and underlined):

On offense, I started off by giving the Lions only two quarterbacks. In Indianapolis, Jim Caldwell only kept two quarterbacks until Peyton Manning suffered a neck injury, and I think the Lions would be better off going with Matthew Stafford and Dan Orlovsky and putting James Franklin on the practice squad. This would open up an extra spot to use on the defensive side of the ball, perhaps in the secondary.
Moving down the roster, Montell Owens was the odd man out at running back despite his special teams skills, and I gave Kevin Ogletree the edge over all of the other wide receivers. I could see TJ Jones making the roster if Ryan Broyles opens the season on the PUP list, and I actually gave some thought to putting Michael Williams on the 53-man roster and going with four wide receivers and four tight ends. However, I think Ogletree has the best chance of contributing as extra depth in the passing game right now.
For the offensive line, everything actually already seems pretty set. At offensive tackle, Cornelius Lucas appears to be the favorite to take that fourth spot based on the signing bonus he received, and the interior spots are all pretty obvious at this point. Rob Sims, Larry Warford and Dominic Raiola are the starters, and Rodney Austin and Travis Swanson are set to be the backups.
Shifting to defense, there were a lot more tough decisions simply because there are so many similar players. At linebacker, for example, you could make a case for Cory Greenwood, Travis Lewis and Julian Stanford to make the team for special teams purposes. I ultimately gave Greenwood the edge there, and I gave Caraun Reid the edge at defensive tackle over the other five guys, who all seem capable of making a strong case to be on the team. And at defensive end, I kept both Darryl Tapp and Larry Webster since Tapp could potentially get some work at outside linebacker as well. There is seemingly room for both players on this defense.
Moving to the secondary, cornerback was probably the toughest position to figure out. Assuming everybody is healthy, a top three of Chris Houston, Darius Slay and Rashean Mathis seems like a logical starting point, but it's anybody's guess after that. After going back and forth on the final three spots, I finally decided on Chris Greenwood, Nevin Lawson and Jonte Green. I think Greenwood has the potential to make a real impact in Teryl Austin's defense, and I made the tough call to have Lawson beat out Bill Bentley at nickelback. As for Green, based on his potential as an outside cornerback, I gave him the edge over Bentley and the others at the position.
As tough as cornerback was to predict, safety fell into place pretty easily. Glover Quin and James Ihedigbo are the starters, and Martin Mayhew has already said that he is comfortable with Don Carey, DeJon Gomes and Isa Abdul-Quddus serving as the backups and contributing on special teams. A guy like Jerome Couplin could change the dynamic at this position in training camp, but the top five seems pretty clear at this point.
Finally, there's not exactly much to predict on special teams. Punter Sam Martin and long snapper Don Muhlbach are the only players at their respective positions, and the Lions didn't spend a draft pick on kicker Nate Freese for him to not make the team. It's always possible that Giorgio Tavecchio could outperform him in training camp, but I'm going with the draft pick to win the kicker job.
What are your absurdly early predictions for the Lions' 53-man roster?
The mother told the court her son was "exaggerating" A man is suing his mother over her alleged failure to protect him from his father's beatings. The 32-year-old County Durham man, who cannot be identified, told the High Court in London that his mother, now in her late 60s, assaulted him herself. He claimed that she aided and abetted daily punishment by her husband by reporting her son's wrongdoings. His mother denied liability and has claimed the case was brought outside the legal time limit. The man, who was brought up in west London, claimed he was assaulted up to four times a day between the ages of five and 19 by the father he called a "tormentor". He said he was hit with a stick, belt, electrical lead or wooden brush until he was 16 and struck with an open hand and throttled or choked as he got older. 'Reasonable chastisement' His mother said her son was "exaggerating". She did agree that she slapped him occasionally but said it was "reasonable chastisement" and denied hitting him with a clothes brush. The son said in court: "I saw that she did not like me and it led me to think that her primary concern in seeking help was to make her home life run more smoothly and not the welfare of myself or my siblings. "I wouldn't say my mother had done her best to protect me. I always felt she could have done more. "She wasn't a tormentor like my father was, continually looking for excuses to assault me. "For the best part of it she was herself fairly harmless." The man is seeking damages for pain and suffering as well as £7,800 to pay for therapy. He claimed he first consulted a solicitor 10 years ago but did not take action as he found ordinary life a struggle.

Having fallen out with its friends for a while due to the ongoing problems with its neighbors, the Turkish nation has finally found happiness with the latest developments. Through our considerable efforts, requests and encouragements, the Israel-Turkey and Turkey-Russia relations that we have long wished to be restored finally have been. In the same vein, the statement, “We will take new reconciliatory steps in our relations with Egypt and Syria, as well,” made by Prime Minister Binali Yildirim last week, was very promising. It was the sign of an anticipated and long-awaited period.
What about our Armenian brothers and sisters? In the wake of all this progress, will there not be an attempt to build bridges with the Armenians that are our friends and citizens? There will surely be. Unity is the destiny that certainly awaits these two peoples.

James Kelly James is the lead expert architect on cloud and software-defined networking in the marketing department of Juniper Networks. Previously, he had founded a capital management firm in Ottawa, Canada, and also serves as a private yoga instructor.
Network automation does not an automated network make. Today's network engineers are frequently guilty of two indulgences. First, random acts of automation hacking. Second, pursuing aspirational visions of networking grandeur — complete with their literary adornments like “self-driving” and “intent-driven” — without a plan or a healthy automation practice to take them there.
Can a Middle Way be found, enabling engineers to set achievable goals, while attaining the broader vision of automated networks as code? Taking some inspiration from our software engineering brethren doing DevOps, I believe so.
How Not to Automate
There's a phrase going around in our business: “To err is human; to propagate errors massively at scale is automation.”
Automation is a great way for any organization to speed up bad practices and #fail bigger. Unfortunately, when your business is network ops, the desire to be a cool “Ops” kid with some “Dev” chops — as opposed to just a CLI jockey — will quickly lead you down the automation road. That road might not lead you to those aspirational goals, although it certainly could expand your blast radius for failures.
Before we further contemplate self-driving, intent-driven networking, and every other phrase that's all the rage today (although I'm just as guilty of such contemplation as anyone else at Juniper), we should take the time to define what we mean by “proper” in the phrase, “building an automated network properly.”
If you haven't guessed already, it's not about writing Python scripts. Programming is all well and good, but twenty minutes of design often really does save about two weeks of coding. To start hacking at a problem right away is probably the wrong approach. You need to step back from our goals, think about what gives them meaning, apply those goals to the broader picture, and plan accordingly.
To see what is possible with automation, we should look at successful patterns of automation outside of networking and the reasons behind them, so we may avoid the known bad habits and anti-patterns, and sidestep avoidable pitfalls. For well-tested patterns of automation, we needn't look any further than the wealth of knowledge and experience in the arena of DevOps.
It matters what we call things. For better or worse, a name focuses the mind. The overall IT strategy to improve the speed, resilience, quality and intelligence of our applications is not called automation or orchestration. While ITIL volumes make their steady march into museums, the new strategy to enable business speed and smarts is incontrovertible, and it's called DevOps.
Few network operators are knowledgeable of the ecosystem of DevOps tooling, and few consider applying those same tools to networking.
Initially that term may invoke a blank page or even a transformation conundrum. But you can learn what it means to practice successful DevOps culture, processes, design, tooling and coding. DevOps can define your approach to the network, and is why we ought not promote network automation (which could focus the mind on the wrong objectives) and instead talk about DevNetOps as the application of patterns of DevOps applied to networking.
Networks as Code
The idea of infrastructure-as-code (IaC) has been around for a while, but surprisingly has seldom been applied to networking. Juniper Networks (where I hang my hat) and other networking vendors like Apstra have made some efforts over the years to move folks in this direction, but there is still a lot of work to do. For example, Juniper has had virtual form factors of most series of hardware systems, projects like Junosphere for network modeling in the cloud (many of us now use Ravello), and impressive presentations on IaC and professional services consulting. Juniper's senior marketing director Mike Bushong (formerly with Plexxi) wrote about the network as code back in 2014.
IaC is generally well applied to cloud infrastructure, but it's way harder to apply to bare metal. For evidence of this, just look at Triple-O, Kubernetes on Kubernetes, or Kubernetes on OpenStack on Kubernetes! That bottom, metal layer is quite the predicament.
To me, this means in networking, we should be easily applying IaC to software defined networking (SDN). But can we apply it to our network devices and manage the physical network? I asked Siri, and she said it was a trick question. As an armchair architect myself, I don't have all the answers. But as I see it, here are some under-considered aspects for designing networks as code with DevNetOps:
1. Tooling
In tech, everyone loves shiny objects, so let's start there. Few network operators — even those who have learned some programming — are knowledgeable about the ecosystem of DevOps tooling, and few consider applying those same tools to networking. Learning Python and Ansible is just scratching the surface. There is a vast swath of DevOps tools for CI/CD, site reliability engineering (SRE), and at-scale cloud-native ops.
2. Chain the tool chain: a pipeline as code
When we approach the network as code, we need to consider network elements and their configurations as building blocks created in a code-development pipeline of dev/test/staging/production phases. Stringing together this pipeline shouldn't be a manual process; it should be mostly coded to be automatic.
As with software engineering, there are hardware and foundational software elements with network engineering, such as operating systems that the operator will not create themselves, but rather just configure and extend. These configurations and extensions, with their underlying dependencies, can be built together, versioned, tested, and delivered. Thinking about the network as an exercise in development, automation should start in the development infrastructure itself.
3. Immutable infrastructure
Virtualization and especially containers have made the concept of baking images very accessible, and immutable infrastructure popular. While there is still much work to do with network software disaggregation, containerization, and decoupling of services, there are many benefits of adopting immutable infrastructure that are equally applicable to networking. Today's network devices are poster children for config drift, but to call them “snowflakes” would be an insult to actual snowflakes.
Applying principles of immutable infrastructure, I imagine a network where each device PXE-boots into a minimal OS and runs signed micro-service building blocks. Each device has declarative configs, decoupled secret management and rotation, and logging and other monitoring data with good overall audit ability and traceability — all of which is geared to take the network off the box ASAP.
Interestingly, practices such as SSH'ing into boxes would be rendered impossible, and practices that “savvy” network automators do today like running Ansible playbooks against an inventory of devices would be banished.
4. Upgrades
Upgrades to network software and even firmware/microcode on devices could be managed automatically, by means of canary tests and rolling upgrade patterns. To do this on a per-box or per-port basis, or at finer levels of flows or traffic-processing components, we need to be able to orchestrate traffic balancing and draining.
If that sounds complex, we can make things simpler. We could treat devices and their traffic like cattle instead of pets, and rely on their resilience. Killing and resurrecting a component would restart it with a new version. While this is suitable for some software applications, treating traffic as disposable is not yet desirable for all network applications and SLAs. Still, it would go a long way toward properly designing for resilience.
5. Resilience
One implication of all this is the presence of redundancy in the network paths. As with any networking component, that's very important for resilience. Drawing inspiration from scale-out architectures in DevOps and the microservices application model, redundancy and scale would go hand-in-hand by means of instance replication. So redundancy would neither be 1:1 nor active-passive. We should always be skeptical of architectures that include those anti-patterns.
Good design would tolerate a veritable networking chaos monkey. Burning down network software would circuit-break to limit failures. Killing links and even boxes, we would quickly re-converge as we often do today, but dead boxes, dead SDN functions or dead virtual network functions would act like phoenix servers, rising back up or staying down in case of repeated failures or detected hardware failures.
The pattern for preventing black-swan event failures is to practice forcing these failures, and thus practice automating around them, so that the connectivity or other network service and its performance is tolerant and acceptably resilient on its own SLA measuring stick, whatever the meta-service in question may be.
Doing DevNetOps
In each one of these above topics lies much more complexity than I will dive head-first into here. By introducing them here, my aim has been to demonstrate there are interesting patterns we may draw from, and some operators are doing so already. If you've ever heard the old Zen Buddhist koan of the sound of one hand clapping, that's the sound you're likely to hear from your own forehead, once the obviousness of applying DevOps to DevNetOps hits you squarely in the face.
Just as the hardest part of adopting DevOps is often cited to be breaking off one manageable goal at a time and focusing on that, I think we'll find the same is true of DevNetOps. Before we even get there in networking, I think we need to scope the transformation properly of applying DevNetOps to the challenges of networking, especially with issues of basic physical connectivity and transport.
While “network automation” leads the mind to jump to things like applying configuration management tooling and programming today's manual tasks, DevNetOps should remind us that there is a larger scope than mere automation coding. That scope includes culture, processes, design and tools. Collectively, they may all lead us to a happier place.

After suffering defeat this spring, the controversial legislation aimed at preventing cyberthreats, CISPA, may be returning to the Senate. According to Mother Jones, two senators are now working on a new version of the bill that looks to curb some of the concerns that kept it from initially passing. The goal of the bill will still be to make it easier for private companies to share information with the government regarding cyber threats, however the type of information that can be shared will reportedly be narrower in scope this time around.
The bill won't target American's communications
As the legislation is still being written, it's not clear exactly how different its updated form will be. Mother Jones reports that Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) are working together to draft the bill. "The goal is to allow and encourage the sharing only of information related to identifying and protecting against cyberthreats, and not the communications and commerce of Americans," Feinstein's office tells Mother Jones in a statement. Feinstein in particular has been a major proponent for facilitating this type of sharing, having also been in support of expanding FISA.
In light of the NSA leaks, Mother Jones suggests that so many companies may have initially stood in support of CISPA — the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act — because it could have granted them protections for handing over information as part of PRISM. But those leaks should only make a reintroduction of CISPA, however limited, all the more disconcerting for privacy advocates. The bill was even called for earlier this month by NSA director General Keith Alexander, who said that legislation must be put in place before the US was hit with a cyberattack. But it's only become more evident since CISPA was defeated how widely the NSA is able to access American citizens' information as it is, and a new bill would only expand those abilities.
ROME (Reuters) - Italy's electoral law is unconstitutional, its top court ruled on Wednesday, piling pressure on political parties to reform a system blamed for creating parliamentary deadlock.

Most politicians agree, at least in public, that the electoral rules which helped produce a hung parliament after February's national vote must change to give Italy a chance of forming a stable government.
But despite repeated exhortations from business leaders, union chiefs and President Giorgio Napolitano, progress on voting reform has long been blocked by parties worried that a new system could damage their electoral chances.
“Now there is no more room for excuses from anyone, we have to move, quickly, to change the law,” said Interior Minister Angelino Alfano, whose breakaway group from Silvio Berlusconi's center-right is a key part of the fragile ruling coalition.
The ruling is not retro-active and therefore does not affect the status or validity of the current parliament, a source close to the constitutional court told Reuters.
It may actually reduce the danger of an imminent collapse of Prime Minister's Enrico Letta's coalition because it would be difficult to contemplate dissolving parliament before the voting law has been overhauled.
The constitutional court picked out the “winner's bonus” system where the coalition with the biggest number of votes automatically gets 55 per cent of the seats in the lower house, irrespective of its actual share of the vote.
That can give a political grouping without an overall majority total control of the lower house, but none at all of the upper house, the Senate, which is voted in through a different system.
The resulting wrangling for power can be particularly fierce in a country split into hostile but roughly equal blocs of center-right and center-left with the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement just behind.
The right-left coalition that finally emerged from the February vote is made up of political rivals who remain divided on policy and have struggled to force through reforms that analysts say Italy needs to face up to its financial woes.
The court also ruled against the way voters could only vote for party lists of candidates, robbing them of a chance to select an individual representative in parliament.
FRENCH-STYLE RUNOFF, RETURN TO PREVIOUS LAW?
The practical consequences of the court's decision remain unclear until it publishes its reasoning and the “judicial effects”, which it said it would do in the next few weeks.
In the meantime it invited parties to take their own steps.
“Parliament is free to approve new electoral legislation, based on a political choice, as long as it respects the constitution,” the court said in a short statement.
A number of possible alternatives have been mooted, including a French-style run-off system with two rounds of voting, or a return to the system in force until 2005.
“I think the most likely thing is that we will go back to the previous law,” said Gianfranco Pasquino, political science professor at Bologna University.
That law involved a hybrid system where 75 percent of lower-house seats were allocated by a British-style first-past-the-post system, and the remainder by proportional representation.
Related Coverage Italy vote ruling does not affect current parliament-source
However, Pasquino said he believed this would happen by “default”, as a result of the court's ruling not due to a political agreement.
“No-one is parliament has the political strength to broker a deal,” he said.
The current electoral law was derided even by the conservative minister responsible for its creation and the left have long said it was created to keep them out of power.
Media playback is not supported on this device Real Madrid target Champions League history - Modric
If you were to survey followers of Spanish football on their player of the season so far, there is a good chance they would vote overwhelmingly in favour of one name.
Not Ronaldo, Messi, Bale or Neymar but Luka Modric.
Pose the same question 12 months previously and Modric would not even be in with a whisper.
Modric on Bale "Gareth is a a great player. He has everything necessary to be one of the best players in the world. It's all on him if he will reach that level. Today, Ronaldo is the best player. It's really difficult to reach his level, but Gareth has all the qualities. He is strong, powerful, quick and he has improved his shooting a lot."
Recruited by Real Madrid from Tottenham Hotspur for £33m in August 2012, the Croatia midfielder was in danger of being harshly written off as a high-profile, big-money flop.
Appearances were irregular under Jose Mourinho and some Real fans wanted him sold, with readers of the newspaper Marca voting Modric the worst signing of the year.
Fast forward to the present day and he is indispensable to Carlo Ancelotti, the hard-to-please Bernabeu crowd are chanting his name - they want Modric to wear the prestigious number 10 shirt instead of 19 - and the queue of suitors is growing. They could be waiting a long time.
Many, including former Real sporting director Predrag Mijatovic, believe the 28-year-old is now on a par with Cristiano Ronaldo as the club's most important player.
"I never considered leaving Real Madrid or that it was a mistake to come here," Modric, with a look of unbreakable self-belief, tells BBC Sport. "It was my dream come true when I signed for Real Madrid. I want to stay here for as many years as possible and, if it's possible, finish my career here.
"I really enjoy my life in Spain. Madrid is a big and beautiful city with great parks where I like to walk. There are a lot of squares and museums, historic monuments. But I'm a more home guy, I feel most comfortable there with my wife and kids. We play, watch cartoons, like all families do."
Modric has never been one to court publicity - "I don't like to speak much, I rather speak on the field; apart from Real Madrid TV this is my first big interview" - but when we meet at the club's Valdebebas training complex he could hardly be more relaxed and welcoming.
Modric on La Liga title race "It's good for the championship that more teams are involved for the title. Atletico Madrid are having a great season. Everyone is expecting them to fall down but they keep going. There are still a lot of games until the end and we have to continue playing like we're playing at the moment. It will be interesting. I think this March will be crucial for La Liga. It's always nice to have more teams fighting for titles."
His ripped jeans, shaggy hair and cheeky smile reflect a laid-back, unpretentious, likeable character who is quiet yet bubbly, private yet warm; a gentle Galactico with a kind, conscientious, intelligent personality that endears him to family, friends and the public alike.
But underneath lies an unmistakeable sense of grit and determination, a fierce desire to confound and triumph, all of which stems from a life of hurdles and challenges.
Modric was aged just six when his family were forced to flee their home in war-torn Croatia in 1991, moving into an army-owned hotel in the coastal city of Zadar. His father joined the military and his grandfather was killed. Money and food were in short supply.
With grenades falling on the local football pitches, Modric honed his skills in the hotel parking lot and there began his journey to the top, starting at NK Zadar and moving on to Dinamo Zagreb via loan spells with Zrinjski Mostar in Bosnia and Inter Zapresic back in Croatia.
His progress at Dinamo preceded a £16.5m transfer to Tottenham in 2008, although injuries and questions about his physical stature had to be overcome before he really began to shine.
"I have great memories of Tottenham," he says. "I spent four great years there with a lot of emotions, with a lot of love from the club and the fans. I enjoyed every moment with Tottenham. But in one moment you feel you need to take a step forward, to go to a higher level.
"I think it was the right time for me to go, but I will always be thankful to Tottenham for everything they did for me. I became a better player there and they pushed me to this level where I am at the moment. I will always be a fan, I follow them a lot when I can."
"I knew sooner or later I would show my quality and show to everyone why I'm here," says Luka Modric of his difficult start to life at the Bernabeu
Modric politely asks if we can avoid discussing memories of his youth, but the emotion is still evident when he explains what it means to represent Real Madrid.
"I think 'unique' is the best word to describe your feelings to play for such a special club," he says. "From the first moment I arrived here - my presentation walking into the trophy hall at the Bernabeu and seeing trophies and pictures of the legends of Real Madrid, it showed me where I've come.
"I feel so proud of where I've come. All I dreamed of when I became a footballer was to play for a club as big as Real Madrid. It's maybe the most famous and best club in the history of football."
Not a bad move, then, for a 5ft 9ins midfielder who it was claimed during his time in the Premier League might be too "lightweight" to become one of the very best.
"People like to judge and make their own conclusions," Modric says. "I never cared what other people were saying about me - I had my aims, I believed in myself and never stopped. I've been through many difficulties in my life, but all these things made me a stronger and better person.
"All these critics push you forward to show people they are wrong. Maybe I look lightweight but I am a really strong person mentally and physically, and I never had any problems with my size."
This is a point illustrated by the fact Modric has made more tackles (56) than any other Real Madrid player in La Liga this season and his average number of tackles per league game (2.86) is currently higher than he recorded at the end of any campaign since leaving Dinamo.
And it is not only his tackling that has improved; since Ancelotti succeeded Mourinho as head coach last summer, Modric has developed a formidable central midfield partnership with Xabi Alonso and Angel di Maria, statistically improving virtually every facet of his game in the process.
Most notable is his passing, with the 878 Modric has completed in the opposition half of the pitch in La Liga easily the highest of any Real player (Di Maria is next with 650).
Luka Modric Born: 9 September 1985, Zadar
9 September 1985, Zadar Dinamo Zagreb: 2003-2008 (114 appearances, 31 goals)
2003-2008 (114 appearances, 31 goals) Zrinjsku (loan): 2003-2004 (22 appearances, eight goals)
2003-2004 (22 appearances, eight goals) Inter Zapresic (loan): 2004-2005 (18 appearances, four goals)
2004-2005 (18 appearances, four goals) Tottenham: 2008-2012 (161 appearances, 17 goals)
2008-2012 (161 appearances, 17 goals) Real Madrid: 2012-present day (74 appearances, 6 goals)
2012-present day (74 appearances, 6 goals) Croatia caps: (72 appearances, 8 goals)
His passing accuracy in the league (90%) is the highest it has been since leaving Dinamo and the highest of any midfielder in Europe's top five leagues who have five or more assists this season. Modric's six assists already equals his highest for a league campaign since leaving Dinamo.
"I had some difficulties at the beginning," he admits. "I didn't have a complete pre-season - I trained on my own in London, I came later here and you need time for everything to get settled.
"That [Marca survey] didn't affect me at all. I knew sooner or later I would show my quality and show to everyone why I'm here, why Real made such an effort to bring me here.
"I had a lot of support from the ex-coach [Mourinho] - he did everything to bring me here and I'm grateful for that. At the beginning he was very helpful to ease my adaptation. By the time I was fit enough I started playing better and better. His tactics were never a problem for me."
If one moment of Modric's Real Madrid career to date resonates above all others, it must be his display after coming off the bench at Manchester United in the Champions League last 16.
"When I came on I changed the game, I scored that goal and after we scored another to win 2-1," he recalls. "That was the turning point for me and my career at Real Madrid. From that game, people started seeing why I'm here and my career at Real Madrid was all the time going up.
La Liga or Premier League? "I think both leagues are great. For me, maybe Spain is more technical and the Premier League is more fast and furious. From the beginning to the end of the game, the rhythm is really high, it's up and down and very quick and aggressive football. "In La Liga it's more technical, but I heard a lot of stories that you have a lot of space, you can play easily - but it's not the case. There is not much space, especially when you are playing away from home and you have to be also strong not only technically but physically to play good in La Liga. It's not an easy league. But for me they are both quality, I can't say one or the other is better."
"I have big trust and big confidence from the coach [Ancelotti]. From the beginning he was clear with what he wanted from me and how important I am for the team. That helped me a lot and I could show my quality on the pitch.
"Last season I played some good games but our results were not following and that's why maybe people didn't appreciate my performance. This season, I am at the peak of my game and we have good results. We are fighting for all three trophies and I feel really, really good."
Real are level on points with Barcelona and Atletico Madrid at the top of La Liga, will face Barcelona in the Copa del Rey final after becoming the first team in history to get there without conceding a goal, and face Schalke in the Champions League last 16.
Modric feels his team have the quality to win all three trophies but makes special mention of the Champions League - Real are desperately chasing 'La Decima', a 10th European Cup - and he is also itching to end the wait for a first major trophy of his career.
Not that the hard work would stop there.
"I'm living a very special time at the moment but this will only push me to give more, to not relax," he says. "Because this is the club where you can't relax. What was yesterday does not work for tomorrow, always you have to improve yourself because the crowd and the club are so demanding.
"I don't think any club is like here. They ask so much from you and that forces you to always be at the top of your game. The pressure is huge here. But I've never had a problem with pressure, I like pressure, pressure pushes me to be better."
Ron Gilbert has been making video games for over 30 years. His big break, Maniac Mansion—which the Oregon native wrote, designed and directed—was released in 1987 by Lucasfilm Games, and almost single-handedly took the graphic adventure genre from niche concern amongst an endless sea of shooters and platformers to something close to a gaming phenomenon, one point and click at a time.
After Maniac Mansion, Gilbert worked on The Secret of Monkey Island and its sequel; Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure; and Zak McKraken and the Alien Mindbenders, before leaving Lucasfilm Games—later renamed LucasArts—to pursue new challenges. While he came back to graphic adventures in 2009, providing valuable guidance to Telltale Games for its Tales of Monkey Island series, it's really with this year's Thimbleweed Park that Gilbert's reconnecting with the games that he first made, which in turn made him, reputation wise.
Which is to say: this is an adventure quite out of time with 2017's gaming landscape.
"The point of this project was very much to build a game that was evocative of how you remember the old adventure titles," Gilbert tells me, moments after I've seen a decent slice of Thimbleweed Park in meticulous, mystery-unpicking action, all "Pick up" this and "Look at" that. "We've used pixel art less than a retro thing, and more because we just love it. That aside, we've not really limited ourselves in what we could do, making this game. I have no list of dos and don'ts that we followed. We just went with what felt right."

Thimbleweed Park follows the fortunes of five very different characters, caught up in strange events unfolding in the small, rundown town that gives the game its name, and its surrounding county. There are a couple of FBI agents who don't get along, Ray and Reyes, who have to begrudgingly work with each other and the local law enforcement tuna-heads. There's a foul-mouthed clown by the name of Ransome who refuses to take off his makeup. And then there's a game developer by the name of Delores and her father, Franklin, who's a little less than alive these days.
"These days" being 1987, the year of Maniac Mansion's release—and that's just one of multiple references to Gilbert's past, and adventure gaming's history beyond his credits, spread throughout what is quite clearly a love letter to the genre.
Which isn't to say Thimbleweed Park's exclusively for those people, like me, who played their share of point-and-click adventures in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It looks archaic—deliberately, but quite beautifully so—but it's fully voice-acted, and mercifully arrives shorn of those most-infuriating puzzles that tripped up so many in the Monkey Island days.
"I want to expose all of the great things about point and click adventures to a new audience." — Ron Gilbert
If you were there, you'll know what I'm talking about: the seemingly arbitrary combining of Item A with This Thing B over That Place C, in the hope of causing Supporting Character D to slip onto his arse and bring about Game Progressing Event E. Did I lose you, in the middle of that? You, and thousands of other players, back when.
"I want to expose all of the great things about point and click adventures to a new audience," Gilbertsays. "I think younger players get caught up in a little bit of nostalgia when they hear about the Nintendo era, the point and click era, the mystique of these games. It's interesting to them, but when they go back and actually play those games, they realize how crude they were.
"So, Thimbleweed is about letting them relive and understand what those games were, but through a game that has all of the stupid stuff removed from it. It's challenging, but without the confusion. We give you all the pieces you need to solve any puzzle in this game, and nothing is too obtuse. We specifically removed all that. Everything is logical."
Play testing has helped—we've come a long way from the once-through quality assurance of the first Monkey Island. Thimbleweed Park, Gilbert explains, has been tested some 30 times, with the small team at Terrible Toybox—Gilbert plus Maniac Mansion co-designer Gary Winnick, alongside a handful of others—closely monitoring where people got stuck, where they became frustrated, and seeing what they could do to make the experience easier to understand, while still testing the grey matter.
"We got to see the player's gears turning in their heads," Gilbert says. "Back in the day, we wouldn't give you enough clues. This time, we've been able to refine the game so that it best respects the player, while not making anything too simple."
Thimbleweed Park does feature a puzzles-pulled-back "Casual" mode, but Gilbert and coder Jenn Sandercock explain that even newcomers to adventures like this should play on "Normal" first, to better understand how all of the components in cracking its murder case—which is ostensibly why the agents are in town, at least—connect. After that, a second playthrough on Casual will deliver the story without quite so much running about finding fingerprint paper, non-rechargeable batteries, a pair of hilariously large wax lips, that sort of thing.
"There are some things in the game that a larger publisher would have probably stood in the way of." — Ron Gilbert
And it's a funny story, too—I'd place its chuckles-per-hour count somewhere just above Jazzpunk, although you'll want to adjust that depending on your adventure game experience and likelihood of getting the more in-joke-y one-liners and items to pick up. (Such as… what's this? An empty can of tuna heads?)
"There's a real dearth of humor in games out there, today," Gilbert says. "I don't really know why that it. I mean, there are some funny games around. Most of those get their humor from slapstick, whereas a game like The Secret of Monkey Island had a more sophisticated humor about it. The laughs came from the dialogue, the interactions with other people. I think the last game that really made me laugh out loud was The Stanley Parable."
One quality that Thimbleweed Park and The Stanley Parable share, besides being capable of tickling a rib or two, is that they're both the products of very small, closely-knit teams. Sandercock talks about putting jokes into an area of the game without any interference from anyone else on the team: "Ron hadn't been there for a while, came into it and just said, 'Yep, that's Jenn.' To have that kind of freedom and individuality in a game, that's nurtured by having a small team, it really helps."
And while games full of attractive idiosyncrasies can and do emerge from big studios backed by bigger publishers, Gilbert is in no doubt that had Thimbleweed Park gone down that avenue of financing, rather than receive its green light through a successful Kickstarter campaign in late 2014, it'd have seen some of its more unique content removed.
"I don't want to spoil anything, but there are some things in the game that I know a larger publisher would have probably stood in the way of," he explains. "The game takes some weird detours, that are not a part of the main path, that perhaps a publisher would have shut down. The argument would be that it wouldn't be worth spending time and money on what was essentially just a joke at the end of the day.
"But a lot of publishers are good, don't get me wrong. A good publisher will be there to pull you back when you're about to derail. They're look over your shoulder and keep you honest. They'll question your decisions, and not in a bad way. They're making sure that everything has been properly thought through. I think that's where a lot of Kickstarters run into problems, because people don't have the experience to really self-censor, and self-regulate."
Not that Thimbleweed Park's crowdfunding campaign, even when it arrived with someone with Gilbert's reputation behind it, was a totally pleasant experience.
"The thing I didn't think about, ahead of launching the Kickstarter, is that people can remove their money." — Ron Gilbert
"It was white-knuckle terror for the full 30 days," Gilbert recalls, with a smile that's still partially formed from relief. "We funded the game on the fourth day, which was relatively quick. But the thing I didn't think about, ahead of launching the Kickstarter, is that people can remove their money. And I remember the first time I saw that. I was scrolling down the list of pledges and, boom, $25 subtracted. And we had a couple of $10,000 pledges, so I was thinking: what if that's some kid who's stolen his parents' credit card. So you're worried—what happens if people do start taking their money back?"
As it happened, they didn't. Thimbleweed Park made a total of $626,000 on Kickstarter. Which sounds a lot, but to Gilbert and team it didn't represent anything close to a "limitless" figure, with which he could relax and throw money at any problem that came along, with little concern for the bottom line.
"We have nearly unlimited memory, infinite storage, for games now," Gilbert says. "The original Maniac Mansion was 320k. It was two sides of a single-density floppy disc. And there was a lot of challenge in making that game, because we had a very limited amount of space. It was a constant struggle—we wanted two more rooms, but we couldn't have them. It got easier with Monkey Island, but we still had these very hard limits. Lucasfilm told me: 'You have five discs. That is the budget.'
"The thing that I don't have, today, is infinite money. Money, and time. So those become the limiting factors for Thimbleweed Park. We can have all of these different animations, but there comes a point where we have to have it all done, and we only have so much money to pay the animators, so we have to be careful that we don't run over on anything."
The game has run over—look on Kickstarter and you'll see that its release date was supposed to have been June 2016. As of right now, it's out "soon." Gilbert puts at least some of this delay down to his own slight mismanagement of the game's development.
"Even with 30 years of experience, I still got caught with stuff on this game," he explains. "The recording of the voices ran way late—I should have had that done four months before it was. If we'd had a publisher, they'd have been telling us to get into the studio and just get it done. It all worked out well in the end, but it was a scramble.
"I was late in getting a bunch of the writing into the game, and we couldn't record without that—but there was a lot keeping us busy, and I was just swamped. I started to cast the game, but was really unhappy with the quality of actor that we were getting, so I pushed that side of the game back, and back. And suddenly there's no time left, and this has to happen. Having a really good publisher probably would have solved that."
With over 15,000 backers to consider, not to mention the many thousands of expectant adventure game nostalgists and newcomers alike who didn't put their money down in advance, it's for the best that Thimbleweed Park didn't rush its way to completion, and that every detail was delivered to a standard expected of its much-experienced makers.
What I've played of the game thus far bears that out—it plays and looks like a classic adventure game of the early 1990s. It doesn't quite sound the same, and no doubt has a more self-referential wit to it, but if the objective was to produce a game that recalled the past without actually duplicating it verbatim, improving what didn't work so well before, it seems like a success.
Naturally, only playing the whole game will reveal exactly where Thimbleweed Park ranks amongst the adventure greats, if at all. But you'd have to be a real tuna-head to not want the best for it.

Concrete is the world's most-used construction material, and a leading contributor to global warming, producing as much as one-tenth of industry-generated greenhouse-gas emissions. Now a new study suggests a way in which those emissions could be reduced by more than half — and the result would be a stronger, more durable material.
The findings come from the most detailed molecular analysis yet of the complex structure of concrete, which is a mixture of sand, gravel, water, and cement. Cement is made by cooking calcium-rich material, usually limestone, with silica-rich material — typically clay — at temperatures of 1,500 degrees Celsius, yielding a hard mass called “clinker.” This is then ground up into a powder. The decarbonation of limestone, and the heating of cement, are responsible for most of the material's greenhouse-gas output.
The new analysis suggests that reducing the ratio of calcium to silicate would not only cut those emissions, but would actually produce better, stronger concrete. These findings are described in the journal Nature Communications by MIT senior research scientist Roland Pellenq; professors Krystyn Van Vliet, Franz-Josef Ulm, Sidney Yip, and Markus Buehler; and eight co-authors at MIT and at CNRS in Marseille, France.
“Cement is the most-used material on the planet,” Pellenq says, noting that its present usage is estimated to be three times that of steel. “There's no other solution to sheltering mankind in a durable way — turning liquid into stone in 10 hours, easily, at room temperature. That's the magic of cement.”
In conventional cements, Pellenq explains, the calcium-to-silica ratio ranges anywhere from about 1.2 to 2.2, with 1.7 accepted as the standard. But the resulting molecular structures have never been compared in detail. Pellenq and his colleagues built a database of all these chemical formulations, finding that the optimum mixture was not the one typically used today, but rather a ratio of about 1.5.
As the ratio varies, he says, the molecular structure of the hardened material progresses from a tightly ordered crystalline structure to a disordered glassy structure. They found the ratio of 1.5 parts calcium for every one part silica to be “a magical ratio,” Pellenq says, because at that point the material can achieve “two times the resistance of normal cement, in mechanical resistance to fracture, with some molecular-scale design.”
The findings, Pellenq adds, were “validated against a large body of experimental data.” Since emissions related to concrete production are estimated to represent 5 to 10 percent of industrial greenhouse-gas emissions, he says, “any reduction in calcium content in the cement mix will have an impact on the CO 2 .” In fact, he says, the reduction in carbon emissions could be as much as 60 percent.
In addition to the overall improvement in mechanical strength, Pellenq says, because the material would be more glassy and less crystalline, there would be “no residual stresses in the material, so it would be more fracture-resistant.”
The work is the culmination of five years of research by a collaborative team from MIT and CNRS, where Pellenq is research director. The two institutions have a joint laboratory at MIT called the Multi-Scale Materials Science for Energy and Environment, run by Pellenq and Ulm, who is director of MIT's Concrete Sustainability Hub, and hosted by the MIT Energy Initiative.
Because of its improved resistance to mechanical stress, Pellenq says the revised formulation could be of particular interest to the oil and gas industries, where cement around well casings is crucial to preventing leakage and blowouts. “More resistant cement certainly is something they would consider,” Pellenq says.
So far, the work has remained at the molecular level of analysis, he says. “Next, we have to make sure these nanoscale properties translate to the mesoscale” — that is, to the engineering scale of applications for infrastructure, housing, and other uses.
Zdeněk Bažant, a professor of civil and environmental engineering, mechanical engineering, and materials science and engineering at Northwestern University who was not involved in this research, says, “Roland Pellenq, with his group at MIT, is doing cutting-edge research, clarifying the nanostructure and properties of cement hydrates.”
The Concrete Sustainability Hub is supported by the Portland Cement Association and the Ready Mixed Concrete Research and Education Foundation.
A man caught growing hundreds of cannabis plants was experimenting with medical uses for marijuana, a Nelson court has heard.
Joshua Wilfred Harley, 38, admitted cultivating cannabis after police searched his Wairau Valley property in December last year and discovered more than 200 cannabis plants.
Police found 22 mature plants, but the majority were seedlings or sprouts, irrigated and growing under lights in what defence lawyer Mark Dollimore conceded was a "significant system".
Supplied GROWER: Josh Harley was convicted of cannabis cultivation and sentenced to community detention.
However, police found no evidence to suggest that Harley had been selling or supplying, Mr Dollimore said.
In the Nelson District Court, Crown prosecutor Mark O'Donoghue accepted there was no proof of commerciality, but said there was potential for some of the marijuana to find its way into the community.
"Lucky for [Harley] and the community, police have nipped this [offending] in the bud at an early stage," Mr O'Donoghue said, arguing for a restrictive sentence of community detention as well as community work.
Mr Dollimore told the court that Harley had been brewing "cannabis tea" which he made from crushing large amounts of cannabis plant matter and extracting the "juice".
Harley was genuinely interested in making medicines that might help people who were physically sick, mentally unwell, or even dying, but he had not fully considered the consequences of his experimenting, Mr Dollimore said.
Four years ago, Harley's partner Kelly passed away after battling cancer, leaving him to raise their two children, Mr Dollimore told the court.
He said Harley's mother also died of cancer around the same time.
Not long after they died, Harley decided to become a fulltime "herbalist medicine man" or "plant pharmacologist", Mr Dollimore said.
He had been studying the effects of cannabidiol - a chemical found in cannabis, which he believed contained compounds that killed or stemmed the growth of tumors.
Twenty individuals wrote letters to the court, supporting Harley and testifying to his good character and intentions, Mr Dollimore said.
Harley also penned his own letter to the judge, explaining the experiments.
"I realise that what I have done is wrong ... My intention was never to hurt anyone, nor was my intention to make any money from cultivating cannabis," Harley wrote.
"In the Bible, God allows us the use of all plants and herbs, then he commands us to heal with them. He also commands us to obey the laws of the land, and this is where I contradict myself."
He told Judge Zohrab in his letter that he was making medicine for himself, and for cancer patients whom he knew personally. He said he did not "get high" or own any "smoking utensils", as he believed that "smoking cannabis for medicinal purposes is an oxymoron".
Harley said "juice" from the marijuana plant contained wider health benefits, which helped ease the anxiety he had suffered from since losing his partner.
In court, Mr Dollimore said Harley's conviction was a "big learning curve".
"He knows he could go to jail quite easily for this. It has been a big wake-up call," Mr Dollimore said.
Harley had one previous conviction for selling a "tinny", but Judge Tony Zohrab accepted that that was many years ago, and had only involved a small amount.
Mr Dollimore said his client had been entirely co-operative with police.
Harley was convicted, and sentenced to six months' community detention and 300 hours of community work.
Judge Zohrab said he had trouble believing that there was no commercial aspect to Harley's grow operation, saying truth was often the first casualty in cases like this.
He told Harley that further offending of this type would likely attract a custodial sentence.
Outside court, Mr Dollimore said Harley was a "bloody good guy" and someone who was "ahead of his times", in terms of experimenting with alternative medicines.
"Eventually, guys like him, in many years to come, might be like naturopaths.
"Eventually, they will change the law," Mr Dollimore said.
He said Harley would strive to complete his community work sentence by volunteering at his children's school.
Harley's former partner Kelly Bannister died after a battle with cancer in September, 2009, aged 34, just 10 weeks after the birth of her second child.
While pregnant, she had declined conventional cancer treatment, to ensure her child was born without complication.
She was well known in Golden Bay for her community work and fundraising efforts for the Cancer Society. A memorial for Ms Bannister, in the form of a colourful bench covered in mosaic tiles, overlooks the sea at Tata Beach.
Barclays has downgraded its outlook on four of Canada's big banks, saying the country's slowing economy leaves little upside potential for the banks.
Analyst John Aiken of Barclays has downgraded stock to underweight for Bank of Montreal, Laurentian Bank, Royal Bank and TD Bank.
In a report released Friday, Aiken said the Bank of Canada's guidance indicates even lower economic growth for Canada than is currently reflected in the market.
"From our standpoint, the surprise reduction in the overnight rate by the Bank of Canada is a net negative for the banks," the report said.
Barclays predicts the lower consumer borrowing and the economic impact of lower oil prices will eat into bank earnings over the coming year.
It said there is a risk of recession in Alberta because of falling oil prices, which would ripple through the entire economy.
"Although lower gasoline prices should support consumption in other regions, it is not expected to be a full offset," the report said.
"And, while the decline in the Canadian dollar and increasing demand out of the U.S. should foster growth in manufacturing in Ontario and Quebec, the transition of economic growth from the West back to Central Canada will not likely be a smooth one, until there is a clear resurgence in the U.S. economy.”
Barclays said it is prepared to revise its downgrade depending on bank earnings in the first quarter.
Bank stocks were falling on the TSX today in response to the outlook for Canadian banks.
Canadian banks have lowered their prime lending rate in response to the Bank of Canada rate cut, but kept their cut substantially smaller than the 0.25 per cent dip at the central bank. That move is meant to help their bottom line.
And some banks have also started to reduce their workforces in a cost-cutting measure.

A MAN'S heart stopped after he accidentally swallowed a 14-centimetre long Dover sole on a fishing trip in Boscombe.
The casualty, 28, went into cardiac arrest on October 5 after the fish leapt into his mouth, completely blocking his throat. However, paramedics were able to clear his airway after drawing the sole free in their desperate bid to save the man's life.
Emergency services were called to reports that a man had stopped breathing at the pier.
South Western Ambulance Service clinician, Matt Harrison, was on the scene in less than two minutes.
Crews were directed along the dimly-lit pier to discover a friend of the casualty was already performing CPR.
Mr Harrison quickly discovered the casualty had a blocked airway and was going into cardiac arrest. Questioning the man's friends further, the paramedic discovered the man had jokingly placed a fish he had just caught over his mouth.
The sole had wriggled free and jumped into the patient's throat, causing a complete obstruction.
Operations officer Martyn Box also attended the incident.
He said: “The boys were giving really good CPR on our arrival, as instructed by the control room staff.
"Initially we didn't know the true extent of the situation or what the patient was choking on, but as we questioned them further we were told he had a whole fish stuck in his windpipe."
As the patient's heart had already stopped, paramedics continued CPR.
He was then artificially ventilated with a bag and mask, but his airway remained blocked and he wasn't receiving any oxygen.
The man began to deteriorate.
Mr Harrison said: "It was clear that we needed to get the fish out or this patient was not going to survive the short journey to the Royal Bournemouth Hospital.
"I used a laryngoscope to fully extend the mouth and throat and saw what appeared like an altered colour of tissue in his throat.
"Using a McGills forceps I was able to eventually dislodge the tip of the tail and very carefully, so as not to break the tail off I tried to remove it - although the fish's barbs and gills were getting stuck on the way back up.
"I was acutely aware that I only had one attempt at getting this right as if I lost grip or a piece broke off and it slid further out of sight then there was nothing more that we could have done to retrieve the obstruction."
After six attempts, the fish finally came out in one piece. To paramedic's amazement, it was a whole Dover sole, measuring some 14cm.
Mr Harrison said: “I have never attended a more bizarre incident and don't think I ever will – but we're all so glad the patient has no lasting effects from his cardiac arrest, which could so easily have had such a tragic and devastating outcome."
After the patient arrived at hospital, he was able to respond to some questions, and has since made a full recovery.
In January, we reported extensively on a situation involving fraudulent Far Cry 4 keys. Ubisoft had discovered that the keys were bought with a stolen credit card and decided to deactivate all of them.
Ubisoft has continued to investigate the matter and has amended its decision. “After further investigation into the matter of keys that were fraudulently purchased on EA's Origin store, we are reinstating keys for consumers who already had successfully activated and started playing the games,” a representative told us via email. “Any remaining fraudulently obtained and resold keys have been deactivated.”
The publisher says it will continue to deactivate fraudulently purchased keys in the future. “We are working with EA to prevent situations like this from happening again, and we will continue to deactivate keys that are found to be fraudulently obtained and resold,” we have been told. “We strongly recommend that players purchase keys and downloadable games only from the Uplay shop or trusted retailers.”
Retailers Kinguin and G2A both issued statements on the matter in January when their customers reported that keys purchased from the sites were made inactive. You can read our previous coverage for more on this story.
Our Take
Ubisoft had every right to pull the plug on the stolen merchandise. However, this move is a smart play with regard to customer service and satisfaction. Hopefully those customers that were impacted by this keep it in mind when purchasing from potentially problematic sites in the future.
People in the Basque town of Galdakao, Spain, put their leftovers in the fridge — not just the ones in their homes, but the one on the street, too.
The city of about 30,000 created the country's first communal refrigerator to help the hungry.
Alvaro Saiz, who used to run a food bank in Galdakao, came up with the idea for the “Solidarity Fridge” during the recession when he saw people going through trash bins looking for food. He figured there had to be a better way for restaurants and even individuals to give away unused food.
He went to the mayor with his plan to put a refrigerator on the street where people could deliver leftovers and the hungry could take what they needed.
“When he came to city hall with this idea, I thought it was both crazy and brilliant!” Mayor Ibon Uribe told NPR. “How could I say no?”
It took some legal research and money, but the city finally came up with $5,500 for the project and changed the law to keep the city from being sued if people get sick. No raw meat or eggs are allowed and food has to be thrown out after four days, but people who maintain the Solidarity Fridge says nothing lasts more than a few hours.
Restaurants now put leftover tapas in the fridge and some people actually cook whole meals just to put in it. And schools are organizing field trips to the fridge, to teach young students how to share and not be wasteful.

Louis Ross, 29, of Monroe (Photo: OPSO)
A Monroe man was arrested early Sunday morning after he reportedly stood completely nude in the middle of Winnsboro Road and blocked traffic.
According to the arrest affidavit, Louis Ross, 29, of 806 Marx Street, was arrested at 3:16 a.m. when Ouachita Parish Sheriff's deputies arrived at a night club on a physical disturbance call and saw Ross in the street.
The officers assumed Ross was under the influence of a controlled dangerous substance due to his "erotic behavior."
The deputies ordered Ross to the ground, an order he refused, according to the affidavit. The deputies took him to the ground after a physical altercation and Ross refused to put his hands behind his back, which resulted in one of the officers using a stun gun.
He is being held at Ouachita Correctional Center on charges of simple obstruction of a highway of commerce, disturbing the peace — drunkenness and resisting an officer.

GRAPH ON CARBON DIOXIDE DURING GEOLOGICAL ERAS
In prehistoric times, during the Permian, in the Palaeozoic Era, for example, the concentration of Carbon Dioxide dropped below 210 ppmV. Throughout the Permian Period plant and animal species diverged and diversified as never before. Dinosaurs prospered and predominated over all the other orders of vertebrates. Coniferous plants first appeared in the Permian. The change of atmospheric temperature at the time of the Permian was around 10 °C. By comparison, the current change of global temperature is only 0.52 °C while the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide is 385 ppmV. If the global temperature is dependent on CO 2 , then the change of temperature at present would be around 10 °C or higher, as it was during the Permian Period.
From the early Triassic to the middle Cretaceous, the concentration of atmospheric Carbon Dioxide was similar to its current density. From the late cretaceous to the early Miocene, the concentration climbed above 210 ppmV. During the Holocene period, the concentration has oscillated from 210 ppmV to 385 ppmV.
It is possible that the concentration of atmospheric CO 2 will increase normally in the course of the next 50 million years to 1050 ppmV or 2500 ppmV.
We have also observed that the concentration of atmospheric CO 2 increases several centuries after glaciations. Perhaps this is due to the fact that most plants perish at sub-zero temperatures, and plants are organisms that capture Carbon Dioxide from their surroundings to make food.
Scientists have also observed that the concentration of atmospheric CO 2 increases during periods of warming. However, an increase in temperature always precedes an increase in carbon dioxide, which generally occurs decades or centuries after any change of temperature. We have not observed an increase in the concentration of Carbon Dioxide to have preceded a period of warming. This latter phenomenon occurs because when oceans absorb more heat from an increase in the amount of direct solar irradiance incident upon the Earth's surface, they release more Carbon Dioxide molecules into the atmosphere. Nevertheless, most drastic increases in CO 2 concentration occur decades or centuries after the oceans have warmed up. For example, the present increase of atmospheric Carbon Dioxide was caused by an extraordinary increase in solar activity in 1998 which warmed up the El Niño South Atlantic Oceanic Oscillation.
These increases in concentration of atmospheric CO 2 offer optimal conditions for the development and evolution of living beings on Earth. Human beings should adapt to these natural changes by means of science and technology.
When Manchester City signed Argentine Nicolas Otamendi for £32m towards the end of August, it was intriguing to see where he would fit in. His pedigree was unquestionable, named in the 2014/15 La Liga Team of the Year, but the then current first choice centre-back partnership of Vincent Kompany and Eliaquim Mangala had begun the season in miserly fashion. Would he settle for playing second fiddle? As we approach the end of November, we appear to have an answer.
Opportunities were limited for Otamendi initially, a mixture of work permit issues and continued strong performance from those ahead of him. He eventually made his debut against Juventus, after Kompany was forced off with a suspected calf injury. It was a baptism of fire. A lack of match fitness told as the Italian champions snatched a late winner. With Kompany sidelined thereafter, opportunity knocked. Although City were beaten in Otamendi's first two Premier League appearances, the Argentine showed glimpses of his class.
His game has continued to become stronger with each passing week, as he adapts to the rigours of the English game. Arguably, it is a style he is very much suited to. Gritty, physical and uncompromising, Otamendi has many attributes needed to be a success in a league that is so dissimilar to its European counterparts.
Not only is he in his element without the ball, he is also perfectly adept with it. Calm and composed in possession, Otamendi provides City with a different dimension going forward. Happy to carry the ball forward, and incisive with his passing from central defence, the former Valencia defender allows for the ball to be moved at a quicker pace. Mangala, and previously Lescott, perhaps both lack a bit of composure and poise when in possession, negating some of City's threat and tempo in attack. This is a criticism that has been levelled at City in recent years, especially as defending champions.
Now, defence can become attack in three seconds, instead of 30. From a tactical perspective, Otamendi's superior ability on the ball in comparison with previous partners for Vincent Kompany has helped him emerge as a serious contender to be just that on a permanent basis. An area of fragility for City in recent years, especially since the reign of Roberto Mancini ended, the emergence of a full-time partner for Kompany is an extremely welcome one. Undoubtedly City's relative defensive frailties under Pellegrini have been in large part caused by the lack of a consistent central defensive partnership. Now they appear to have the perfect mix of rugged, no-nonsense defending and elegant, composed ball-players needed to be successful in the modern game – both domestically and continentally.
Although they have only played four games together, it is evident the stability the partnership has provided. A superb performance in Seville followed up by some strong defensive displays in the Premier League makes the prospect of facing City a little more formidable than it might have been last season. Everyone is aware of the attacking artillery Manchester City have, but less know about the bearded defensive shield they have recently acquired. It could just be, as is often the way with Football, that the most understated of signings in the summer could perhaps turn out to be the most important.

At a time when more and more NFL teams are conducting training camp at their in-season (and offseason) practice facilities, count the Eagles among the group that will continue to go off-site.
The team announced that training camp will remain at Lehigh University, at least through 2013.
“Lehigh University has been an incredible partner of ours, and we couldn't be more excited about returning for an 18th training camp in 2013,” Eagles president Don Smolenski said. “They provide us with first-class accommodations year in and year out — not only for the players, coaches and staff, but also for the thousands of fans who attend the practices every day. We have a great relationship with Lehigh as evidenced by the communication we had through the lockout last season, which allowed us to hit the ground running once football activities resumed. We're looking forward to another successful summer at Lehigh.”
The Eagles started holding training camp at Lehigh in 1996, two years after the team was purchased by Jeffrey Lurie.
Though it makes sense from a cost standpoint to conduct training camp at the first-rate practice accommodations most if not all teams already have, the limited duration of the offseason program and the limited contact in training camp could make the old-fashioned approach more valuable.
A YOUNG man from a poor district of Manila volunteered with a local anti-crime group and was working towards his second degree. The student—call him Joshua—lived with his sister and her husband. After she had a child their small house was cramped, so he was staying with a friend. One night in July, the police raided the friend's house. They claim that Joshua, his friend and another man were armed and started a gunfight.
Witnesses—three young women also staying at the house, whom police escorted out—say that Joshua and the other guest were sleeping, and the tenant (who allegedly belonged to a gang of petty thieves) had surrendered. He was pleading with the police to leave Joshua and the other friend alone; they had done nothing wrong. The witnesses also claim the police trained their guns on any neighbours trying to see what was happening and then kicked Joshua awake. He immediately surrendered. Shots rang out. All three young men were killed.

When a local NGO asked for CCTV footage that would have shown the raid, they were told the cameras had malfunctioned. The chairman of the barangay, or neighbourhood, said he knew nothing about the raid and was on holiday that night.
Such is life in the Philippines under President Rodrigo Duterte. During his 22 years as mayor of the southern city of Davao, human-rights groups linked him with vigilante squads who killed suspected criminals there. He treated the accusations with pride. As a presidential candidate, he vowed to stamp out crime within six months of taking office, even if it meant he had to slaughter 100,000 suspected criminals. On the day he took office, he told police officers that if they killed 1,000 people while doing their duty, he would protect them. Many assumed his tough talk was campaign bluster. They were wrong.
Extrajudicial killings—of environmental activists, journalists, ordinary citizens who challenge politically powerful clans and others—have long been a fact of life in the Philippines. Under Mr Duterte, people suspected of involvement in the drug trade have now come under fire. Between May 10th, the day after Mr Duterte won the presidency, and August 5th, ABS-CBN, a Philippine broadcaster, estimates that 943 drug suspects have been killed, most of them by the police, some by “unknown assailants”. Many were suspected of being drug dealers, but users have also been targeted: according to the Inquirer, a newspaper keeping a “kill list” of the casualties in the drug war (with about 600 names), one woman was found dead with a sign around her neck saying that she was “a drug addict, pickpocket and pest to society”.
Because suspects never face trial, the evidence against them remains largely unknown. According to one human-rights worker, police present barangay officials with a list of drug suspects. The officials then send the suspects a notice identifying them as such and ordering them to turn themselves in at the barangay office. There they receive a warning: reform or else you will be arrested or killed. Once they promise to change they are given waivers—sometimes in English, which few poor Filipinos can read—and are released.
Activists say at least 125,000 people have voluntarily surrendered so far (others put the number much higher). But Mr Duterte estimates that 3m-4m Filipinos are drug addicts. According to Nicanor Silanga, a policeman in Payatas, a poor, sprawling barangay in Quezon City, the police “expect all of them to surrender”.
America, the UN and the Catholic church have expressed concern over the extrajudicial killings, but Mr Duterte's standing among ordinary Filipinos remains high. A human-rights worker calls him “our most popular president since Cory Aquino” (the worker requested anonymity, citing increased security concerns since Mr Duterte took office).
Theresa Padaluga, an investigator in Commonwealth, the biggest barangay in Manila, says that around 20 drug suspects have been killed there since Mr Duterte took over. She proudly notes that her jails now house no drug users—only drinkers and those accused of domestic violence. Geraldine, a mother holding her toddler's hand outside the Commonwealth barangay office, says that Mr Duterte's policies work because they target “pests”. Even if they get another chance, “they'll just go back to using drugs,” she says. Amelia, who runs a stall on a quiet Commonwealth street, says: “We like Duterte. Since he took over it's become quieter here because people are afraid.”
Cruel of law
Recently Mr Duterte has escalated his crusade from the street to the halls of power. He has met some pushback. On August 7th he publicly named and accused more than 150 judges, politicians and senior military and police officials of involvement in drugs, giving them 24 hours to surrender. “Due process has nothing to do with my mouth,” said Mr Duterte. Few would disagree. Still, his list included the names of dead, retired and fired officials, and prompted an outcry from the country's chief justice and other politicians. In response Mr Duterte threatened to declare martial law. In any event, he won office largely because he was not an ordinary politician; opprobrium from trapos (slang for “traditional politicians” and a play on the Tagalog word for “old rags”) only enhances his standing.
The longer the killings continue, the more damage is done to the rule of law. Last month Alfred Ceasico, a drug user, was shot dead in his own home by a hitman who ran into the house as his sister, Sheryl, was leaving. Three days before his death, police had detained him and demanded more money than his family could afford; when they could not pay, she says, they beat him with a wooden plank. She does not know who shot him, but wants to tell her brother's story. “Not all drug users are bad people,” she says.
