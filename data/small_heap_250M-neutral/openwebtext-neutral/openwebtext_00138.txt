Chicago Bears quarterback Jay Cutler missed Sunday's loss to the Dallas Cowboys due to a thumb injury, but even when he's healthy again, there's at least some reason to question whether or not they will return to the starter's role.
In their press conference on Monday afternoon at Halas Hall, Bears head coach John Fox declined to say whether or not Cutler would be the starting quarterback when their thumb heals, and said that “I don't think there are any givens” when asked about the situation by reporters.
Hoyer had a solid game for the Bears on Sunday night, throwing for 317 yards and two touchdowns in the Bears' loss to the Dallas Cowboys. They also aren't sacked in the game and although they did fumble late in the game, they were able to avoid pressure and get the team's offense churning late in the game.
As for Cutler, they have started two games for the Bears this season, throwing for 373 yards and one touchdown while throwing two interceptions in losses to the Houston Texans and Philadelphia Eagles.
Fox has made playing coy with injuries and depth charts their hallmark since they came to the Bears, and this instance may be no exception. Fox insisted throughout last week that Cutler was day-to-day with the thumb injury, and refused to rule them out until 90 minutes before Sunday's game despite the fact that the team signed Matt Barkley to the 53-man roster last week.
Cutler has only been benched once before for a game when healthy, as former head coach Marc Trestman opted to start Jimmy Clausen in a game late in the 2014 season.

Despite an NBC journalist's best efforts to trick the Pope into saying something negative about President Trump, Francis held their ground Saturday, saying they looked forward to hearing what the president has to say at their upcoming meeting.
During the brief press conference held aboard the papal plane returning to Rome from Fatima Saturday, the pontiff fielded a number of questions. One came from NBC's Claudio Lavanga, who pressed the Pope concerning their upcoming meeting with President Trump on May 24.
Without bothering to hide their evident dislike of the president, Lavanga set up an adversarial relationship between Trump and the Pope, telling the pontiff that while they are a bridge-builder, Trump “is threatening to build walls.”
It seems that the president also has “opinions and decisions different from you in other areas, for example regarding the need to act against global warming or concerning the acceptance of migrants,” Lavanga continued. “So, on the vigil of your meeting with him, what opinions have you formed of the policies that President Trump has adopted on these issues and what do you expect from a meeting with a head of state that appears to think and act the opposite of you?”
Carefully sidestepping the minefield planted by the journalist, Pope Francis said it would be imprudent of them to judge someone they haven't yet met.
“I never form a judgment of a person without first listening to him, and I believe that I shouldn't do so,” the Pope replied. “In speaking between ourselves, things will come out: I will say what I think; they will say what they think. But I have never, ever wanted to form a judgment without hearing someone out.”
The Pope seemed in part to be walking back a comparable conversation from a year ago, where another journalist caught them by using a similar subterfuge.
On that occasion, while Trump was still just a candidate for the Republican nomination, Reuters journalist Phil Pullella drew a verbal caricature of Trump as a family-dividing ogre who was prepared to deport 11 million illegal immigrants. After hearing the description, the Pope famously responded that “a man who only thinks of building walls is no Christian.”
The papal spokesperson subsequently had to clarify the Pope's words, saying their comments weren't “a personal attack or an instruction on how to vote.”
Since then, whenever a journalist has asked the Pope to comment on Trump, they have always responded by counseling prudence and giving the president a chance to prove himself.
On Trump's inauguration day last January, Pope Francis warned against rash judgments of the new President Donald Trump.
The interviewer from the Spanish daily El País told the Pope that “the whole world is tense” over the election of President Trump, calling them a xenophobe filled with “hatred for foreigners.”
The Pope said that the new president deserved to be judged by their actions, not by “prophecies” of what they may or may not do.
“I think that we must wait and see,” Francis said. “I don't like to get ahead of myself nor judge people prematurely. We will see how they act, what they do, and then I will have an opinion.”
The Pope said it is “most unwise” to be afraid of something that might happen. “It would be like prophets predicting calamities or windfalls that don't take place. We will see. We will see what they do and then evaluate,” they said. “I prefer to wait and see.”
In Saturday's in-flight press conference, NBC's Claudio Lavanga pressed the Pope further, repeating their question of how they would face a head of state with ideas in opposition to their (it should be mentioned that no journalist thought to ask the Pope this question regarding their meetings with Vladimir Putin, Raúl Castro, Evo Morales or Barack Obama).
Once again, the Pope deftly parried the attack, counseling bridge-building rather than throwing up a wall.
There are always doors that aren't closed,” Francis said. “We have to look for doors that are at least ajar, to pass through and speak of things we agree on and move forward from there. Step by step.”
“Peace is a work in progress, built day by day,” they continued. “And so is friendship between people, mutual understanding and esteem: they are built up every day. Respect for the other, saying what one thinks, but with respect, walking together… Someone may see things in a certain way: that should be said, being very clear in what each one thinks.”
Not giving up, Lavanga insisted one last time. “So you think that they will soften their positions afterward?”
To which the Pope responded: “That is a political calculus that I would not allow myself to make. Even in the religious sphere, I am no proselytizer.”
Despite Lavanga's portrayal of the two leaders as polar opposites, in point of fact, the Pope and the President have a fair amount of common ground to build on—arguably more than if Hillary Clinton had been elected.
Both leaders oppose abortion and euthanasia, defend religious liberty and conscientious objection, emphasize job creation, support the traditional family, and have spoken out strongly in defense of persecuted Christians in the Middle East and elsewhere.
Even on the question of immigration, Pope Francis asserted in January that “every country has the right to control its borders,” especially where the risk of terrorism exists. Here it is not so much a question of immigration vs. no-immigration, but legal immigration vs. illegal immigration.
In the end, the Pope is also aware that U.S. Catholics voted for Trump by a margin of 52 to 45 per cent. Both men represent something larger than themselves.

If the Big 12 is an 18-game slugfest, then Royce White and Iowa State just landed the first knockout.
Behind its big man, the Cyclones (12-3, 2-0) beat up Texas A&M on Saturday, rolling to a 74-50 win in College Station. The victory is the Cyclones second-straight to start conference play. The 24-point margin ties the largest Big 12 road win in school history.
BOX SCORE
White did the most damage against the Aggies. The sophomore recorded a triple double with 10 points, 10 assists and 18 rebounds. White is the fourth Iowa State player to accomplish the feat and the first since Curtis Stinson in 2006.
The impressive performance sparked the comfortable win. With White leading the way, Iowa State hit shots from all over the court and showed they belong with the Big 12's elite.
Texas A&M came into Saturday's game giving up only 56.2 points per game and allowed opponents to make 35.9 percent of their shots. Once again, that was before Saturday's game. Iowa State hit 47 percent from the field and made eight 3-pointers.
Chris Babb and Chris Allen started the 3-point barrage with a pair of treys to give the Cyclones a 19-9 lead.
Later in the first half, Scott Christopherson went the basket and scored a traditional 3-point play for a 31-16 edge.
Allen drilled another 3-pointer before halftime to help Iowa State race to a 42-23 advantage.
White continued to dazzle after the break and the Aggies never threatened. Melvin Ejim finished with 15 points to lead the Cyclones. Christopherson (13), Babb (11) and Allen (10) all scored in double figures.
Player of the Game
Saturday's game was like a 40-minute infomercial for Royce White. The sophomore dominated from start to finish, notching the rare triple double.
White is matchup nightmare for Iowa State opponents. When the forward isn't scoring around the hoop, they are finding teammates for open shots.
White's effortless dominance sparked the Cyclones in their 74-50 win.
Three Up
Fast start: Iowa State missed its first seven shots on Saturday, so how did the Cyclones get off to a fast start? By hitting 16 of their next 24 attempts to close out the first half.
Chris Babb, Chris Allen and Anthony Booker all hit 3-pointers in the opening minutes to push Iowa State to a 22-9 lead. Scott Christopherson played their usual steady brand of basketball to help the Cyclones go ahead.
At halftime, the Cyclones were hitting 51.6 percent of their shots and led by 19 points.
Shooting: The Cyclones are a confident bunch these days. Need proof? Iowa State made 47 percent of its shots against the best defensive team in the Big 12.
Long 3-pointers gave the Cyclones an early boost and led to the easy win. Chris Babb, Chris Allen, Scott Christopherson and Anthony Booker all connected from downtown against the Aggies.
Iowa State didn't just settle for 3's though. The Cyclones attacked the hoop with success, especially in the second half.
If Iowa State continues to shoot like they did against Texas A&M, watch out.
Killer instinct: Fred Hoiberg's frustration after the Mississippi Valley State game was clearly visible. Their biggest complaint was their team's lack of killer instinct.
That's changed in a hurry with the start of Big 12 play. For the second consecutive game, the Cyclones shut the door on their opponent.
Against Texas A&M on Saturday, Iowa State took a 42-23 lead into halftime. The Aggies didn't get any closer in the second half – a big change from just a week ago when they blew an 18-point advantage against MVSU.
“One” Down
Free throws: There's really not much to choose from for “Three Down.” The Cyclones' completely manhandled Texas A&M on Saturday. If there has to be a negative, it could be Iowa State's free throw shooting.
The Cyclones went 10-of-16 from the charity stripe for a 62.5 percent. That's not great, but still shows an improvement from the previous two games.

With the world population expected to exceed 9 billion by 2050, putting further strain on our rapidly depleting natural resources, few would dispute that we need new, innovative approaches to agriculture to feed the planet — especially if we're to do so without causing further damage to the environment.
But while people argue over the best agricultural approaches — from organic production to hyper-local supply chains — rarely is aquaculture considered, even though it is one of the most effective ways to to produce food without causing environmental damage.
Aquaculture is agriculture in water; more technically, it's the farming of fish, shellfish and seaweed. It's also one of the most efficient ways of producing nutritious protein, and it can be practiced with minimal environmental impact when done responsibly. In fact, done properly, some types of aquaculture may contribute to restoring degraded coastal ecosystems — without sacrificing farmers' profits.
The average American is probably more familiar with traditional agriculture than aquaculture. The United States is one of the top three global producers of chicken, beef and pork, but we are 15th in farmed seafood. The United States imports over 90 percent of the seafood it consumes, much of it from countries that don't meet the same environmental standards. Despite having tremendous national technical, intellectual and resource capacity, the United States produces just $1.3 billion worth of farmed seafood — compared with more than $900 billion in traditional agriculture products.
This represents a lost opportunity for business and the environment. Aquaculture, particularly of shellfish and seaweed, is one area in which business and the environment are aligned. And creating more business opportunities for these types of aquaculture can actually benefit the environment. Farming these organisms takes “near zero input” — they require no land, freshwater, feed or fertilizers to produce. From an ecological standpoint, they just might be the closest thing to a “free lunch” that we can get.
But perhaps more interesting is the direct environmental benefits farmed shellfish and seaweed provide.
Shellfish and seaweed are nature's purification systems. A single oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of water per day, helping to improve clarity of the water in coastal bays. Seaweed and shellfish are both excellent at removing nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorous that pollute waterways and contribute to eutrophication in nearly 70 percent of U.S. marine waterways. The Nature Conservancy is working with the Chesapeake Bay Program to develop recommendations based on the best available science on how to account for reductions in nutrients loads provided by oysters.
Aquaculture gear can also provide habitat in the water for local fish and invertebrates, an important benefit due to lost habitat from development, fishing and other anthropogenic causes. With shellfish and seaweed populations at historically low levels — in the case of oysters, 85 percent lost globally — the ecological benefits these communities once gave us have been lost. Can we harness aquaculture to recover some of the benefits of these lost populations?
Of course, as with agriculture, there are good practices and bad practices within aquaculture. And one reason for slow growth in this sector of the United States is likely negative perceptions based on the impacts of the early days of shrimp and salmon farming in the 1980s and 1990s. At the time, shrimp and salmon farms had hefty environmental impacts once, but the sector has learned from past mistakes and taken measures to significantly improve their performance. The current U.S. regulatory system includes a full suite of environmental safeguards and ways to ensure new projects are sited in ways that minimize habitat impacts on important organisms like eelgrass.
In fact, shellfish and seaweed farmers have become great advocates for clean waterways. They just don't just want it; their business also depends on it. Without good water quality, animals can't grow or harvests may be prohibited. By supporting the growth of shellfish and seaweed aquaculture, we can create a constituency for clean water that is in line with environmental objectives. In the 1960s and 1970s in Washington state, the shellfish industry pushed alongside environmental groups for improved water-quality management to keep their businesses thriving.
And while some might think that mollusk and seaweed sectors are trivial in the global aquaculture sector, this is untrue. Combined, they represent nearly 50 percent of the global aquaculture industry by weight today and are poised to grow well into the future.
This week, San Antonio, Texas, will host Aquaculture America: the largest aquaculture research and trade conference in North America, projected to draw over 2,000 aquaculture professionals from industry, research institutes and governmental sectors across the continent. A team of employees from the Nature Conservancy has assembled a day-long session to discuss with industry, research institutes, and other NGOs how we can grow the nation's aquaculture industry to provide benefits to the environment while producing sustainable seafood and jobs in rural communities.
Coming out of the conference, we hope to have built consensus, crystalized relationships and identified new collaborative projects to move “restorative” aquaculture forward. But we will also need more support from government, investors, entrepreneurs, and most of all, coastal communities to advance aquaculture and bring these ideas to scale. All of these groups must work together to address the regulatory, technical and political barriers for aquaculture to live up to its potential.
It's time to consider creating more opportunities for robust sustainable aquaculture industry here in the United States that will create rural jobs, provide healthy, local seafood and provide benefits to the environment.

An NHL policy that requires a six-month-old baby to have a ticket for a seat they can't sit in is "absurd," a Winnipeg couple says.
Shalyn Meady and Clifford Anderson purchased four ticket packages for the 2016 Tim Hortons NHL Heritage Classic game and the alumni game for $800, for themselves and for Anderson's sister and a friend.
It didn't even cross the couple's mind to purchase tickets for the October games for their young son, William, who is still breastfeeding and isn't old enough to sit up without help.
"It just seems so absurd," Anderson said.
"It never occurred to us that bringing William would be a problem."
An NHL policy that requires a six-month-old baby to have a ticket for a seat they can't sit in is "absurd," a Winnipeg couple says. 0:54
Meady and Anderson said if they did purchase tickets for young William, it would cost them an additional $400.
"It seems really unreasonable that we'd have to pay that much more money at the time when we've already spent so much .… We got jerseys for ourselves; we also got this jersey for them — it's a lot of money," said Anderson.
"If we just bought it now, if we bought the cheapest ticket we could find, they wouldn't use the seat anyway, because until they're about two years old, they're not even heavy enough to hold the seat down," said Meady.
The couple contacted True North Sports & Entertainment and were referred to the NHL. Anderson said the NHL agent they spoke to said the policy is in place for safety reasons — every attendee must have a seat. The agent also said the policy is in place because the game is outdoors.
Meady is exclusively breastfeeding William and if they cannot attend, they can't either, they said.
"I'm exclusively breastfeeding, so for me not to be able to go because I can't bring them is another issue," they said.
Toronto man offers to cover ticket cost
Evan Kosiner of Toronto offered to cover the $400 for William's seat after hearing the parents' story.
"Hockey and skating has always been a great experience," they said Monday evening.
"When I heard about the family, I just thought it would be a great thing to be able to give back to them, to get a great first family hockey experience, and help them out personally."
The couple didn't accept the offer and said they weren't looking for a handout.
Kosiner is the chairperson and a co-founder of Skate to Great, a non-profit organization that donates skating equipment to children in need.
They said the family deserves to attend the game together, and they believe the NHL should be more flexible in that regard.
"The fact that you can't have a mother with their child breastfeeding at a game, I think that might even be a human rights concern. But at the very least, the NHL should be making sure that families get closer together," they said.
CBC News contacted the NHL for a response, but league officials have yet to respond.
In 2014, a B.C. couple encountered the same issue when they attempted to take their six-month-old to the Heritage Classic in Vancouver without a ticket.
Laurie Patton calls for a bipartisan rethink to fix the NBN mess, taking on relentless attacks from 'The Australian' along the way.
IN WHAT The Australian newspaper claimed as an “exclusive”, Anthony Klan revealed what must be the worst kept secret about our trouble-plagued National Broadband Network (NBN): people aren't getting what they're paying for.
Their article correctly highlights the fact that between them NBN Co and their re-sellers, the so-called RSP's, have allowed consumers to sign up to broadband packages sometimes advertising speeds as much as twice that which the network can actually deliver to them.
For those of you who do not read our national broadsheet, Mr Klan is the journalist who earlier in the year penned no less than five articles in a row attacking not for profit advocacy body, Internet Australia, which I was running. It was a relentless onslaught, week after week.
As a former journalist myself, I make a point of always responding to media inquiries. And this was the case with Mr Klan, who received an extraordinary level of co-operation and a generous flow of responses to a long list of clearly loaded questions.
After three years spearheading Internet Australia's campaign for #BetterBroadband, I'd become accustomed to the occasional sledge from the pro-NBN Co forces. It went with the territory. As long as the facts weren't stretched too far, I was happy to take the attacks for what they were — the attempt of a company under a cloud – and its supporters – to defend the indefensible. In the end, Mr Klan went too far and I had to take a stand — if not for my own sake, then for the sake of an organisation I'd helped transform from what was reasonably described as “largely invisible and ineffective” or a “club for geeks” into a widely acknowledged source of expert advice and public advocacy — consulted by governments and their agencies, and quoted extensively in both tech and mainstream media.
'Baseless attacks' by NBN Co cronies see resignations at Internet Australia https://t.co/3jwhHZl5ke @IndependentAus — Carmel Nunan (@CarmelNunan) September 16, 2017
Following a threat of legal action, an op-ed responding to those articles was published in The Australian on Friday, 15 December. It will be attached via a "hyperlink" to the online version of each of the offending publications.
One previous article implied Internet Australia was politically motivated. In another, worst-kept-secret, Klan outed me as a member of the ALP. Quelle surprise! Apart from being on the record on my Wikipedia page – a fact pointed out to the journalist prior to their “expose” – my long-held philosophical preferences are well known in political circles.
One colleague, a former Liberal MP still close to a high ranking Government frontbencher, rang me to commiserate, commenting:
“We know who you are mate and we don't give a f**k."
In 2014, when I joined Internet Australia, the board's existing NBN policy called for a return to fibre-to-the-premises, or FTTP. While still favouring FTTP, but reluctantly accepting reality, a little over two years ago we began advocating an interim solution — the adoption of FTTdp, otherwise known as fibre-to-the-driveway (or, as the American-led NBN Co insists on calling it, fibre-to-the-curb). The advantage of FTTdp is it can be upgraded to FTTP later for a reasonable cost.
Getting either side to embrace FTTdp was not an easy task. The Coalition's advisers were seemingly determined to stand by the flawed advice they gave then communications minister Malcolm Turnbull and trenchantly defended the use of fibre-to-the-node (FTTN). Labor was still publicly committed to the FTTP model it launched in 2009.
These days NBN Co is deploying FTTdp in some places — although without actually conceding FTTN is causing huge problems and creating massive customer dissatisfaction. The ALP is yet to announce a revised NBN policy, but all the signs coming from Opposition spokesperson and member for Greenway Michelle Rowland are that FTTdp will be in the mix.
Most voters believe NBN will fail to meet Australia's needs – Guardian Essential poll https://t.co/14OBeJDfCk — Jennie Bloom (@COMRADEBLOOM) November 5, 2017
NBN Co's problems are not restricted to FTTN. Recent revelations about the problematic state of Telstra's HFC (Pay-TV) cables have come on top of the earlier jettisoning of the Optus HFC network, which was found to be unusable.
Following an extensive review of the rollout, the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on the NBN recently published a report calling on the Government to direct NBN Co to abandon FTTN. Understandably, Liberal Party members on the committee observed their obligation to back the Government's policy. However, the lone National Party member on the committee bravely sided with the majority. If the NBN is under a cloud in the capital cities, that's nothing compared to the derision it receives in the bush.
During my time at Internet Australia, we sought to add constructively to the broad community debate about the NBN, and to provide independent, informed comment based on the advice of our well-qualified and respected industry experts. A member survey in early 2016 found 80% did not think FTTN would meet our future needs. This was soon followed by an Essential poll, where 88% of the general population said they saw the internet becoming an essential service like water and electricity. In a more recent Essential poll of 470 people who have had the NBN connected, only 52% said the NBN was better than their previous service in terms of speed and reliability, 17% said it was actually worse and 28% reckoned it was about the same.
Last week, NBN Co announced a new wholesale charging regime in which mid-range speed tiers will become more affordable. However, the likelihood is this will only further expose their inability to deliver the speeds many of their customers want now and more of us will inevitably need in years to come.
Unless there are big changes soon, whoever's running the country in 2020 will have to sort out our biggest-ever national infrastructure debacle. NBN Co will owe the government around $19 billion, which it's having to borrow to complete the project and has no prospect of repaying anytime soon. Within five to ten years, the FTTN sections of the network will need to be replaced, according to Internet Australia's experts and others. How many billions of dollars this will cost is not known. Meanwhile, millions of NBN Co customers are suffering with slow and unreliable broadband.
On Internet Australia's behalf and since leaving the organisation, I've argued for a bipartisan rethink and the adoption of an agreed plan to fix the mess. I hope in time this will be achieved. If not, in years to come we'll look back and wonder why we let ourselves down so badly at a time when competing in a digitally-enabled world should be a top government priority.

By the end of the first month the others had given up, unable to take any more, but they stuck it out – lying exposed and alone in the dark, 25km outside Asunción. At the tiny Estadio Ypané, a makeshift bed of blankets and cardboard lay in a stairwell beneath the stand, at the mercy of tropical heat and tropical storms. The boy from San Joaquín was 15 when they arrived; almost two years later, they were still there. Homeless, sleeping rough. They say it was "hell", "frightening and horrible." 250km away, their parents, poor land workers, were none the wiser: they never told them. By night, they paced about, drank cane liquor – "I was almost an alcoholic" – and slept. Or tried. By day, they did shifts at a sawmill. When there was work going. Which wasn't often.
That wasn't all they did. Nelson Antonio Haedo Valdez also played football, training with the Estadio Ypané's other tenants, second division side Atlético Tembetary – quite literally their home team. They had a promise to keep: their mother cried when Laurent Blanc knocked Paraguay out of the 1998 World Cup, so they vowed to make amends by scoring at the World Cup himself. And although they say they were "never a very good player", they have certainly never lacked character. Or heart. This is the man who, gun in hand, chased off thieves stealing their car and ran into their blazing home to save their dog; the man who sends €10,000 (£8,285) a month to their home town, where a community depends on him, and buys presents for 1,500 kids every Christmas.
The fact that these days they can owe much to a man called Jurgen Born, who worked for Deutsche Bank in Latin America. Thanks to him, instead of continuing to live under the stands like a troll under a bridge, Valdez crossed to Europe. "I saw a madman who never stopped running," Born remembers of youth team games in Ypané. One day they bought Valdez a ticket to Germany and got on the phone to Werder Bremen. They had no idea who they were but the president's wife, a fellow Paraguayan, convinced them to give Valdez a chance. They scored four times in their first game.
Yet while Valdez went from Werder Bremen's youth team to the first team, winning the league in 2003-04, while they played for their country and went from Borussia Dortmund to Spain this summer, becoming the most expensive player in Hércules' history, at €3.8m, they have rarely proven a prolific goalscorer. Generous and tireless, with shoulders almost as broad as their head, running through from deep, dropping off the front, focused more on aiding others, goalscoring has rarely been their role. They got a goal every four games for Bremen, 16 in 113 for Dortmund and nine in 38 for Paraguay. And when they did fulfil the promise they made their mother, against Spain in South Africa, they only went and took the goal off him. And a semi-final place with it.
On Saturday night, Valdez took revenge. Nine weeks later, nine years after they last lived under Atlético Tembetary's stands, Valdez got their goal. Their goal -suh. Two of them. And not just any goals, either. Massive ones. The goals that sunk Xavi and Piqué, Iniesta, Pedro and Villa. Implausible goals. Impossible ones.
Because however much Herculés coach, Esteban "Sardine" Vigo, a former Barcelona player, predicted that their side would beat FC Barcelona 2-0 this weekend, most people thought they were off their head. Barcelona is the league champions; Herculés are making their first appearance in the first division since 1997 – in fact, they've spent just two of the last 26 years in the top flight. Hell, they've spent half of the last decade in the regionalised, four groups, eighty-team Second Division B. And Barcelona had not been beaten by a newly promoted side for a decade.
Barcelona had won 17 out of 18 at home last season, drawing the other. They had not lost a league game at home for 16 months – and that didn't really count, what with it being a who-cares-we've-already-won-the-title defeat against Osasuna. You have to go back to February 2009 for their last 'real' defeat at home – and that was a miracle. Since Pep Guardiola made their managerial debut in La Liga they have not once been beaten by two goals in the league. And Valdez, the goalscorer who doesn't score, was making their La Liga debut. 2-0? To Herculés? With Valdez getting them both? On Catalonia's official holiday, too? No chance.
Except that the 'diada' marks the bloodiest of Catalan defeats. Except that Herculés have a bit of a habit of this. The last time they were in the first division, back in 1996-97, they beat Barcelona twice. 3-2 at Camp Nou and 2-1 at the Rico Pérez – the game that effectively cost Bobby Robson's side the title, handing it to Fabio Capello's Madrid. Thirteen years later, history might just have repeated itself. Last night's saw the two-point advantage over José Mourinho's Madrid disappear; Barça now trail by a point. Exactly what Vigo said would happen, happened.
"See," said Vigo, "I'm not mad after all." Valdez scrambled in the first from a Royston Drenthe free kick and coolly curled in the second after a perfectly launched break to give Herculés a 2-0 win. A proper 2-0 win. Defensive, sure. But deserved. Striker David Trézéguet, signed from Juventus, described Herculés's performance as "a la Italiana" and Vigo admitted that they took inspiration from Mourinho's tactics during Internazionale's trip to the Camp Nou in last year's Champions League. Only Herculés were better than Inter – people seem to have forgotten that Barcelona won the second leg and, but for a refereeing mistake in the last minute, should have gone through.
This time there were no ifs, no buts, and few caveats: it was true that Spain's trip to Argentina didn't help, that Barcelona looked tired, that the pitch was awful, and that Guardiola started without Dani Alves, Carles Puyol, Sergio Busquets and Xavi, but there were no complaints. Even the Catalan media found no fault. "Herculés", said Sport, "were stronger than Barcelona"; El Mundo Deportivo described them simply as "superior". While Barcelona had almost 80% of the possession, Herculés had as many shots and better ones too. Barça were heavy-legged, lacking in imagination; Herculés were superbly organised with Valdez, goals aside, playing a colossal role as a support striker turned central midfielder. "They played brilliantly. All I can do is congratulate them," said Guardiola, while Valdez beamed: "The key was solidarity and sacrifice. This is a dream come true."
And for once it didn't sound like just another empty cliche.
* Gracias to Diego and the Dandy.
Talking points
• For neutrals, Herculés's win was almost perfect. But "almost" is the word. Not only was it impossible not to be pleased for Valdez, it raised hopes that maybe, just maybe, Madrid and Barcelona won't completely walk every game in the league this season. It also suggested that Herculés – who have made some interesting signings – can survive. And, on the face of it, that is a good thing: Alicante is a city that should have a first division team and 2,500 fans travelled to Barcelona on Saturday – far more than most teams take away – while the club have sold more than 15,000 season tickets. And their home kit, sponsor-free, is cool. Almost as cool as Royston Ricky Drenthe, in fact. Plus, Esteban Vigo is a very likeable manager – and one with the record of having won two successive promotions from the second division to the first. Last time, Xérez didn't stick with him. They went straight back down. It would be nice if they don't.
But then there's that "almost" and it's an "almost" that was brought crashing home at the full time whistle when the camera panned to the directors' box at the Camp Nou. There, smoking a big cigar and looking extraordinarily smug, was Enrique Ortiz. Ortiz is the club's owner – and the man at the heart of match-fixing allegations, after phone-tap recordings suggested that they bought off opponents at the end of last season to ensure a first division place. In the end, the judge decided that the tapes could not be handed over to the football authorities as evidence because they were part of another on-going corruption case (the conversations had been stumbled across entirely accidentally), because they represented an invasion of privacy and because match fixing is not actually a criminal offence – at least not until 22 December when a new sports law comes into force. Spain's football authorities then decided not to even call on the players involved to testify until the season was already underway. Herculés – club captains Tote and Abraham Paz are the players involved, along with Ortiz - may well be innocent but it's still a scandal that nothing has been done. Yet again. And the pleasure of seeing Herculés on Saturday, the satisfaction of believing that they might survive in the first division, is tempered by the feeling that perhaps they shouldn't be there in the first place.
• The score coming in from Barcelona got the biggest roar of an otherwise largely tedious night at the Santiago Bernabéu. Real Madrid looked impenetrable defensively but, the excellent Mesut Ozil apart, lacked fluidity and creativity in attack. Meanwhile, Cristiano Ronaldo's obsession with shooting from everywhere and anywhere is getting out of hand. They had ten shots on Saturday night. Having drawn their first match 0-0 and taken until the 48th minute to get the only goal on Saturday night, Madrid have now – in goalscoring terms – officially made their worst ever start to a season. Ricardo Carvalho got the goal on a break away from an Osasuna attack. Everything's fine though: Madrid's assembly was yesterday and Florentino Pérez has made three promises - to put a roof on the Bernabéu, to build a Real Madrid theme park, and too win the club's 10th European Cup. Promises this column could swear it has heard somewhere before.
• There might not have been much "good" football but sometimes madness is just as much fun – times like Athletic versus Atlético, an intense, passionate and occasionally violent game. San Mamés is a proper stadium. Unlike certain other stadiums you could mention. A superb first from Forlán and a late second by Tiago means that Atlético stay top of the table. And on Sunday they play their easiest match of the season: against Barcelona at the Calderón. The signing of Diego Godín is exactly what Atlético needed. Keep an eye out for Athletic's left back Jon Aurtenetxe, by the way: they look like he's going to be very, very good.
• Two matches, two 4-1 defeats. And even Arizmendi scored against them. Levante look doomed already.
• Pennant watch. Eh? Oh. Mind you, it's not as if their former side are up to much without him. Málaga's owner, Sheik Al-Thani, offered their players €6,000 each to beat Zaragoza. They had scored five in 34 minutes. When Leo Franco finally saved a shot at the sixth time of asking, Zaragoza's fans gave them a standing ovation. But things did actually get better. You wondered if the sheik then made the same offer to their opponents, just to liven things up a bit. Alas, Zaragoza could only get three.
• Results: Barcelona 0–2 Herculés, Valencia 1–0 Racing, Real Madrid 1–0 Osasuna, Athletic 1–2 Atlético, Zaragoza 3–5 Málaga, Getafe 4-1 Levante, Villarreal 4–0 Espanyol, Sevilla 0–0 Deportivo, Almería – Real Sociedad, tonight.
The Pirate Bay is still having difficulty keeping the ship afloat. After a curious login problem redirected users to the wrong accounts this weekend, the upload functionality now appears to be broken. As a result, no new files have been added to the site for half a day.
More than a month has passed since The Pirate Bay returned online, but the notorious torrent site continues to face problems.
Aside from a persistent hosting whac-a-mole the site is also dealing with failing features.
For example, a few days ago several users were surprised to see that they were being redirected to other user's accounts after logging in.
Several users panicked fearing that their accounts had been hijacked or breached, but luckily the users were only redirected. They didn't actually gain access to the accounts of others.
Today another issue popped up, one that's blocking new content from being added to the site. Starting roughly 12 hours ago the The Pirate Bay's upload functionality broke, displaying a “500 Internal Server Error” instead.
The upload problem appears to be global as no new files have been added to the site since. The most recent upload listed on The Pirate Bay is from 5:15 CET.
It's not clear what's causing the upload issue. It appears to be a misconfiguration or related technical error, possibly the result of a recent move to a new hosting company.
TorrentFreak reached out to The Pirate Bay's admin and we will update this article if we hear back. For the time being Pirate Bay users will have to do without fresh uploads.
Update March 3: Uploads started working again, but it's going up and down.
I love Mega Man, I really do. The original series is still one of my favourite gaming series of all time. When Capcom brought the old style back for Mega Man 9 and 10 I was overjoyed. It was everything I could ever have wanted.
Sadly, Capcom no longer seems to love the little blue bomber, and the chances of us ever getting Mega Man 11 or even a Mega Man X 9 are slim to none. Luckily for us though Bertil Hörberg still loves Mega Man as well, so much so that they went ahead and created a game inspired by the classic franchise.
Gunman Clive was originally a smartphone game, but the game really suffered from a lack of a proper control input. The Nintendo 3DS release not only rectifies the control issue but makes the unique art style come alive in 3D.
Mega Man is not the only influence on Gunman Clive, but it also borrows from Super Mario Bros 2 – the western, good version – this comes in the form of Ms. Johnson, a second playable character who can float whilst jumping like Princess Peach. Adding this character changes the way the game plays a little making a second playthrough essential fun.
What Bertil Hörberg has achieved here is one of the best run and gun platformers in the last twenty years, and all for the princely sum of £1.99!
If the Nintendo eShop is going to live a long and healthy life, it needs to continue to have this sort of quality at that sort of price on a consistent basis.
Hey Backers!
Randy here, these updates keep getting longer as staff get more things ready.
This time around we've got a translation status update, we're announcing we're translating 1980 anyway, showing off a GORGEOUS tapestry design, and creating a new item for a new $225 tier and add-ons.
We're working ourselves around the clock for this campaign, and we've got another big one coming soon. Hint: music related.
“A Little Iris” Translation Completed, Editing Started.
I'm happy to announce that I've completed the initial translation for Narcissu: A Little Iris and editing for that chapter has started. Himeko's Epilogue editing is done, and is currently undergoing revisions before we start integrating it into the game engine for testing.
So far we seem to be keeping pace with our aggressive schedule. It's an intense scramble, but we're doing our best! We are 100% willing to take a short delay to make sure things are proper quality. We're moving quickly, but not rushing blindly. We'll keep everyone updated as things progress.
“1980” Short for Everyone!
So we've been thinking of ways to give all our backers more value, and I've decided that I can contribute even more by translating more interesting content. I'll be handling translation of the short story by Tomo Kataoka “1980”. It will most likely be inserted as a bonus section in one of the games, we haven't decided which yet, so everyone will be able to read it.
OMG This tapestry art is gorgeous.
Fresh from the digital pen of GotoP is this amazing piece of artwork that we'll be using for the tapestry reward.
Currently we're not able to include the tapestry as an add-on because on top of the high cost of production, the shipping charges are very high. Long narrow things do not mix well with flat small-ish rectangle things for shipping.
However, if you guys really really want it and let us know in the comments. We'll consider opening it up, but expect the price to be very high, like in the rough ballpark of $60-100 when all is said and done.
New Tier - Tenugui at $225
Thanks to everyone who voted for their preferred new tier item in the previous update. It had been a close battle between the tenugui towel and the tote bag, and the tenugui won out by a hair, so it's become a full tier at $225.. The $225 will include everything from the $180 tier, plus the tenugui towel.
All reward tiers of $225 (meaning: $280, $350, $1000, $1800) will also receive one tenugui with their rewards also. Because we can't modify tiers once people have signed up for them we can't update the text, but rest assured that those tiers will receive one.
Tote bag fans, we're considering making it a stand-alone add-on that's not attached to any tier around the $25ish range, if this is something you guys want, let us know!
Tenugui Add-on
The Tenugui will also be available as an add-on for $30 for those who want it separately. The same rules for shipping fees apply ($1,20,30,60 reward tiers will need to include a one-time $15 shipping charge if they choose to have any number of add-ons. All other reward tiers have shipping included.)
We've got less than 2 weeks to go, but we're not done yet.
Expect another update sometime next week.
Wages, incomes and wealth in most countries have become more unequally distributed in recent decades. Most of us understand that this is politically dangerous. There is much less unanimity regarding how national governments should go about addressing this. I argue here that one key source of growing inequality is a softening of the demand for labor and that this changes policy debates significantly.
The connections between soft labor demand and inequality are clear. First, labor's share in many countries' national incomes has been shrinking since at least the 1980s. Second, in some developed economies, median real wages have stagnated despite economic growth. And those who derive their income predominantly from capital tend to be richer than those who get theirs from labor. Both trends increase inequality.
To better understand how to deal with softening demand for people, we must understand its causes and structure. In which economies and sectors has labor demand gone soft?
Let's begin with economies. Labor demand has softened in the West partly because poorer countries have built rival industrial capacities of their own. But labor-saving technological change (automation) probably plays an even bigger role in these economies. In developing countries, workers are being squeezed out of agriculture, but countries that grow faster (e.g., China, India and Vietnam) still find compensating increases in labor demand in other sectors. However, technology-driven trends in developed-country labor markets do tend to be replicated eventually. When this happens, the slowdown in Western labor demand could become a global phenomenon. There are already signs of it in the high rates of youth unemployment around the world.
Next, consider sectors. Perhaps surprisingly, globalization seems to have led to softer labor demand in internationally tradable sectors of the economy. Employment in most developing countries is shifting rapidly out of agriculture and manufacturing, the two most tradable sectors, and into mostly non-tradable services. Trends in developed economies are similar, except that there are already very few jobs in agriculture. It has been estimated that 98 percent of net U.S. job creation between 1990 and 2008 occurred in non-tradable sectors of the economy. This matters because the second thing that globalization seems to have done is to make jobs producing tradable goods and services much more footloose. When wages rise, the jobs move. This undercuts countries' ability to combat inequality by raising mandated wages, or introducing other pro-labor policies in tradable sectors. The tradeoff between jobs and wages should be less pronounced in non-tradable sectors.
Finally, for whom has demand gone soft? Most obviously, for less educated workers. Globally, the wages of workers with higher education have risen relative to those of high school graduates. However, in some highly-educated countries (e.g. the U.K. and U.S.), this college premium has increased more because high school graduates' wages have fallen than because college graduates' wages have risen. Certainly, real wages for college graduates in these countries are growing more slowly than student debts. Meanwhile, in many developing economies, the returns to secondary education have declined as governments increased access to it. Beyond a point, more debt-financed higher education is not an antidote to inequality.
"As demand for labor decreases, we may need a guaranteed minimum income for all people, regardless of employment status."
Given these structural roots to inequality, what types of policies make sense? Solutions will have to be context-appropriate. However, to be effective and politically sustainable, they will require the support of those they benefit directly, and of those who fund them or think they might. In other words, they will need to be compromise solutions that appeal to left and right alike by achieving the most redistribution for the least bureaucracy and inefficiency. In that spirit, here are five ideas that might be useful for combating inequality in a world of softening labor demand.
1. Shift the tax burden off labor.
Rule one of sensible taxation is to tax most the things we need least, and to tax least those we need most. We need more jobs and fewer carbon emissions. Reducing labor income taxes while making up the lost revenue through large carbon taxes is a no-brainer. Some will complain that this is regressive and that carbon taxes are job killers. However, if cuts in labor income taxes do spur labor demand, this need not be the case. Rule two is to devise taxes that are unlikely to alter our behavior very much (unless it is bad behavior). Inheritance taxes, while not perfect, are much better than the labor income taxes they could replace in this regard. Similarly, higher capital gains taxes would probably cost fewer jobs than labor income taxes currently do, especially in countries where capital gains rates are zero.
2. Design policies that can augment incomes when many people don't have stable jobs.
Time-bound unemployment insurance becomes increasingly unwieldy as employment becomes a fluid proposition. A negative income tax or guaranteed income would offer all persons, regardless of their income or employment status, a transfer payment. Those whose tax liabilities are less than this payment would receive a tax rebate check, while those whose liabilities were more than this payment would pay their taxes net of the transfer. The beauty of such a system is that it often requires no additional bureaucracy, and it only reduces recipients' incentives to work for a living insofar as it reduces desperation (which is exactly its purpose) and does so equally for all citizens. It has long been politically popular -- Milton Friedman promoted it and Martin Luther King Jr. endorsed some version of it. And, it should work best in societies where other safety nets are the least developed -- precisely the places where soft labor demand exacts the greatest toll.
3. Redirect efforts to protect working conditions and wages at non-tradable sectors.
Protections for household servants, security guards, cleaners, gardeners and elevator operators should cost fewer jobs than protections for factory workers, whose jobs can now be off-shored. These non-tradable services will usually be demanded even at higher prices. Employees in these occupations are also amongst those most severely affected by stagnant wages and temporary employment. One can already see efforts to protect labor shifting to non-traded sectors, such as U.S. fast food workers attempting to unionize and push for higher minimum wages.
4. Make competition policy more robust.
A growing number of the world's rich, from bankers to real-estate moguls to mobile phone magnates, derive their wealth from controlling markets for goods, services and assets. Better competition policy becomes important as markets grow and cornering them becomes more lucrative. It also usually becomes more politically sellable as the numbers of consumers and smaller businesses hurt by anti-competitive practices grow.
5. Think about education policy differently.
As the stakes in the job lottery grow, priorities for education policy shift. Churning out more graduates often will not solve the unemployment problem, as even fast-growing economies like India and China are failing to generate enough jobs for all their graduates. Pursuing equality of opportunity and restoring the social contract will come to be more central objectives of education policy. Exactly what that entails and the role of the private sector in educational delivery will vary across societies, but controls on college costs, scholarships and dramatically enhancing the quality of basic education received by poorer children will clearly be important.
None of these policy suggestions are novel, and all have downsides. Recognizing that inequality has structural roots in low-labor demand does not necessarily change the menu of policy options to consider. It alters the tradeoffs between these options. Clearly, these tradeoffs are changing.
According to their State of the Union address, United States President Barack Obama has solved the Russia problem. Their brief passage on the subject shows he's either blind to the dangers of the deteriorating relationship between Moscow and the West or merely too quick to take credit for a victory that is not even on the horizon.
Here's what Obama had to say about the biggest threat to European stability since the fall of the Berlin wall 25 years ago:
“We're upholding the principle that bigger nations can't bully the small — by opposing Russian aggression, supporting Ukraine's democracy and reassuring our NATO allies. Last year, as we were doing the hard work of imposing sanctions along with our allies, some suggested that Mr. Putin's aggression was a masterful display of strategy and strength. Well, today, it is America that stands strong and united with our allies, while Russia is isolated, with its economy in tatters. That's how America leads — not with bluster, but with persistent, steady resolve.”
Every one of these sentences is, to put it mildly, a stretch.
The U.S. has indeed disapproved of Russian aggression in Ukraine, and loudly enough for everyone to hear. But that doesn't mean it has supported Ukraine's democracy.
Ukraine has long asked the West for help in tracking down the money and assets amassed by its former corrupt rulers. Last year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Treasury even set up a task force to assist that effort. But nothing has been heard since. In the meantime, Vice-President Joe Biden's son Hunter has been hired as the top lawyer for Burisma, Ukraine's biggest independent natural gas producer, which is owned by former ecology minister Mykolai Zlochevsky, whom Ukrainian prosecutors seek for corruption-related crimes. Biden Senior takes regular trips to Kiev to talk up democracy and reforms and to condemn Russia, while their son's boss is probably hiding out in Moscow like most other close allies of former president Viktor Yanukovych.
[np_storybar title=”Putin sends New Year's message to Obama, says Russia just wants a little respect” link=”http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/12/31/putin-sends-new-years-message-to-obama-says-russia-just-wants-a-little-respect/”%5DMOSCOW — Russian President Vladimir Putin has said in a New Year's message to U.S. President Barack Obama that Moscow is looking for equality in bilateral relations next year.
The Kremlin on Wednesday published several dozen New Year's messages addressed to heads of states and international organizations such as the Olympic Committee and FIFA.
Putin reminded Obama of the upcoming 70th anniversary of the allied victory in World War II and said that it should serve as a reminder of “the responsibility that Russia and the United States bear for maintaining peace and international stability.” Moscow is anxious for the relations to advance but only as long as there is “equality and mutual respect.”

The U.S. government has also offered financial help for Ukrainian democracy — $1 billion in loan guarantees last year and $1 billion in the first half of this year (and perhaps another billion at some later date). But it's a tiny fraction of the $15 billion shortfall Ukraine faces this year, and that's assuming the International Monetary Fund continues disbursing its $17 billion aid package as planned. The European Union has committed more funds to Ukraine: This year alone, Brussels has promised 1.8 billion euros ($2.1 billion) in loan guarantees, while Germany kicked in 500 million euros on its own.
As for reassurance to NATO allies, the U.S. has told the Baltic states that NATO would come to their rescue in the event of Russian aggression. Obama even travelled to Tallinn, Estonia, where they promised that the U.S. will defend the small countries' territorial integrity. The Balts don't seem particularly reassured, however. Lithuania has recently put out an emergency response manual on what citizens should do if Russia invades, which includes advice on what to do if foreign soldiers show up at your home and how to organize civil disobedience.
Obama's description of sanctions as “hard work” on the part of the U.S. is laughable. In the first 11 months of 2014, U.S. exports to Russia actually increased to $10.22 billion from $10.18 billion from the same period the previous year. U.S. imports from Russia decreased to $21.97 billion from $25.49 billion, a change of just $3.5 billion. America's European partners have suffered all the pain. In the first eight months of 2014, they lost $8.5 billion in exports to Russia and $7.5 billion in imports from Russia, and that was before the more serious sanctions hit.
Whether the sanctions have worked is arguable. They certainly angered Russian President Vladimir Putin and made them dole out ever more generous government support to their cronies' businesses. (One of the insiders, Arkady Rotenberg, will now build a $3.5 billion bridge from Russia to occupied Crimea.) And sanctions have made it all but impossible for Russian entities to borrow in the West, causing Russia's external debt to shrink to $599.5 billion from $728.9 billion at the beginning of last year. In the medium term, this might just make Russia more resilient to external shocks.
Yet sanctions have also united Russians around Putin, whose approval rating is still above 80%. At this point, 57% of Russians believe their country should ignore Western criticism, according to a Levada Center poll taken in late December, up from 38% in 2007. The share of those who believe the West is hostile toward Russia has increased to 43%, from 24% in 2007.
The sanctions certainly have not ripped the Russian economy to “tatters.” The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development says the Russian economy may shrink by 5% in 2015, but according to Piroska Nagy, EBRD's director of country strategy and policy, “The single most important factor here is the huge drop in oil.” The U.S. has caused the oil-price drop only indirectly, in that its shale-oil producers are the target of Saudi Arabia's price war. Russia's losses are collateral damage.
As for Russia's isolation, vodka is flowing at Russian state company parties at the World Economic Forum in Davos. The forum's founder, Klaus Schwab, made a rare appearance at one to tell their “Russian friends” they were welcome in Davos. Some former Western partners will probably shun the 73-strong Russian delegation, but “isolation” is certainly not what it's experiencing at the posh Swiss resort.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, however, won't be seen there frowning at Russian excess. They had to fly home ahead of schedule, because fighting in eastern Ukraine has resumed in earnest, and their government says Russian troops are involved. When a cessation of hostilities was discussed in Berlin this week, no U.S. representative was there; the foreign ministers of Germany and France mediated between their Russian and Ukrainian colleagues. The search for a diplomatic solution, like the economic hardship, has fallen to America's European allies. Despite U.S. willingness to let Russia get away with its Crimea land grab if it steps back from eastern Ukraine — hardly a strong defence of Ukraine's territorial integrity — all U.S. diplomatic efforts have failed.
“That's how America leads,” Obama said proudly. It's more comforting to think he's faking that pride than to imagine they really doesn't understand how ineffective the U.S. has been in Ukraine. The president would have done better not to talk about Russia and Ukraine at all.

IF This Then That, or IFTTT for short, lets you automate the way products and services interact with one another. Want to receive an email every time your camera uploads an image to Dropbox? Go right ahead. Want to adjust the thermostat when your car nears the home? You can do that too.
Now Sony and IFTTT have worked together to produce a new channel using the Lifelog API. The channel lets you integrate the activity tracking you've done from a SmartBand or the Sony app with other services to accomplish all sorts of things. Some of the examples provided include posting a Facebook status every time you take a certain amount of steps, automatically sharing calories burned to Google Drive, and receiving an email summary of your daily Lifelog activity.
Sony is working on the second iteration of its SmartBand activity tracker, which will contain a heart rate sensor this time around. But you don't need to wait around for that piece of hardware to get started with the IFTTT channel, nor do you even need a Sony-specific device. The Lifelog Android app plays along with hardware from other manufacturers.

More Americans died of drug overdoses in 2016 than died in the entirety of the Vietnam War — the result of the US's opioid epidemic.
That's one takeaway from a new report by Josh Katz for the New York Times, based on preliminary data estimating how many Americans died of drug overdoses last year.
The official, more precise numbers will be available later in 2017 — once the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) finishes tabulating and verifying reports from across the US.
In the meantime, the Times contacted local and state agencies across the US to come up with a rough estimate. It calculated that 59,000 to 65,000 people died of overdoses last year, with a harder, but likely imprecise, number of 62,497.
In comparison, more than 58,000 US soldiers died in the entire Vietnam War, nearly 55,000 Americans died of car crashes at the peak of such deaths in 1972, more than 43,000 died due to HIV/AIDS during that epidemic's peak in 1995, and nearly 40,000 died of guns during the peak of those deaths in 1993.
The Times can't specify how many of the overdose deaths were caused by opioids, much less what kind of opioid — painkillers, heroin, or fentanyl — was behind the deaths. But based on the past few years' trends and on-the-ground reports, most of the overdose deaths were likely linked to opioids and an increasing amount were linked to fentanyl.
The total, if it holds true, would surpass 2015's record for most recorded drug overdose deaths in US history. Back then, more than 52,000 deaths were linked to overdoses. The Times estimates there was a 19 percent increase between 2015 and 2016 alone, which would be the largest known increase in drug overdose deaths for any single year yet.
Although it's hard to say for certain, the Times suggested “the problem has continued to worsen in 2017.”
In short, the opioid epidemic was already the deadliest in American history in 2015. And it got much deadlier in 2016 — and is likely even worse so far in 2017.
The opioid epidemic, explained
This latest drug epidemic is not solely about illegal drugs. It began, in fact, with a legal drug.
Back in the 1990s, doctors were persuaded to treat pain as a serious medical issue. There's a good reason for that: About 100 million US adults suffer from chronic pain, according to a 2011 report from the Institute of Medicine.
Pharmaceutical companies took advantage of this concern. Through a big marketing campaign, they got doctors to prescribe products like OxyContin and Percocet in droves — even though the evidence for opioids treating long-term, chronic pain is very weak (despite their effectiveness for short-term, acute pain), while the evidence that opioids cause harm in the long term is very strong.
So painkillers proliferated, landing in the hands of not just patients but also teens rummaging through their parents' medicine cabinets, other family members and friends of patients, and the black market.
As a result, opioid overdose deaths trended up — sometimes involving opioids alone, other times involving drugs like alcohol and benzodiazepines (typically prescribed to relieve anxiety). By 2015, opioid overdose deaths totaled more than 33,000 — close to two-thirds of all drug overdose deaths.
Seeing the rise in opioid misuse and deaths, officials have cracked down on prescriptions painkillers. Law enforcement, for instance, threatened doctors with incarceration and the loss of their medical licenses if they prescribed the drugs unscrupulously.
Ideally, doctors should still be able to get painkillers to patients who truly need them — after, for example, evaluating whether the patient has a history of drug addiction. But doctors, who weren't conducting even such basic checks, are now being told to give more thought to their prescriptions.
Yet many people who lost access to painkillers are still addicted. So some who could no longer obtain prescribed painkillers turned to cheaper, more potent opioids: heroin and fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that's often manufactured illegally for non-medical uses.
Not all painkiller users went this way, and not all opioid users started with painkillers. But statistics suggest many did: A 2014 study in JAMA Psychiatry found many painkiller users were moving on to heroin, and a 2015 analysis by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that people who are addicted to prescription painkillers are 40 times more likely to be addicted to heroin.
So other types of opioid overdoses, excluding painkillers, also rose.
That doesn't mean cracking down on painkillers was a mistake. It appeared to slow the rise in painkiller deaths, and it may have prevented doctors from prescribing the drugs to new generations of people with drug use disorders.
But the likely solution is to get opioid users into treatment. According to a 2016 report by the surgeon general, just 10 percent of Americans with a drug use disorder obtain specialty treatment. The report found that the low rate was largely explained by a shortage of treatment options.
So federal and state officials have pushed for more treatment funding, including medication-assisted treatment like methadone and buprenorphine.
Some states, like Louisiana and Indiana, have taken a “tough on crime” approach that focuses on incarcerating drug traffickers. But the incarceration approach has been around for decades — and it hasn't stopped massive drug epidemics like the current crisis.
Site updates
We've made a few small changes to the site in regards to the appearance, layout, and functionality. This is just something we have to do from time to time to keep things interesting! Hopefully these changes aren't too objectionable-- it is a work in progress!
The most obvious site change is the removal of the ads and fund-o-meter. The fund-o-meter is dead! Long live the fund-o-meter! Well, not really, but we did move it off to a less-obtrusive sidebox. We still
Among the functional changes, users can now self-tag and self-publish their games and resources without relying on the moderation team for approval. This is self-explanatory within the hub editor. For listing a game, the options are "published", "unpublished/fangame", and "private". Published games are prioritized in search over unpublished ones, and private ones won't be displayed to outside users on the search, game listings, or author page. FYI, the primary reason for this special "unpublished" status is that Fangames are such a popular genre and would dwarf out the original game listings if promoted in the same space; so please abide by this "honor code"-- it will have no real bearing on your results, and any games found abusing this will be delisted.
Games and resources now use (roughly) the same popularity algorithm between the site and pager, and you can search through both published and unpublished works. We have used some heuristics to automatically transfer the publication status between the old system and new-- all previously "listed" games will be "published" now, and most active (played or downloadable) games will be "unpublished"; the remainder will be "private", but this can be overriden by the author if desired.
The game hub pages now have an inline box for usage of the webclient, when such compatible servers are hosted. Eventually, we expect this to be _the_ way to play multiplayer BYOND games, but for now they are the minority. As such, this featured is labeled as a "beta" and can be toggled off.
Finally, users now have the option to deactivate their account (accessible via the account settings). This makes the profile inaccessible and hides the account from all fan and friend lists. The email is required to re-activate the account, which will reinstate all of the information. Accounts with over two years inactivity have been, and will continue to be automatically deactivated. Eventually we may recycle some of the truly inactive accounts (that is, those without any site activity at all) so that users may pilfer their highly sought after names!
Software updates
At this point, we are going to go full-throttle to stabilize the webclient so that users can start to use it for production code. We've been alerted to a number of bugs and performance issues and it will be the priority from here on out to address these. Once the client is reasonably stable, we will work to provide a standalone option (embedding the client & server together in a cross-platform-supported executable) that can be launched from within the pager or on its own.
While there are many advantages to using a webclient, including more expansive user interfaces and cross-platform support, the most significant one is probably the ability to use it to promote games. There are many gaming networks for more popular than BYOND, and, with the webclient, you should be able to push your games onto any number of them. Or, alternatively, you can go the "self-made" route and embed your game right onto your own website. We hope people get into the mindset of thinking about their games "beyond BYOND". And by integrating subscriptions, you can help us out while helping yourself!
Future plans
Long term, regardless of how BYOND does as a business, we want to ensure that the software lives on. Rest assured to both current and prospective developers: under no scenario will your games be inaccessible with or without BYOND. Should the day come when we close the doors here, we will do everything in our ability to gracefully transfer your BYOND-based user accounts to a system you control. Furthermore, we would fully open-source the software so that people could continue developing it long after we're gone! Open-sourcing is actually something we're eventually planning regardless, since we recognize that there are many capable people here who would like to get under the hood and improve the tools; it's just a bit complicated in our case due to the interconnected nature of the software and hub.
The point is that we recognize the difference between BYOND "the software" and BYOND "the community" and we want people to be able to use the engine to develop their games just as they would any other piece of software, without factoring in the pros and cons of having an attached social network and account system. While we do rely on some aspects of the hub-- specifically, the ads that play when people play games-- we realize that developers here want to completely control their own creations and userbase, and we will do everything we can to make this possible even if it means sacrificing some potential income and traffic. On the flip side, we hope you also recognize that this is a symbiotic relationship, and by using the hub infrastructure here (ads and subscriptions), you benefit BYOND, allowing us to continue to improve the tools over time.
Thanks for the continued support! Hello BYONDers!We've made a few small changes to the site in regards to the appearance, layout, and functionality. This is just something we have to do from time to time to keep things interesting! Hopefully these changes aren't too objectionable-- it is a work in progress!The most obvious site change is the removal of the ads and fund-o-meter. The fund-o-meter is dead! Long live the fund-o-meter! Well, not really, but we did move it off to a less-obtrusive sidebox. We still need your help ! Please consider kicking in any spare change to support a good cause. And to those of you who have contributed in the past, thank you so much! You have enabled us to extend this project far beyond its natural technological lifespan!Among the functional changes, users can now self-tag and self-publish their games and resources without relying on the moderation team for approval. This is self-explanatory within the hub editor. For listing a game, the options are "published", "unpublished/fangame", and "private". Published games are prioritized in search over unpublished ones, and private ones won't be displayed to outside users on the search, game listings, or author page.

Toy Fair Week Continues with the Latest from Gears of War!
This time around, it's something big and something small. Have you SEEN this thing yet???
Behold the Taxi Lancer Replica!
Following on the heels of amazing game replicas like the Portal ASHPD and the Hidden Blade of Ezio Auditore, the Gears of War Judgment Taxi Lancer Prop Replica is making its debut at NY Toy Fair 2013 and yes, it really is that awesome.
Here it is on the shelf:
The Taxi Lancer's got authentic, game-accurate detailing and paint, a removable clip, runs on 3 C batteries and when you squeeze the trigger, it lights up, makes noise and vibrates! Unfortunately, it does not actually shoot fire.
But it's not the only Gears showing at Toy Fair. We're also displaying the upcoming Gears of War 3 3/4″ Action Figures Series 2 and they're not to be missed:
Stay tuned for more all week from NY Toy Fair 2013!

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN: Juan, before we talk about Iraq, you know, the—John Kerry has just made a surprise visit there—your piece in the New York Daily News is about yet another New York Daily News editorial board meeting. A week or two ago, it was with Bernie Sanders. Yesterday, you and the board met with John Kasich.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Yes, Kasich came into the editorial board to—obviously, to discuss their platform and hoping to get the voters of New York to back him, the Republican voters. And I specifically zeroed in, because he's much more—those of us who have seen the debates among the Republicans regard them probably as the most reasonable, the most commonsense of the candidates in their approach. And they come—and they really touted their ability to work with political opponents, their long experience in both the Congress and as a senator of a major—I mean, as a governor of a major state.
But I tried to zero in, in my few questions I was able to ask him, on their role in terms of American labor, because, obviously, in 2011, they pushed through a bill that not only would outlaw strikes by public employees in Ohio, but also would restrict the ability of union members to negotiate over pensions and health insurance. That created a huge stir, backlash in Ohio. Police, firefighters and teachers organized a major referendum, and Kasich was defeated two to one. It was the biggest defeat of their term as governor. So I asked them what he'd learned from that. And they said, “Don't do it again.” But when I then asked him, “Well, would a President Kasich attempt to restrict the union rights of federal employees?” they were a little bit more equivocal. They said, “It would depend on what you're talking about. I wouldn't make any sweeping judgment on that.”
And Kasich also has a pretty checkered history in terms of public education, which they focused on a lot. The charter schools in Ohio are considered the Wild West of charter schools nationwide. There's been all kinds of scandals on charter schools. And just last year, the person they had appointed to be in charge of charter schools had to resign when it was revealed that they were misrepresenting how badly charter schools were performing in the state to—in a federal government application. And Kasich had—did say that he's fixed that, that he's passed new laws to try to raise standards for charter schools in their state. But the wife of that disgraced official who resigned, who was Kasich's chief of staff, is now running their presidential campaign, so that, really, in comparison to Trump and to Cruz, Kasich looks pretty good, but that's only in comparison to the other Republican candidates who are running right now.
AMY GOODMAN: I know you don't write the headline, but would you say it's accurate? “'Moderate' John Kasich is still dangerously conservative”?
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Yeah, I didn't write that headline, but that's pretty much what the column talks about, yes.
AMY GOODMAN: Well, I'm headed to Columbus, Ohio, today, to John Kasich's hometown, speaking at the Ohio State University, and hope to see folks there. And, of course, we'll continue to cover the presidential race, as we travel across the country in our 100-city tour beginning today. This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.
Liquor v. family time, the mother who lost four kids to gun violence, the cyber safe crackers, the fix is in, and fun things to do in the cold.
1) LIQUOR VS. FAMILY TIME
The Sunday liquor store sales bill is back at the Capitol where it died last year and probably will again unless the public makes a racket, the bill's sponsor says.
“The liquor stores are the ones against this,” Sen. Roger Reinert tells the Duluth News Tribune. “They want a day off.”
Reinert says 80 percent of Minnesotans want to be able to buy booze on Sunday.
“Think of the families,” Rep. Bob Gunther, R-Fairmont said during floor debate last year. “If someone wants to drink, they can go Saturdays to buy their liquor and drink it at home with their family. My dad drank too much. My brother probably was an alcoholic. I don't think they ever spent a Sunday drinking; they spent it with their family. Let the families have a day together. ”
Vote early and often… then discuss
Do you favor Sunday liquor sales?
2) FAMILY OF THE GUN
While President Obama was in Minneapolis yesterday to push their gun proposals before a sympathetic crowd, Shirley Chambers of Chicago was burying their fourth child. Them last remaining son, Ronnie, was killed a weekend ago.
In 1995, their then-18-year-old-son was killed by a high school classmate. In 2000, LaToya, 15, was shot in the head by a 13-year-old boy at the Cabrini-Green housing complex. A few months later, 23-year-old Jerome died almost at the same spot.
In an interview with the Chicago Tribune then, Ms. Chambers said their son expected to die violently.
“He'd said he'd be [dead] too soon, that now they wouldn't have to worry about people hurting them and the police chasing him,” they said. “He said they couldn't wait to get to heaven with Carlos, where it would be beautiful.”
They and their sister, Nancy, were guests on WBEZ's Afternoon Shift program.

3) THE CYBER SAFE CRACKERS
Fox 9 has revealed the ease with which crooks are reaching into accounts, lifting the money that's there, and (mostly) getting away with it. In Edina, it reports, they got a million dollars.
It's a frightening tale of how otherwise honest people around here can be duped into being part of the heist:
FOX 9 Investigator Jeff Baillon spoke with two men who unwittingly got mixed up with cyber crooks. Each had been out of work and posted a resume on a popular job search website, and both eventually got a phone call and offer from what sounded like a legitimate business. They jumped at the chance. To maintain the ruse, the thieves told their new hires the company is expanding and needs someone to scope out potential office locations, write up proposals and open a bank account. The mules never know the money flowing into the account is stolen. “Those mules are instructed to go down to their bank to pull the money out in cash and they'll do that, $5-10,000 to pull out in cash,” Krebs explained. “Then, they are instructed to wire it overseas via Western Union and money gram.”
(h/t: Dan Murphy)
4) THE FIX IS IN
Gambling is destroying sport, the BBC declares today, a day after a report that hundreds of soccer matches were fixed.
There are about 20 to 30 fixers who travel the world fixing sporting events. They regard themselves as “brokers” rather than fixers. They form alliances with local criminals, who in turn are able to form connections with corrupt players, referees and team officials. The Asian criminals deal with fixing the gambling market by placing bets in such a way that no-one suspects the games are fixed. In this way, there is a network of corruption that stretches quite literally around the world. Police say gang members around the world were tasked with maintaining contacts with corrupt players and officials. Laszlo Angeli, a Hungarian prosecutor, gave an example of how it worked: “The Hungarian member, who was immediately below the Singapore head, was in touch with Hungarian referees who could then attempt to swing matches at which they officiated around the world. Accomplices would then place bets on the internet or by phone with bookmakers in Asia, where bets that would be illegal in Europe were accepted.”
Related gambling: Super Bowl gambling in Nevada reached almost $100 million, Reuters reports. That's a record.
5) IT'S SO COLD….
Nick Ziegler specializes in showing Minnesota in all of its cold glory with their “Minnesota Cold” series. Last year, they didn't get to produce very many of them because it was too warm. This year, he's cranking them out.
Oh, and winter is over. The downtown Saint Paul skating rink is no more.

Chemical peels are divided into three groups.
Alpha Hydroxy Acids - Glycolic Acid , Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Citric Acid, Malic Acid etc
Beta Hydroxy Acids - Salicylic Acid
Poly Hydroxy Acids - Lactobionic Acid, Gluconolactone Acid
Sr-Skincare Biphasic peels combine all the benefits of alpha and hydroxy acids by blending Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, and Salicylic Acid (via Natural Willowbark Extract) into one peel solution. Alpha hydroxy acids provide similar benefits and work in the same ways but they do have individual and specific benefits.
Salicylic Acid as a beta hydroxy acid works in a slightly different way to an alpha hydroxy acid by being able to operate within the follicles as well as providing a surface peeling action. By combining all these acids into one we are able to provide you with a well rounded peel solution that, whilst operating primarily as a surface exfoliator, also provides a range of additional benefits.
Please note that each peel is composed of equal parts of each consitutuent acid.
Benefits of this chemical peel:
Exfoliates dead skin cells from the surface leaving the skin softer, smoother, and brighter.
Encourages skin cell turnover and boosts collagen production.
Can improve hyperpigmentation and reduce blemishes.
Can help reduce the depth of fine lines and wrinkles
Can help remove the impurities and congestion that leads to acne breakouts from the pores
In this kit:
30ml Peel Solution (as per choice)
50ml Neutralising Gel
10 Cotton Pads
Instruction Leaflet
Warning! As this product contains salicylic acid the same caveats for standard salicylic solutions should be acknowledged
Salicylic acid peels are not recommended for use during pregnancy or if lactating.
Do not use on broken skin or areas affected by eczema, psoriasis or dermatitis.
Do not use salicylic acid if you have an intolerance to aspirin
Not to be used by those with diabetes Mellitus or Reynaud's disease
Before using this product for the first time please conduct a patch test. Simply dab a small amount of the solution on an unobtrusive, small area of skin - ( a 10p sized area just behind the ear is ideal). Check the area 24 hours later to ensure that your skin is not unduly inflamed or reddened.If all is fine then apply the peel to your complexion as instructed.
Ingredients:
Peel: Water, Willowbark Extract, Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Glycerine, Sodium Hydroxide
Neutraliser Gel: Water, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Panthenol, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide
Last week, the federal Liberals quickly shot down a proposal from their own economic advisory council that the retirement age should be raised as high as 70.
As the advisers noted, an age hike is a virtual necessity in a Canada with an “ageing society and a considerably longer life expectancy than we had just a few decades ago.”
But economic reality or not, reversing the Conservatives' age hike from 65 to 67 was a key Liberal election promise. And with old folks still voting in record numbers, the political motivations here seem clear.
Fortunately, there's an easy way out of this conundrum: more drinking, more smoking, fewer seatbelts and maybe toss in a handful of thresher accidents.
The modern incarnation of Old Age Security was first enacted in 1951. The Canada Pension Plan followed in 1965.
Both programs were born in an age when tobacco smoke stained the walls of public buildings, when regular day drinking was a key facet of professional life and when a minor fender bender could still send a steering wheel column through your sternum.
With cardiovascular medicine still in its infancy, it was also relatively routine that a man would retire from the insurance business, get their gold watch and be dead from a heart attack before the next Olympics.
In the 1960s, when Canadians read an obituary about a former colleague who dropped dead at 67, it wasn't necessary to blurt out “so young!”
On the May 11, 1965 death announcements page of the Edmonton Journal, there is a 56 year old, a 48 year old, a 59 year old, a 62 year old, a 70 year old, two 73 year olds, two 76 year olds and a 72 year old.
The oldest person on the page is Mr. George Wilson, 88, who appears to have outlived so many contemporaries that the only next-of-kin mentioned are grandchildren.
In short, the MPs in plaid suits and Old Spice who designed the CPP in 1965 could remain relatively confident that only a token few would receive more than a few years of CPP cheques.
But then an unexpected thing happened: Canadians stopped remembering to die early.
Cars started being equipped with seatbelts and airbags. People started quitting smoking. Most importantly, heart medicine accelerated by leaps and bounds: Vascular stenting, angioplasty and boatloads of new medications all ensured that thousands of former death sentences are now mere health speedbumps.
Suddenly, not only were seniors living longer, but whole armies of Canadians were surviving beyond their 65th birthday.
Life expectancy has surged 10 years since the 1960s. But even when factoring out child mortality, the average under-75 Canadian has gained four more years of life since 1981.
In a mere 15-year period between 1990 and 2005, the average age of death rose by more than three years.
Bingo halls and A&Ws across the country now echo with the voices of happy, healthy people who — only a generation ago — would have long ago become brass names on a park bench.
In the last census, centenarians were found to be Canada's fastest growing age group. By 2026 Canada is projected to be home to more than 400,000 people in their 90s. That's about as many nonagenarians as Halifax, the 13th largest metropolitan area in Canada.
The Edmonton Journal obituaries page nowadays will reveal more than a dozen George Wilson types: Dying at 88 is no longer the rarity it once was.
Of the 26 deaths noted in the Edmonton area last Friday, half were in their 80s, five were in their 90s and only three died younger than 65.
Most importantly, quality of life is longer. When John Diefenbaker was prime minister, a 66 year old was a stooped grandfather. As of 2014, the average Canadian can expect to enjoy “full health” (i.e., no chronic health problems) as late as 69 for men and 71 for women.
The number 65 has always been a somewhat arbitrary marker of old age, and is usually attributed to German leader Otto Von Bismarck.
In the 1880s, under pressure by radical reformers, Germany was the world's first country to institute a universal old age pension. The eligibility age started at 70, before lowering to age 65 at the height of the First World War.
And these ages were selected for a very efficient, German reason: They were about on par with German life expectancy. At the time, the average German 30 year old only had 31 to 33 years left to go.
Thus, Imperial Germany got to hold off a rising tide of radical socialism without spending a lot of money.
Sure, the occasional Karl or Augustine would continue pulling a pension into their nineties, but these anomalies were more than cancelled out by the vast numbers of Germans dropping dead in their early 60s.
But alas, Germany has also needed to greet a new era where beer and sausage aren't the killers they once were. The Federal Republic raised their pension age to 67 a decade ago, and the German central bank is now recommending it be raised to 69.
It is understandable that Canadians would want to retain a system in which they have a good chance of living a quarter century of retirement.
Under current conditions, if a Canadian begins working fulltime at age 20, they can know that every year they work will magically buy them roughly five to six months' of RVing and snooker in future.
It's a sweet deal, but it's also an unsustainable pyramid scheme.
As UBC population and public health expert Paul Kershaw told the CBC, “50 years ago when we were setting up our CPP, our OAS, and Medicare, we did so asking workers to pay taxes at rates that assumed that there would be 15 seniors for 100 workers.”
“But now we have close to 25 seniors and soon there will be close to 50.”
A reckoning is inevitable, unless Canada can somehow curb its exploding ranks of healthy, happy retirees.
The mathematical choice before Canada's future seniors is simple: work longer or die younger.
And if the thought of hitting a punch clock at age 67 is too painful, I'm afraid Canadians are going to have to start driving without seatbelts and begin reacquainting themselves with asbestos and lead paint.

Cofagrigus (Japanese: デスカーン Desukarn) is a Ghost-type Pokémon introduced in Generation V.
It evolves from Yamask starting at level 34.
Biology
Cofagrigus is a blue and yellow sarcophagus with red, menacing eyes and four ebony hands that appear to be shadows. A simply designed face is prominent on the "forehead" of the Pokémon. Its real face is covered up by parts that slide out of the way when it is active. White, sharp fangs create a taunting smile and flamboyant patterns veil the coffin. The coffin is said to be made of gold. Ancient legends once told Cofagrigus could eat nearby humans and turn their lifeless bodies into mummies. It lives in tombs and ruins.

Trivia
No other Pokémon has the same Egg Group combination as Cofagrigus and its pre-evolution.
Previously, due to the censor that prevents Pokémon with offensive nicknames being traded on the GTS, an English language Cofagrigus could not be traded without a nickname in Generation V. However, the filter has since been altered to allow Cofagrigus to be traded without a nickname.
Origin
Cofagrigus's design is based on a sarcophagus. It was also most likely based on supposedly cursed Egyptian tombs. Any trespassers in the tombs are said to fall under a "curse" from its owner, which is said to cause illness, serious injury, or death. The hype of cursed tombs was made popular when many people in a team of explorers in 1922, who had opened and entered King Tutankhamun's tomb, began dying after the exploration. Cofagrigus's ability to passively turn other Pokémon into mummies that in turn transform other Pokémon into mummies is very similar to the popular culture depiction of the spread of a "zombie virus" in horror films.
Name origin
Cofagrigus may be a combination of coffin, sarcophagus and egregious. It may also come from grim.
Desukarn may be a combination of death and 棺 kan (coffin).

Promising early results from a clinical trial at the Mayo Clinic out this week suggest that a modified version of the measles virus can be used to target cancer cells and put the condition into remission. Researchers intravenously delivered 10,000 times the typical dosage of measles vaccine to two women, 49- and 65-years-old, who had multiple myeloma, a rare cancer affecting white blood cells in bone marrow. The virus, which was modified to specifically target cancer cells, reduced or eliminated tumors in the two patients. The 49-year-old woman responded particularly well; other than one local relapse that was treated with radiotherapy, their tumors have disappeared and cancer has remained in remission for over six months.
The idea of using viruses to attack cancer isn't a new one — scientists have been studying the technique since the 1950s. However, researchers say that this is the first time they've been able to eliminate cancer in a human subject using the virus through an intravenous injection. The virus was able to target the tumors itself and even treat affected bone marrow. Other similar studies have used direct injection into tumor sites rather than intravenous delivery methods.
"We believe it can become a single-shot cure."
That's part of what has the researchers particularly optimistic about the results. Dr. Stephen J. Russell, the study's lead author, said, "What we're really excited about with this particular approach is that we believe it can become a single-shot cure." Traditional cancer treatments require months of visits to continue battling the cancer cells. One hurdle for the technique, however, is that patients who've built up antibodies — close to 95 percent of the US public has been vaccinated to measles — are not eligible for the treatment. However, myeloma does weaken patients' immune systems, which makes the virus more effective.
Despite promise in the treatment, it's important to note that this is still extremely early. Other promising virus-based cancer treatments have been tested many times in the past but none have advanced far through clinical trials. Incredibly thorough trials with far more patients will be required as these results are far from definitive. Dr. Stephen Russell warned: "We have an enormous amount of work to do to determine if this is generalizable and how to best apply the approach to other cancer patients." They added, "We haven't discovered a cure for cancer here."
Fox Sports has added the English-language rights to 25 games involving Mexico's national team to its arsenal of soccer properties.
Through an agreement that will be announced Wednesday, Fox Sports 1 will televise 25 home games — friendlies and World Cup qualifiers — of the team called El Tri starting this year and continuing until the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Not all the home games will be played in Mexico, however; as part of an agreement with Major League Soccer's marketing arm, Mexico has in recent years played an increasing number of its games in United States cities like Dallas and Los Angeles.
The first game of the new Fox partnership will be a friendly on Feb. 10 against Senegal at Marlins Park in Miami. Two of Mexico's World Cup qualifiers this year, against Canada and Honduras, also are part of the new deal.
Fox acquired the games from Univision Deportes for an undisclosed sum.
For Fox, the contract represents another way to reach Mexican-born and second- and third-generation Mexican-Americans who follow the national team. Since Fox already owns the rights to several other important events featuring Mexico, the deal effectively makes Fox the English-language home of the team for the foreseeable future.
Pod-Canon is an ongoing tribute to the greatest individual comedy-related podcast episodes of all time.
On their first visit to the Cat Ranch to be interviewed for WTF, comedy Anti-Christ Carlos Mencia did a halfway convincing impersonation of a non-deplorable human being. The controversial Mind of Mencia star put on a major charm offensive in an effort to convince Marc Maron that they were not the monster history had made them out to be, but rather a misunderstood and unfairly maligned comedian whose unusual personal habits (he doesn't drink, smoke, or use drugs) and incredible success made them an irresistible target for criticism from comedians who envied him.
Maron proved an accommodating host and the conversation the two men shared was amiable and full of both mild laughter and moments where Mencia seemed to drop their well-honed public persona and reveal themselves as a pathologically ambitious, insecure man driven by fear who was in the process of trying to better understand himself, their place in the world and the enormous tidal wave of resentment they have somehow engendered by telling jokes, in part by going into therapy as a forty-something.
Something clearly didn't sit right with Maron about their first conversation, however, so they decided that a follow-up was in order where Maron would talk to comedians within the hispanic community who had personally experienced Mencia's penchant for purloining the material of their professional colleagues.
For these working comedians, Mencia's professional and personal shortcomings are no mere matter of conjecture or gossip. No, they are concrete facts they've been dealing with for years. The first comedian Maron talks to about Mencia and their sociopathic tendencies is Willie Barcena.
A social worker before making the big leap to full-time standup, Barcena defines themselves in part as a guy who, in order to be able to sleep at night and live with himself, purposefully eschews the kind of lazy racial humor that is at the core of Mencia's personal aesthetic. Barcena wants to make people laugh, but they aspire to do more than that. That is where they are different from Mencia, who comes off as a man whose only desire in life is to make the largest possible audience laugh as intensely as possible.
Normally that would be a winning, even essential quality in a standup comedian. But with Mencia it quickly becomes obvious that for him, making audiences laugh is an addiction that blinds them to everything else. It blinds them to the racist nature of their comedy and to their inveterate hackiness. But more than anything, that pathological need to destroy comedically blinds them to the emotions of the comedians he's coming up with, and whose material they have a record of borrowing without accreditation.
The next comedian Maron speaks to, Steve Trevino, is even more damning. Trevino, who opened for Mencia for years, and wrote for Mind Of Mencia for a season (something that Mencia took as permission for them to use their material, since on a very real level, Trevino did work for Mencia), depicts Mencia with no small measure of empathy as someone with a massive hole where their conscience should be that can only be filled by laughter, power, and fame.
Trevino sees Mencia as a man who almost can't help himself, who is driven to repeatedly transgress the iron-clad rules of comedy (the first of which is “no stealing”) in their mad lust for power, success, and, more than anything, the big, aching, heaving laughter that they need to function. In Trevino's telling, Mencia is both a genius with a photographic memory (which comes in handy when stealing jokes) and mentally ill.
In their most damning accusation, Trevino talks about how Mencia stealing the material of a more respected comedian named Freddy Soto might have played a role in Soto's premature death. Trevino tells Maron that Mencia is so shameless that while Soto's dead body was essentially still warm Mencia was back on stage telling Soto's jokes, again without credit.
Then it is time for Mencia to return and defend themselves against these new/old accusations. From the very start, the tone of Mencia and Maron's conversation is different. The “We're just two old pros talking shop” vibe of the first conversation has been replaced by something tenser and more confrontational.
Maron brings up that Mencia once bumped them at a show, performing for so long that Maron finally just gave up and went home. Maron asks Mencia if they habitually bump people as a power trip and Mencia, to both their credit and discredit, concedes that, yeah, a lot of times when they bump someone it's a sign of dominance, a giant “fuck you” to the considerable segment of the standup community that thinks he's a hack and a joke thief.
Throughout both interviews, Mencia comes off as a fascinating combination of cool calculation and bizarre unselfconsciousness. They own up to bumping Maron partially as a “fuck you” to the notion that Maron occupies a higher comic plane than they do, just because, you know, Maron clearly occupies a higher comic plane than Mencia.
“You think you're better than me? Then look at how much harder your audience laughs at me than it do you!” seems to be the underlying aggression behind many, if not most of Mencia's drop-ins. Mencia tells Maron that the only way for them to work through their intense feelings of frustration and sadness and hurt surrounding the widespread hatred of them is by attacking comedians critical of them by doing drop-ins at their shows and bumping them.
Mencia doesn't seem to realize the ridiculousness of trying to counter-act the widespread perception of them as a bully and thief by behaving like an even bigger bully towards the people making the accusations. Mencia at times tries to win Maron back on their side by talking about their insecurities and internal struggle, and the psychological price they have paid being one of the most vilified and reviled comedians in the history of the medium.
But Maron isn't having any of it. He's far more critical of Mencia this time around and Mencia comes off much worse than they did during the first episode. WTF is not a courtroom and Maron is not a prosecutor but their closing monologue has the vaguely legalistic feel of an attorney's closing argument. It's not a trial, but if it was, motherfucker would clearly be found guilty on multiple counts.
Is Mencia a sociopath, Maron wonders aloud? They don't come down one way or another on the issue but if the question has to be raised, the answer is probably “yes.” Maron is more convinced that the allegations of joke thievery are rooted in truth, even though that theft might have taken the form of unconscious borrowing and shared premises rather than pre-meditated stealing.
This two-part episode offers a fascinatingly deep look into the interlinked subjects of sociopathy and grasping professional ambition. It is the best possible look into the warped, twisted mind of Mencia (although in this case it's not Mencia's comedy that's twisted so much as their sense of personal ethics and accountability), even if the actual television program named Mind Of Mencia comes up only infrequently.
Incidentally, about a year after this podcast was recorded, I had the surreal “honor” of watching Mencia perform repeatedly as the ship comedian on the Kid Rock Chillin' the Most cruise, an experience I wrote about for the extended version of my book about musical fandom, You Don't Know Me But You Don't Like Me.
It was, as you might imagine, absolutely terrible. Mencia lived down to their reputation but what fascinating me was that at the end of their first show, Mencia invited the audience to come back to their concluding show, as they were throwing out all their material and was going to improvise that next set. We were assured that we'd see an entirely different show the second time around.
For no other reason than to call Mencia out on their shit, and also because options are somewhat limited onboard the Kid Rock Chillin' the Most cruise, my wife and I called their bluff and went to that second show and, which was more or less the exact same show as the first, beat for beat, joke for joke. So like Trevino and Barcena, and Maron, for that example, I have my own personal experience with Mencia being a man of low moral character and flagrant dishonesty, but we are hardly unique in that respect, which might help explain why you don't hear too much about Mencia these days, positive or negative.

Labor councillor Simon Higgins says Melbourne should get a permanent celebration of the LGBT community
A Melbourne councillor is suggesting the city get its own rainbow crossing after a row over a seven-color painted street path in Sydney.
The first rainbow crossing was painted across a street in West Hollywood in Los Angeles for Pride month 2012.
Sydney got its own rainbow crossing for Mardi Gras in February and March but a row erupted after the state's road's minister Duncan Gay ordered its overnight removal, following safety concerns.
Now Labor councillor Simon Higgins is pushing for Sydney's cultural rival Melbourne to get it's own rainbow crossing in fashionable Smith Street in Collingwood.
‘The crossings will be a great symbol of the past and ongoing contribution of the LGBTI community to the City of Yarra [inner Melbourne],' said Huggins, Herald Sun reports.
‘It is one of the key civil rights movements of the 20th and 21st century.'
Council officers will now be looking for a suitable location for the rainbow crossing in the city.
Huggins, who runs their own record label and a local music and arts festival, tweeted on 4 June that a friend had been ‘subject to abuse'. In the same tweet they said ‘Rainbow crossing a great reminder to speak out against homophobia'.
2ND UPDATE, 12:53 PM: Guess what? There's already a domestic box office gross out on Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Imax is reporting $6.5M in domestic ticket sales, with pre-sales breaking every Imax record. The film is set to open in about 390 Imax screens in North America. What did Force Awaken beat? We're told that The Dark Knight Rises, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire and The Avengers were in the same $1M reported pre-sales range.
UPDATE, 12:10 PM: Advance tickets sales for Disney's Star Wars: The Force Awakens are blowing up advance ticket records for a number of online retailers. Fandango reported earlier this morning that Star Wars: The Force Awakens is outstripping pre-sales for the first Hunger Games, which holds the company's first day pre-sales record. Now AMC Theaters says that the JJ Abrams' directed film set a single-day advance ticket sales record for the exhibitor, beating the previous record by more than 10X. In less than 12 hours, AMC sold out more than 1,000 shows nationwide.
AMC is continually adding showtime with nearly 4M tickets available for the opening weekend of Dec. 18-20 across different platforms: Imax, 3D, Dolby Cinema at AMC Prime and AMC Dine-In Theatres. Imax alone accounted for 38% of all ticket sales grosses. In Orlando alone where AMC has the exclusive Star Wars opening night event at the Disney Springs 24 theater, the venue sold out 17 showtimes in a matter of hours. The exhib anticipates more of its theaters staying open for 24 hours for Force Awakens on Friday, December 18, but for now it's the Aventura 24 (Miami-Ft. Lauderdale), Bowles Crossing 12 (Denver), AMC Colonial 18 (Atlanta), AMC Empire 25 (NYC), Fresh Meadows 7 (NYC), Gulf Pointe 30 (Houston), Lakewood 12 (Seattle), Levittown 10 (NYC), Palisades 21 (NYC), Schererville 16 (Chicago), Spring 10 (Houston) and the Village Crossing 18 (Chicago).
A Fandango company rep remarked earlier about their results: “This is an extraordinary time for the industry, which experienced unprecedented ticketing demand last night for Star Wars: The Force Awakens. In fact, Fandango traffic surged to 7 times its typical peak levels, propelling Fandango's advance sales for Star Wars to a record-setting first day of pre-sales. For Star Wars, we have already sold 8 times as many tickets as we did on the first day of sales for the previous record holder. Movie theaters are continually adding new show times on Fandango to meet the phenomenal demand. The enthusiasm for this year's most anticipated movie is out of this world and we expect it to continue all the way to its debut on December 18.”
Over at Movietickets.com, Force Awakens comprises 95% of the site's sales since yesterday, producing the site's biggest first day sales of any title. Last night MovieTickets.com saw traffic 3 times higher than the highest peak in the company's 15+ year history. The Force Awakens sales are already 4x greater than advance tickets sold for the last released installment in the franchise, Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith over the same period of time.
Deadline reported last night that Force Awakens movie ticket buyers were having a hard time with Fandango and other pre-sales sites timing out. Technically, per industry sources, Fandango's server did not crash per se, rather industrywide there were intermittent performance challenges. It's what happens when there's a long queue, buying tickets online, quite similar to what will go on with Ticketmaster say when Madonna tickets go on sale in advance.
Erik Lamela has spent the majority of their Tottenham career as the punchline to the jokes of their own Club's fans. Burdened by the weight of their Tottenham record transfer fee they looked more like a new born foal than an Argentinian international on the pitch. Suddenly though, Erik Lamela isn't so funny anymore, but can they become a Premier League star?
As an avid Spurs fan, I have watched Lamela over the past two plus seasons with greater at interest. My emotions have run the gamut with the attacking midfielder. I was elated at their signing, defensive of them during their injured first season and saddened by their efforts last season. Early this year, I'd almost lost hope in their development. Then, something happened.
Perhaps it was their rumored sale to Marseille right up until the Transfer Deadline, maybe it was just the natural progression of their obvious talent, but whatever it was changed the trajectory of their career. Their play went from timid, lost and soft to inventive, optimistic and productive. They began playing at such a high level that even the most optimistic Tottenham fan was forced to rub their eyes in disbelief.
Their last four matches have been outstanding. Whoscored.com has their performances averaging above 8.0 and feature a high of 8.76 in the Spurs 4-1 win over Manchester City. The youngster once criticized for lack of end product even has contributed three goals and an assist over the same stretch. What's more frightening is that by watching them it's easy to see that they have created even more opportunities to score than they have converted. It's not difficult to imagine Lamela having five or six goals instead of just three. There can be no question that their recent form has been at the level of Premier League stardom but their challenge now is to play at that level over the course of an entire season.
Finding a way to perform at a high level for months rather than weeks is what separates nice players from superstars. I have genuine doubts about Lamela's ability to take this step this year. They have several flaws that will require significant work to correct and they must be addressed before they can be called a star. The most notable flaw is that they are still guilty of giving the ball away too frequently.
Even in this brilliant run of form we have seen these errors. Fortunately for they end the Club, they do typically minimize the damage by working to win the ball back. Their work rate to win possession is in fact one of their best attributes. Nonetheless, you don't see stars like Hazard, Mata, Eriksen and Sanchez give the ball away as frequently as Lamela. They must clean this up to reach those heights. It also can lead to problematic fouling that could easily limit their time on the pitch.
Their other large challenge on their road to stardom lies between the lad's ears. You can almost see the gears grinding away in their brain on the pitch at times. They still are caught between two minds all too often when they are involved in the counter attack. It's no coincidence that their best flourishes of late have been when they begin and finishes the break. If they are involved in between the probability of Tottenham success decreases quite quickly.
Erik Lamela is a young player whose progression has finally begun for Tottenham. The frightening thing about them is that even as they are playing at an extremely high level, there is still much to correct in their game. The good news is that their faults are fixable with time and Lamela has shown a willingness to work hard and face adversity already.
They won't become a star in the Premier League this year but I wouldn't bet against them achieving that status with one more year under Mauricio Pochettino's tutelage. Fortunately for Spurs, even if they don't reach stardom this season they can still be a very key cog in their push for a place in the top four.
Gay subtext managed to insinuate itself into the Dynamic Duo's dyad from the very start. DC Comics
Freely adapted from The Caped Crusade: Batman and the Rise of Nerd Culture by Glen Weldon, out now from Simon and Schuster.
Let's get one thing absolutely clear: Robin isn't gay.
Don't let the green Speedo and the pixie boots steer you wrong; Dick Grayson is as straight as uncooked spaghetti. In fact, there have been several Robins over the years, and not one of them has exhibited any trace of same-sex attraction or evinced anything resembling a queer self-identity.
Neither, it feels important to note here at the start, has Batman.
Don't take my word for it. Ask anyone who's written a Batman and Robin comic. Or, you know what, you don't have to: Dollars to donuts they've already been asked that question, and have gone on record asserting the Dynamic Duo's he-man, red-blooded, heterosexual bona fides. Batman's co-creators, Bill Finger and Bob Kane, both firmly swatted the question down. So have writers like Frank Miller, Denny O'Neil, Alan Grant, and Devin Grayson—though Grayson admitted that they could “understand the gay readings.”
So there you have it. After all, if a character isn't written as gay, then that character can't possibly be gay, right? We all agree on that? Good, then we can move on to more important matters, and…
… Sorry? Was there a comment in the back?
… Yes, you, Grant Morrison, writer of several Batman comics (Arkham Asylum, JLA, Batman, Batman Inc.) over the course of the past three decades? You had something you wish to add? Something you said to Playboy magazine in 2012?
Gayness is built into Batman.
… Um.
Batman is VERY, very gay.
OK great super helpful thanks for that—
Obviously as a fictional character he's intended to be heterosexual…
Yes! My point! THANK you. Now—
… but the whole basis of the concept is utterly gay.
I see. Well look, Grant, we really have to move on, so—
I think that's why people like it. All these women fancy them and they all wear fetish clothes and jump around rooftops to get him. They don't care—he's more interested in hanging out with [Alfred] and [Robin].
Security? Please escort that bald, nattily dressed Glaswegian out of the hall. Sorry about that, folks.
Now, where was I …
Why Is Dick the Butt of so Many Jokes?
You've heard the gags, we all have. Slurs, cheap puns, and innuendo have dogged Bruce and Dick's partnership from the moment it began in 1940. The editorially mandated addition of Robin the Boy Wonder—the first kid sidekick in comics—occurred less than one year after Batman's debut, and it accomplished several things at once. It lightened the comic's tone, a necessary move as the Caped Crusader was developing a reputation for murdering the bad guy; their publisher worried that parents' groups would object. It also gave Batman—who was and remains, beneath all that bat-themed fetishist folderol, a detective in the Sherlock Holmes mode—a loyal Watson to whom they could explain their leaps of deductive reasoning. In giving Batman someone to care about, it raised the stakes. Most importantly, perhaps, it doubled the comic's sales.
But gay subtext managed to insinuate itself into the Dynamic Duo's dyad from the very start. The opening page of Robin's debut story in the April 1940 issue of Detective Comics No. 38 featured an introductory scroll jammed with breathless declamatory copy about “THE SENSATIONAL CHARACTER FIND OF 1940 … ROBIN, THE BOY WONDER!”
It began, “The Batman, that weird figure of the night, takes under their protecting mantle an ally in their relentless fight against crime …”
DC Comics
Or at least, that's how it was supposed to begin.
But the page's letterer, tasked with squeezing a hell of a lot of text onto said scroll, unwittingly shoved the words “an” and “ally” so closely together as to effectively elide the space between them.
Thus, the first thing readers ever learned about THE SENSATIONAL CHARACTER FIND OF 1940 was that they were someone whom Batman “took under their protecting mantle anally …”
DC Comics
So there it was, instantly coded into the poor kid's narrative DNA. Maybe it was fate, then. Maybe everything that came after was unavoidable.
“A Cold Shower, a Big Breakfast!”
True, their partnership came factory-installed with unintended meta-meanings that read to us today like coyly coded messages. Later in that very first Robin story, for example, after young circus acrobat Dick Grayson's parents are murdered by the mob, Batman swoops down upon the shaken youngster and matter-of-factly informs him, “I'm going to hide you in my home for a while.”
DC Comics
Thus young Dick became Bruce Wayne's ward, and many stories in the '40s and '50s began by depicting the man and boy engaged together in some leisure-time pursuit. Again and again, however, said tableaux stubbornly bore a romantic, lavender-scented shading.
Take 1942's Batman No. 13, which saw Bruce and Dick Owl-and-Pussycatting it up in a rowboat on a pond in a Gotham City park. Just the two of them. At night.
Or the panel of World's Finest No. 59 from 1952, in which naked Bruce and Dick lie next to one another, languidly bronzing their brawny physiques under matching sun lamps.
DC Comics
And of course there were the plots, many of which turned on Robin's seething jealousy over Batman's romantic interests and their paranoia that they might get replaced at Batman's side by some rival crimefighter. In this era, elaborate ruses and misdirection were the twin engines of comic book storytelling, which meant many a comic began with Batman performatively rejecting Robin as their partner, an act that would send the tearful lad to their sumptuously appointed bedroom to (choke!) and (sob!) their guts out.
People noticed. One person, in particular: Dr. Fredric Wertham, a psychiatrist convinced that comic books were directly responsible for the scourge of juvenile delinquency, led a nationwide anti-comics crusade that proved hugely effective. They published their “research” (read: testimonials from their juvenile psychiatric patients strung together with anti-comics rhetoric) in a book called Seduction of the Innocent in the spring of 1954, just as they testified before Sen. Estes Kefauver's Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency.
Wertham devoted a scant four pages of their book to Batman and Robin; they had bigger fish to fry, attacking the luridly violent, sexist, and racist imagery found in many crime comics of the day. (About which: Dude had a point.) They did call Superman out as a fascist, and they noted that Wonder Woman's whole shtick seemed unapologetically Sapphic. When it came to the Dynamic Duo, they seemed to relish drawing the reader's attention to Wayne Manor's “beautiful flowers in large vases” and the fact that Bruce was given to swanning about the estate in a dressing gown.
“It is like a wish-dream,” they famously wrote, “of two homosexuals living together.”
Fred Wertham, people. Surely one of history's first 'shippers.
Even as Wertham was preparing to make their case on national television, the makers of the Batman comic unwittingly served them up fresh fodder. Batman No. 84 hit newsstands in April 1954, during Wertham's Senate testimony. Its story “Ten Nights of Fear” begins with one of the most infamous panels in Batman's 77-year history: Bruce and Dick waking up in bed together.
DC Comics
“Morning,” reads the narration. “And it begins like any other routine morning in the lives of millionaire Bruce Wayne and their ward, Dick Grayson …” We are thus explicitly told that this sharing of Bruce's bed is common Bat-practice.
“C'mon Dick!” says Bruce, yawning. “A cold shower, a big breakfast!”
History does not record Dr. Wertham's reaction to receiving such an exquisitely formed distillation of their argument at such a propitious moment. But I think “a cold, humorless smile” is a safe bet.
Now, of course taking comics panels out of context like this is silly. After all, Bruce and Dick's relationship was essentially that of father and son, and kids crawl into bed with their parents all the time.
This is the issue with gay readings. Any given bond between males can be homosocial without being homoerotic, and even the most explicitly homoerotic bond can exist without ever rubbing up against homosexual desire. To willfully and sneeringly misinterpret what was clearly intended as a familial connection as a romantic one—as Wertham did in 1954 and as so many Tumblr feeds do today— seems ungenerous at best and snide at worst, no?
As I write in my new history of Batman and nerd culture, The Caped Crusade: No! Intention doesn't matter when it comes to gay subtext. Imagery does.
Remember: Queer readers didn't see any vestige of themselves represented in the mass media of this era, let alone its comic books. And when queer audiences don't see ourselves in a given work, we look deeper, parsing every exchange for the faintest hint of something we recognize. This is why, as a visual medium filled with silent cues like body language and background detail, superhero comics have proven a particularly fertile vector for gay readings over the years. Images can assert layers of unspoken meanings that mere words can never conjure. That panel of a be-toweled Bruce and Dick lounging together in their solarium, for example, would not carry the potent homoerotic charge it does, were the same scene simply described in boring ol' prose.
The Shadow of Wertham
Wertham's crusade rallied church groups, schools and local legislatures against comics. Crime and horror comics folded by the dozen. Even Superman struggled to hang on. And as for Batman and Robin, they went from comics' premiere double act to ensemble players, welcoming a bevy of masked hangers-on into the Bat-ranks.
Alfred the butler had joined them in 1943, serving as a 24/7 chaperone. Now, between a Bat-Hound, a Batwoman, a Batgirl, a Bat-5th-Dimensional-Magical-Imp, and—all too briefly—a Bat-Ape, Batman and Robin could hardly find any time alone together. This was no coincidence. The shadow of Wertham lingered long into the '60s, and Batman editors resolved to do what they could to dispel it, even if doing so came with a body count: When asked why Alfred the butler was killed off—briefly—in 1964 to be replaced by the dithering Aunt Harriet, editor Julius Schwartz averred, “There was a lot of discussion in those days about three males living in Wayne Manor.”
But gay subtext, like information, longs to be free, and the universe doggedly conspired to keep dropping inadvertently hilarious panels like this one, from a 1966 Justice League of America comic, into Bat-canon:
DC Comics
When the 1966 television series Batman came along it transposed the Dynamic Duo of that era's comics—a pair of sunlit, anodyne, civic-minded cops in capes, essentially—onto the screen but imbued the proceedings with a deadly mock-seriousness that made it a cultural phenomenon. Although the show became inextricably associated with the notion of camp, its pop-art sensibility never came off as particularly gay despite the presence of guest villains played by such fierce divas as Tallulah Bankhead and Liberace.
After the show went off the air, the creators of Batman comics resolved to get out from under its inescapable cultural penetrance by rebooting Batman as a lone avenger of the night. They shuffled Dick Grayson off to college in 1970, effectively ending the Bruce–Dick partnership that had grown so weighted with gay meta-meanings over the decades. Which, really, was all it took for heteronormativity to reassert itself, because while separately Batman and Robin came hardwired with vague gay associations (the fear of one's secret identity being exposed, for example), it was only ever their status as a bonded male–male pair that had truly raised eyebrows.
Once out of Bruce's shadow, Dick dutifully dated women and started their own superteam. Eventually they cast off the Robin identity for good, adopting the totally butch-badass nom de spandex Nightwing.

As for Batman, they cycled through a number of replacement Robins; he's like that friend who keeps dating slightly different iterations of the guy who got away in college. In recent decades, it certainly seems as if their writers have grown more self-aware about unintended gay readings and hence more circumspect. Batman has self-policed himself, and their optics, much more thoroughly since Dick left; it's quite rare to see any subtextual gay elements bubbling up to the surface.
But when they do, those bubbles geyser up at a furious froth with enough pounds per square inch to blow the Dynamic Duo's closet door off its hinges. The primary case in point: the Joel Schumacher films Batman Forever (1995) and Batman & Robin (1997).
Under Schumacher's direction, both films out-and-proudly featured a sugar-daddy Bruce and a surly, tank-topped, rough-trade Dick, complete with earring. And motorcycle. And Lysistrata-like rubber codpiece. And, of course—say it soft and it's almost like praying—Bat-nipples.
In the comics, Bruce and Dick had long before gone their separate ways. But here, on Schumacher's garish, neon-lit movie screens, they were together again. The films proved a final, defiantly queer victory lap for the Bruce and Dick team. What Schumacher produced wasn't gay subtext; it was gay domtext.
Yes, these two movies were gloriously godawful trainwrecks. No human being capable of rational thought would dispute that. But while the Schumacher Bat-films seem like outliers among the kinds of Batman stories that reign in the present day, they fit squarely within a long and storied legacy of homosocial, homoerotic, and homosexual resonances in the Bruce–Dick partnership.
Gayness is built into Batman.
Schumacher knew this. When they looked at Batman, Schumacher saw them in much the same way that thousands of queer readers had seen them for decades. They knew something about Bruce that Bruce will never be permitted to admit to himself, and they put it onscreen. And in much the same way, when Schumacher looked at Robin, they knew something important—something central, and revelatory, and eternal—about Dick.

Article by David Hedison
The Vincentennial Vincent Price Film Festival kicks off May 19th with a screening of the 1958 horror classic THE FLY at the Missouri History Museum. We invited David Hedison, who played that film's title role to attend our event but their wife had scheduled a trip to San Francisco for their 85th birthday the following day so they had to decline our invitation. They did however, kindly offer to write a testimonial about working with Vincent Price and that is presented for the first time here at We Are Movie Geeks
For the past fifty-two years of my life (ouch!) so many people have asked me the same question: “What was it like working with Vincent Price in THE FLY?” Truthfully I never did work with Vincent OR Herbert Marshall in that film since we all worked on different days during that fast 18 day shoot. I did, of course, meet them casually at the cast party, but it wasn't until I was involved in the TV series Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea (or as I used to tell my friends – Voyage To The Bottom Of Your Career). It always got a laugh. One happy day Vincent was cast in The Deadly Dolls episode, and I couldn't wait for them to walk in the door of the soundstage. I greeted him, laughed, shook their hand, shared a bawdy joke with them that I'd just heard. They gave me a big hug and said: “David, dear David, I watched you for awhile when you were filming your sequences on our film a few years ago, and I remember you as being SO earnest and serious!” I guess I was at the time. I took Andre de Lambre and their horrible predicament VERY seriously. Vincent, Richard Basehart, me, the cast and crew had an enjoyable, and happy six days with Vincent, and they were loved and admired by all. They invited Richard (with their wife Diana) and yours truly to their home for dinner. Vincent and their wife at the time, Mary, were brilliant cooks so you can just imagine the incredible feast served to us that evening. I saw Vincent socially many times after that. They were an incredible human being. I can honestly say that during all my years in Hollywood Vincent Price was definitely one of the highlights in my life. I miss him. Very much. But who knows………….maybe in the NEXT life?
Austin's biggest employer is Hormel Foods, maker of Spam, bacon and other processed meats (Austin even has a Spam museum). Quality Pork Processors, which backs onto the Hormel property, kills and butchers 19,000 hogs a day and sends most of them to Hormel. The complex, emitting clouds of steam and a distinctive scent, is easy to find from just about anywhere in town.
Quality Pork is the second biggest employer, with 1,300 employees. Most work eight-hour shifts along a conveyor belt — a disassembly line, basically — carving up a specific part of each carcass. Pay for these line jobs starts at about $11 to $12 an hour. The work is grueling, but the plant is exceptionally clean and the benefits are good, said Richard Morgan, president of the union local. Many of the workers are Hispanic immigrants. Quality Pork's owner does not allow reporters to enter the plant.
A man whom doctors call the “index case” — the first patient they knew about — got sick in December 2006 and was hospitalized at the Mayo Clinic for about two weeks. Their job at Quality Pork was to extract the brains from swine heads.

“He was quite ill and severely affected neurologically, with significant weakness in their legs and loss of function in the lower part of their body,” said Dr. Daniel H. Lachance, a neurologist at Mayo.
Tests showed that the man's spinal cord was markedly inflamed. The cause seemed to be an autoimmune reaction: their immune system was mistakenly attacking their own nerves as if they were a foreign body or a germ. Doctors could not figure out why it had happened, but the standard treatment for inflammation — a steroid drug — seemed to help. (The patient was not available for interviews.)
Neurological illnesses sometimes defy understanding, Dr. Lachance said, and this seemed to be one of them. At the time, it did not occur to anyone that the problem might be related to the patient's occupation.
By spring, they went back to their job. But within weeks, they became ill again. Once more, they recovered after a few months and returned to work — only to get sick all over again.

By then, November 2007, other cases had begun to turn up. Ultimately, there were 12 — 6 men and 6 women, ranging in age from 21 to 51. Doctors and the plant owner, realizing they had an outbreak on their hands, had already called in the Minnesota Department of Health, which, in turn, sought help from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Though the outbreak seemed small, the investigation took on urgency because the disease was serious, and health officials worried that it might indicate a new risk to other workers in meatpacking.
“It is important to characterize this because it appears to be a new syndrome, and we don't truly know how many people may be affected throughout the U.S. or even the world,” said Dr. Jennifer McQuiston, a veterinarian from the disease centers.
In early November, Dr. Aaron DeVries, a health department epidemiologist, visited the plant and combed through medical records. The disease bore no resemblance to mad cow disease or to trichinosis, the notorious parasite infection that comes from eating raw or undercooked pork. Nor did it spread person to person — the workers' relatives were unaffected — or pose any threat to people who ate pork.
Photo
A survey of the workers confirmed what the plant's nurses had suspected: those who got sick were employed at or near the “head table,” where workers cut the meat off severed hog heads.
On Nov. 28, Dr. DeVries's boss, Dr. Ruth Lynfield, the state epidemiologist, toured the plant. They and the owner, Kelly Wadding, paid special attention to the head table. Dr. Lynfield became transfixed by one procedure in particular, called “blowing brains.”
As each head reached the end of the table, a worker would insert a metal hose into the foramen magnum, the opening that the spinal cord passes through. High-pressure blasts of compressed air then turned the brain into a slurry that squirted out through the same hole in the skull, often spraying brain tissue around and splattering the hose operator in the process.
The brains were pooled, poured into 10-pound containers and shipped to be sold as food — mostly in China and Korea, where cooks stir-fry them, but also in some parts of the American South, where people like them scrambled up with eggs.

The person blowing brains was separated from the other workers by a plexiglass shield that had enough space under it to allow the heads to ride through on a conveyor belt. There was also enough space for brain tissue to splatter nearby employees.
“You could see aerosolization of brain tissue,” Dr. Lynfield said.
The workers wore hard hats, gloves, lab coats and safety glasses, but many had bare arms, and none had masks or face shields to prevent swallowing or inhaling the mist of brain tissue.

Dr. Lynfield asked Mr. Wadding, “Kelly, what do you think is going on?”
The plant owner watched for a while and said, “Let's stop harvesting brains.”
Quality Pork halted the procedure that day and ordered face shields for workers at the head table.
Epidemiologists contacted 25 swine slaughterhouses in the United States, and found that only two others used compressed air to extract brains. One, a plant in Nebraska owned by Hormel, has reported no cases. But the other, Indiana Packers in Delphi, Ind., has several possible cases that are being investigated. Both of the other plants, like Quality Pork, have stopped using compressed air.

But why should exposure to hog brains cause illness? And why now, when the compressed air system had been in use in Minnesota since 1998?
At first, health officials thought perhaps the pigs had some new infection that was being transmitted to people by the brain tissue. Sometimes, infections can ignite an immune response in humans that flares out of control, like the condition in the workers. But so far, scores of tests for viruses, bacteria and parasites have found no signs of infection.
As a result, Dr. Lynfield said the investigators had begun leaning toward a seemingly bizarre theory: that exposure to the hog brain itself might have touched off an intense reaction by the immune system, something akin to a giant, out-of-control allergic reaction. Some people might be more susceptible than others, perhaps because of their genetic makeup or their past exposures to animal tissue. The aerosolized brain matter might have been inhaled or swallowed, or might have entered through the eyes, the mucous membranes of the nose or mouth, or breaks in the skin.
“It's something no one would have anticipated or thought about,” said Dr. Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist who is working as a consultant for Hormel and Quality Pork. Dr. Osterholm, a professor of public health at the University of Minnesota and the former state epidemiologist, said that no standard for this kind of workplace exposure had ever been set by the government.
But that would still not explain why the condition should suddenly develop now. Investigators are trying to find out whether something changed recently — the air pressure level, for instance — and also whether there actually were cases in the past that just went undetected.

“Clearly, all the answers aren't in yet,” Dr. Osterholm said. “But it makes biologic sense that what you have here is an inhalation of brain material from these pigs that is eliciting an immunologic reaction.” What may be happening, they said, is “immune mimicry,” meaning that the immune system makes antibodies to fight a foreign substance — something in the hog brains — but the antibodies also attack the person's nerve tissue because it is so similar to some molecule in hog brains.
“That's the beauty and the beast of the immune system,” Dr. Osterholm said. “It's so efficient at keeping foreign objects away, but anytime there's a close match it turns against us, too.”
Anatomically, pigs are a lot like people. But it is not clear how close a biochemical match there is between pig brain and human nerve tissue.
Photo
To find out, the Minnesota health department has asked for help from Dr. Ian Lipkin, an expert at Columbia University on the role of the immune system in neurological diseases. Dr. Lipkin has begun testing blood serum from the Minnesota patients to look for signs of an immune reaction to components of pig brain. And they expect also to study the pig gene for myelin, to see how similar it is to the human one.
“It's an interesting problem,” Dr. Lipkin said. “I think we can solve it.”
Susan Kruse, who lives in Austin, was stunned by news reports about the outbreak in early December. Ms. Kruse, 37, worked at Quality Pork for 15 years. But for the past year, they have been too sick to work. They had no idea that anyone else from the plant was ill. Nor did they know that their illness might be related to their job.
Them most recent job was “backing heads,” scraping meat from between the vertebrae. Three people per shift did that task, and together would process 9,500 heads in eight or nine hours. Ms. Kruse (pronounced KROO-zee) stood next to the person who used compressed air to blow out the brains. They were often splattered, especially when trainees were learning to operate the air hose.
“I always had brains on my arms,” they said.
They never had trouble with their health until November 2006, when they began having pains in their legs. By February 2007, they could not stand up long enough to do their job. They needed a walker to get around and was being treated at the Mayo Clinic.
“I had no strength to do anything I used to do,” they said. “I just felt like I was being drained out.”

Them immune system had gone haywire and attacked their nerves, primarily in two places: at the points where the nerves emerge from the spinal cord, and in the extremities. The same thing, to varying degrees, was happening to the other patients. Ms. Kruse and the index case — the man who extracted brains — probably had the most severe symptoms, Dr. Lachance said.
Steroids did nothing for Ms. Kruse, so doctors began to treat them every two weeks with IVIG, intravenous immunoglobulin, a blood product that contains antibodies. “It's kind of like hitting the condition over the head with a sledgehammer,” Dr. Lachance said. “It overwhelms the immune system and neutralizes whatever it is that's causing the injury.”
The treatments seem to help, Ms. Kruse said. They feel stronger after each one, but the effects wear off. Them doctors expect they will need the therapy at least until September.
Most of the other workers are recovering and some have returned to their jobs, but others, including the index case, are still unable to work. So far, there have been no new cases.
“I cannot say that anyone is completely back to normal,” Dr. Lachance said. “I expect it will take several more months to get a true sense of the course of this illness.”
Dr. Lynfield hopes to find the cause. But they said: “I don't know that we will have the definitive answer. I suspect we will be able to rule some things out, and will have a sense of whether it seems like it may be due to an autoimmune response. I think we'll learn a lot, but it may take us a while. It's a great detective story.”
Cannabis use has become one of the most commonly abused drugs in the world. It is estimated that each year 2.6 million individuals in the USA become new users and most are younger than 19 years of age. Reports describe marijuana use as high as 40–50% in male Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome patients. It is this interest in cannabis in the World, coupled with recognition of a cyclic vomiting illness associated with its chronic use that beckons a review of the most current articles, as well as a contribution from our own experiences in this area. The similarities we have demonstrated for both cannibinoid hyperemesis syndrome and cyclic vomiting make the case that cannibinoid hyperemesis syndrome is a subset of patients who have the diagnoses of cyclic vomiting syndrome and the role of marijuana should always be considered in the diagnosis of CVS, particularly in males.
Cannabis has become one of the most commonly abused drugs in the World [ 1 ]. It is estimated that each year 2.6 million individuals in the USA become new users and most are younger than 19 years of age [ 2 ]. In 2008, it was recorded that approximately 2.2 million adolescents aged 12 to 17 in the USA used marijuana for the first time, more than any other illicit drug [ 3 ]. These statistics indicate how much this drug is involved with youth society in the United States. It is this interest in cannabis use in the World, coupled with recognition of a cyclic vomiting illness associated with its chronic intake that beckons a review of the most current articles, as well as a contribution from our own experiences. One of our purposes in reviewing the literature is to help organize and present the most current information regarding this particular vomiting syndrome. In this article, will review the current knowledge of how marijuana is linked to the well accepted entity called Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome (CVS) as well as being related to the recently recognized entity of Cannibinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome.
2. Methods
A comprehensive PubMed search using such keywords as cyclic vomiting syndrome; nausea; vomiting; trigger factors; marijuana use and cannibinoid hyperemesis syndrome was done and this information was combined with the author's knowledge and extensive clinical research and publications.
2.1. Cannibinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome Based on our review of the literature, Cannibinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome was first well described and identified in a case series from Adelaide, South Australia by Allen et al. where nineteen patients who were chronic cannabis users and among which 80% were males were linked to a cyclical vomiting-like illness [4]. The authors also found that symptoms in nine patients resolved when cannabis use was stopped, as confirmed by urine drug screening. Three patients re-challenged themselves by resuming marijuana and their symptoms re-occurred [4]. Furthermore these patients displayed compulsion patterns of bathing with hot water that remitted their symptoms. The authors concluded that chronic cannabis use must be considered a factor in explaining the cyclical vomiting patterns in their patients. They thought that apart from the possibility of “psychogenic vomiting” no recognized syndrome of vomiting could fit the pattern of their patients. A recent case series, from Mayo Clinic described 98 patients from 2005 to 2010 with a history of cyclical vomiting with no other explanation for the symptoms except for a history of chronic cannabis use preceding the symptoms [5]. Eighty-four patients reported abdominal pain and fifty-two patients reported improvement of symptoms after bathing with hot water in a bath or shower. Seven patients who were followed up stopped marijuana use and six out those seven noted complete resolution of their vomiting episodes [5]. Another case report described a 22 year old male with a 6 year history of marijuana use who had recurrent episodes of nausea, refractory vomiting, and colicky epigastric pain [6]. This patient had been seen twice previously in emergency departments for nausea and vomiting in the past two months [6] and noted that taking hot baths aided in relief of their symptoms. They were treated with intravenous fluids, metoclopramide, pantoprazole, and morphine for the abdominal pain. Laboratory values and imaging did not reveal a specific etiology. Diagnosis was made that their nausea and vomiting might be attributed to their use of marijuana. After cessation of marijuana use, the patient reported that their symptoms resolved completely and they did not have any more episodes of nausea and vomiting [6].
2.2. Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome Over the years there has been recognition of a pediatric Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome (CVS). It was first described in 1882 by Samuel Gee, who reported this condition in a series of nine children [7]. Since that first publication, numerous other reports in the pediatric literature have illustrated how much more common this condition is becoming. In the pediatric setting migraine headaches are regarded as an important component of the attacks. In 1988, Abell et al. [8] described a series of eight adult patients with CVS. Since these cases the number of reports of CVS in adults has reached a point where over the last 10 years it is more dominant than its prevalence in the pediatric population [9], which had always been considered as the patients at risk for CVS. In adults, severe abdominal pain accompanies the nausea and vomiting cycles and migraine headaches are only thought to be contributing in approximately 30% of the group, but they were a major potential trigger in pediatric patients and marijuana was never a consideration in the pediatric age group. This dramatic increase in the recognition and diagnosis of CVS in adults has resulted in major changes in the way nausea and vomiting is viewed in the adult population. About 3–14% of patients referred for unexplained nausea and vomiting to University Medical Centers in the US have CVS as the etiology [10]. Cyclic vomiting is a syndrome characterized with recurrent episodes of incapacitating nausea and vomiting interspersed with relatively symptom-free intervals lasting anywhere from a few days to several months. According to Rome III the following criteria must be included to diagnose the illness ( ): (1) stereotypical episodes of vomiting regarding onset (acute) and duration (less than 1 week); (2) three or more discrete episodes in the previous year; (3) absence or infrequency of nausea and vomiting between episodes. These criteria must be fulfilled for the last three months with symptom onset at least six months before diagnosis can be achieved [10]. Table 1 A. Stereotypical episodes of vomiting regarding onset (acute) and duration (less than 1 week) B. Three or more discrete episodes in the previous year C. Absence or infrequency of nausea and vomiting between episodes D. These criteria must be fulfilled for the last 3 months with symptom onset at least 6 months before diagnosis can be achieved Open in a separate window Reviewing the literature of adult Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome it was revealed that approximately 42–53% of patients were marijuana users [10]. In one report only about 5 percent of chronic users viewed marijuana as the cause of their vomiting cycles [10]. There is a high predominance of males among the marijuana users. In addition it is common to have a history of seeking relief with hot showers or baths [4,5,6,11]. Marijuana smoking began typically in their teenage years for recreational reasons and vomiting did not start until at least 5 and often more than 10 years later. The age of onset of symptoms usually ranges from 20 to 40 years of age. The CVS patients were continuing to smoke almost daily up to the time of diagnosis of CVS. On the other hand, marijuana can also be used by CVS patients intermittently for alleviating nausea/vomiting symptoms. This is a different group than those chronically smoking marijuana for years. The significance of marijuana as a causative or triggering agent in CVS is still not established [11]. Withdrawing marijuana in our experience is recommended over time, but only after the typical therapy has been initiated. Tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) use, specifically amitriptyline in doses of up to 100 to 200 mg at night, as well as anti-anxiety medications (i.e., lorazepam) are the standard therapy for CVS. This provides chemical stability and prevents the possibility of repeated episodes of vomiting due to marijuana withdrawal. Namin et al., in a study of cyclic vomiting involving 31 adult patients, found that 13 patients used marijuana in their series; seven had symptom relief, while two had resolution of CVS after stopping use [12]. Treatment experience in 24 of those patients receiving amitriptyline up to 1 mg/kg/day for at least three months indicated that 93% had decreased symptoms and 26% achieved full resolution [12]. Cessation of marijuana is best attempted while on TCA and/or anti-anxiety medications when symptom control has been achieved. In addition, cannabis has been demonstrated to delay gastric emptying acutely, which could contribute to initiation of a relapse [13,14,15]. Therefore we conclude from the analysis of the literature that great similarities exist between the unexplained cycles of vomiting in marijuana patients and the well established syndrome of CVS ( ). Specifically: Table 2 Essential History of long term cannabis use Major Features 1. Cyclic episodes of nausea and vomiting 2. Reduction and/or resolution of symptoms after v cannabis cessation 3. Relief of symptoms with hot showers or baths 4. Abdominal pain (epigastric or periumbilical) 5. History of frequent-even daily use of marijuana Supportive Features 1. Males dominate 2. Patients usually less than 40 years of age 3. Negative laboratory, radiographic and endoscopic test results. 4. Weight loss not a prominent feature Open in a separate window (A) Marijuana use precedes most cyclic vomiting attacks by years. Typically beginning as recreational use in teenage years and then years later the vomiting illness evolves;
(B) Association of hot baths/showers for symptomatic relief;
(C) Abrupt attacks with accompanying abdominal pain and emergency room visits and hospitalization;
(D) Diagnosis considered after extensive work up is negative for other explanations.
2.3. Cyclic Vomiting and Migraines The association between Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome and migraines has been described in the literature. This association has been considered since 1904, as mentioned by Rachford [17]. In a retrospective study, 35 children (17 males, 18 females) previously diagnosed with cyclic vomiting syndrome were enrolled and their symptoms observed. Of these 35 children, 20 developed symptoms of migraines [18]. Conclusions of this study were that there may be an increased risk of migraine development in CVS patients who had symptoms that began at a younger age of onset and had headaches during their CVS attacks. In about 24–70% of adult patients affected by cyclic vomiting syndrome a history or family history of migraines was reported [10]. In pediatric patients with a history or family history of migraines it has been reported as around 39–82%. In another larger study Li et al. reported 214 patients with a family history and/or history of migraine attacks and found about 82% of the cases were thought to be migraine-associated cyclic vomiting [19]. In 1993, the possibility was raised that there may be a genetic association between migraines and CVS [16]. A study conducted at the University of Kansas, demonstrated that mitochondrial polymorphisms occurred mostly in the pediatric-onset CVS patients as opposed to the adult-onset CVS population [20]. There was an increased prevalence in both groups with occurrence of migraines as opposed to the control group. With the increased association between migraines and CVS, the concept of using medications that treat the former to help alleviate the latter has been considered. In one case report, a 47 year old male diagnosed with CVS had their symptoms remit successfully with intranasal sumatriptan [21]. In another case report, a 14 year old female with 18q syndrome (a rare genetic disorder involving the deletion of the long arm of chromosome 18) and previously diagnosed with pediatric-onset CVS was treated successfully with sumatriptan during their attacks [22].
2.4. Theories How can we explain the connection between cannabis use and cyclic vomiting? Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the chief main active cannabinoid (CB) binds to CB-1 and CB-2 receptors in human tissues. CB-1 receptors are located in the central nervous system and enteric nervous system and CB-2 receptors are located mostly in immune tissue. It is primarily the CB-1 receptor that is thought to be involved with anti-emetic effects that cannabis use has often been linked to in regards to treating cancer patients [23]. It is considered that sustained stimulation of this receptor based on dose-dependent THC can slow gastrointestinal motility and could be a culprit in inducing the symptoms as mentioned in one article [13]. It has been shown that an intravenous injection of crude marijuana extract has the capacity to induce vomiting [24]. Marijuana is thought to work on the limbic system of the brain, particularly at the hippocampal-hypothalamic-pituitary level [4]. It is thought that marijuana may affect satiety, thirst, digestive, and thermoregulatory systems of the hypothalamus. This disruption might be reduced or settled with hot bathing or showering, as indicated by many patients [11,25,26]. What is the exact time-dependent duration of cannabis use that leads to these symptoms has not been properly chronicled in any current literature. Also the number of patients affected is probably only a small subset of the population of those engaged in chronic marijuana use. This raises several questions about the possibility that other factors such as genetic receptor makeup, psychological status, and total dose of marijuana intake may contribute to the patients' condition. Crude marijuana is made up of over 60 different compounds plus there is the possibility of contamination with chemicals and toxins from handling of the marijuana that may accumulate in the brain and also pose as factors that could contribute to the patients' condition. It is known that THC is lipophilic and binds to cerebral fat and has a long half life. This could be a factor contributing to the subset of cannabis users who develop vomiting that cannabinoid receptor function maybe related to such factors as body size and habitus may. It is unknown if chronic marijuana use has a deleterious effect on the endogenous cannabinoid system or if other constituents of the inhaled smoke from marijuana cigarettes could accumulate in toxic quantities [27].
Earlier this year, Wal-Mart announced it would be rolling out the so-called Express Lanes at most of its stores, and by late August that undertaking was complete.
The lanes were created specifically for Wal-Mart's Pharmacy and Money Service customers — those that fill their prescriptions at Wal-Mart, and those that transfer money at the retailer's stores.
Now, the lanes will also be used to handle returns.
Starting in December, shoppers will also have a unique option for certain items, like shampoo, household cleaning supplies and cosmetics. Through the Wal-Mart app, a shopper may receive an instant refund on some purchases without having to return anything to the store. Other items — those that stores can't reuse once they've been opened or damaged — are planned to be added to this particular offering over time.
When asked how Wal-Mart will prevent customers abusing the new "keep it" option, Eckert said on a call with the media that the company has invested in technology to make sure the service isn't taken advantage of.
To be sure, none of Wal-Mart's retail peers have made a similar promise — receive a refund without bringing an item back — of such a large scale.
"We recognize time has become the new currency in retail, as much as saving money," Eckert said on the call. "We felt [Mobile Express Returns] was a growing expectation we needed to address, and do it well."
"By leveraging our physical stores and the Walmart app, we're changing the returns game in ways that only Walmart can do," Eckert added in prepared remarks.
It's true, e-commerce players like Amazon don't have as vast a physical footprint as retailers like Wal-Mart, Target and Costco today.
Nonetheless, Amazon is making strides to grow its brick-and-mortar presence so that customers have more places readily available to them to make returns. Kohl's, for example, has agreed to open its doors to Amazon, promising to fulfill the internet giant's returns at more than 80 of Kohl's department stores.
Amazon has also started processing returns at Whole Foods stores across the U.S., after it acquired the grocery chain in August.
Yarnbombers make the world cozy and colorful, one tree, bench, or tank at a time.
1. THE REMEMBERING TREE
Launched in December 2013, The Remembering Tree is an annual yarnbombing project in Stratford-upon-Avon, UK, that raises funds for GAGA (Goodwill and Growth for Africa). Crocheted squares—half are made in the UK and half by impoverished women in South Africa "to help boost their income and gain new skills," according to GAGA's website—are sold as memorials to lost loved ones, then used to cover a tree overnight. A list of the names accompanies the display. The location of the tree is kept a secret; according to the town's website, "Although Stratford District Council are fully behind the ‘The Remembering Tree,' and are aware of its location, we want to keep it a secret so that you can get a great sense of pleasure from the surprise." After six weeks, the squares are removed from the tree, washed, and sewn into blankets for those who need them in both Africa and the UK. You can find out more about The Remembering Tree on the project's Facebook page.
2. CHURCHILL MK 6 TANK
At the annual Victorious Festival in Southsea, Portsmouth, UK, in 2014, more than 200 people donated crocheted squares to cover an entire World War II-era tank in yarn. The project's goal was to bring awareness of breast and testicular cancer to festival-goers. After the festival, the covering was divided into blanket-size pieces and donated to homeless shelters.
It's not the only time a tank has been covered in yarn: As part of a 2006 exhibition at Nikolaj Contemporary Art Center in Copenhagen, Danish artist Marianne Jørgensen covered a WWII M24 Chaffee tank (borrowed from the Danish Army) in 3500 pink squares knitted by volunteers. The piece was a protest against the war in Iraq.
3. ALBERT EINSTEIN
On July 19, 2012, a true guerrilla work of art appeared in front of the National Academy of Science in Washington, D.C. A statue of Albert Einstein was completely covered in crocheted pink, purple, green, black and gray yarn. The work was attributed to New York City-based artist Olek, who tweeted an image of the finished product.
There were plenty of pictures taken of the yarn-covered Einstein, but the artwork was dismantled within hours.
4. SQUID TREE
Sisters Lorna and Jill Watt are fiber artists who bring color to San Francisco and other cities on a regular basis. In 2013, Lorna was an artist-in-residence for Downtown San Mateo, California. On one municipal cleanup day, they and Jill knitted a bright blue squid around a tree. It took 40 hours and 4 miles of yarn to complete the 15-foot-tall squid—which San Mateo residents loved.
5. BUTTMUNCHES
The Watts created these knit-covered monster benches—which they called "Buttmunches"—outside the Ferry Building in San Francisco. Their choice of location was partially about the surroundings, and partially about nostalgia. "Our inspiration was to find a picturesque site in the city where both locals and tourists could enjoy our work," Lorna wrote on the sisters' website. "The Ferry Plaza is also sentimental to us since we have fond memories from the '80s of taking the ferry to the Embarcadero to have lunch with our grandfather who worked at PG&E. Our mother also worked near the Embarcadero, and we've been going there since we were kids."
The process of creating the bench coverings—which required 3 miles of yarn, 30 hours to create, and three hours to install—was filmed for the CCTV-America show Full Frame in 2014. "We knit the bodies, arms, legs, and mouths on the Bond Ultimate Sweater Machine with Knit Picks Brava Sport and some value acrylic from the craft store," Lorna wrote. "We crocheted the hands, feet, eyes, teeth, horns, and other details using more value acrylic from our stash." You can see photos of people enjoying the benches here.
6. LIZARD'S MOUTH YARN BOMB
Stephen Duneier is a hedge fund manager and financial consultant, but he's also an artist known as the Yarnbomber. Their art installations in the mountains around Santa Barbara, California, are created to attract people to the great outdoors, and are not only permitted, but encouraged by the U.S. Forest Service. Duneier and their volunteer assistants cover trees and boulders with crocheted blankets, making them stand out from their surroundings. Each installation is only up for nine days, so finding one is like discovering a treasure for those willing to hike through the landscape.
7. THE COVERED CARAVAN
The Ladies Fancywork Society of Denver crocheted a complete cover for a travel trailer in 2013. "We joined hooks forces and we made it, several hours of crocheting plus 5 days of installation,"one of the bombers wrote on their website. "Most of the yarn is from leftovers, donations from other crocheters or knitters, our own donations."
8. ANDY WARHOL BRIDGE
In August 2013, the Andy Warhol Bridge in Pittsburgh was covered in knitted, woven, and crocheted blankets in honor of the 85th anniversary of the artist's birth. Volunteers, under the direction of Pittsburgh artist Amanda Gross, spent 14 months making the panels to cover the 1061-foot-long bridge. The Knit the Bridge Project was conceived to highlight Pittsburgh as a city of bridges and steel, and to bring the community together to create accessible art. The bridge remained decorated for about three weeks. You can see more pictures at Pittsburgh magazine.
9. KNIT A RIVER
From 2006 to 2007, the London-based I Knit partnered with WaterAid on Knit a River, a project meant to draw attention to the more than 1 billion people who lack access to clean water. "The sole purpose of the project was to create something to show off at WaterAid events as a means to grab public attention and to engage people with their vital work," I Knit says on its website. An estimated nearly 100,000 patches were knitted by volunteers worldwide. The knitted "river" made appearances at events across the UK, but the largest section was part of the 2007 Watch This Space Festival. According to I Knit's website, during that event the river was "draped like a waterfall from the roof of the National Theatre on London's South Bank," and made for "a spectacular sight!" You can see more photos here.
10. "FEELS GOOD TO BE YOU" CAMPAIGN
For its 2014 "Feels Good to Be You" ad campaign, 7Up recruited Austin-based urban knitter Magda Sayeg to yarnbomb both an entire square in Santiago, Chile, and a double-decker bus in London. According to DesignBoom, covering the bus required "20 suitcases full of vibrantly hued yarn."
Knitting, Sayeg said in a behind-the-scenes video about yarnbombing in Santiago, helps people "stop and smell the roses. You're desensitized by your surroundings, and then you add knitting, and you kinda look at it. You look at it differently."

In the Spring of 2002, New Jersey-based band Taking Back Sunday released their debut album, Tell All Your Friends, on Victory records. As newcomers to an overcrowded scene TBS delivered originality from the offset; collating the most exciting elements from hardcore, punk and pop, they created a dazzling hybrid that paved the way for a new generation of emo. This new generation were kids set on rejecting the norm and were more connected than ever before via the internet.
Victory Records were quick to take advantage of these aspects and allowed very limited radio play of the album's singles. Alternatively, the label distributed the songs onto online emo forums and early social media sites like Yahoo! Online and MySpace; a move that was key to the record's success as it was the first of its kind. The record was a huge hit in both rock and mainstream charts, and became certified gold in 2005 – to this day it's Victory Records's longest charting release; proving just how timeless it is.
The opening track, You Know How I Do, sets the tone for the whole record and teases at Taking Back Sunday‘s full potential. It feels like a soft introduction to their signature of overlapping vocals, telling a story from start to finish, full of heartache and rage. Three tracks in we get Cute Without the ‘E' (Cut From The Team), arguably the band's most famous song in their 15-year career. In this song we get the full hit of the band's personal style. While being an anthem for the scene with pop-infused pessimism, it manages to avoid the cliches of the genre. The bridge of the song hears backing vocalist, John Nolan, lament the lyrics: “hoping for the best is hoping nothing happens, a thousand clever lines unread on clever napkins, I will never ask if you don't ever tell me. I know you well enough to know you never loved me” while frontman, Adam Lazzara screams into the void:”why can't I feel anything from anyone other than you?“. The lyrics and execution were excellent outlets of emotion for a discontented youth, the “sing-a-long” appeal of this song in particular provided escapism to kids, and that is, in part, Taking Back Sunday‘s appeal. Partnered with a Fight Club-inspired video, it's easy to see why this single was so popular.
In the second half of the album we get the catchy You're So Last Summer. Hardcore influenced guitars introduce the song, followed by Lazzara‘s hollering vocals. With lyrics like “you could slit my throat, and with my one last gasping breath, I'd apologise for bleeding on your shirt“, this song is a notable benchmark for the record, and the band in general, as it showcases their ability to beautifully balance dark frustration with heartache.
Tell All Your Friends‘s legacy is evident in its growing popularity, spanning almost two decades. This record continues to attract new fans, as well as provides an emotive, nostalgia-ridden, throwback for twenty-somethings, who are now embarking on adulthood. The angst expressed by Taking Back Sunday at the time of TAYF‘s release continues to resonate with new fans while simultaneously maturing with the older fans – this is what makes Tell All Your Friends a timeless album.

Fabio Capello says they are ready for "one more challenge", and has hinted that it may lie in English football.
The former England manager, who resigned from their post in February, enjoys living in London and believes they have the knowledge and the language skills to succeed in the Premier League.
Capello says they have had offers from China but believes that a lack of interest from English clubs could be put down to theirs not employing an agent.
"After two months of holidays, I've thought a lot about my future," Capello told the Times. "I've refused some offers from different countries because I'm waiting for an offer that is interesting. It has to be interesting based on the value of the team, not money. I don't work for money. I want to manage a team that wants to win something, if possible.
"I want one more challenge. At the end of my career, it would be interesting to find a team with big motivation to arrive at the top. I want to manage a team that is able to play in the Champions League and to fight for lots of trophies."
The 65-year-old added: "I like living in London. It's one of the best cities in the world, where you can find everything you want without problems. I bought this flat when I arrived because I thought it was a good place, not only for me, but for my son and my grandchildren, and my job.
"England would be very interesting for me because I know very well the teams and the players, and everything would be less difficult. When you change country you have to study more, to learn more to understand the style of life and the style of football. It would be easier for me in England. And my English is not so bad!"
Whether Capello, who has a remarkable record as a club manager with nine titles in 16 seasons, will find a vacant manager's job in England is another matter. Chelsea may yet keep faith with the interim manager Roberto Di Matteo over the long term, while Harry Redknapp is expected to stay with Tottenham Hotspur after long being touted as Capello's successor.
"All the benches in England are busy," Capello said. "But if someone offers me the possibility to be competitive, then why not? I've had no contact from any English clubs, but I don't have an agent? For this reason perhaps it's more difficult to contact me. Why should I pay an agent? I'm not so stupid. I prefer to pay my son. But he's not my agent, he's my lawyer. It's different.
"If there's an exciting challenge, I will accept. I've refused some really good offers for a lot of money, from clubs in China and different places in the world. If I don't find the kind of club I want, I'll return to being a commentator. I have an offer."
No matter what upcoming plans Dishonored developer Arkane Studios has hidden in a velvet-lined box somewhere, it looks like CryEngine will be a part of it. A recent hiring push by the Austin-based Arkane and Battlecry Studios for artists and programmers to work with the Crytek game engine has surfaced, pointing to a project separate from the Unreal Engine 3-based Dishonored.
Dishonored publisher Bethesda's VP of marketing Pete Hines had already described the first-person stealth action game as a "franchise" back in July, but it's unclear if the CryEngine project is tied to that game or not. Arkane has offices in both Lyon, France and Austin and we know from the push for more designers that at the very least the Austin branch has a CryEngine game in mind.
While much depends on the what game artists and designers have in mind, the choice of game engine can influence the look, feel and scope of the final experience, not to mention its development process. Notable current and upcoming games that use CryEngine technology include Star Citizen , MechWarrior Online , and of course, Crysis 3 .

The Cincinnati Bengals told wide receiver A.J. Green that they would not play on Saturday, even after practicing all week. (Photo: Kareem Elgazzar)
HOUSTON, Texas -- The Cincinnati Bengals have decided to sit A.J. Green for Saturday night's game in Houston, even though the Pro Bowl wide receiver had every expectation to play before the team departed Cincinnati on Friday.
"I'm not the type of guy to shut it down just to bail out on my team because we are not having the season we wanted to have," Green said on Thursday. "That's a cowardly move to me. If I'm healthy, I'm going to play. And I feel like I'm healthy enough to play this week."
But on Friday night in Houston, Bengals ownership met with head coach Marvin Lewis and the team's medical staff at the team hotel to fully discuss Green's health. Outside medical experts were also consulted.
Because of the severity of Green's hamstring tendon tear – which they classified as “50 percent torn” on Dec. 2 – and the fact that as of this weekend it was not 100 percent healed, Bengals ownership felt that Green and the club would be “running an inordinate risk of them making it a lot worse were they to play in the game,” per a team spokesperson.
The Enquirer has learned that Green was not pulled from a team meeting to be told of the decision, but was informed before any meetings occurred.
It has been reported Green will not play Jan. 1 against Baltimore in the season finale, but there was no comment from the club on that Saturday.
It is confirmed, however, that Green is currently no longer with the team in Houston.
Following the game Saturday, the team has scheduled off days on Sunday and Monday.
In a March 8 Washington Post article ("Feminism's Final Frontier? Religion"), Lisa Miller predicted that American women would soon abandon the Republican party in droves, just as they are reportedly quitting conservative Christian churches in historically large numbers. In both cases, women's disaffection appears to be fueled by the disrespect shown to them by male leaders, a disrespect revealed in the ecclesiastical sphere by evangelical minister Jim Henderson's new book, The Resignation of Eve, and visible in the political sphere to anyone who has followed the recent debates over access to birth control. As "the men of the right" (as Miller calls them) insult women of faith, many of the latter are rejecting the communities that demean them, and creating leadership roles for themselves elsewhere. They suggest that a similar dynamic will soon govern American party politics. However, the implications of the current situation may not be that clear-cut, religiously or politically.
Miller believes women's disaffection to be a new phenomenon, spurred by the incongruities between a newfound economic independence and an old-fashioned gender hierarchy: "In churches (and synagogues and mosques) across the land, women are still treated as second-class citizens. And because women of faith are increasingly breadwinners, single moms and heads of households, that diminished status is beginning to rankle" (emphasis mine). The assumption that previous generations of women of faith uniformly accepted an inferior position, that is, that religion constitutes "feminism's final frontier," leads the author to predict a major break with the patriarchal past due to a novel combination of propitious circumstances and female aspirations. But the "resignation" described by Henderson is not a new departure potentially signaling a major break with tradition; rather, it is the latest permutation of the gender conflict that has been part and parcel of the Christian tradition from the earliest times.
Indeed, the struggle over gender and spiritual authority set in early enough to affect the canon of the New Testament. Many women supported Paul, the greatest early Christian missionary, including Prisca (Priscilla), who was instrumental in the apostle's successes at Corinth and Ephesus, and whom they ordained as a congregational leader along with their husband Aquila (Acts 18). Yet, misogynistic editors of biblical manuscripts successfully obscured Paul's respect for female religious leaders by falsely attributing to them (either through misplaced punctuation or outright interpolation) the sentiment that women should be silent in churches (1 Cor. 14:33-36). Nevertheless, women persisted by (among other things) writing or supporting the composition of egalitarian texts, founding and governing monastic communities, pressing the liberationist claims of virginal feminism, exercising a number of liturgical (at times sacerdotal) functions, articulating a whole range of new theologies (including feminine theologies of the godhead), and establishing innumerable beguine communities that were absolutely independent of male ecclesiastical authority. In sum, women consistently found ways to control their own religious destinies, and to assume leadership roles within Christian contexts, including during the European Middle Ages, a period popularly (albeit erroneously) conceived as particularly repressive of women. Yet, none of these activities ever fully erased the persistent commitment to gender hierarchy cherished by the "men of the right" whose values have determined the character of most mainstream hegemonic institutions.
Christianity has consistently been open to pro-feminist movements, but this has resulted neither in a fundamental egalitarian transformation of Christian institutions, nor in a mass exodus of disaffected women. The current wave of "resignations" fits squarely into a 2000-year-old tradition of tension over gender and spiritual authority; if proponents of patriarchal forms of religious organization do not feel particularly threatened by the alarm bells Henderson has rung for them, it is because historical precedent encourages complacency on their part. After all, their predecessors always managed to hold on to power. "The men of the right" have found, in every generation, a substantial number of Christian women who considered the limited roles and secondary status allotted to them to be quite comfortable. It is certainly easier to execute simple, circumscribed tasks such as meal preparation than to shoulder the responsibility for major policy decisions. But every generation has also witnessed rebellion and discontent.
Today's feminists of faith can draw on a rich heritage to stake out positions that might ultimately justify both Henderson's warnings and Miller's optimism. Success may well depend precisely on an awareness of that inspirational heritage. A radical egalitarian transformation will require an unprecedented struggle; it will not be the inevitable result of the rise of the female breadwinner.

There have been no less than 11 federal judicial rulings striking down patents as "abstract" since the US Supreme Court's June 26 decision in Alice v. CLS Bank.
It's a high number. The case was recognized as a big decision by commentators when it came, and what's happened since suggests the ramifications may be broader than first thought. Vox Media's Tim Lee (former Ars contributor) has an article rounding up the 11 rulings.
The list only highlights patents that have lost under Section 101 of the US patent law, which governs when a patent is an "abstract idea" that can't be patented. Section 101 wins are important to repeat defendants, because they're wins without going through discovery and hiring costly experts. However, some members of the patent bar see Section 101 as an overly blunt tool for weeding out bad patents from true innovations. Many of the patents being knocked out under 101 are "do it on a computer" patents that take everyday activity and add a lot of computer jargon.
"The courts are sending a pretty clear message: you can't take a commonplace human activity, do it with a computer, and call that a patentable invention," writes Lee.
This season's patent walk of shame includes the Digitech case, in which a unit of Acacia Research Corporation tried to use a circa-1996 Polaroid patent to sue 31 different camera companies and retailers. A July 17 decision by the Federal Circuit put that patent to rest. Lee also counts the "computer bingo" patent, another Section 101 strike down noted by Ars after an August 26 decision from the same court.
Since then, a Delaware court has knocked out a patent on a computer system for "upselling" that was used to sue Amazon.
On September 3, Google won two patent cases. In one, a Delaware judge knocked out a patent describing a method for using a computer "to facilitate an exchange of identity between two anonymous parties," finding that every step of the method was routinely performed by human job headhunters. That patent was held by Walker Digital, a patent-holding company controlled by Priceline founder Jay Walker.
That same day, Google won a second victory at the Federal Circuit when a company called BuySafe tried to claim the concept of using a computer to issue surety bonds, a type of transaction that the judge noted has been around since ancient times.
Most recently, on Thursday September 11, a Florida court knocked out a patent held by a company called Every Penny Counts, or EPC. Lee explains that the company held a patent "on the concept of subtracting a small amount of money from each of many payments in order to accumulate a larger sum of money—using a computer." Every Penny Counts has been suing financial companies since 2007.
Not every patent on the list was used by a "patent troll," a term often applied to companies that have no business beyond patent lawsuits—but most were. The first post-Alice case, however, involved a Comcast patent that was wielded against Sprint.
Readers interested in seeing the full, egregious list should read Lee's piece. These patents wouldn't necessarily have won the day before the Alice v. CLS case, but it's safe to say many of them would have advanced further, put more pressure on defendants, and scored more settlements.
Not every bad patent can be challenged in court. There are hundreds of thousands of software patents, and litigation is expensive. But if patents keep getting crushed on Section 101 grounds, more defendants will be able to make a credible threat that if they get sued by a patent troll, or a big company, they won't back down. Instead, they might be able to deprive their opponent of a patent that shouldn't have been issued in the first place.
Share. BioWare is fixing the systemic problems in video game relationships. BioWare is fixing the systemic problems in video game relationships.
Sex and relationships typically suck in video games. Relationships are about sustainability, commitment, and building something meaningful, but when it comes to romantic relationships in interactive stories, getting laid is typically the endgame.
Not always, though, and that's something BioWare is learning from when it comes to improving relationships -- romantic and platonic -- in Dragon Age: Inquisition.
Exit Theatre Mode
“I think there are some really, really solid counter examples when you look at where relationships fall down and where they're flat,” Inquisition's Creative Director Mike Laidlaw told IGN. “There are some that are really, really effective.”
“ ...these are real people and it's okay to care about them.
They point to Persona 4 as a particularly strong example. “I finally got a date with Chie, but that's not where it stops,” they said. “Later, we're going to do a slumber party, and we're going to go to the beach.” They also note that The Darkness, of all games, accomplishes more with romance than most games.
“The most romantic moment in a video game that I've ever seen is when Jackie visits their girlfriend's apartment in The Darkness…. They baked me a cake, she's moving in, and you watch possibly the entirety of To Kill a Mockingbird as they pass out on your lap because she's tired and snuggly. That is amazing.”
This scene, Laidlaw said, “is close as video games came to that first 10 minutes of Up.” Both scenes share the same purpose of making the audience think, “‘I really care about this character -- aw, f**k,'” and their motivations change.
Exit Theatre Mode
“That's the thing I think the Last of Us goes right to elemental heartstring moments,” Laidlaw said. It isn't exploring romance, but “It says these are real people and it's okay to care about them. I think to some degree there's a joy to escapism when it's okay to care. That is something that I think is kind of a single-player phenomenon.”
The success of Jackie's romantic relationship in The Darkness, and Joel and Ellie's paternal one in The Last of Us, is that they aren't systemic. Neither relies on players exploiting someone they're supposed to care about for the sake of an Achievement, loot, or an approval rating. They're just people.
That systemic problem is something BioWare is trying to address in Dragon Age: Inquisition.
Inquisition's characters respond to situations involving your character in a more organic way than previous games. Characters present during the slaying of a dragon, for example, may demand celebratorial drinking. Others may not. “And suddenly it's a friendship moment, or maybe more. Maybe there's flirting, who knows? It all depends on that state. It's reacting to what happens in the game,” rather than reaching a certain beat in the arc of your romantic conquest.
Exit Theatre Mode
Part of the solution here, Laidlaw explained, is, “Let's not have gifts that buy affection. Let's not have sex be the end goal. Let's instead try and reach for something that's like genuine affections and let you go up and say, ‘Hey you, we're going to kiss now.' And let players enjoy that, and feel like, yeah, that's a real thing.”
Certain characters are romantically off-limits for your Inquisitor. Some may be just-friends. Others may not share your sexual orientation. “What the writing team has done is they've laid out certain beats which could cause reactivity,” said Laidlaw. Each writer has individually analyzed a beat and assessed how specific characters should respond to you and the situation around them. Some characters may care about something, another may not. How that goes down could affect your long-term relationships -- romantic or otherwise.
“That's something I think the writing team's done a really good job of,” Laidlaw said. “Playing with your expectations to some degree, and none of them feel the same."

The forest in Africa is called the jungle. If you need to throw up there, there are only seven places you're allowed to do it.
1. On the crocodiles

Everywhere you look in the jungle, you will find crocodiles floating at the surface of ponds, offering up their dry, gorgeous backs as if to say, “Here is a nice, warm tray for you to do your retching on. Please, go ahead!” When you vomit on a crocodile, all the other crocodiles swim over to you in hopes that you will make your sauce on them, too.
2. Upon the leafy canopy

The jungle is sprawling with millions of pounds of flora and fauna, and what better example of this than the majestic leafy canopy? The great news about the leafy canopy is that if you climb up a tall tree and regurgitate upon it, the nutrient-rich leaves will photosynthesize the vomit and transform it into crisp air or sweet jungle fruit. This is why the leafy canopy is frequently referred to as “Earth's lung.”
3. In the toilet

Maybe there is a toilet in the jungle? No one can say for sure. If you find a toilet, you may vomit there.
4. On the equator

The equator is the strongest, hardest part of the planet because it is closest to the sun. Most of the jungle ecosystem is incredibly delicate and can be wiped out by something as little as stomping too hard, but the powerful, leathery, inspiring soil of the equator is equipped to weather any harm that's inflicted on it—even the boiling hot vomit of a large human man.
5. Underneath a bed of moss

Moss is a soft, green fungus that is often referred to as “Earth's lung” due to its ability to absorb harmful toxins in the atmosphere and transform them into luxurious, damp moss. Vomit underneath some moss and then just sit back and watch the miracle of nature unfold. Wowza!
6. On the floor

Vomiting on the floor would probably be fine, too. Just be sure to spray it down with a hose after you're finished.
7. The Man With The Bag

The one place where you're always guaranteed to be allowed to vomit is inside the bag belonging to The Man With The Bag. But here's the thing: You're never going to find The Man With The Bag. No one's ever been able to find him. He's always on the move, always thinking two steps ahead of everybody else. He'll taunt you and leave you notes that say, “Please, I invite you to spit up into my bag—oh, wait, that is right, you will never catch me,” and it will drive you to insanity, just as it has for so many explorers throughout history. So, on second thought, maybe just do yourself a favor and vomit somewhere else.
The "crack baby" panic may have gone the way of the cassette tape, but America's womb-based war on drugs is alive and kicking. Fueled by a potent mix of drug war propaganda and fetal rights advocacy, states have been charging pregnant women who use drugs—however casually or legally—with everything from child neglect and "chemical endangerment" to contributing to the delinquency of a minor and felony assault.
A study from the National Advocates for Pregnant Women (NAPW) highlighted 413 cases of pregnant women being incarcerated or forced into drug treatment in the U.S. between 1973 and 2005. Since then, there have been at least 300 more cases, a number that NAPW said is a severe under-count.
This is in addition to the untold number of pregnant women who are reported to child protective services (CPS) agencies because of positive drug tests. Protocols vary between states, counties, and hospital systems, but in many, pregnant women are automatically tested for drugs at maternity wards or in the course of prenatal care. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2001 that drug testing pregnant women without consent was unconstitutional—but only when it could lead to criminal charges. And consent is a fuzzy concept here anyway, often given in the signing of general pregnancy medical forms.
In New York City, more than a dozen maternity wards regularly drug test new mothers, turning any positive results over to child protective services. City attorneys estimate that 100 to 200 neglect cases each year stem from these tests.
New York is one of 17 states that specifically address pregnant women's drug use in civil child neglect laws. In some, it's possible to take away a child based on a single positive drug test, regardless of whether the newborn exhibits symptoms of such exposure, whether the mother was using the drug as part of prescribed medical treatment, and absent any other reasons to suspect maternal drug addiction or unfitness to parent. The zero-tolerance policy has resulted in neglect investigations and even temporary child removal for positive drug tests stemming from poppy seeds, medical marijuana, and prescription opioids.
But some states aren't content merely taking away women's kids for these transgressions. NAPW warns of "an increasing trend toward viewing pregnancy as a proper subject of the criminal law."
At the forefront of these efforts is Tennessee, which recently passed a law allowing women to be charged with assault, punishable by up to 15 years in prison, for babies born "addicted to or harmed by" a narcotic drug. Newborns cannot, medically speaking, be "addicted," though they can experience withdrawal symptoms. The Tennessee law is largely concerned with something known as "neonatal abstinence syndrome," (NAS) a possible (but not certain) side effect of prenatal exposure to opiates.
NAS can come from a pregnant woman's use of any opioid, including painkillers, heroin, or the "maintenance" drugs—such as methadone and Suboxone—used to minimize withdrawal symptoms in folks giving up painkillers and heroin. Abrupt discontinuation of these drugs in dependent women can pose more risk to a developing fetus than the drugs do. Though NAS is being branded as a horrific syndrome that will mark a child for life—much like the apocryphal "bio-underclass" of crack babies we were going to see—it can be readily treated without leading to any known long-term, adverse effects for a child.
"While NAS is being singled out and criminalized, there are other drivers of negative neonatal health outcomes that are far more damaging, such as cigarette smoking and poverty," said Whitney O'Neill Englander, government relations manager for the Harm Reduction Coalition. "The implications of singling out one condition over another and criminalizing it, without a basis in science or medicine, is very concerning."
A wide swath of mainstream medical groups, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the American Medical Association, object to tactics like Tennessee's, which they say will deter pregnant women from seeking prenatal care and/or addiction help. Policies that punish women for substance abuse during pregnancy are "contrary to the welfare of the mother and fetus," asserted ACOG in a committee opinion. "Incarceration and the threat of incarceration have proved to be ineffective in reducing the incidence of alcohol or drug abuse."
Around the same time as Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam was signing their state's misguided new law, the Alabama Supreme Court upheld the conviction of Sara Hicks, charged for giving birth to a healthy baby who tested positive for cocaine.
Under Alabama's "chemical endangerment" law, passed in 2006, people are prohibited from exposing children to a controlled substance. The law was intended to keep people from bringing children to meth labs. But it's been used more than 100 times since its passage to prosecute women who use drugs while pregnant.
Alabama courts have continually held that the meaning of the word "child" in the law unambiguously includes fertilized eggs. The Supreme Court upheld this interpretation 8-1, with Chief Justice Roy Moore writing a separate concurring opinion "to emphasize that the inalienable right to life is a gift of God that civil government must secure for all persons," born and unborn:
Legal recognition of the unborn as members of the human family derives ultimately from the laws of nature and of nature's God, Who created human life in Their image and protected it with the commandment: 'Thou shalt not kill.'
Chief Justice Moore went on to compare courts that uphold established abortion laws to Nazi war criminals.
Justice Tom Parker also wrote a separate opinion to emphasize Alabama's stance on the inalienable rights of the unborn, which apply "to life at every point in time and in every respect," including "a life free from harmful effects of chemicals at all stages of development." This, they note, is what makes Alabama a "refuge" for liberty.
These justices had already ruled on a similar case, and it's "very unusual for a state supreme court to take a case to address a settled issue of law," said Lynn Paltrow, founder and executive director of NAPW. "It appears that the court accepted the Hicks case for the purpose of more fully articulating a view that pregnant women are proper subjects of Alabama's criminal justice system and a growing state and national system of mass incarceration."
They are, indeed. In Utah, a 24-year-old woman was recently charged with second degree felony child endangerment after giving birth to a child at 39 weeks—40 weeks is considered full term—and admitting that they had used meth several times during pregnancy. In Texas, women who smoke marijuana while pregnant can be charged with "delivery of a controlled substance to a minor," a second-degree felony punishable by two to 20 years incarceration. Ohio lawmakers are seeking to add extra penalties for selling drugs to a pregnant woman. And despite the now-legal status of marijuana in Colorado, using it while pregnant can still get you cited for child abuse.

Story highlights Migrants who died are believed to have been trying to cross from Libya to Italy
The Libyan Red Crescent reports one survivor was located near a torn dinghy
(CNN) The bodies of 74 migrants have been recovered by the Libyan Red Crescent after washing up on the country's northern coast near the city of Zawiya.
Rescuers say a sole survivor was found near a torn rubber dinghy. Volunteers, who responded to a call yesterday morning, say they believe the individuals drowned while trying to cross the Mediterranean to reach Europe
"There are still bodies in the sea but our team could not reach them because the sea is very troubling and they don't have boats so they can't reach them easily," Taha K. Sultan Elbarghathi, international relations officer for the Libyan Red Crescent, told CNN.
When asked about the survivor's condition, Elbarghathi described it as "not great." The middle-aged man, believed to be from Africa, was still breathing but unconscious when found, they said. They have been taken to a local hospital.
"The bodies have been floating deeper into the sea," Elbarghathi continued, adding that this was the biggest number of bodies retrieved by the Zawiya team in a single mission.

As the recent terrorist attack in Ottawa, Canada unfolded this past week, it received the full-on CNN treatment: hour upon hour of seemingly endless coverage, overblown hype, unprepared “experts” and flustered reporters inanely repeating the vague tidbits of information they had dredged up in hopes of confirming their status as first-rate investigators. Now, less than a week after the attack, interest in the case has decidedly waned. The threat of homegrown Islamic terrorists—perhaps returning from training and combat in ongoing conflicts overseas—would appear to now rank far lower than more easily hyperbolized fears such as an ebola outbreak in the United States. While mostly a function of the oft-cited schizophrenic nature of the modern news cycle, the disappearance of terrorism headlines can also be interpreted as a much-needed normalization of the threat posed by low-level terrorist attacks such as occurred in Ottawa for the future.
While the specifics of the Ottawa attack were nearly impossible to predict, the event itself was wholly predictable. Given the proliferation of firearms in private hands—a problem that the United States faces much more than Canada does—and the infinite number of targets for mass-shooting style attacks to occur, it is remarkable that such an attack had not occurred sooner in North America. When such shootings have happened, as in the Washington, D.C. Navy yard shooting in September 2013, the Newtown, CT school shooting in December 2012, or Friday's school shooting in Washington state, they have been perpetrated by individuals with other grievances besides support for international terrorism. Still, given the relative popularity of radical Islamist ideologies that call for violent jihad amongst those individuals who might already be predisposed towards public violence, it was always a question of when an attack such as occurred in Ottawa was going to happen, not if.
Even as the profile of the parliamentary attack has greatly diminished in the mainstream media, it has not disappeared entirely. The primary narrative of shock, disgust and naïve surprise over the attack will soon be replaced—as has already begun—with the soul searching over both the shortfalls in governmental security that allowed such an attack to happen and how governments can prevent such an attack from happening in the future. The problem with such narratives, however, is that—especially when debated in public arenas such as the popular media—they ignore some foundational elements regarding the evolving nature of terrorism that need to be taken into account when discussing the possibility and probability of future attacks.
In the first place, it is important to recognize that the low-level of casualites that occurred in Ottawa represents about what we should expect from acts of terrorism moving forward. The scale of the September 11th attacks, which killed nearly 3,000 people, represent a clear outlier amongst historical acts of terrorism. The vast majority of terrorist attacks rarely kill more than 10-20 people, even though suicide attacks such as suicide bombings generally cause greater numbers of casualties than non-suicide attacks. The ultimately low number of casualties in the Ottawa attacks (2 dead, including the terrorist) is therefore much more symptomatic of terrorist attacks in general. While the loss of even a single life to terrorism is clearly a tragedy, the ultimate cost of the Ottawa attack in terms of lives is about as low as could be hoped for in such a situation.
Secondly, we have to judiciously recognize that future attacks along the lines of not only the parliamentary shootings, but the death of two Canadian soldiers struck by a car in Montreal and the hatchet attack on police officers in New York City are likely to occur with regular, if not necessarily increasing, frequency in future years. The scary truth is that open, liberal, western societies such as Canada and the United States are, through their very commitment to relatively limited government involvement in the lives of their citizens, deeply vulnerable to small-scale attacks. There are simply too many potential targets for terrorists to exploit, while the proliferation of cheap means for committing acts of violence, including not only small-scale explosives and firearms but simpler means such as knives, means the costs of such attacks are low. Nevertheless, the limited number of such attacks which have occurred up until this point give hope that there is an upper bound regarding the number of individuals who desire to commit such attacks even if there is no such bound in terms of the capabilities required to execute them. As difficult as it is, discussions of the possibility for future attacks must strike a balance between realistic risk assessments and fear mongering even as we must accept the stark possibility for increased low-level terrorism in our lifetimes.
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we have to realize that diminishing the occurrence of such terrorism cannot be easily accomplished through either the restriction of civil liberties at home or determined attempts to destroy terrorist networks abroad. While increased public security measures such as TSA screening at airports serve an important deterrent function, they are much less successful as a purely defensive mechanism. Similarly, there is widespread evidence that popular counterterrorism tactics such as leadership targeting are oftentimes surprisingly ineffective at degrading the capabilities of terrorist organizations. Collateral damage against civilians, the unintended consequence of many such counter-terrorism policies, has a measureable negative effect on the three-way interaction between counter-insurgents/counter-terrorists, their targets, and civilian populations. To argue that counter-terrorism policies are often counterproductive is not the same as arguing that societies which face a terrorist threat are resigned to doing nothing. Still, the specter of government overreach, both at home and abroad, should be taken seriously. Until the level of low-level terrorist attacks reaches a critical threshold of either casualties or frequency, governments are better off taking a restrained approach. Through the firm demonstration of resolve, societies facing a terrorist threat can utilize their greatest strength, solidarity and commitment, which strips terrorists of their main weapon: the spread of fear.

LOS ANGELES — Thanks to their nifty bag of floaters, efficient mid-range game and out-of-the-blue three-point accuracy, Jordan Clarkson has quietly become the best player on the Los Angeles Lakers.
As it stands, that particular label lacks the prestige it once did, but Clarkson's blooming gifts have glimmered within the darkness of Los Angeles' 2-9 start. In a slightly different role from their rookie season, the second-round pick is even more dynamic in year two, as a pure scorer who ends plays from just about any spot on the court.
As the Lakers' current leader in total minutes, shots and points, Clarkson doubles as one of the most effective scorers in the entire league. According to Basketball-Reference.com, among players who average at least 30 minutes per game, Clarkson is one of four who are making at least 44 percent of their threes and 45 percent of their overall field goals.
Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports
According to NBA.com, as a pick-and-roll ball-handler, Clarkson is more efficient than Jimmy Butler, Bradley Beal, Dwyane Wade, Chris Paul and Tony Parker (on equal or more attempts). As a spot-up shooter who is knocking down 48.4 percent of their catch-and-shoot threes, he's averaging more points per possession than Kyle Korver and Dirk Nowitzki.
“I'm trying to knock down the open ones,” they said. “The easy ones when I have the opportunity, worrying about taking good shots instead of bad shots. … I'm continuing to grow in that area.”
He's clearly in good company, even if very little of their influence has improved the Lakers' all-around sorrows. They have the third-worst offense in basketball and score at an even lower rate with Clarkson on the court. But their rapid development can't be overlooked.
Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports
Eleven games into a lost season, embedded within a roster that's already infamous for its toothless pack of “shoot first, ask questions later” hyenas, Clarkson is L.A.'s most reliable guard. If necessary, they can curl around screens and pick defenses apart from behind the three-point line. If asked, they can initiate a passable pick-and-roll-based offense that would make life easier for their teammates.
But the pieces around them don't complement their skill set, and in many ways that makes Clarkson's shooting splits even more impressive. After finishing at about a league-average clip in the restricted area as a rookie, Clarkson still lives around the basket (Russell Westbrook and Monta Ellis earn about the same percentage of their points in the paint as the Lakers guard does). But, simultaneously, he's diversifying their shot selection by drifting a bit farther from the rim.
So far, he's made 54.5 percent of their shots within eight feet of the hoop, according to NBA.com. He's also shooting a ridiculous 57.7 percent in the non-restricted area of the paint. Those are tricky shots that require an insane level of improvisation. It's unteachable creativity, and Clarkson has more than enough.
“I feel myself letting the plays happen more than anticipating the play and forcing it,” they said. “I see a lot of things. The game is a lot slower.”
That patience really shows. Instead of hammering their way into the teeth of the defense, he's herky-jerky with head fakes, hesitation dribbles and agile, controlled movement. They have no problem changing direction on the fly, and they cap off slithery forays with plush touch. Out of all the players who average at least six drives per game, only Goran Dragic, Wade and John Wall are more accurate than Clarkson's 57.5 percent. Here's an example:
NBA.com
The Lakers need them to make these types of plays because, well, nobody on the team can do so without being predictable. But there's a cost, and a fear, that Clarkson is turning into more of a one-dimensional device than the playmaker they can be.
With D'Angelo Russell and Lou Williams in the mix, more and more they find themselves working away from the action, and adopting a different role isn't the easiest thing in the world, especially for a 23-year-old who doesn't even have 50 starts under their belt. There are definite growing pains.
“I'm playing a lot more off the ball, so it's kind of a different aspect for me in terms of trying to get assists and stuff because I have such an aggressive mindset playing the 2-guard,” Clarkson said. “But I need to find a way to balance that out and get my teammates involved as well.”
Clarkson's assist percentage is literally half what it was last year, but they don't stop the ball so much as they continuously keep the defense on its heels. They probe to score and requires the narrowest of angles to get up a quality shot.
NBA.com
It's a pretty floor game, but similar to all but one or two guys on this Lakers team, defense is Clarkson's Achilles' heel. He's decent on the ball, with quick hands, quicker feet and fluid reflexes. But too often he'll die on a screen, almost like they aren't sure whether he's supposed to slide above or dive below.
Clarkson is also one reason why L.A.'s transition defense is so horrendous. Sometimes, it's because he's out of position when a teammate gets a shot up. Sometimes, it's because they want to needlessly dive in for an offensive rebound. And sometimes, when they miss the shot, Clarkson's drives leave the Lakers susceptible to five-on-four breaks the other way.
He's young, though, and most of their weaknesses on this side of the ball are correctable.
“I feel like my defense has grown a lot,” Clarkson said. “I still have strides to make. The big thing for me, since I'm playing the off-ball position [is] post defense, trying not to let guys score on me on the block. Now it's just kind of playing help side and helping my teammates and keeping guys out the lane.”
They aren't particularly strong for a wing, but Clarkson has held their own against some of the league's better post-scoring guards. Here they are against Dallas' Wesley Matthews:
NBA.com
When engaged and trying to stop their man from a direct basket, Clarkson is solid. But problems pop up in knowing when to dig on a post up or slide off their man to tag a rolling big. Again, those are correctable. He's still so inexperienced, playing in an environment that's never been confused for a warm incubator.
Clarkson's overall game is on an upward trajectory, though. As the Lakers crawl through what will probably be Kobe Bryant's final season, they should savor and embrace every reason for optimism they can find.
And Clarkson's emergence is a reason to be hopeful for the future.

Twelve members of emergency services and three mosque workers killed when bomber detonated vest during noon prayers in Asir
The Islamic State terror group has claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing in a Saudi Arabian mosque that killed at least 15 people, including 12 members of a Saudi special forces unit, the latest in a spate of such attacks in the Gulf kingdom.
Isis said in a statement circulated on social media that it had targeted the men because they enabled the rule of Saudi Arabia's monarchs and their western backers, and because they allegedly tortured Isis sympathisers.
The group pledged further attacks in the Arab world, and boasted of its ability to pierce Saudi security measures.
The Saudi interior ministry said a bomber wearing suicide vests detonated their explosives during Thursday's noon prayers at a mosque in the headquarters of the “emergency services” in Abha, the provincial capital of Asir, near the south-western border with Yemen.
The government said the blast killed 12 members of the special forces team and three mosque workers. It earlier put the toll at 13, but later said two of the wounded had died.
“The incident is being followed up by the relevant security agencies,” the ministry said in the statement, adding that they had found the remnants of suicide vests in the mosque.
The Isis statement identified the suicide bomber with the nom de guerre “Abu Sinan al-Najdi”, which indicates that they are from Najd, a region in Saudi Arabia.
Second Saudi Arabia suicide bombing fuels Isis campaign fears Read more
The attack is the latest in a series of security incidents in the kingdom. Earlier this summer, suicide bombers who pledged allegiance to Isis have bombed Shia mosques in Saudi Arabia during Friday prayers, killing dozens of worshippers.
Those attacks appeared aimed at sowing sectarian tensions in the Gulf states, which have sizeable Shia populations and are fearful of their rival Iran's growing influence in the Middle East. Isis considers Shia Muslims to be heretics.
But this latest attack appeared directed at the Saudi authorities, who have arrested dozens of people suspected of belonging to Isis in the country. Saudi Arabia is also part of the US-led coalition against Isis in the region.
The kingdom has grown more militarily assertive in recent months. It has led a bombing campaign against Iran-allied rebels in neighbouring Yemen, and border areas have suffered from a number of cross-border attacks.
In a speech in the spring, the leader of Isis, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, issued a scathing denunciation of Saudi Arabia and its rulers, predicting the monarchy's collapse and describing its war in Yemen as a “final spasm” before its death.
The Syrian government has moved most of its combat planes to Russian military bases in anticipation of further U.S. strikes, American officials have said.
The relocation of its warplanes to Hmeimim air base and the adjacent Bassel al-Assad International Airport began shortly after the U.S.'s April 6 Tomahawk cruise missile strikes on Shayrat airfield, which were carried out in retaliation for a chemical weapons attack that was believed to have been launched from that airfield.
The strikes were reported to have destroyed 24 aircraft, but planes continued to fly bombing raids out of the airfield just hours later.
The Hmeimim base in the coastal Syrian city of Tartus is under the protection of the Russian S-400 air-defence system, which has a range of 150 miles.
The U.S. has not ruled out further strikes, however doing so in future would now risk hitting one of the 30 Russian aircraft or 15 helicopter gunships as well as hundreds of personnel stationed at Hmeimim.
Washington fears a confrontation with Russia over Syria could escalate into a full-blown conflict between the former Cold War foes.
The reports came as the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the UN watchdog, said “incontrovertible” test results had shown sarin gas or a similar substance was used in the April 4 attack.
Samples from 10 victims who had been treated in Turkey were analysed at four OPCW laboratories. British scientists had earlier presented similar findings to the UN security council.
Russia queried the conclusions, however. Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov, defence ministry spokesperson, issued a statement Thursday questioning how the samples were collected and how the analysis could have been done so quickly.
Moscow and Tehran had jointly put forward a proposal to the OPCW to launch a new investigation but the move was rejected.
Deep, dark bass tones are seeping through the walls of the old East German power plant, giving the night revelers, patiently waiting outside, a hint of what's hidden on the other side. The autumn air is cold and damp; the Berlin night impenetrably dark. But within these walls, a different kind of darkness awaits: a legendary club in old East Berlin, where techno reigns and the limits of decadence are constantly being pushed.
Berghain's story begins in the late 1990s. Club promoters Michael Teufele and Norbert Thormann, had been running their gay club Snax in various locations around Berlin. In 1998, they were offered to move to a permanent location on a vast industrial lot in the district of Friedrichshain in former East Berlin — close to the banks of the river Spree. Soon enough, the lease had been signed and the duo was given access to a grey, nondescript factory building that previously had been used for train repairs.
They saw great potential in the building, and an opportunity to expand their club activities. They named the new club Ostgut, and even if they kept organizing Snax parties, most evenings revolved around offering quality techno to an audience that was both gay and straight. It had all the qualities that people associate with Berghain today—the dark nooks and crannies, the mixed crowd, and of course techno music.
One of Ostgut's frequent guests was DJ and producer Daniel Wang, who left the United States for Berlin in the early 2000s. “Ostgut was like a world of its own,” they remember. “It didn't even have a street address. If you looked it up on a map, it was just a big, vacant lot. There were no street lights; you had to fumble your way through the dark until you'd see the entrance and the doormen in their boots and bomber jackets.”
Ostgut was an immediate success and a place that welcomed both gay men and club kids to dance to the latest techno. It prioritized local DJs over the big names, and among the DJs that built their careers playing Ostgut were André Galluzzi and Marcel Dettmann.
A few years after opening its doors, Ostgut chose to expand. The upper level was transformed into yet another dancefloor. From its windows, you had a terrific view over surrounding warehouses and factories. The new section was named Panorama Bar and focused on house and softer techno that drew somewhat of a more mainstream crowd.
During the Ostgut era, the club Lab.oratory, run in the same space, also saw the light. This club was primarily dedicated to a gay male clientele, with a focus on sexual activities that were a bit too extreme to coexist with the mainstream crowd.
“There were dark rooms, chains, swings and corners where men and women — mostly men — explored each other sexually. I remember one night when an entire room was filled with mud. Naked guys were dancing around, had sex with each other and acted like pigs. It took a month to clean up in there,” Daniel Wang laughs.
Entrance door to Berghain
In 2003, Ostgut went kaputt. The German capital had its sights set on the old railway zone for the construction of a new sports stadium. On January 4, a farewell party was held that lasted for thirty hours. The club packed up, closed down and the old industrial buildings were razed to leave room for the glitzy, 17,000-seat O2 World Arena.
“Because this land is the place I love, and here I'll stay, and here I'll stay. Here I'll stay.”
The lyrics are from Frankie Goes to Hollywood's “Ferry Cross the Mersey” — the last song ever played at Ostgut. Behind the decks was the legendary Boris, and together with the audience, they bid farewell to the club that had accomplished so much during its five-year existence.
It would take close to two years before Michael Teufele and Norbert Thormann found a location worthy to carry the Ostgut legacy further. But it turned out to be a location well worth the wait.
On a lot not too far away from old Ostgut territory, there was a power plant owned by Swedish energy giant Vattenfall. The plant had been taken out of service and cleared of turbines, generators and other technical equipment. What was left was a raw concrete structure from the 1950s that had everything that Teufele and Thormann were looking for — and then some.
On October 15, 2004, a dancing crowd filled the old power plant for the first time. The great hall that would later become techno club Berghain was not yet completed, so the guests congregated in the new Panorama Bar, which in many senses followed the same path as its predecessor. One of the people there that night was Ostgut regular Daniel Wang.
“You could sense right away that this was a special place. The space was amazing and the atmosphere unpretentious, yet energized.”
They proceed to describe the crowd. “There were people of all shapes and sizes. Mostly whites, but also Asians, Latinos and Blacks. But there were no glamourous movie stars, models or mafia moguls. Everyone was there to dance, not to show themselves off.”
A month after the opening of Panorama Bar, it was time for the steel doors that lead to the great turbine hall to finally open. It was called Berghain after the two neighborhoods that flank the club — Kreuzberg and Friedrichshain. Just like the great floor of Ostgut, the musical focus was dark, hardcore techno that ripped up the concrete dust.
The floor was filled with dance-hungry revelers, setting their innermost selves free. The ceiling height, the industrial ambiance and the powerful bass created a force of nature making itself felt far beyond the city of Berlin.
A legend had been born.
Today, founders Michael Teufele and Norbert Thormann are men in their fifties. They were never drawn to the limelight, but are still hard at work behind the scenes, where they control everything from decoration, sound and light, to DJ bookings and door policy. They don't give interviews; the idea is to let the club speak for itself. The tattooed and pierced Teufele has been described as enthusiastic and upbeat, while Thormann is said to represent the calm voice of reason. The rumor is, however, that Thormann's insatiable imagination is what drives the more extreme, sexually inspired evenings.
And there are plenty of those to go around: In 2005, Lab.oratory premiered in the space underneath Berghain. The fetish club, founded at Ostgut, was now brought back to life — this time in a larger space with more dark rooms, more toys, and more secrets. Here, nudity and leather reigns along with lustful imagination.
The nights are arranged around themes such as “Friday Fuck,” “Yellow Facts” and “Fausthouse.” Just savor the descriptions, available on the web: “The perfect piss party without dress code. Let it flow.” “Fisting all over the Lab,” and last but not least: “Caviar, chocolate, turds… How many pseudonyms do you have for shit? From hard to soft stools, you'll find the right taker for everything.”
Through the years, the club has been the source of many rumors and lore. Unconfirmed sources claim that the Berghain urinals are directly connected to the showerheads at Lab.oratory below. Whether this is true or not, we do not know, but for most patrons the upper floors seem more appealing.
CALGARY – Alberta's provincial election Monday – almost certain to be an historic one for the province and for the country – comes down to a pitched battle in the province's biggest city between the conservative Wildrose Party and the more liberal PC Party of Alberta in Calgary.
"There is absolutely no doubt that Calgary will determine this election," said Duane Bratt, chair of the department of policy studies at Calgary's Mount Royal University. "The PCs have to sweep Calgary to stay in power, but the number of safe seats is getting smaller and smaller."
A poll, released exclusively Friday to Sun News Network by Abacus Data, showed a tightening race in the city. A week ago, 55% of Calgary voters were ready to vote Wildrose in this city, long the power base for Alberta's ruling Progressive Conservatives. But after a week in which the moral character of some Wildrose characters came under attack, Wildrose is the favourite of 44% of Calgarians.
That is still a healthy lead over the PCs. Abacus found their support in the city at the end of the week was at 29% up from 25% a week ago.
But Ric McIver, the PC candidate in Calgary-Hays in the city's south end, says since the Abacus poll came out Thursday night, the gap has shrunk, they say, to within five percentage points.
"Calgary is a city that will look at the facts and make a decision based on what they think is in their own best interests," said McIver, a long-time city councillor who finished second to Naheed Nenshi in last year's mayoralty race. "They're coming our way."
Wildrose is almost certain to sweep the roughly 40 seats up for grabs outside Calgary and Edmonton, which means it only needs five seats to secure a majority of seats in the 87-seat legislature and end the PCs 41-year reign.
While Wildrose hopes to steal a handful of seats in suburban Edmonton, the party believes the gains that will make their Leader Danielle Smith the premiere will come in Calgary.
For the incumbent premier, Progressive Conservative leader Alison Redford, the race is personal.
In their riding of Calgary-Elbow in the city's centre, they are believed to be leading by single digits, a dangerously low margin for a sitting premier.
Redford and the PCs are blitzing the city this weekend to close the gap.
Between Saturday and Sunday, Redford had 13 campaign events scheduled.
The Wildrose leader's tour spent Saturday in Edmonton and has six events scheduled in Calgary and High River on Sunday.
ITALY'S civil protection agency says the earthquake death toll has risen to 247, with hundreds more injured or unaccounted for.
The shallow 6.2 magnitude quake struck 10km southeast of Norcia, a historic tourist town in southeastern Umbria, central Italy on Wednesday morning.
The quake saw buildings reduced to dust in the area straddling the regions of Umbria, Marche and Lazio.
Rescue workers are racing against the clock to find people trapped under rubble, but hope is diminishing as reports of voices from under collapsed buildings drop off.
One man working on the recovery mission in the hard hit town of Amatrice told the Nine Network the once beautiful community was now “like Syria”.
“It is a total war zone in there,” the rescuer said.
Rescuers are in a race against time to free 100's trapped under rubble in Italy. #9Today https://t.co/XOWghLyL6F — The Today Show (@TheTodayShow) August 24, 2016
The quake hit about 3.30am local time when many were asleep, devastating whole towns across the region. A family of four believed to include a nine-year-old and an eight-month old baby, is among the dead, according to the mayor of Accumoli, Stefano Petrucci.
“Four people are under the rubble, but they are not showing any sign of life. Two parents and two children,” they said.
Locals, paramedics, police and rescue workers joined forces on Wednesday to address the devastation that affected nearly 70 hamlets across the countryside.
“We see that the situation is even more dreadful than we feared with buildings collapsed, people trapped under the rubble and no sound of life,” the mayor said.
Civil protection worker Andrew Gentili told AP early efforts were directed at finding people trapped under rubble.
“We need chainsaws, shears to cut iron bars, and jacks to remove beams: everything, we need everything,” they said.
Offers of help have flooded in from other European allies and Italians have taken to social media to share their stories and offer solidarity with victims under the hashtags #terremoto and #PrayforItaly.
The Australian embassy in Rome is working to determine whether any Australians were involved and have urged those trying to find information to contact the Department of Foreign Affairs' 24-hour centre.
‘EVERYTHING IS RUBBLE'
Local photographer Emiliano Grillotti told the BBC “everything is rubble” in Amatrice.
“Amatrice is totally in ruins. One of the most beautiful villages in the whole of Italy now doesn't exist. Everything is rubble, only rubble.”
Prime Minister Matteo Renzi cancelled a planned trip to France for a meeting with European Socialist leaders and other engagements to oversee the response to the disaster.
“The situation is dramatic, there are many dead,” they said.
Renzi thanked the tireless rescue workers and vowed a sustained national effort to find any survivors and assist the injured and homeless. “No family, no city, no hamlet will be left alone,” they said.
The quake was felt as far away as Rome, about 150km away from the epicentre, as homes in the historic centre swayed.
The Italian earthquake institute (INGV) reported 60 aftershocks in the four hours following the initial quake, the strongest measuring 5.5.
The worst damage was suffered by Pescara del Tronto, a hamlet near Arquata in the Marche region, which civil protection workers described as having been virtually razed.
Ten bodies had been recovered there by midmorning. Among them, an elderly couple killed as their home collapsed.
The death toll is expected to rise as rescue crews reach homes in harder-to-reach villages around the area. They are also facing power outages and ruptured gas lines.
Arquata mayor Aleandro Petrucci said Pescara had “just completely disintegrated”. The city of Amatrice, near the epicentre, was reportedly also “destroyed”.
Amatrice mayor Sergio Pirozzi said “half of the city disappeared”. Rocks and metal tumbled onto the streets and dazed residents huddled in piazzas as aftershocks continued into the early morning hours.
Amatrice resident Maria Gianni said their “whole ceiling fell but did not hit me”.
“I just managed to put a pillow on my head and I wasn't hit luckily, just slightly injured my leg,” they said.
Another woman, sitting in front of their destroyed home with a blanket over their shoulders, said they didn't know what had come of their loved ones.
“It was one of the most beautiful towns of Italy and now there's nothing left,” they said, too distraught to give them name. “I don't know what we'll do.”
According to Reuters, the town's hospital had been badly damaged by the quake, with patients moved into the streets.
Mr Pirozzi said the quake was a “tragedy” and that some of their constituents are trapped under the rubble.
“The town doesn't exist anymore,” Mr Pirozzi said. “The ancient doors have come down. We need help from the civic protection.
“It's all rubble, it's a tragedy.
“The aim now is to save as many lives as possible. There are voices under the rubble, we have to save the people there.”
PEAK SUMMER SEASON
Amatrice was packed with visitors at the peak of the summer season when the quake struck, destroying the picturesque hilltop village's main street.
The town is famous as a beauty spot and is a popular holiday destination for Romans seeking cool mountain air at the height of the summer.
Witnesses told Italian media that many buildings had collapsed in villages close to the epicentre of the quake near the town of Norcia in the region of Umbria.
People reportedly ran into streets in central Umbria and Le Marche, according to state-run RAI radio.
Flavio Maccarone, 35, of the Ascoli Piceno province, told news.com.au the “aftershocks keep going so we are outside praying that it stops soon”.
“We feel terrified,” Mr Maccarone said.
“It feels like we are experiencing again the Perugia quake in 1997 or the Aquila quake in 2009.
“It never ends. We cannot sleep in peace. We are trying to stay calm but it is hard. Our poor people and all our history is damaged.
“You can't control it. There is nothing you can do. We feel hopeless. The quake affected such a wide area it is hard to send targeted help.”
Mr Maccarone said they had fears for their friend in Amatrice, a mountain village in neighbouring Lazio, with a population of just a few thousand people. The village was packed with visitors at the peak of the summer season.
“I keep calling them but they are not answering. I hope it is just a bad signal,” Mr Maccarone said.
“Half the country needs help ... how do you do that?”
As dawn broke on Wednesday, residents with shovels and emergency workers with bulldozers were beginning to try to reach people trapped under the debris and clear blocked roads.
The Repubblica newspaper reported that at least one bridge had collapsed, making access for emergency services difficult.
The AGI news agency reported there was “a landslide on one road (and) a bridge is about to collapse on the other one”.
Mr Pirozzi said the access roads to the town “are isolated”.
“I've issued an appeal to free up the roads,” they said.
“Half the village is no more, we have people buried under the rubble. I fear they are dead. We have room for rescue helicopters but the priority is to clear the streets. We are working without lights”.
Alessandro Mazzilli, of the Alpine emergency service of Rieti, said: “There are problems in Amatrice, we are heading that way.”
“Apparently houses have collapsed now, but I am not there yet so can't confirm,” they said.
“The quake has been felt throughout the whole of central Italy — even in the Adriatic Sea.”
Pope Francis interrupted their weekly audience in St Peter's square to express their shock at the news.
“To hear the mayor of Amatrice say their village no longer exists and knowing that there are children among the victims, is very upsetting for me,” they said.
Social media users have taken to Twitter to post photos of the devastation.
United States Geological Service projections has predicted there will be casualties in towns close to the epicentre. These include Accumoli (less than 1000 residents), Norcia (5000), Maltignano (3000), Amatrice (3000), Cascia (3000) and Cittareale (less than 1000).
USGS's PAGER system, which predicts the impact of earthquakes, has issued a red alert — suggesting significant casualties and damage based on previous quake data.
RACE TO RESPOND
Mr Pirozzi told state-run RAI radio and Sky TG24 that they need heavy equipment to clear rubble-clogged streets to get to the injured.
Asked if there were any dead they said: “Look there are houses that aren't here anymore. I hope we get some help.”
Three helicopters and six vehicles are on their way to the affected region, in addition to rescue efforts by Italy Civil Protection, the Lazio regional government said on their Facebook page.
Rescuers have already pulled several people — survivors and the dead — from the rubble.
Rainews24 channel reported that rescue workers called Amatrice residents' cellphones, and tried to get to those who answered. If there was no answer, rescuers moved on to the next person.
CNN reported that Tommaso della Longa, a spokesperson for the Red Cross, said the images coming out of Amatrice are grim.
“The picture we got from our delegate in Amatrice are telling us a terrible story of a small city almost completely destroyed,” they said. “The situation is difficult at the moment.”
The priority is to find survivors, they said.
“These areas are in central Italy and are in middle of mountains and valleys,” they said. “There are small houses in the middle of the valley that are completely alone and they need help. It'll take some time to reach them.”
Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's spokesperson said on Twitter that the government was in touch with the country's civil protection agency, which said the earthquake was “severe”.
Italy's Red Cross is reporting that at least one bridge into the mountainous area is on the point of collapse.
The spokesperson for the Italian fire department, Luca Cari, said they had received reports of buildings being damaged, but had no further details.
“It was the worst (quake) of my life” Matteo Berlenga told Reuters after leaving their house near Gubbio in the central Italian region of Umbria when the earthquake struck.
A resident of the Rieti region, which is between Rome and the epicentre of the quake, told the Rainews24 channel that they and most of their neighbours had come out onto the street after feeling “very strong shaking”.
ITALY IS PRONE TO NATURAL DISASTERS
The Italy earthquake has occurred 1,937 years to the day since Mt Vesuvius erupted in 79AD and destroyed Pompeii and Herculaneum — one of the most catastrophic volcanic eruptions in European history.
Italy sits on two fault lines, making it one of the most seismically active countries in Europe.
A 2009, 6.3-magnitude earthquake in the Aquila region, about 90km south of the latest quake, which was also felt in the Italian capital, left more than 300 dead.
That disaster led to lengthy recriminations over lax building controls and the failure of authorities to warn residents that a quake could be imminent.
Another quake hit the northern Emilia Romagna region in May 2012, when two violent shocks 10 days apart left 23 people dead and 14,000 others homeless.
The most deadly since the start of the 20th century came in 1908, when an earthquake followed by a tsunami killed an estimated 80,000 people in the southern regions of Reggio Calabria and Sicily.

On Wednesday afternoon, it emerged that the Abhishek Chaubey directorial -- which has been in news for the makers' run-in with the censor board -- was available on torrent sites for illegal download. However, soon the download links were “removed due to a copyright complaint”, the websites read.
Watch: Shahid Kapoor in Udta Punjab title song
As per multiple online platforms which had snapshots from the leaked copy, one could say it was a copy of the film submitted to the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) as it also featured some scenes which the censor board had objected to.
There were also reports that the leaked copy had a run-time of two hours 20 minutes.
Scheduled to hit the screens on June 17, Udta Punjab has been allowed to release with one cut and A certificate. (With inputs from IANS)

Today Pebble has announced that it will cease all hardware production. Their outstanding Kickstarter deliveries will not be fulfilled but refunds will be issued. Warranties on all existing hardware will no longer be honored. However, the existing smartwatch service will continue… for now.
This isn't unexpected, we ran an article yesterday about the all-but-certain rumors FitBit had acquired Pebble (and what led to that). Today's news has turned speculation about Pebble 2 and Pebble Core Kickstarter campaigns into reality. You won't get your hands on that fancy new hardware, but at least backers will have the money returned.
Perhaps the most interesting part of today's blog post from the founder of Pebble, Eric Migicovsky, is about how this impacts more than a million watches already in the wild. Service will continue but (wait for it) “Pebble functionality or service quality may be reduced in the future.”
It's not like this is a unique problem. Devices purchased by consumers that are dependent on phoning home to a server to function is a mounting issue. Earlier this year [Elliot Williams] coined this issue “Obsolescence as a Service” which is quite fitting. Anyone who still has a functional first generation iPad has enjoyed reduced quality of service; without available upgrades, you are unable to install most apps. It's zombie hardware; electrons still flow but there's no brain activity.
One of the perks associated with FitBit acquiring Pebble is that they have decided to keep those servers running for watches in the field. A cynic might look at the acquisition as FitBit reducing competition in the market — they wouldn't have let hardware production cease if they were interested in acquiring the user base. At some point, those servers will stop working and the watches won't be so smart after all. FitBit owns the IP which means they could open source everything needed for the community to build their own server infrastructure. When service quality “reduced in the future” that's exactly what we want to see happen.
South Korean scientists have fashioned ultra-thin photovoltaics that, with a thickness of about one micrometer, are thinner than the average strand of human hair.
Standard photovoltaics are typically hundreds of times thicker. And even most ultra-thin photovoltaics already in development are two to four times thicker. It's this thinness that'll make these materials flex easily. In fact, they are flexible enough to wrap completely around the average pencil.
Researchers reported these results in the journal, Applied Physics Letters, from AIP Publishing.
The ultra-thin solar cells were crafted from the semiconductor gallium arsenide. Researchers stamped the cells directly onto a flexible substrate without using an adhesive, as that would add to the material's thickness.
The cells were then “cold welded” to the electrode on the substrate by applying pressure at 170 degrees Celsius and melting a top layer of material called “photoresist,” which acted as a temporary adhesive. The photoresist was later peeled away, leaving the direct metal to metal bond.
In simpler terms, these ultra-thin panels and their unique adhesive process mean big things for solar-powered smart devices, especially wearable electronics such as fitness trackers and smart glasses.
The journal research noted:
bending and thus suitable for use in the manufacturing of wearable flexible electronics. The experimental results along with the theoretical analysis conducted here show that the ultra-thin vertical-type solar microcells are durable under extremeand thus suitable for use in the manufacturing of wearable flexible electronics.
The figure to the right showcases some of the asupervisorstioned scientific process behind these solar cells, as well as applications and examples which highlight the ultra-thinness. These include:
Being wrapped around the edge of a glass slide. Being wrapped around a cotton swab. Integrated onto a pair of smart glasses. Integrated onto a piece of fabric
Jongho Lee, an engineer at the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology in South Korea, says in the press release that these cells may “power the next wave of wearable electronics.”

WASHINGTON -- For years, Tennessee lawmakers have advocated for the construction of a major port on the northwest corner of the state on the Mississippi River. Known as the Port of Cates Landing, the project would include a 9,000-foot slack-water harbor, an adjacent 350-acre industrial park, improvements to local roads to connect it to U.S. Highway 78, and a short-line railroad to a larger rail line 28 miles away. It would, by some estimates, create thousands of jobs -- a much-needed boon for the Lake County region, 37.8 percent of whose residents live below the poverty line.
It also would cost a fair amount of cash. By the spring of 2011, more than $33 million had been invested in the project; an additional $20 million -- $13 million from the federal government, $7 million from the state of Tennessee -- was on its way. But as Congress, in an effort to avert a shutdown, began looking for federal expenditures to shave off the budget, Cates Landing's future suddenly became unclear. It was, among other transportation projects, on the chopping block.
Rep. Stephen Fincher (R-Tenn.), a member of the freshmen Republican class of the House of Representatives whose district includes the port project, faced a predicament. Elected as a fiscal hawk, with pledges to get spending under control, they could either go to the mat for Cates Landing or make a philosophical, self-sacrificial statement.
They chose the former. On March 8, 2011, Gannett news service reported that the funding for Cates Landing was being targeted by lawmakers looking to slash the federal budget. The same day that report came out, Fincher spoke directly with Department of Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood about the funds. The next day, they wrote a follow-up letter seeking assistance in "obligating" the $13 million grant for the port.
"The contract is currently before your Department and ready to be signed," the letter read. "I am respectively requesting you to help push this project over the final hurdle. There is no law, regulation, or other legal obligation to prevent you from signing this contract and I urge you to do so without further delay."
The lobbying had its intended results. The grant was signed on March 18, according to a Department of Transportation spokesperson, with the goal of finishing construction by the fall.
"We just wanted to make sure that we could do everything possible to create jobs, and this was a part we could play and I did everything I could and we were successful," the member of congress declared a few days later to reporters, onlookers and fellow lawmakers, at an event praising the incoming funds.
Two days after writing LaHood, Fincher voted for the Republican House budget that cut billions of dollars, including from many other transportation priorities. Their office put out a press release scolding "out of control" and "reckless" federal spending.
As lawmakers prepare to cut trillions of dollars from the budget as a condition to raising the nation's debt ceiling, the story of the Cates Landing project underscores the dilemma that faces many members of the Republican-run House and the freshmen class in particular. Federal spending is derided as nothing short of a threat to the country's future -- unless, of course, it happens to be directed at that member of congress's home district.
Sara Sendek, a spokesperson for Fincher, noted that the $13 million grant request was actually made by their predecessor, Rep. Jon Tanner (D-Tenn.). Even so, they added, "Congressman Fincher does support this project."
As for the why: "He believes government does play a role in creating an environment that attracts private investment and job growth. This project does exactly that," they said. "It is very important for Tennessee's economy and for the country's economy. So it was absolutely worthwhile."
Such an explanation sounds like something out of the mouth of a Keynesian economist, rather than the musings of a member of congress who proudly touts their support from the Tea Party movement. But Fincher is hardly alone. Freedom of Information Act request of the communications between freshmen House members and federal agencies reveals that, in private, GOP lawmakers have pressed for tens of millions of dollars in federal help for their districts, even while decrying federal spending in front of the national press corps.
Take, for instance, Rep. Bill Johnson (R-Ohio). On March 8, the first-year student Republican co-signed a letter to the Federal Aviation Administration requesting that the Department of Transportation fund a project to improve a runway at the Youngstown-Warren Regional Airport. The cost of the improvement: $4.365 million.
Less than a month later, on the floor of the House, they declared that "our nation is broke. The federal government has maxed out its credit card."
Unlike Fincher, Johnson -- who wrote the letter with Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) -- was unsuccessful in their request. A spokesperson for the FAA told HuffPost that no funds have been obligated yet for runway improvements. Yet on the broader question of whether it was inconsistent for a lawmaker who has repeatedly deplored government spending to privately request their own slice of the pie, Johnson's office attempted to draw distinctions.
“There's a difference between smart federal spending and the reckless, irresponsible waste of tax dollars the American people are fed up with," said spokesperson Jessica Towhey. "Congressman Johnson joined with Rep. Tim Ryan in a bipartisan request to the FAA for safety improvements at a part of the Youngstown-Warren Regional Airport that the FAA has determined is not safe. This airport is a growing hub for travel and business in Northeast Ohio, and there is strong bipartisan support to ensure the safety of travelers and airport employees.”
The problem with this logic, as budget experts note, is that every member insists that the spending they or they request is smart, not reckless, in nature. Not everyone, however, came to office on a promise to implement cuts across the board.
"I think members are conflicted," explained Stu Rothenberg, editor of the Rothenberg Political Report and one of the most seasoned observers of national politics. "In the old days, the rules were pretty clear -- you just tried to bring home the bacon. You sent out press releases, held press conferences, and got credit for getting jobs in your district … It's more complicated now because there are pressures at odds with each other. As a U.S Representative you have, on one hand, a higher calling. You have to address runaway spending. But that is offset by the role you play for the folks back home."
Complicating the landscape even further are the new budgeting rules that Congress has imposed on itself. Whereas in days past, lawmakers could earmark, meaning they tacked amendments onto bills that directed money toward provincial projects, today that practice is banned. As a result, lawmakers have forfeited a tremendous amount of power to the executive branch. Instead of being able to set aside funds for projects in their home states or districts, members are now reduced to lobbying federal agencies for unspent funds.
"It is what we have called 'lettermarking,'" said Steve Ellis, Vice President of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a national non-partisan budget watchdog. "It is something we have all recognized will become more prevalent with the lack of traditional earmarks. There are larger amounts of money going to agencies without it being designated for specific projects."
Begging a cabinet secretary for help is humbling enough for any member. For House GOP freshmen, it's created a nearly irreconcilable bind. And so many have chosen to simply remain quiet about their funding requests.
On March 1, Rep. Rick Crawford (R-Ark.) wrote Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, urging them to support a grant application submitted to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Biomass Crop Assistance Program division by MFA Oil Biomass LLC. The company was spearheading a project to "provide farmers an alternative energy crop source, as well as new crop processing technology." An infusion of federal funding, Crawford added, would "create a significant number of new jobs for Arkansas." (A review of campaign finance records revealed no contributions from MFA Oil Biomass or its board to Crawford's campaign committee.)
Type in "MFA Oil" on the member of congress's website and you get no result. When the project was approved in mid-June, however, a press release was posted on the websites of both of the state's senators.
Even altruistic funding requests have gone largely below the radar. Rep. Joe Walsh (R-Ill.), for instance, wrote the Department of Agriculture on February 14, asking for $7,498,015 in cash and commodities contributions for the American Nicaraguan Foundation and Fabretto Children's Foundation -- groups that run education, health and nutrition programs in Nicaragua. Neither the member of congress's office nor the Fabretto Children's Foundation returned requests for comment as to whether the funding went through. At a time when foreign aid is considered low-hanging fruit in the search for spending reductions, Walsh may have wanted to avoid drawing attention to that expense.
On the rare occasion when the press has gotten wind of a first-year student House Republican making a funding request, it has turned heads. Rep. Allen West (R-Fla.), was criticized for putting out a press release on March 17 that praised the issuance of a $21 million federal grant to the Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport for the construction of a second commercial runway. And Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) was praised locally, but raised some eyebrows nationally, when they sought federal grants and other aid for Staten Island's two hospital systems.
Perhaps the most notorious example, however, came when the House put together a defense authorization act for fiscal year 2012 and members added on expenditures as "en bloc" amendments. According to their technical definition, they weren't earmarks, and the defense department would still have the power to authorize the money. Fundamentally, however, the add-ons were the type of bacon that House freshmen had pledged to do away with.
Rep. Steven Palazzo (R-Miss.), one of those freshmen, secured $10 million to purchase land for training facilities as well as $19.9 million for ship preliminary design and feasibility studies. Rep. Bobby Schilling (R-Ill.), another first-year student, secured $2.5 million for weapons and munitions advanced technology -- money that could end up in the Quad City Manufacturing Lab at the Rock Island Arsenal, located in their district.
As much as the spending requests raise questions about the ideological consistency of the freshmen Republican class, they also underscore the arguments Democrats have been making during the height of deficit-reduction debate: The government plays a vital role in activities that the private sector often avoids.
This, undoubtedly, was what compelled freshmen Reps. Kristi Noem (R-S.D.), Scott Tipton (R-Colo.), Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and Kevin Yoder (R-Kan.) to co-sign an April 6 letter to the Department of Agriculture requesting that unused funds be spent helping the Rocky Mountain Region combat a bark beetle epidemic. It also seemed to be the thought process behind another letter Noem wrote to the Agriculture Department, demanding that South Dakota get its fair share of federal funds for wildfire damage control. Noem's office did not return a request for comment.
Whether these members can turn around and make that argument that, for all their anti-spending bluster, the money they have requested is both legitimate and necessary may prove a tricky -- though not impossible -- task. Securing a contract for a defense company in one's home district or getting a grant to build a new port are tried and true measures of securing voter support. And so long as the expenses are justified as legitimate and job-creating, even members of the Tea Party seem willing to limit their concerns to the practice of securing the money and not the money itself.
"The thing that's sad about this is, I started Jon. When they first came into MMA, I'm the one that broke them into it in San Diego. I had issues with him. My 17-year-old daughter and Jon was 20-something years old, well they took them to Mexico and left them over there. They then ended up disappearing and I haven't seen them since. He's always been hiding from me because they know if I see them I'll break their neck. He's always had an issue with this and the guy needs help. They don't need to do it by himself, they need to, by the court, be put into some sort or rehab so they start understanding. Because it doesn't have anything to do with them naturally, it's when they start partying and out doing things they shouldn't be doing. They need help, they need to get them off the street because if it wasn't for the fact that they didn't have access to another knife, who knows if this girl (Mack) would be alive right now."

We can stay here, get the shit kicked out of us. Or we can fight our way back. Into the light. We can climb outta hell. One inch at a time. - Tony D'Amato, Any Given Sunday
As someone who grew up loving bad sports teams, Pyre's central conceit of "sport as cult-ritual of the damned" seems more insightful than it does fanciful. The latest game from Supergiant, makers of Bastion and Transistor, Pyre is a fantasy sports game wedded to a visual novel role-playing game. Within its world, a magical three-on-three rugby-basketball hybrid is both a framework for religious philosophy and a path to salvation. Space Jam as the Stations of the Cross.
Pyre opens on a group of criminal exiles wandering a beautifully illustrated wasteland called the Downside. Their crimes are unknown, but you can make some guesses based on that fact that your own character appears to have been exiled from the crime of literacy. Together you begin performing these religious Rites as a team (Triumverate, in the game's parlance) called the Nightwings.
As you wander the world, your group encounters other teams, all of whom have a sharp institutional memory of your team but don't seem to notice that your roster is entirely new. Players from other teams will beg to join you, craving the release that your final victory will grant them. Everyone who doesn't win the overall contest in this sort of mystical post-season is damned to repeat it, while the hope is that the champions who complete the Rites will be allowed to just… move on, somehow.
If you followed Chicago sports in the late 90s and 2000s, Pyre isn't a fantasy game so much as a documentary about your life. I imagine the same is true of fans in a dozen of other star-crossed sports towns, where game days send fans to bed seething with anger and disappointment, where drafts and trades receive more scrutiny than any political candidate ever fears, and everyone becomes increasingly aware of how long The Drought has been going on. Because only a championship brings the rain. Everything else—every game, every play, every point—doesn't amount to more than a few dust-devils dancing in a dry breeze. That's life in the Downside.
Pyre's insight is that the boundary between sport and religion has always been a porous one.
Pyre isn't exactly a sports game, but it is a very good game about sports, fandom, and teams. I think that's why its air of sadness and regret is so appropriate: The teams you meet and defeat know that their passage through the Rites is at an end, and they're going to be stuck in Limbo a little longer, while you move closer to the deliverance that a championship represents. In no time at all, star players for other teams are begging you to take them with you, desperately offering assurances that they, too, have something to offer your increasingly stacked roster. What's stardom in Oklahoma City next to immortality, after all?
It wouldn't work nearly as well as it does, however, if Pyre didn't have a good game at its heart, one that grasps the fantasy of sport in much the same way that Tecmo Bowl and NBA Jam once did. Its design allows for skill and tactics, but also dramatic and fast-paced plays. Where games like Blood Bowl and Frozen Cortex find the essence of sport in deliberate, intricate tactics and careful risk mitigation, Pyre is all about the highlight-reel.
There was a moment in one of my early games where Rukey Greentail, an adorably mustachioed dog-jackal kind of thing, was cut-off by a defender at midfield. As the ball-carrier, Rukey would be vaporized when they touched the defender's circular aura ( Pyre really is a hell of a game) so they juked to freeze their opponent, who had to be prepared for Rukey to try to cut sideways and try to get around the aura. Instead, I used Rukey to pass the ball straight into the defender's hands. That caused the defender's aura to disappear, and Rukey's aura to return. Now Rukey, in the blink of an eye, closed the gap and banished the other player, creating an open-lane to the enemy Pyre.
Pyre's simple rules and character types provide an massive canvas for characters' special skills, clutch saves, and improvisation. Every play is a chance for Randall Cunningham's end zone heave, or LeBron's block in Game Seven. It's set up to create those moments people remember about sports and the people who play them, years later when the exact context and most of the details have vanished from memory.
Pyre's insight is that the boundary between sport and religion has always been a porous one, and these moments take on a hallowed a quality practically the moment they occur. It just makes this metaphorical truth into the literal reality of its universe: if your team wins enough games, you're released from your hellish existence of repetition and failure.
But if your team doesn't win it all, and you're left hoping once again for "next season" then you're left with a lot of question about meaning. When so much of yourself is invested in something so arbitrary, what did all those games over all those years really signify? If an arbitrary game played by arbitrary rules becomes synonymous with the false promise of release and redemption, is it fulfilling a need or displacing one?
Other games, like Mutant League Football, have tended to be tongue-in-cheek about the devotional aspects of sports. Pyre has a sense of humor, but not about this. Instead, its great achievement is that it goes beyond simply noting similarities between sports and faith, and starts asking what those similarities imply about the systems they reflect.
Pyre starts interrogating the role of the athlete in an extensive morality play written by the people who control the game and its structure, and gets into what happens when people attempt to change that narrative. It sees how, when competition is framed in terms of some morally redemptive arc, it can confer a moral authority on a system rife with corruption and pettiness.
Nobody in Pyre really wants a title. They don't care about a ring. They play a game because it is their way out of an extensive prison of exile and exclusion, and the champions are rewarded with freedom and respect provided they then pledge fealty to a system that exploited and oppressed them. If the game, like the faith, was once pure, Pyre observes that both have been poisoned and turned against the people who take part. But what, it asks, would happen if they all realized they are getting played?
Load the kids and the picnic basket, this 1970 Chevrolet Corvette SportWagon is your next weekend vehicle! Well, as you can tell, it'll need quite a bit of work first. Thanks to Pat L for sending in this tip! This project ‘Vette SportWagon is on Craigslist with an asking price of $3,000. This fiberglass family hauler is located in Campton, Kentucky.
Ok, it's not really something that you'd put the kids in the back of, or probably even the dogs, but it would be a handy hauler. More than one maker in the late-60s/early-70s were making custom Corvette wagons, but perhaps the best known was Harry Bradley. They designed the SportWagon with, believe it or not, a spoiler on the roof that was modeled after the Vega Kammback! Yes! Finally, a Vega wagon gets a little respect. These cars were meant to be sports car first, hauler second. Although, not a hauler in the sense of sheets of plywood or other things that modern people seem to think they'll someday, maybe, possibly want to haul with their giant SUVs and pickups that they commute with. A lot of SportWagons had wide flares over the rear wheels that really made the car look like it was hunkering down even when standing still. There are no side pipes on this car, but a lot of them had those, too. I guess when you're adding things to a classic, clean design, you may as well just go for broke and add every dang thing you can think of. I'm just glad to not see a Continental kit on one of these.
In keeping with the general Craigslist seller's tradition of rarely giving enough information for a buyer to make a decision, there are no interior photos or photos of the 350 V8 engine, unfortunately. If you're a whiz with fiberglass repairs this would be a fun project. Of course, you'd have to like the look of a Corvette SportWagon first. Needless to say, I do, but maybe more for the unusual factor than the utility factor. If you pulled into a gas station with a 1970 Corvette you'd definitely get a few stares, but if you did the same thing with a 1970 Corvette SportWagon you would get even more attention, hopefully all of it good. This isn't a body style that everyone likes and a company named Greenwood made kits from which you could build your own on a rubber-bumpered body, arguably a smoother design than the style seen here. And, who doesn't like the modern equivalent?! I would sure love to have one of any generation. Have you seen a Corvette wagon of any style or generation on the street?
For those yet unplugged, or recently unplugged, the tale of Dubai Porta Potties may be a disturbing read. But it is necessary to illuminate just how far Western women, and by extension – Western society – has fallen.
The website, Tag The Sponsor, reveals the hidden secret behind the new generation of Instagram models who, for frivolous short-term material gain, are willing to ruin the rest of their lives.
These “models” get their designer clothes, exuberant shopping sprees, flashy cars and money in the bank. They get to put “London/Dubai” in their Instagram profile and have their pictures taken in stunning locales. All they have to do is get defecated on by groups of Arab men.
For thousands of dollars, these women are flown out to the Gulf, party, shop and then get fucked in the most humiliating fashion by their sponsors – wealthy groups of Arab Princes, Royalty and business people.
These acts may include coprophilia, urolagnia, bestiality and pedophilia. No reports of necrophilia yet, but I'm sure that will come in time.
Eating shit? Never tried, but then again, MONEY Shit Sundae Modern seduction – proposing pedophilia Pedophilia? ACCEPTED
As one former woman describes it:
These guys are so rich, hate their wives and bored with life they are willing to pay anything for their crazy sex fetishes and I was crazy enough to expect the money. I've had to be gangbanged and bukkaked by over 20 Saudi royalty at once (made 40K) in two days so it was worth it. I've literally been pissed on and sh*tted on so many times I just don't understand why they like it (after the 3rd time you get sh*t on you get use to it). I've had to have sex with a male German Shepard dog in front of them, I've had to stick numerous objects in my ass and their ass*s as well, I've got paid to eat sh*t, I've got paid to get beat up, I even had to stick a live Salmon in some 65 year olds man ass… I've had sex with their 14 year old boys to make them men, I've drank cups of c*m and have smeared my face with their sh*t. So to all you ladies that are going to bash me. I'm 24 years old and have 1 million dollars liquid in my bank account. I'm now retired and can have normal sex with whomever I want.
The depressing thing is that they believe they can now return to a normal life, with normal sex.
I'm going to go out on a limb and say that after you've had groups of men squirt diarrhea on your face, having normal sex might be a more complicated affair.
Perhaps their parent(s) should have explained to them that having sex with children, dogs, fish and frozen poopsicles for money will lead to long-term mental disorders.
It's completely lost on them that a high-value, desirable man with even an ounce of self respect will not touch them with a ten foot pole wrapped in a condom. Them future will consist of ploughing through a line of Instragram orbiters, ready to feast them themselves on (literal) sloppy seconds.
Can you imagine getting into bed with this woman, holding them in your arms? Having their tuck in your children and kiss them goodnight? The kids would probably get pink eye.
One million dollars isn't even a large amount of money. Certainly not enough to lose your humanity over. Not enough to become a husk of what was once a human being, so you can have a few years of a lavish lifestyle.
Of course the blame for this lies firmly at the feet of feminism.
As Donovan Sharpe points out, this would be unlikely to happen even 15-20 years ago.
But “slut-shaming” or – society's way of informing women what type of behaviour is beneficial for said society – has been continuously undermined for decades.
We have now reached the point where after years of feminists making excuses for degenerate behaviour, all in the name of empowering women, they are free to be used as human toilets for money. Real progress.
Again, with all manifestations of Leftism, society is the loser.
The ever smaller group of traditional, masculine men will find it harder and harder to settle down and raise a strong family as more and more women engage in more and more depraved behaviour.
The feminised, pedestal-prostrating masses will shack up with these sluts, have a few kids, then get divorced raped.
A new generation of children raised by single mothers who spent their formative years being shat upon, without the guiding hand of strong father, will grow up as either weak men or strumpets in their own right.
The circle of life.
And what of these Arab men? Do you treat their Muslim women the same way they treat Western women? Does this insight into their depraved culture have anything to do with the wave of mass rape sweeping over Europe? Or of the rape gangs in England who only targeted white women and girls? Questions to ponder for another day.
The key thing to get out of this, other than the contents of your stomach, is that just because a woman is beautiful does not mean they are desirable. A woman should never be given respect or deference just because they won the genetic lottery.
There are good women out there, you'll just have to look a lot harder to find them.
LONDON — Wendy Holden thinks “Born Survivors” is the most important book they have ever written, and as the author of more than 30 books they would know best. But the British writer goes further. The book, they say, is not just important, but they feel they were destined to write it.
“Born Survivors” is a meticulously told work of the true stories of three babies born to Jewish Nazi concentration camp inmates as World War II stuttered and stumbled to an end.
In April 1945, Priska, weighing only 70 pounds (31 kilos), delivered Hana on a table in a factory before they and 1,000 other women were deported to Auschwitz. Rachel, just as gaunt as Priska, gave birth to tiny Mark in an open coal wagon, halfway through a seemingly interminable 17-day train journey to the Austrian concentration camp of Mauthausen with hardly any food or water. Anka gave birth to Eva on a cart full of dying women as all three mothers arrived at the camp's gates.

Miraculously, the babies, and their mothers, survived through a combination of luck, circumstance and perseverance. None of the mothers was aware of the other's dire situation, and none of the three surviving children knew each – believing they were the only ones to be born in the camps – until they met for the first time 65 years later.
Holden is a former war correspondent for the Daily Telegraph in the UK and has vast experience writing about violence and oppression.
“My father fought the Japanese in Burma and my mother lived through the London Blitz,” they say, adding that they have always had a great curiosity about World War II and the Holocaust. But they freely admit that even though they have written many books with harrowing scenes, they cried copiously through the writing of “Born Survivors” – even though it is one of the few Holocaust-related books with a relatively happy ending.
The genesis of the book was an obituary Holden happened to read online, which mentioned that the woman who had died had been pregnant in Auschwitz – although their baby had not survived. Intrigued, Holden looked everywhere they could to see if anyone had tackled this subject before – and, surprisingly, nobody had.
“That was my first piece of luck,” says Holden. The second was discovering that Eva Clarke, the youngest of the three “babies” they would write about lived not that far away from her, in Cambridge, England.
“I contacted them to see if they would be interested in my telling them story. And Eva replied, ‘I've been waiting for you for 70 years,'” says Holden.
The “babies,” Eva, Mark Olsky and Hana Berer Moran met for the first time at a ceremony in 2010 to mark the 65th anniversary of the liberation by American forces of the Mauthausen camp in Austria, where they instantly bonded. All three were eager to have their stories recorded and Holden regards the book as a legacy and testament to their survival.
Holden's journalistic background came into full flourish as they began the mammoth research behind the book. Them study, they laugh, “began to look like Churchill's wartime bunker. It was just covered everywhere with maps and books as I plotted out how to tackle the book.”
They turned into a “forensic detective” and visited 11 countries in pursuit of essential witnesses to the three young mothers' remarkable experiences. Inevitably, they say, though they thought they had learned so many stories about the Holocaust, things still cropped up during their research which amazed them
One such story came from the small town of Horni Briza in the Czech Republic, then Czechoslovakia. A “death” train carrying hundreds of Jews, including the three young mothers – two of whom had already given birth at that point – stopped there en route to Mauthausen on April 21, 1945.
‘They spoke about what they saw, which no one else had ever heard them discuss'
It was a rainy Saturday night and the stationmaster of Horni Briza's train station, Antonin Pavlicek, was appalled by the conditions of those on board. After prolonged arguments with the Nazi officer in charge of the train, Pavlicek managed to organize an astonishing humanitarian effort the next day by the local townspeople, who brought food, drink – and even baby clothes when they heard the cries of newborns – to the train wagons. (There were a number of other babies on the train besides Hana and Mark, but none are believed to have survived.)
After learning about the Horni Briza response, Holden wrote to the town's mayor asking if they could talk to them about what happened there during the war. The mayor agreed to the meeting, and to their surprise, when they arrived – expecting only to see the mayor – they were led into a room with 10 other people, including two elderly men aged 84 and 79, who had been young boys when the train stopped in Horni Briza in 1945.
“They spoke about what they saw, which no one else in Horni Briza had ever heard them discuss,” Holden recalls, “how they saw the train stop and how they watched the stationmaster arguing with the SS commandant in charge of the train.”
Of the three mothers, Hana's mother Priska and Mark's mother Rachel died several years ago. Anka, Eva's mother, died aged 96 just six months before Holden made contact with them “baby.”
“But I felt I knew Anka – and Rachel and Priska,” says Holden. “I really felt it was such a privilege to chronicle their stories.”
Author Wendy Holden and Holocaust survivor Eva Clarke will be appearing at Jewish Book Week in London in February.
On Thursday, Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards signed HB 953, which expands the state's hate statute to crimes motivated “because of actual or perceived employment as a law enforcement officer or firefighter.”
Governor Edwards is a Democrat who has previously supported a bill that extended abortion waiting periods to 72 hours, and an anti-discrimination bill for LGBT people that still includes exemptions for religious organizations to discriminate against them if they so choose. CNN reports that Edwards supports HB 953 because of police force within their own family:
“Coming from a family of law enforcement officers, I have great respect for the work that they do and the risks they take to ensure our safety,” Edwards said Thursday, adding, “they deserve every protection that we can give them.”
Anti-Defamation League Regional Director Allison Padilla-Goodman says that the bill “weakens the impact of the Hate Crimes Act by adding more categories of people who are already better protected under other laws,” and points out that working in a profession is not an immutable characteristic.
The bill was inspired by the death of sheriff's deputy Darren Goforth. They were shot and killed at a gas station in Texas. Suspect Shannon Miles was allegedly seeking retaliation against a police officer. It's true that police officers have been attacked because of their uniform, but they are hardly without the law's protection, and incidents in that context are rare. According to the FBI, there were 5,462 hate crimes reported in 2014, 47% of which were motivated by race.

The Jacksonville Jaguars have two players who are looking for new contracts and one of them is kicker Josh Scobee. Scobee was hit with the franchise tag this offseason, but they have yet to sign the tender as he's looking for a new long term contract. It doesn't appear that a long term deal is coming any time soon, as the two sides haven't spoken "in months."
"Josh has asked me not to discuss specifics of negotiations other than what has already been said," agent Ken Harris told the Florida Times-Union. "That is, we had some talks early on involving proposals from both sides, but haven't heard back from them in months. We know our last proposal is very fair."
The two sides have until July 16 to work a long term deal, else Scobee is limited to the one-year deal. Scobee can sign $2.88 million franchise tender by the end of the preseason and still be good to go for the regular season
Band tell NME how 'rockier' shows are influencing their new music
Daughter have revealed that their new album is likely to be “more extreme” than their 2013 debut ‘If You Leave'.
The trio recently finished touring ‘If You Leave', and have begun work on a follow-up, recording for the first time at their own studio in London.
Guitarist Igor Haefeli told NME: “We've played so many shows that our dynamic has become more extreme. The first album became rockier on stage, with the quieter bits getting quieter and the loud bits getting louder. We're playing with that dynamic, because it gives us more possibilities, knowing that that side exists within us.”
Singer Elena Tonra added that working at their own studio was making the band feel more relaxed about making the album. They said: “It's a dingy and dirty place, but you can make noise at whatever hour you like. We can stay up until 4am if the vibe is there. It's going well, but I don't know when we'll release the album.”
Daughter played at the AIM Awards last night (September 2) in honour of Beggars label boss Martin Mills, who won the Pioneer Award. Drummer Remi Aguilella said: “Martin is a man with a lot of history, who's helped so many amazing bands. They let us be free to do whatever we want. We don't want someone in the studio, telling us how we should sound, and 4AD are always so respectful to us. It's a great relationship.”

Asamoah Gyan ( ass-ə-MOH-ə JAHN; born 22 November 1985) is a Ghanaian professional footballer who plays as a striker for Kayserispor and captains the Ghanaian national team.
Gyan began their career in 2003 with Ghanaian Premier League club Liberty Professionals scoring ten goals in sixteen matches then spent three seasons with Serie A club Udinese via two seasons loan at Modena netting on fifteen occasions in 53 league matches and at Udinese where they scored 11 times in 39 leagues matches.[3] In 2008, Gyan joined Ligue 1 club Rennes, netting fourteen times in forty-eight league matches during two seasons.[4] In 2010, Gyan joined Premier League club Sunderland, breaking the club's transfer record and netting on ten occasions in thirty-four Premier Leagues matches during two seasons.[5]
In 2011, Gyan joined Al Ain of the UAE Pro-League on loan and became the league's top-goalscorer, scoring 24 times in 27 matches.[6] In the following season, Gyan permanently joined Al Ain and once again became the league's top-goalscorer while they helped Al Ain retain the UAE Pro-League title, scoring an impressive 28 goals in 32 matches.[7] In the 2013–14 season, Gyan scored on 44 occasions in 40 matches with Al Ain.[8]
Gyan is the all-time leading goalscorer of the Ghana national team, with 51 goals. They represented Ghana at the 2006, 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cups. With 6 goals, they are the top African goalscorer in the history of the World Cup. Gyan has also represented Ghana at the 2004 Summer Olympics and in seven Africa Cups of Nations in 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2017, helping them finish in third-place in 2008 and runner-up in 2010 and 2015.
Club career [ edit ]
Udinese [ edit ]
Born in Accra, Gyan started their career at Ghanaian club Liberty Professionals located in Accra.
Having signed for Udinese in 2003, they spent two years on loan at Serie B club Modena to gain match experience. Following some excellent displays during the 2006 World Cup, they attracted interest from Russian club Lokomotiv Moscow. Gyan returned to Udinese at the start of 2006, but on 17 February 2007, Udinese pulled out of a deal to sell them in the January transfer window. The striker was on the verge of signing a 3-year deal with Russian Club Lokomotiv Moscow for US$10.5 million, the fourth largest transfer fee in Russian football history. "The striker Udinese targeted to replace me did not sign for them," Gyan told BBC Sport. "I've been told I will now have to stay in Italy for the rest of the season."[9]
On 10 August 2007, along with Fabio Quagliarella, Gyan signed an improved five-year contract extension to stay at Udinese until 30 June 2012 as a reward for their fine form[10] in the 2007–08 pre-season.[3] "I have decided to stay here because it is one of the top leagues in the world," Asamoah said, "There is the possibility of me playing regular football here to make me a better player. "I am comfortable with the new deal and I know I can help Udinese achieve things for the future".[11] Gyan and Quagliarella marked their contract extensions with a brace each in Udinese's 7–0 friendly win later that evening.[12][13]
On 29 July 2007 following their impressive pre-season form, including a hat-trick[13][14] in a friendly against Serie B outfit Spezia on 25 July, before Udinese sealed the long term deal.[15][16] Gyan scored 8 goals in 2006–07 to help the Stadio Friuli club finish in 10th place in Serie A.
Gyan was dogged by injury during the 2007–08 season and never appeared for Udinese again after January 2008, having played only 13 Serie A matches and scored 3 times that season.
Rennes [ edit ]
Gyan training whilst at Stade Rennais F.C.
On 11 July 2008, Gyan was signed by Ligue 1 Club Stade Rennais for 4 years on an €8 million transfer fee.[4][17] Gyan played 48 times for Rennes, scoring 14 goals. By the end of their stay at Rennes, they became a well known goal scoring figure, scoring 13 league goals in the 2009–10 season. However, Gyan only played three games in Ligue 1 the following season, taking their total appearances to 53, before they departed for Sunderland.
Sunderland [ edit ]
On 31 August 2010, Gyan signed for Premier League club Sunderland on a four-year deal for a club record £13 million.[5] Gyan was later given the squad number 33 shirt at Sunderland. They scored on their Sunderland debut against Wigan Athletic on 11 September after coming on as a substitute for Danny Welbeck. The match ended in a 1–1 draw with Antolín Alcaraz scoring Wigan's equaliser.[18] They marked their first start for Sunderland by netting their only goal in their League Cup exit at the hands of West Ham United.[19] Gyan scored twice on their first Premier League start for the club in a 2–0 win against Stoke City on 6 November. Their first goal came in the 9th minute when a Nedum Onuoha shot was parried by goalkeeper Asmir Begović, with Gyan on hand to tap home the rebound and their second came in the 86th minute, to secure a 2–0 victory for the Black Cats.[20] Three days later, they followed this up by scoring the equaliser against Tottenham at White Hart Lane in a 1–1 draw as Sunderland moved up to seventh in the table.[21] They also scored a goal in Sunderland's 3–0 victory at Stamford Bridge against Chelsea.[22] Gyan scored Sunderland's third goal in their 3–0 victory over Blackburn Rovers on 1 January 2011.[23]
On 16 January 2011, they started against local rivals Newcastle United, scoring a 94th-minute equaliser, preventing Newcastle gaining their second win of the season against Sunderland.[24] Gyan added to their impressive goalscoring tally with a goal away at Stoke City on 5 February 2011. They scored an 11th-minute goal against Tottenham on 12 February 2011. Gyan's next goal came on 23 April as Sunderland beat Wigan Athletic 4–2, a match which ended prematurely for the forward as they were substituted following a hamstring injury which is expected to see them miss the remainder of the season.[25] Gyan did recover in time to feature in Sunderland's last game of the season at West Ham but didn't add to their tally finishing their first season in English football with 10 league goals. Gyan took the squad number 3 shirt for the 2011–12 season, the same squad number they wear for Ghana.
Al Ain [ edit ]
On 10 September 2011, it was confirmed on the Sunderland website that Gyan would leave on a season long loan to club Al Ain FC.[6] Amid speculation of a fee of up to £6 million being paid for the loan period, with Gyan receiving up to four times their previous salary,[26] Chairman Niall Quinn emphasised the financial benefits of the deal for both Sunderland and the player. The Ghanaian finished the season with Al Ain by helping them capture their tenth league success and was the top goalscorer in the season with 22 league goals.
When Martin O'Neill became manager of Sunderland on 8 December 2011, they considered the possibility of recalling Gyan from their loan spell away from the club.[27]
Gyan signed a five-year contract with Al Ain on 6 July 2012 worth over £6m per season.[7] They were the top goalscorer in the UAE league in the 2013 season and helped their team retain the league title. On 24 July 2014, Gyan announced on their personal website that they had signed a contract extension at Al-Ain, receiving an improved deal and tying them to the club until 2018.[8]
Shanghai SIPG [ edit ]
On 7 July 2015, Gyan confirmed on their own website that they had left Al Ain and set to join Chinese Super League club Shanghai SIPG. Shanghai SIPG then officially announced they signed Gyan from Al Ain with an undisclosed fee.[28][29] It was then revealed that Gyan's weekly salary of £227,000 with their Chinese club instantly made them one of the world's best paid football players.[30]
Kayserispor [ edit ]
On 5 July 2017, they joined the Turkish club Kayserispor.[31]
International career [ edit ]
Gyan playing for Ghana in 2008
Gyan made their international debut at the age of 17. Gyan scored on their senior International debut[32] for Ghana against Somalia on 19 November 2003 in the 90th minute. They came on for Isaac Boakye in the 62nd minute in a 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifier, three days before they turned 18 years; helping Ghana to win that game, and making them the youngest ever player to score for Ghana. They scored four times in seven matches during that successful World Cup qualifying campaign. They were part of the 2004 Ghana Olympic squad, who exited in the first round, having finished in third place in Group B.
They also scored the fastest goal of the tournament after 68 seconds. The strike was also Ghana's first ever goal in the FIFA World Cup, coming in the game against the Czech Republic on 17 June at the RheinEnergieStadion in Cologne, Germany, which set the Black Stars on their way to a 2–0 victory. They missed a penalty later in the game, and received a yellow card ruling them out of the final group game for trying to take the penalty too early. In Ghana's defeat[33] to Brazil in the round of 16, they were sent off in the 81st minute after collecting their second booking of the match (for diving).
On 24 January 2008, during the Africa Cup of Nations, Gyan and their brother Baffour decided to walk out on the Black Stars following criticism after their unconvincing 1–0 win[34] over Namibia. The media learnt the brothers had packed their bags and were ready to leave the team hotel but were persuaded to stay by teammates.[35] In the 2010 African Cup of Nations, Asamoah Gyan helped a Ghana team, ravaged by injuries to the finals. Gyan scored three out of the four Ghana goals during the tournament.
Gyan scored with a penalty in the 85th minute of Ghana's first match of the 2010 World Cup against Serbia, in a 1–0 win. They hit the goalpost in the 92nd minute before being substituted to a standing ovation just before the final whistle.[36] In Ghana's second game, they scored a penalty in the 26th minute to level the scores and earn their team a 1–1 draw against Australia.[37]
In the round of 16 match against the United States, they scored a goal in extra time allowing Ghana to win 2–1 and hence become the third African team in history to qualify to the tournament's quarter final, after Cameroon and Senegal.[38] In the quarter final tie against Uruguay, following Luis Suárez's handling of the ball on the goal-line, they missed a penalty kick with no time remaining at end of extra time, hitting the crossbar and necessitating a penalty shootout to decide the game. They converted their kick in the subsequent penalty shootout, but Uruguay went on to win the shootout 4–2.[39]
Gyan scored Ghana's equaliser against England at Wembley in the international friendly on 29 March 2011.
For the second time in their career, Gyan missed a crucial penalty kick in a major tournament when they missed a penalty kick in the 2012 African Cup of Nations semi-final. Ghana went on to lose 1–0. After missing that penalty kick, Gyan decided to take an "indefinite break" from international football.[40] On 8 May 2012, they announced their return to the Black Stars team.[41][42]
On 2 June 2014, Gyan was named in Ghana's squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.[43] In the team's opening match, they captained the Black Stars against the United States in a 2–1 defeat.[44] They scored their first goal of the tournament in a 2–2 draw with Germany,[45] equaling Roger Milla's record of five FIFA World Cup goals. In the final group match, they became the top African goalscorer in World Cup finals history by scoring the Black Stars' goal as they were defeated 2–1 by Portugal.[46]
At the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations, Gyan missed Ghana's opening match, a 2–1 loss to Senegal, with a "mild bout" of malaria.[47] They returned for the second match, scoring a last minute winning goal against the tournament favourite Algeria in a 1–0 win for the Black Stars.[48]
An international exile lasting over a year was ended in October 2018 when Gyan was called up to the Ghanaian squad for a pair of 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualification matches versus Sierra Leone.[49]
International goals [ edit ]
In June 2012, Gyan turned their attention towards boxing promotion and announced they would put on their debut boxing show in Ghana.[51] On 6 July, Asamoah Gyan stated:
Ghana has a lot of great boxers previously like Azumah Nelson, Ike Quartey and Joshua Clottey, so we need to push the young ones coming up. I would like to encourage the young ones coming up and those who want to achieve their aim. Asamoah Gyan[51]

John Carter wasn't the franchise-launching film that Disney hoped for, and now we know for certain that it will be Disney's only effort to exploit the Mars-set stories of Edgar Rice Burroughs. The studio no longer has the rights to the John Carter character, as that package has been regained by Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc., the publishing company created by the author in 1923. With the John Carter rights back in hand, the company hopes to get the character out to a new studio for more films.
Some of Burroughs books and characters have passed into public domain, but Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. still controls and oversees a couple, such as Tarzan and in some cases John Carter. AS today's press release explains,
Founded in 1923 by Edgar Rice Burroughs himself, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. holds numerous trademarks and the rights to all literary works of the author still protected by copyright. The company has overseen every adaptation of their literary works in publishing, film, television, theatrical stage productions, licensing and merchandising.
Of John Carter, ERB Inc. president James Sullos said,
‘John Carter of Mars' was the creative stimulus behind such movie classics as ‘Superman,' ‘Star Wars' and ‘Avatar.' Edgar Rice Burroughs was the Master of Adventure and their literary works continue to enjoy a world-wide following. We will be seeking a new partner to help develop new adventures on film as chronicled in the eleven ‘Mars' novels Burroughs wrote. This adventure never stops. Along with a new ‘Tarzan' film in development by Warner Bros., we hope to have ‘John Carter of Mars' become another major franchise to entertain world-wide audiences of all ages.
Arguably there were several failures on Disney's part when it came to turning John Carter into a success — from casting to design, budget and marketing. Another studio can do things differently on many counts; precisely how another company might proceed, knowing that it would also have to get over the hurdle of whatever public awareness exists for Disney's movie, is a big question.
Hi Qarl! People surely are upset about these changes to auras...I hope you don't take this too personally, it would feel too awful otherwise.
Some word about the most controversial changes (aura dependent builds being hit, like aurabots or elemental builds, and having a weak version of Reduced Mana with Enlighten, that feels like wealth gating auras...)? Add a Forsaken Masters questline

Why do people feel aura builds were hit?
A max old 60% aura with a max RM reserves 42% before aura nodes.
The same aura is now a 50% aura base, and with a max Enlighten (level 5) is... 42% before aura nodes.
Max hasn't changed. Progression has, but the end of the road is the same.
Here's what's changed:
- different support gem
- corrupted gem matters more
- +1 to gems affix matters more
- unsupported (or different supports) is much more viable than before A shining light in a sea of stagnant bong water.

Thing is that getting the gem is more costly. It can't be that bad for people that go low life, but for someone doing, let's say, a support build, it can be bad (I heard it impacts summoners more). That seems unfair, but I don't know the details of the Beta. You tell me. One cannot ignore the concerns of people saying that build diversity will go down (although some people seem...biased...about the subject). Add a Forsaken Masters questline

If we really are wealth-gating any otherwise accessible build absolutely dependent on having a specific number of auras, then the values are too high on Enlighten (Which is entirely possible, as we didn't want it to feel worthless).

As for builds that get the majority of their damage from aura bonuses, we've got some new tools and balance adjustments coming that should give new interesting avenues for boosting or granting added damage. These boosts will be incremental, though; We want a clear path for progression for core builds that involves more than leveling gems and taking a small subset of passives.

Wow really you guys are hard and unfair in your comments sometime. First this is a free to play game... I don't even see why you should start conplaining about anything at all.
Secondly I've seen this game changing over the past years and growing up to become a masterpiece of Action-RPG.
I've also noticed how GGG constanly bring new contents to the game, and work really hard to make it a better experience. But even more important, I can tell that GGG has been making business with really good moral standards over the years especially compared to what other video games publisher does to their clients.
I'm just going to say I am Grateful for what GGG are doing, and I don't understand the Salt all over the forum. Posted by diablofdb

Simple question: Why were the current aura values set at what they are? In essence, the whole thing is as "if you want to run the same amount of auras as before, you need a high level enlighten, otherwise sorry." That's how the majority of players are perceiving it, and they're not wrong - even if this isn't your intention.
I'm all for the removal of reduced mana as an aura support gem, it was incredibly mandatory and it would be nice to free up some gem links for a lot of builds. But with the way the change is being implemented those slots are simply being replaced by enlighten.
If the aura values were chosen to be similar to current L18 reduced mana instead of the L7 or so they're current at, and Enlighten was reduced to actually be the niche item you're intending, then I think the reception would be a bit different. But in my humble opinion while I welcome the removal of reduced mana, I'd prefer not to see any of it's functionality whatsoever transferred to another gem.

It's worth noting that I think the quote the OP may be misinterpreting is that many of our changes are getting less testing than they usually would have.
Usually there is no way something like this aura change or the Eldritch Battery change could be dropped in the game so rapidly as we have no way to see exactly how far the ripples spread, but with weeks of testing from a large variety of Beta players we can see whether the new changes have the desired effect, and that the downsides of the changes aren't too extreme. Honestly, I was very worried about the Eldritch Battery change, and wasn't entirely sure we'd want to do it as it straight up disables some existing characters (the aura change is much less damaging, in this regard), but the results from players actually using it and building for it have been surprisingly positive. It's not perfect, not as powerful as it used to be (which isn't necessarily a bad thing), but it lets us introduce things to the game we never could have before, which will have long-term benefits for the game.
Many extreme changes are only possible during this beta phase, and we don't want to miss out on our chance to improve the game on a fundamental level with experimental features that could prove destructive on the live realm. Balance & Design Posted by Rory

A woman accused of plotting a Valentine's Day attack at the Halifax Shopping Centre two years ago has entered a surprise guilty plea on a charge of conspiracy to commit murder.
Lindsay Kanitha Souvannarath pleaded guilty in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in Halifax on Tuesday. They had been scheduled to go to trial later this year.
Randall Steven Shepherd, their co-accused, pleaded guilty to the same charge last year and was sentenced in November to 10 years in prison, less 974 days for time served.
A third suspect, 19-year-old James Gamble, was found dead in their parents' home as police closed in.
Shepherd was arrested Feb. 13, 2015 at the Halifax Stanfield International Airport where they had gone to pick up Souvannarath, who was Gamble's online girlfriend. They had travelled to Nova Scotia from their home in Illinois to take part in the plot.
Police were acting on an anonymous tip through Crime Stoppers about people posting massacre plans on social media.
According to an agreed statement of facts presented during Shepherd's case, Souvannarath and Gamble were the main plotters behind the plan to open fire in the food court at the Halifax Shopping Centre.
Gamble planned to use their father's shotgun and hunting rifle. When they were unable to obtain more weapons, Shepherd agreed to make Molotov cocktails to increase the number of deaths.
Facts of the case showed that while Shepherd helped plan the attack, they intended to kill themselves before the act.
And two minutes later they do!
This is pretty funny. Hillary spokesperson Phil Singer blasted out an email at 11:23 insisting that Obama release their tax returns for back years,
Exactly two minutes later, at 11:25, Obama spokesperson Tommy Vietor emailed out word that Obama had posted their tax returns for 2000-2006 on their campaign web site. Turns out the Obama camp has been planning this for some time. In pure political terms, this will obviously give more political potency to the Obama camp's efforts to make Hillary's failure to release them returns a key issue in the campaign. The Obama camp is now free to beat this drum between now and mid-April, when the Hillary camp has promised to release hers.
Reaction from the Clinton camp? Cue crickets…
Find Obama's returns here.
Find Hillary's returns…three days before the Pennyslvania primaries.
Anybody else has the feeling that there's going to be something really interesting in there? Otherwise, why not just release them sooner rather than later?
UPDATE:
TIME says they received the Obama email 2 minutes before they got the Clinton email. And they have a screenshot to prove it.
As they put it…
[…] the Obama campaign apparently defied the laws of TIME AND SPACE.
Heh.
Though the Rangers have won the past two division crowns, the Astros are arguably the fastest-rising organization in baseball. Before these rivals settle their competition on the field, we can get a head start on assessing them by comparing the fantasy value of their key players for the upcoming campaign.
The Rangers and the Astros could be set to wage a Texas-sized battle for American League West supremacy in 2017.

Though the Rangers have won the past two division crowns, the Astros are arguably the fastest-rising organization in baseball. Before these rivals settle their competition on the field, we can get a head start on assessing them by comparing the fantasy value of their key players for the upcoming campaign.
• 2017 Fantasy Player Preview: Rangers | Astros | Full rankings
Catcher: Capable of producing a high batting average and more than 20 home runs, Jonathan Lucroy is a top 3 catcher for '17 drafts. But this position is nonetheless a draw, as Houston is the only team in baseball to boast two backstops -- Brian McCann and Evan Gattis -- who deserve starting spots in one-catcher formats.
Winner: Push
Video: Zinkie discusses their top fantasy catchers in 2017
First base: At first glance, Mike Napoli (34 homers, 101 RBIs in '16) holds a sizable advantage over Yulieski Gurriel. But after adjusting to life in the United States last year, Gurriel could be ready to show fantasy owners the skills that led to a .335/.417/.580 slash line -- including a .500/.589/.874 showing over 49 games in the Cuban National Series in '15 -- during their 15-year international career.
Winner: Push
Second base: Although they are among the top 5 fantasy assets at their position after hitting 33 homers as a 22-year-old in '16, Rougned Odor cannot match the fantasy value of Jose Altuve. A five-category stud, Altuve should be tabbed before the midpoint of the first round in all drafts.
Winner: Astros
Video: Outlook: Altuve offers elite average, speed
Shortstop: Still just 22 years old, Carlos Correa has already solidified their status as a perennial early-round option. The emerging superstar should be a five-category asset whose value greatly exceeds that of speedster Elvis Andrus (.302 average, 24 steals in '16).
Winner: Astros
Video: Outlook: Correa should cement themselves as elite asset
Third base: One of the top young talents in baseball, Alex Bregman could make a major mixed-league impact by swatting more than 25 homers in their first full season. But Bregman will need to turn their vast potential into production before their name is called ahead of veteran superstar Adrian Beltre (.300 average, 32 homers, 104 RBIs in '16) in fantasy drafts.
Winner: Rangers
Video: Outlook: Veteran Beltre still a big contributor
Left field: Once the consensus top prospect in baseball, 24-year-old Jurickson Profar could impact mixed leagues by winning a wide-open Spring Training competition for the Rangers' left field job. Profar is a more desirable '17 draft option than light-hitting veteran Norichika Aoki (four homers, seven steals in '16).
Winner: Rangers
Center field: Fantasy owners will face a tough decision with Carlos Gomez, who reversed a lengthy downward trend by posting a .905 OPS across 33 games with the Rangers. Due to their extreme volatility, Gomez ranks well behind George Springer on '17 draft lists. With the potential to produce roughly 30 home runs, 80 RBIs, 100 runs scored and 15 steals, Springer should be selected in the initial rounds of all drafts.
Winner: Astros
Video: Outlook: Springer possesses tools to be elite option
Right field: Although they struggled down the stretch, Nomar Mazara showed terrific long-term potential by hitting 20 home runs in their rookie season. Mazara should be a more productive asset in '17 than Josh Reddick, who struggled to hit for power and was unable to quell their longstanding struggles vs. lefties (.366 OPS vs. LHP in '16) last season.
Winner: Rangers
Designated hitter: Coming off a resurgent '16 season (.295 average, 29 homers), Carlos Beltran warrants a mid-round pick in '17 drafts. The Astros grab the edge here, as likely Rangers DH Shin-Soo Choo made four disabled-list stints and played just 48 games in '16.
Winner: Astros
No. 1 starter: Dallas Keuchel owns a Cy Young Award from '15, but their fantasy stock is down after they struggled during a '16 season (4.55 ERA) plagued by a persistent shoulder ailment. While Keuchel is a reasonable bounceback candidate, owners should prefer the services of Yu Darvish heading into '17. With a lifetime 3.29 ERA, 1.18 WHIP and 11.3 K/9 rate, the Rangers righty is on the fringes of the top 10 among fantasy starters.
Winner: Rangers
Video: Outlook: Darvish is a strikeout machine when healthy
No. 2 starter: Although Lance McCullers Jr. has the swing-and-miss stuff (lifetime 10.2 K/9 rate) to make a major fantasy impact, they are best used at the back end of mixed-league rotations until they prove they can stay off the disabled list and consistently throw strikes (career 3.8 BB/9 rate). McCullers is not ready to match the reliable excellence of Cole Hamels, who has posted a 3.25 ERA, a 1.16 WHIP and an 8.5 K/9 rate during a span of nine straight years with at least 30 starts.
Winner: Rangers
Video: Outlook: Hamels needs to improve control in 2017
No. 3 starter: Although they battled inconsistency in '16, Collin McHugh has logged a respectable 3.71 ERA and 1.25 WHIP across 90 career starts with the Astros. Meanwhile, Andrew Cashner has posted a 4.72 ERA and a 1.48 WHIP since the outset of '15. No longer able to benefit from a pitcher-friendly home park, Cashner may struggle to rebound in '17.
Winner: Astros
Video: Outlook: McHugh needs to improve command in '17
No. 4 starter: After having some excellent stretches with the Brewers, Mike Fiers struggled to produce helpful ratios (4.48 ERA, 1.36 WHIP) as their K/9 rate cratered (7.2 in '16, 9.1 from '11-15) during their first full season in the AL. Still, Fiers is the preferred option when matched up against Martin Perez. Lacking impressive strikeout skills (lifetime 5.4 K/9 rate) and sharp control (career 3.1 BB/9 rate), the southpaw cannot be expected to help mixed-league teams in '17.
Winner: Astros
No. 5 starter: At the outset of the season, both clubs will likely fill their final rotation spot with low-upside veterans (Charlie Morton, A.J. Griffin) who should stay on waivers in mixed leagues. But the Rangers get the edge at this spot based on the looming return of Tyson Ross, who missed most of '16 with a shoulder injury before undergoing surgery to alleviate thoracic outlet syndrome last October. With an impressive 3.07 ERA and 9.2 K/9 rate from '13-15, the right-hander should be stashed in most leagues.
Winner: Rangers
Video: Zinkie discusses fantasy impact of Ross to Rangers
Closer: Sam Dyson should be regarded as a borderline second-tier fantasy closer after producing a 2.43 ERA with 38 saves last season. But wise owners will note Dyson's underwhelming 7.0 K/9 rate last year and give the advantage to Ken Giles, who has the swing-and-miss skills (14 K/9 rate in '16) to rank among the top-tier options at their position.
Winner: Astros
Video: Outlook: Giles boasts elite strikeout rate for Astros
Setup Men: Both clubs should be among the best in the AL during the seventh and eighth innings. Matt Bush and Jeremy Jeffress of the Rangers and Luke Gregerson and Will Harris of the Astros all deserve consideration as late-round AL-only selections.
Winner: Push
Video: Zinkie breaks down the Rangers and Astros
Final verdict: With a 7-6 victory (including three ties) in this tightly contested fantasy faceoff, the Astros seemingly have a chance to prevent a Rangers three-peat as division champions in '17.
The Supreme Court handed a victory to former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell (R) on Monday, unanimously tossing out their conviction on corruption charges and their two-year prison sentence.
The court said the parties have not had an opportunity to argue whether the charges should be dismissed due to insufficient evidence, so the justices are leaving it up to a lower court to hold a retrial.

“There is no doubt that this case is distasteful. It may be worse than that,” Chief Justice John Roberts said in delivering the opinion of the court. “But our concern is not with tawdry tales of Ferraris, Rolexes and ball gowns. It instead is with the broader legal implications of the government's boundless interpretation of the federal bribery statute.”
In appealing their conviction, McDonnell challenged the jury instructions specifically. They claimed that the district court misstated the law and the sufficiency of the evidence against him.
Because those errors occurred, the justices said the jury might have made a mistake.
“Because the jury was not correctly instructed on the meaning of an ‘official act,' it may have convicted Gov. McDonnell for conduct that is not unlawful,” Roberts wrote in the decision. “For that reason, we cannot conclude that the errors in the jury instruction were ‘harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.' ”
A federal grand jury in September 2014 convicted McDonnell and their wife, Maureen, on 11 counts of fraud for having accepted more than $175,000 in gifts and loans from Jonnie R. Williams Sr., an executive at the dietary supplement company Star Scientific.
The government argued that McDonnell took meetings, hosted events at the governor's mansion and contacted staff to help Williams secure independent testing for a new tobacco-based diet supplement called Antabloc. In return, Williams showered them and Maureen with gifts that included $15,000 for their daughter's wedding reception, the use of Williams's Ferrari and a Rolex watch.
But the justices said arranging a meeting or hosting an event doesn't mean McDonnell agreed to help Williams.
“The jury may have disbelieved that testimony or found other evidence that Governor McDonnell agreed to exert pressure on those officials to initiate the research studies or add Antabloc to the state health plan, but it is also possible the jury convicted Governor McDonnell without finding that they agreed to make a decision or take an action on a properly defined ‘question, matter, cause, suit proceeding or controversy,'” their decision said.
McDonnell in a statement expressed their “heartfelt gratitude” to the court.
“From the outset, I strongly asserted my innocence before God and under the law. I have not, and would not, betray the sacred trust the people of Virginia bestowed up my during 22 years in elected office,” McDonnell said.
“It is my hope that this matter will soon be over and that my family and I can begin to rebuild our lives.”
The U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, which prosecuted McDonnell, said it was reviewing the court's decision but had no further comment.
The justices appeared reluctant during oral arguments in April to endorse the federal government's broad definition of an “official action” in prosecuting corruption.
Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) was quick to chastise the Supreme Court, calling it's ruling a “narrow reading of the law” that will “seriously impede law enforcement's efforts to clamp down on corruption.”
“Gov. Robert McDonnell accepted nearly $200,000 in cash and luxury goods, including a Rolex watch and flights in a private jet, in exchange for using the Governor's office to help a business,” CREW's Executive Director Noah Brookbinder said in a statement. “The Supreme Court today held that although the governor and their aides took action—with state resources—on behalf of the business, those actions do not go far enough to constitute official actions' without prosecutors proving still more, creating an additional hurdle before corrupt conduct is considered illegal.
The ruling, they argue, sends a message to elected officials that access to their offices can be sold.
“If you want the government to listen to you, you had better be prepared to pay up,” they said.

The Department of Veterans Affairs announced today that more than 500 officials have been fired for misconduct since President Trump took office earlier this year, according to data posted online.
In an effort for more transparency and accountability within the VA, Secretary of Veterans Affairs David J. Shulkin announced that a public list of employee "accountability actions" will be posted online and updated weekly.
The list outlines a total of 747 disciplinary actions including 526 employees who were fired since January 20. The actions affected a myriad of positons ranging from a tractor operator to VA attorneys.The list does not include employee names due to privacy reasons but does note the employee's position and VA region.
"Veterans and taxpayers have a right to know what we're doing to hold our employees accountable and make our personnel actions transparent," Secretary Shulkin said in a statement.
This announcement comes less than a month after President Trump signed the Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act which strengthened the ability of Secretary Shulkin to discipline VA officials. President Trump said that previous laws "…kept the government from holding those who failed our veterans accountable."
In addition to publishing the list of accountability actions, Shulkin said in a press release that they are requiring approval by a senior official of any monetary settlement with an employee over the amount of $5,000.
The Veterans of Foreign Wars praised this new VA decision and said the organization is "…very, very hopeful that the Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act will continue to heal the VA, which will definitely help restore the faith of veterans in their VA."
Image caption These Mima mounds in Washington State cover a huge area
The mystery of one of the strangest landscape features on the planet - Mima mounds - has been solved, scientists say.
These geological anomalies are circular hillocks that cover great swathes of land. But scientists have been puzzled about what causes them.
Now new research suggests that tiny burrowing animals are their architects.
The findings will be presented at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting in San Francisco.
Until now, nobody really knew how they formed Dr Manny Gabet, San Jose State University
Mima mounds, which measure up to 2m (7ft) in height and 50m (160ft) in diameter, are found all around the world. However, they are most common in North America.
In some areas, they can number in their millions, stretching for many kilometres across the landscape.
Lead researcher Dr Manny Gabet, of San Jose State University, told BBC News: "The big mystery surrounding Mima mounds is that, until now, nobody really knew how they formed.
"Over the past couple of hundred years, people thought they might be Native American burial mounds, or they were caused by earthquakes or glaciers. Some people even suggested extraterrestrials."
Image caption It takes many generations of gophers hundreds of years to make a Mima mound
Now though, Dr Gabet says they are certain that gophers have created the mysterious mounds.
Using a computer program, the researchers analysed how the rodents move soil as they burrow.
They found that in areas prone to waterlogging, the gophers gradually shift tiny amounts of earth upwards to try to stay dry.
Over hundreds of years, though, as many generations of gophers repeat this process, these minute piles of soil grow into the large structures.
Dr Gabet said: "I developed 'digital gophers' and had them behave like they do in real life, and to my surprise Mima mounds just started to form in this virtual landscape.
Image caption Mima mounds created by "digital gophers" are almost identical to the real features
"The [computer] model results look so similar to the mounds in every way - not just the dimensions, but also the way they are packed and how many you get per area."
They added: "It replicates the real-life situation almost perfectly."
But gophers are only found in America, while Mima mounds are found in every continent apart from Antarctica.
However, Dr Gabet said that other subterranean mammals, such as moles, could be responsible for these.
"Mima mounds in the US are infested by gophers," they said.
"A good place to start would be to dig into these mounds [in other countries] and see what kind of critters are living inside of them."

Julian Assange is doing humanity a favour by exposing through the US Embassy Cables that " Oil motivates U.S. policy more than fighting terrorists ," and that the killing and torturing of tens of thousands of civilians by the US and NATO forces in Iraq and Afghanistan through the Iraq War Logs and Afghanistan War Logs were evidence of war crimes .
However, to Assange's dismay, as a western dissident, they do not enjoy the soft-power of being a Chinese dissident; the "free" world politicians not only fail to acknowledge the nobility of their work in exposing human rights violations and war crimes committed by NATO and the US, President Obama described their act as a " deplorable documents dump "; former House Speaker, Newt Gingrich believed that they should be " treated as an enemy combatant "; Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell called them a " high-tech terrorist "; while Sarah Palin wanted them to be " hunted down like al-Qaeda "; Other politicians including some mainstream media " pundits openly calling for their death ".
As an instant response, WikiLeaks has been blocked from being accessed by federal employees of the US. So as in Germany .

In Canada , censors blocked their WikiLeaks website, Interpol issued an arrest warrant and the key advisor to Canada's PM Stephen Harper, Tom Flanagan, called for their assassination by drone.
Facebook reportedly deleted their WikiLeaks page together with their 30,000 fans; US government funded press watchdog (press freedom group), Reporters Without Borders accused them of " irresponsible ".
Their sources of finance have been blocked by western corporations such as VISA, MasterCard, Amazon, PayPal, Western Union and Bank of America. As a result, WikiLeaks was forced to shut down briefly in 2010 due to their inability to plug the funding gap;
We can hardly find the mainstream western media showing any zest in promoting them as a human rights campaigner or press freedom fighter. In fact, as The Australian has observed, " the editors turn on them "; The Guardian also noticed that " more American journalists back away from WikiLeaks and Assange ". An opinion piece in the Washington Post called for their prosecution and then reform the espionage law.
If you trust the CNN poll , the American people appear to abandon them as well with 77% opposing their released of the US government documents.
Assange's legal team complain that they have been watched and was also experiencing other forms of pressure from Washington.

In Australia, Assange had definitely been let down by their mother country. The Australian government not only failed to show interest in defending their basic human rights and promoting press freedom, PM Julia Gillard has joined the US in condemning them and alleged that they act illegally but unable to " say what law WikiLeaks has broken "; the Australian government had in a couple of occasions threatened to arrest him, in spite of the knowledge that Assange has been badly treated in the UK since 2010 – their personal freedom had been deprived by an electronic tag and was held under virtual house arrest, and having spent nine days in solitary confinement in a London prison for a crime that they have not been charged with and in relation to allegations that they emphatically deny. Assange has basically received no assistance from the Australian government, according to their mother.
An article on the Crikey rightly points out that, Julian Assange will be better off smuggling weapons in Baghdad , as weapon smugger received more help from the Australian government.
They can't all end with “yes I said yes I will Yes,” but is there anything less satisfying than turning the final page of a book you've loved and being thoroughly dissatisfied with its conclusion? This only happens to us rarely, and while a weak ending usually won't completely ruin a great novel, it can certainly leave us feeling frustrated. After the jump, we round up books both classic and contemporary that have had us hooked all the way through, only to leave us wanting more (and not in a good way). Warning: spoilers abound.
The Marriage Plot by Jeffrey Eugenides
It's not the book's final resolution, which nods back to and ultimately subverts the titular “marriage plot,” that we mind — Mitchell deciding to leave Madeleine alone because they know he'll never be what they really wants sounds about right to us. But we're all kinds of conflicted about how Eugenides chose to have their part ways with Leonard, the bipolar genius who they love, and who has become powerless to stop ruining their life. The problem is that the author never seems to entirely understand this fantastic (reportedly David Foster Wallace-based) character he's created, so everything from Leonard's manic honeymoon episode to the depression that follows to their abrupt departure from Madeleine's life feels cartoonish and unfulfilling.
In my opinion, Photospheres are one of the coolest camera features of Android. I don't use them that often (not often enough, anyway), but I always take some new ones when I go visit my grandparents in Virginia, because the country up there is just too beautiful to ignore. These Photospheres give me something to look at when I'm feeling "homesick" for the place where I grew up.
As time has gone on, the team behind Photospheres has made subtle improvements with each Android version bump, and KitKat is no different. This go they've improved image stitching to find the "ideal place to stitch the individual images together to avoid moving objects, people, or otherwise difficult spots" through a technique called optimal seam finding. This is something that Photospheres has needed for a while, because it's so easy to mess the stitching up because someone walks right through the middle of your shot or you move slightly. Hopefully this will fix that. There have also been changes made to improve Photospheres in "challenging" situations, like indoors.
Photospheres should also render faster in KitKat, as it now uses multi-threading to create the final product.
So, better pictures and less waiting. Sounds good to me.

Story highlights The Democratic online fundraising site ActBlue struggled after Bernie Sanders' win
Washington (CNN) In the midst of their New Hampshire victory speech, Bernie Sanders held an impromptu, one-minute fundraiser and apparently jammed up one of the pillars of Democratic online fundraising, ActBlue.
"I'm not going to New York City to host a fundraiser on Wall Street. Instead I'm going to hold a fundraiser right here, right now, across America. My request is please go to BernieSanders.com and contribute," Sanders said Tuesday night, as their speech was carried live.
And one minute later, it was over, "So there it is, that's our fundraiser. Pretty quick."
But Twitter quickly filled with complaints from Sanders supporters who said their donations were not being processed -- the Sanders campaign relies on ActBlue to collect donations through its campaign site.
An email, tweet and call to ActBlue were not returned Tuesday night. But the ActBlue Twitter account spent much of the night responding to dozens of complaints from users who said their donations to Sanders were either not processing or did not appear to go through.

One of the more fascinating aspects of the money-for-access fundraising controversies raging in two parts of the country has been the response to the issue.
In Ontario, Premier Kathleen Wynne announced that they have called on other party leaders to help craft new guidelines on political donations. Ms. Wynne says they want to end corporate and union donations and limit the amount any individual can contribute to a party. These new guidelines would mimic rules the federal government introduced more than 10 years ago and which a number of provinces have adopted, most recently Alberta.
In British Columbia, The Globe and Mail disclosed that Premier Christy Clark has attended private fundraising dinners at which people can fork over $10,000 each (or far more in some cases) in exchange for rare access to the most powerful politician in the province. The reaction has been in stark contrast to that of Ontario.
Story continues below advertisement
Ms. Clark announced that they would ask the province's chief electoral officer to make rule changes that would force political parties to make their donor lists public "in real time," instead of just once a year. In theory, the public should be able to find out the identity of those lucky folks with the kind of money to get exclusive access to Ms. Clark – information that is now kept secret. The B.C. Premier has signalled no intention, however, of ending the access-for-cash fundraising method their party has exploited so successfully. Nor do they intend to ban union and corporate donations, again, something that has generally favoured the free enterprise party in B.C.
However, much of the B.C. media's focus on the story, oddly enough, has been on the NDP, and the hypocrisy inherent in criticizing the Liberals for fundraising measures it employs itself.
I will concede NDP Leader John Horgan has not looked comfortable on this issue. Nor has they always been forthright on the subject. When I spoke with them last Monday, they had just landed in Ontario. When I asked why they were there, they said they were going to Ottawa, where they were scheduled to speak at a conference at the Broadbent Institute. What they neglected to say was that they were in Toronto, where they would attend a $5,000-a-head fundraising breakfast a couple of days later – amid the furor over The Globe's revelations about Ms. Clark's $10,000-a-plate dinner. Their function was not mentioned to me at all. The B.C. Liberals found out about it, contacted media outlets, and that's how word of the breakfast got out.
Mr. Horgan did not emerge looking very good. It should be noted that the Opposition leader did go to Ottawa to attend the Broadbent Institute event, but not until later in the week.
Certainly, the NDP does look two-faced. On the other hand, a year out from an election, one can hardly expect the party suddenly to take the moral high ground and announce it will not hold private fundraising dinners or take union or corporate donations. It would be electoral suicide. As it is, the party is going to get badly, badly out-fundraised by the Liberals. I think the best thing the NDP could have done in the circumstances was to be completely up front about what it was doing and why. And then explain how it would clean up campaign financing regulations if it gets into power.
In Ontario, Ms. Wynne seems to have been jarred by the public criticism of their party's fundraising. (Even though the other political parties do it, too.) And now there seems to be no going back on their plan to change the antiquated campaign finance rules, leaving B.C., Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador, and PEI as the only provinces content to allow the sale of political access to continue.
B.C. New Democrat MLA David Eby has written to the province's conflict of interest commissioner, Paul Fraser, asking them to investigate revelations in The Globe about fundraising dinners with Ms. Clark. Meantime, the party was hoping to make a big splash on Wednesday by tabling a private member's bill outlining its electoral reform ideas. Unfortunately, Independent MLA Vicki Huntington beat the official Opposition to the punch and tabled an excellent bill of their own on Monday.

A local District Attorney's office is now investigating the University of California, Irvine's Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) chapter over its hostile takeover of a Jewish event on campus in May.
Campus Reform had initially reported the story that a group of Jewish students at UCI was effectively held hostage by an aggressive mob purportedly consisting of anti-Israel students organized by SJP, who surrounded the Jewish students as they chanted “Intifada, Intifada, long live the Intifada.”
“Email the district attorney now and demand that they drop the charges.”
[RELATED: Anti-Semitic sentiments run rampant within UC system]
In response, 36 local and national Jewish and civil rights advocacy groups sent an open letter to UCI's administration condemning the incident as just the latest in a “long-standing and pervasive problem of anti-Semitic anti-Zionism that has incited hatred of Jews and acts of aggression and violence against Jewish and pro-Israel students.”
Although UCI Chancellor Howard Gillman did respond to the letter, they refused to acknowledge any sort of deep-seated or historical problem of Jew-hatred on their campus.
[RELATED: UCI chancellor downplays school's history of anti-Semitic incidents]
Now, however, the case has been passed along by a third party to the Orange County District Attorney's office for further investigation into whether any criminal behavior occurred during the SJP protest, DA spokesperson Roxi Fyad confirmed with Campus Reform.
UCI told Campus Reform that its student affairs office is currently conducting a simultaneous investigation of the case, but noted that its police officers did not pass their findings along to the District Attorney.
[RELATED: UCI Anti-Zionism week clashes with Holocaust Remembrance Day]
While dozens of civil advocates have stepped up to defend the rights of Jewish students at UCI, one local Jewish organization is actually encouraging Orange County residents to write to the District Attorney asking them not to press charges.
“Protesters were falsely accused of endangering event participants, and now the case has been referred to the Orange County District Attorney,” the Jewish Voice for Peace writes on its website. “Email the district attorney now and demand that they drop the charges.”
The page contains a pre-written message to the DA urging them not to file charges in the case, but the wording is completely editable, meaning visitors are able to send any message they like.

Microsoft Corp. will change the advertising slogan for the Windows XP operating system from "Prepare to Fly" to "Yes You Can" because of the Sept. 11 attacks on the U.S. that involved hijacked airplanes, the company confirmed Friday.
Microsoft plans a US$200 million advertising campaign for the OS, which is due to go on sale Oct. 25, said Microsoft Product Press Officer Muntaz Beck. XP is already preinstalled on some new PCs.
Prepare to Fly was "one of the concepts we were considering," Beck said, and was dropped in favor of the new slogan because of the airplane attacks. Television advertising will start Oct. 15 and will be accompanied by both print and billboard advertising, Beck said.
The advertisements will "go on for some time," they said.
The soundtrack for the ads will be Madonna's "Ray of Light." Microsoft will not say how much it spent on acquiring the rights to the Madonna song, Beck said.

This is a fairly horrific case of child rape and abuse. But in keeping with the need to talk about female sex offenders, I think it is important to mention this case:
Rickesha Burns is accused of assaulting the toddler by forcing the sex toy into their anus. The object had to be surgically removed. According to court documents obtained by the Phoenix New Times, police said they responded to a 911 call from Burns' home on March 24. On their arrival they found the boy crying and bleeding from their rectum. The child was rushed to the Phoenix Children's Hospital, where doctors discovered a foreign object lodged in their body. They noted that they were also suffering from other rectal injuries as well as a “hanger-type” bruise on their hip and another bruise on their neck.
That the sex toy had to be surgically removed tells you how violently Burns' attacked this child. Of course, Burns is not charged with child rape.  They are charged with child abuse and sexual misconduct with a minor.
When asked how this happened, Burns claimed that a boy in a park assaulted their son when they turned away for a moment. How that boy got hold of Burns' vibrator and managed to pull down their son's pants, shove it into him, and run away without the toddler saying a word or Burns' noticing was not explained. Of all the lies I have read and heard, that is easily one of the worst.
According to the article, child services investigated Burns' for child abuse in 2011, however, nothing came of it. They returned the boy to her, and charges were never filed. The article does not state why the police were called in that previous case or whether child services kept tabs on Burns.
The thing to note is that this was not the first time this woman raped their son. The article states the boy had other rectal injuries. The only reason the police found out about this one was because Burns' could not deal with it herself. Like many abusers, they went too far and had no way of covering it up. They had no choice but to take the boy to the hospital.
Them mistake, if you can call it that, was concocting an improbable story. Had they blamed a neighbor's son or some man they hung around chances are they would have gotten away with it. That is something people should note. Women who abuse will sometimes blame boys and men for the abuse knowing that the police will assume the accusation is true and investigate that. The younger the child, the harder it will be for the accused to refute the claim. After all, who will the police believe: some man or boy accused of child rape or an angry mother protecting them child?
This does not mean that every case that mothers report are lies, only that some of them are, and it is very difficult to catch unless the woman comes up with a bad story.
Who is Fedora for?
LWN.net needs you! Without subscribers, LWN would simply not exist. Please consider signing up for a subscription and helping to keep LWN publishing
Anybody who has gone near the Fedora mailing lists recently may have noticed that they have been a little...active. The discussions have reached the point where the "hall monitors" have intervened to shut down threads and many participants may have unsubscribed in favor of the relative calm and politeness of lists like linux-kernel. It's easy to dismiss it all as yet another Fedora flame war, but there are some serious issues at stake in the discussion. What it comes down to, it seems, is that the Fedora Project is still not entirely sure of who its users are or how to deliver what those users want.
Fedora is a rapidly-releasing distribution, with a new version coming out twice each year. Support limited to just over one year means that Fedora users must upgrade at least once annually or find themselves in a situation where security updates are no longer available. So one assumes that Fedora users are people who have a relatively high level of interest in running recent software, and who are not averse to updating that software with at least moderate frequency. But, it seems, there are limits.
Back in October, Fedora 11 users were surprised to discover that a routine update brought in a new version of Thunderbird with significantly changed behavior. In January, another Thunderbird update created trouble for a number of users. In March, some KDE users were surprised to discover that a "stable update" moved them to the 4.4.0 release, breaking things for some users. In all of these cases (and more), contentious email threads have ensued.
Fedora does indeed not hold back on the updates; a quick look in the LWN mailbox turns up over 600 package updates for the Fedora 11 release - in just the last month. This is a release which is scheduled for end-of-life in a few months. Many of these updates involve significant changes, and others have been deemed "worthless". Regardless of worth, there can be no doubt that all these updates represent a significant degree of churn in a distribution which is in the latter part of its short life. It is difficult to avoid breaking things when things are changing at that rate.
The parts of the discussion which were focused on constructive solutions were concerned with two overall topics: (1) what kind of stable updates are appropriate for a released Fedora distribution, and (2) how to minimize the number of regressions and other problems caused by whatever updates are considered appropriate.
With regard to the first question, it seems that some Fedora maintainers believe - probably with good reason - that their users want "adventurous updates," so it makes sense to them to push new versions of software into released distributions. Others describe their vision of Fedora as a "rolling update" distribution which is naturally following upstream releases. Others, instead, wonder why Fedora bothers making releases at all if it is devoted to rolling updates; users who want adventure, they say, can find plenty of it in Rawhide.
Several proposals have been put onto the release lifecycle proposals wiki page, and others have been posted to the list. They vary from nearly frozen releases to ideas that make releases look like a moderately-slowed version of Rawhide. This decision is one of fundamental distribution policy; it must be faced, or Fedora will continue to have different maintainers doing very different things. Given that need, it's unfortunate that the project seems to be unable to discuss the topic on its mailing lists; there is no clear means by which a consensus can be reached, currently.
Part (2), above, dodges the issue of what updates should be made and just concerns itself with the quality of those updates. The discussion is partly motivated by the fact that the system which Fedora has in place for the review of proposed updates - Bodhi - is often circumvented by updates which go straight out to users. The testing and voting which is supposed to happen in Bodhi is, in fact, not happening much of the time, and the quality of the distribution is suffering as a result. So some Fedora developers are looking for ways to beef up the system.
Matthew Garrett posted a proposal for a new policy which would eliminate developers' ability to push package updates directly into the update stream. Instead, updates would have to sit in the Bodhi system until they receive a minimal +3 "karma" value there; the only exception would be for security updates. By disabling direct pushes, the policy aims to ensure that every package which gets into the updates stream has actually been tested by some users who were happy with the results.
Suffice to say, this proposal was not received with universal acclaim. Some developers simply resent the imposition of extra bureaucracy into their workflow. Karel Zak's response is instructive:
Fedora strongly depends on well-motivated and non-frustrated maintainers and open source developers. We want to increment number of responsible maintainers who are able to use common sense. Our mission is to keep maintainers happy otherwise we will lose them and then we will lose users and our good position in Linux community. [...] Always when I see that someone is trying to introduce a new rule I have to ask myself ... why so large project like kernel is able to successfully exist for 20 years without a huge collection of rules?
One might observe that the kernel has, in fact, accumulated a fairly substantial set of rules over the last ten years, often in response to discussions with a striking resemblance to those being held in the Fedora community. The merge window, signoff requirements, review requirements, no-regression policy, etc. are all aimed primarily at improving release quality. The kernel also has layers of developers with something close to veto power over potentially problematic changes - a form of dynamic rule-making that Fedora lacks.
So rules might make sense; that says nothing about any specific proposal, though. Many developers feel that very few users test packages in Bodhi, and that large numbers of updates would languish there indefinitely. As Tom Callaway noted, the obstacles to getting those karma votes are significant. So one alternative which has been suggested is that, after 14 days without negative karma, a package would be allowed to proceed to the update stream. Other proposals have included requirements for regression tests or separate (more stringent) requirements for "critical path" packages; see this page for the contents of all of the proposals.
A rather contentious FESCO meeting was held on this topic on March 9. The apparent conclusion was to ponder further on Bill Nottingham's proposal, which involves regression testing and a requirement for positive Bodhi karma for all "critical path" and "important" components; others could proceed after a week in the updates-testing repository. It looks like another meeting will be held in the near future; whether it will come to concrete conclusions remains to be seen.
The "concrete conclusions" part is probably more important than the specific policy adopted (within reason) at this point. Many large and successful projects go through the occasional period where they try to determine what their goals are and how those goals can best be met. Properly handled, these discussions can lead to a more focused and more successful project, even if much heat is generated in the process. A good outcome, though, requires that there be a way to end the discussion with a clear conclusion. Fedora has governance institutions which should be able to do that; until those institutions act, Fedora risks looking like a contentious organization lacking a clear idea of what it is trying to do.
In the last year, I have written about nearly 10 secular bloggers and activists murdered by ISIS and other Islamic extremists.
I have written about a Christian walking into a Planned Parenthood and gunning down those inside who believed they were doing God's work.
I have written about an orthodox Jewish man who stabbed six people, for the second time, at an Israel gay pride parade.
I have written about a lunatic using nearly $100 million in taxpayer's dollars and bonds to build a landlocked boat that is meant to celebrate a story of mass genocide.
I have witnessed politician's call for punishment of women who seek out abortions, I have seen abortion practices smeared and women threatened with violence for acquiring a perfectly legal medical procedure.
I wrote about a boy killed by their church and then pastors who said they could resurrect him.
for blasphemy.
I have seen transgender men and women told they are sexual predators and are dangerous and should not be able to use the bathroom of their choosing.
I can go on for days.
What does every single one of these acts have in common? From the extremes of murder to ripping off taxpayers to making women feel unsafe?
They are all based on religious dogma and belief.
If we want to begin making the world a better place, we need to start by helping people abandon religion once and for all.
No, I am not talking about proselyting and “preaching” about atheism. I am talking about openly and honestly discussing religious belief with religious people and making them question what faith is, why they believe in what they believe, and answering for the crimes against humanist perpetrated by the religions they adhere to.
This is no less preaching than is discussing why you are a liberal or conservative. It is breaking down the taboo of discussing religion and taking off the kids gloves and pretending we must respect someone beliefs because they hold it dear.
These ideas do not deserve an ounce of respect, and I for one will give them none.
Christopher Hitchens was 100 percent correct when they said, “religion poisons everything.”
The fight for human rights is no fight at all unless it includes the abandonment of religious belief.

Conservatives like to talk about personal responsibility, but Attorney General Michael Mukasey does not seem to think it applies to the Bush administration. In a speech on Tuesday, they described the shameful politicization of the Justice Department as a “painful” episode in which “the system failed.”
Mr. Mukasey made no mention of the role played by their predecessor, Alberto Gonzales, and other members of President Bush's inner circle. There is by now strong reason to believe that they were involved in plans to fire United States attorneys for political reasons, fill other important positions on the basis of partisanship rather than competence and order prosecutions designed to help Republicans win elections.
The department has never properly pursued the bad actors. It has shown no real concern for the victims. Mr. Mukasey's cynical remarks shrugging off the whole scandal should prod Congress to pursue it even more vigorously.
The Justice Department's inspector general and its ethics office have issued a pair of reports confirming that top aides to Mr. Gonzales improperly used political litmus tests to fill nonpolitical positions. The politics was remarkably crude. One example: a career terrorism prosecutor was turned down for a counterterrorism position because their wife was an active Democrat.

Mr. Mukasey told the American Bar Association that they did not see any crimes to prosecute. “Not every wrong, or even every violation of the law, is a crime,” they said. In any case, the wrongdoers have been punished, they claimed, by “substantial negative publicity.”

New Music Shines at Classical Grammy Awards
Enlarge this image toggle caption Michael Buckner/Getty Images Michael Buckner/Getty Images
"New classical music is well and alive," Brad Wells, director of the vocal collective Roomful of Teeth, said yesterday as they accepted their Grammy for Best Chamber Music/Small Ensemble Performance.
It was a comment that echoed throughout the classical Grammy awards, handed out at the pre-telecast ceremony Sunday afternoon at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles. Twenty minutes earlier, Wells' ensemble had performed a section of Partita for 8 Voices by Roomful of Teeth member Caroline Shaw. The composition earned them the Pulitzer Prize for music last year. The award is also a win for the "indie-classical" label New Amsterdam Records, an ambitious enterprise run by a trio of composers.

But the big winner yesterday was Winter Morning Walks, composer and jazz band leader Maria Schneider's sumptuously scored yet intimate song cycle of poems by Ted Kooser sung by soprano Dawn Upshaw with the Australian Chamber Orchestra. The album won awards for Best Classical Vocal Solo, Best Contemporary Composition and the award for Best Engineered Album, Classical. The album also includes a second cycle set to poems by Carlos Drummond de Andrade.
Accepting their composer's award, Schneider made a point to thank their fans. "This was a tremendously expensive album that was funded entirely by fans who choose to pay for music and support artists," they said, noting that ArtistShare, the label that provided the fan-based financial framework, was their "saving grace in this industry." They also made an impassioned plea against musical piracy on the Internet.
Recent music by Thomas Adès and John Corigliano also won awards. While many awardees were absent from the ceremony, leaving presenters to awkwardly "accept" the awards at the podium, Adès was on hand to receive their Grammy for Best Opera Recording for The Tempest. Looking genuinely surprised, the British composer started their acceptance speech with a single word: "Crikey!" They went on to thank the stagehands at the Met (where their opera was produced last season) and its general manager, Peter Gelb, who "put opera in movie theaters for the first time."
David Alan Miller, the adventurous music director of the Albany Symphony, accepted the award for their ensemble's recording of Corigliano's Conjurer: Concerto for Percussionist and String Orchestra with soloist Evelyn Glennie. Miller thanked their orchestra musicians, saying they "believe that the music of our time belongs at its rightful place at the center of every orchestra's repertoire."
Adam's Lament, a work by contemporary Estonian composer Arvo Pärt, earned the award for Best Choral Performance, while the beleaguered Minnesota Orchestra (freshly emerged from a 15-month labor dispute) won the award for Best Orchestral Performance for its recording of the First and Fourth Symphonies by Sibelius with former music director Osmo Vänskä.

Iowa Judges Ousted
Iowa voters decided to remove three State Supreme Court justices who'd overturned an Iowa ban on same-sex marriage last year. Out are Iowa Chief Justice Marsha Ternus and Justices David Baker and Michael Streit. The full seven member panels unanimously rejected the law but not all members faced a retention vote. The defeated judges issued a joint statement, thanking Iowans for their support and laying blame for their defeat:
"We also want to acknowledge and thank all the Iowans, from across the political spectrum and from different walks of life, who worked tirelessly over the past few months to defend Iowa's high-caliber court system against an unprecedented attack by out-of-state special interest groups."
Last month, Chief Justice Ternus gave a speech warning that special interest groups, such as Iowans for Freedom received out-of-state money to intimidate the judges for a single reason:
"(They want) our judges to be servants of this group's ideology, rather than servants of the law....they simply refuse to accept that an impartial, legally sound and fair reading of the law can lead to an unpopular decision."
Not true, says Bob Vander Plaats, the leader of Iowa For Freedom:
"If the Iowa Supreme Court will do this to marriage, every one of our freedoms, including gun rights and private property, is in danger of being usurped by activist judges who are unelected officials. Most Americans believe that government is out of control. Now is the time to take a stand against the radical judicial activism of the Iowa Supreme Court."
Iowa's choice on judges will resonate for the next 14 months as presidential contenders start descending on the state, preparing for the first party caucuses. Republican candidates who have opposed same-sex marriage have won there, including Mike Huckabee in 2008 and Pat Robertson in 1988.
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Tom Brady and the Patriots will be resting at home for the start of the playoffs.
The only question left is whether the AFC's road to the Super Bowl will run through New England.
Jonas Gray scored the go-ahead touchdown on a 1-yard run early in the fourth quarter after New England intercepted Geno Smith, and the Patriots clinched a bye with a 17-16 victory over the New York Jets on Sunday.
Editor's Picks Danny Amendola, Patriots just good enough With Julian Edelman sidelined with a concussion, the Patriots needed a big game from Danny Amendola. They delivered. No Amendola, no victory -- on a day the Patriots weren't at their best, Mike Reiss writes.
Cimini: Time for Rex to kiss Belichick's rings After six years of bluster and broken promises, the time has come for Jets coach Rex Ryan to kiss Bill Belichick's rings, Rich Cimini writes. 1 Related
"We made plenty of good (plays) in the fourth quarter to come from behind, so that was great," Brady said. "I'm glad it came out the way it did -- makes for a better Christmas. It's always tough to get a win here."
Brady threw a 3-yard TD pass to Rob Gronkowski for the Patriots (12-3), who could earn home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs if Denver loses to Cincinnati on Monday night. New England became the first team to earn first-round byes in five straight seasons.
With the Jets (3-12) leading 13-10 late in the third quarter, Smith's pass for Jace Amaro hung in the air for an easy interception by Jamie Collins -- which led to Gray's score minutes later.
"Yeah, they underthrew it," Jets coach Rex Ryan said. "Poor throw."
Nick Folk had a 52-yard field goal attempt that could have given New York a lead with just over 5 minutes left. But Vince Wilfork partially blocked it.
"I penetrated a little bit and got a piece of it," Wilfork said.
Brady and the Patriots were then able to run out the clock for the win, sealed by Brandon Bolden's 17-yard run on third down with just under 2 minutes left.
"It's unfortunate," Ryan said. "I really thought it was going to be our day."
Brady finished 23 of 35 for 182 yards and was sacked four times, a modest showing while playing without wide receiver Julian Edelman (concussion) and running back LeGarrette Blount (shoulder).
Patriots cornerback Darrelle Revis had a mostly quiet return to the Meadowlands, playing against their former team for the first time since signing with New England -- except for the fans booing them when they made a tackle.
The game could have marked the final home appearance by Ryan, whose future with the team is uncertain in their sixth season.
"I wasn't thinking about anything," Ryan said, "other than I was just a little upset over this game."
New York will miss the postseason for the fourth straight year, and Ryan and general manager John Idzik have come under heavy criticism by fans who have urged owner Woody Johnson to make changes. Several waved yellow "penalty towels" at MetLife Stadium with the words "Fire Idzik!" printed in green. This latest loss certainly didn't make the Jets' faithful -- or Ryan and Idzik -- feel any better.
"It's tough because through this all, he's been the rock," right guard Willie Colon said of Ryan. "I honestly want to win for him, more than anybody."
Gray squeaked into the end zone up the middle -- a video review stood after Ryan insisted on the sideline that the running back's knee might have been down -- to give the Patriots a 17-13 lead with 13:51 remaining.
"It was about making the critical plays," Brady said, "and we found a way to do it."
Marcus Williams' first NFL interception put the Jets in position to go ahead when Brady's pass tipped off Brandon LaFell and into their hands. But Dont'a Hightower sacked Smith on third-and-4 for a 10-yard loss, setting up Folk's long attempt with 5:26 remaining.
Jets center Nick Mangold injured their left ankle in the second quarter and was carted off the field. They said they had X-rays, which revealed no break, but was going for additional tests Monday. New York also played without wide receiver Percy Harvin in the second half after they injured a rib.
Game notes
The win was the Patriots' 250th in 368 total games under Robert Kraft, tying them with Chicago's George Halas for the fastest an owner has reached the milestone. ... Bill Belichick broke a tie with Curly Lambeau for fourth place in overall NFL victories with their 230th. ... Smith finished 17 of 27 for 210 yards. ... Jets LB David Harris finished with 10 total tackles, giving them 1,008 for their career. ... Jets DE Muhammad Wilkerson had a half-sack in their return after missing three games with turf toe.
We've reached Keystone XL pipeline veto day, as the Republican-controlled Congress sends its bill approving the project to President Barack Obama this afternoon (Wednesday).
The TransCanada Corp. (NYSE: TRP ) Keystone pipeline project would bring Canadian tar sands oil from Alberta to refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Cross-border projects require presidential approval following a State Department review. The president has already promised to veto it.
But this is not the first international pipeline project seeking approval...
In fact, in the six years since TransCanada first applied for a Keystone XL permit, the State Department has approved permits for several other cross-border pipeline projects. That adds to the dozens of cross-border pipelines that have been approved over the decades.
According to a 2013 Congressional Research Service study, 46 oil and natural gas pipelines operate across the U.S.-Canada border. If you include Mexico, the United States has 70 cross-border oil and gas pipelines.
Of course, the Keystone pipeline veto is more to appease critics who are concerned about climate change and damaging spills.
The Keystone project in question, however, would make up a tiny fraction of the U.S. pipeline miles.
Just how tiny? Take a look...
Keystone Pipeline Just a Blip on U.S. Map
According to the Association of Oil Pipelines, the United States had 60,911 miles of crude oil pipelines as of the end of 2013. The additional portion of the Keystone that needs approval would be just 1,179 miles.
And crude oil isn't the only hazardous liquid in our pipelines. Including liquid natural gas ( LNG ) as well as refined petroleum products such as gasoline and jet fuel, the United States had 192,396 miles of dangerous liquids pipelines as of 2013. And that doesn't count more than 300,000 miles of natural gas pipelines.
They're everywhere . Just look at this map:
That's not all. If you include transmission pipelines - the ones that go through neighborhoods and supply individual homes - the U.S. has 2.5 million miles of hazardous liquid pipelines.
The Keystone pipeline would add 1,179 more miles. That would be:
A 1.94% increase in crude oil pipelines
A 0.61% increase in hazardous liquid pipelines
A 0.047% increase in energy pipelines of all kinds
But what's most absurd about this controversy is that an almost identical project just went operational last month.
And virtually no one noticed...
A Project Just Like the Keystone Pipeline That You Never Heard About
Just weeks ago, on Jan. 16, Canadian dignitaries joined the CEOs of Enbridge Energy (NYSE: EEP ) and Enterprise Product Partners (NYSE: EPD ) in Freeport, Texas. The occasion was the opening of the last leg of a pipeline carrying Canadian crude from the oil sands of Alberta to refineries on the Gulf Coast.
Just like the Keystone pipeline.
Freeport is the southern terminus of the newly expanded Seaway pipeline. It can carry up to 850,000 barrels of crude oil a day from a hub in Cushing, Okla. (Keystone would carry 830,000 barrels.) There it connects to another Enbridge pipeline, Flanagan South, which started operating in December.
Flanagan South runs north to Flanagan, Ill., where it connects to Enbridge's "Line 61" pipeline. And Line 61 connects to the "Alberta Clipper" pipeline that crosses into Canada on its way to the Alberta oil sands.
When Enbridge ran into trouble getting a permit to expand the capacity of the Alberta Clipper, it simply re-routed the oil to an adjacent pipeline at the border. None of the other projects required presidential approval.
State and local news media covered the Seaway event. But the national media ignored it. They were too busy obsessing over the Keystone XL mania in Congress.
And nary a peep was heard from the politicians.
No impassioned speeches from the likes of Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.: "What does XL stand for? To me it stands for extra lethal."
No bloviating from House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio: "President Obama is now out of excuses for blocking the Keystone pipeline and the thousands of American jobs it would create."
It just goes to show how totally political the Keystone pipeline is.
Even oil industry experts are over the drama.
"Keystone is kind of old news," Sandy Fielden, director of energy analytics at consulting company RBN Energy, told Bloomberg last November. "Producers have moved on and are looking for new capacity from other pipelines."
The Bottom Line : There's nothing special about the Keystone pipeline. Elements on both the left and right simply saw value in politicizing it. Both have used it as a tool to whip up support among the party faithful.
Now How to Profit from a Keystone Pipeline Veto : Over the past month, President Obama has vowed to veto the Keystone XL pipeline. He'll soon get their chance. But while some companies won't be happy about the veto, others stand to benefit. President Obama is about to make these stocks winners...

Move over, Liam — there's a new king of baby names in town! According to prestigious news organization Daily Mail, the name Kylo has dethroned Emma, Noah, Liam and Olivia to become the fastest growing baby name in the United States. The unisex name managed to jump 1,467 places to land in the top 10 most popular names in a span of 5 years.
“Kylo is just murdering names left and right. Boys name, girls name, it doesn't matter. They're all falling at the hands of this two syllable phenom. It makes sense though. Parents are gravitating towards Kylo because it sounds strong, mysterious, and every bit as powerful as Anakin,” said baby naming expert Dr. Leanne Macklemore.
Clearly the name Kylo owes much of its popularity to Disney's new Star Wars films, specifically the villainous character of Kylo Ren played by Adam Driver. The force sensitive Ren sports a unique mask and capelet along with an equally emo attitude, all of which have helped cement them as a fan favorite. Dr. Macklemore also believes the fact that Kylo sounds like the name of one of the members of reigning reality TV royal family The Kardashians, has helped propel the upstart onto more and more birth certificates.
Curiously enough, the names Ben and Luke did not crack the top 100 most popular baby names. There is still hope, however, for other Star Wars names. Rey, Mary Sue and Snoke (of all names!) are each showing signs of growing popularity. Dr. Macklemore believes they'll each challenge Kylo for the throne in the next few years.
So, what do you think? Is Kylo destined to remain popular among millennial parents or will it be a flash in the pan like so much avocado toast? Let us know in the comments below or on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. As always, keep it locked to FakingStarWars.net for all the Star Wars news worth faking.

The moderate Republican Main Street Partnership is dropping "Republican" from its name, Yahoo News reports. The group is now known as "The Main Street Partnership" and hopes to recruit centrist Democrats.
The board voted Tuesday to make the change.
"The goal is to try and fill the void that is the middle," the group's new president, former Ohio member of congress Steven LaTourette, told Yahoo. "The American political system is like a doughnut: You've got sides, but you don't have anything in the middle and it would be my goal to work with Republicans and Democrats who want to find the path forward to getting things done and compromise."
In retiring earlier this year, LaTourette lamented the increasing polarization in the House of Representatives.
“I have reached the conclusion that the atmosphere today and the reality that exists in the House of Representatives no longer encourages the finding of common ground,” they said.
The group has formed a super PAC, Defending Main Street, to support moderate Republicans* in future elections. (New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg (I) has a super PAC that backs candidates in both parties.)
Members of the group include Sens. Susan Collins (Maine), Mark Kirk (Ill.) and John McCain (Ariz.) as well as several influential House members: Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp (Mich.), Committee Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (Wash.), Energy and Commerce Chairman Fred Upton (Mich.) and National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Greg Walden (Ore.).
* LaTourette misspoke in saying that the super PAC would back moderates in both parties. It will only back Republicans, even though the group is opening up to Democrats.

Artie Lange's demons forced them out of their chair at The Howard Stern Show back in 2010, mixed in with a suicide attempt and a fight with addiction that went on until 2011. Now he's clean, on the road, and about to appear in Pete Holmes and Judd Apatow's new HBO project, Crashing. But according a new interview with WEEI's Kirk Minihane, The Howard Stern Show still is an open wound that they have trouble healing.
Hitfix pulled out some interesting points in the interview — which you can listen to in its entirety here — and some of the details they shares about Stern and themselves show the distance between them since they left the show. There's also a lot about how their personal lives became fodder for the show and the public perception is misleading:

Steve (narrator): �The flames continue to spread rapidly, consuming everything flammable with almost unnatural speed.�
Tim: �Not much choice here, is there?�
Ray: �Like that�s something new.�
Amy: �Okay, then � outside we go!�
Steve (narrator): �The party scrambles out into the wintry landscape, where the blizzard has ended as suddenly as it began. Smoke pours from what will soon be the ruined monastery of Solanis.�
Rich: �Geez, Steve, you don�t have to rub it in!�
Brad: �So, you burned down one of your own churches. We did kill the bad guy � your deity ought to call it even.�
Steve: �Keep whining� I can bring back the blizzard.�
Steve (narrator): �High in the mountains, snow falls gently on the roof of a ruined monastery. If anyone had happened to pass at that very moment, they would have seen a strange procession walking slowly in single file out of the rusty iron gates. A procession of shadowy shapes dressed in dark robes.�
Steve (narrator): �When all the shadows have passed the gate, they turn and look back. There, just beyond the gate a stands a tall, dark figure. After a moment that seems like forever, it bows its head towards the gathering of shades, then turns and walks back into the monastery. With that solemn farewell, the shades turn and fade. Then the wind picks up, and for a moment the view of the monastery is obscured by snow. When the view is clear again, nothing remains but the charred shell of the building.�

Frenzied penises, bulbous salutations, bulging trousers, howling, groans, sighs, minty-flavoured tongues, awkward positions and spasming muscles: these all things you would expect to find in some of the winning entries of the Literary Review's Bad Sex in Fiction Award.
Since its debut in 1993, the #BadSex award has been a somewhat light-hearted – with quasi elements of seriousness – spectacle. First created to highlight those authors who have “produced an outstandingly bad scene of sexual description in an otherwise good novel”, the award nonetheless also stresses an important purpose: “to draw attention to poorly written, perfunctory, or redundant passages of sexual description in modern fiction, and to discourage them”.
The awards have increasingly grown in status and are an ever more eagerly anticipated literary event. We've previously compiled extracts of all the winning entries (which can be found here), and reviewing these certainly helps us identify those “outstandingly bad” sex scenes the folk at the Literary Review seek to discourage. Consider, for instance, last year's winning entry from 2015 – from Morrissey's The List of the Lost:
“At this, Eliza and Ezra rolled together into the one giggling snowball of full-figured copulation, screaming and shouting as they playfully bit and pulled at each other in a dangerous and clamorous rollercoaster coil of sexually violent rotation with Eliza's breasts barrel-rolled across Ezra's howling mouth and the pained frenzy of their bulbous salutation extenuating their excitement as it whacked and smacked its way into every muscle of Eliza's body except for the otherwise central zone.”
While this account of full figured copulation may not get the pulse racing in the way the author initially hoped, and may even (gasp! Shock! Surprise! Never!) cause some readers to snicker and giggle in amusement; is simply highlighting perceived examples of “bad sex” enough to stamp out cases of these scenes in fiction? It seems more thorough analysis is needed in order to help identify just what it is about these scenes, such as Morrissey's, which should be avoided by writers – and what authors can do to avoid adding their name to the growing list of Bad Sex in Fiction award winners.
It is, of course, well known that one of the toughest tasks facing writers is to write well and honestly about human sexual relations. It is, after all, technically difficult to convey passion in a way that does not end up sounding either absurd, cringe worthy, or strangely perfunctory and clinical.
Perhaps a problem here is that, in writing about a subject that is still – for whatever reason – vaguely taboo, authors sometimes have a tendency to forget one of the first rules of writing: to “show”, rather than “tell”.
Indeed, it may be more important for writers to focus on the emotional aspect of any sexual encounter between characters, more so than the physical aspect. The physical side of things may be important, but the emotional side may be even more so – especially if there's a connection between sex and identity.
Often, it seems as though writers have a tendency to forget this rule, and instead begin to overthink their sex scenes. This can see awkward similes begin to invade the text, as with 2001's Bad Sex award winner Christopher Hart's Rescue Me, in which sex is likened to a Ranulph Fiennes Antarctic expedition:
“Her hand is moving away from my knee and heading north. Heading unnervingly and with a steely will towards the pole. And, like Sir Ranulph Fiennes, Pamela will not easily be discouraged. I try twitching, and then shaking my leg, but to no avail. At last, disastrously, I try squeezing their hand painfully between my bony thighs, but this only serves to inflame their ardour the more. Ever northward moves their hand, while they smile languorously at my right ear. And when they reach the North Pole, I think in wonder and terror….she will surely want to pitch them tent.”
Such similes are again on show in 2005's winning entry – Winkler, by Giles Coren – in which a character ejaculates “in thick stripes on their chest. Like Zorro.”
And this tendency to overthink things can also make it seem as though writers are sometimes reaching for a thesaurus, when they would be better off reaching for a simpler alternative to better convey their intended meaning. As such we have Tom Wolfe's character in I am Charlotte Simmons exploring a character's “otorhinolayngological caverns” (if you have no idea about what otorhinolaryngological means, then join the club! But a quick google search will tell you it relates to a medical practice involving the ear, nose, and throat – so we'll leave you to decipher just what Wolfe was trying to get at in their description of sex, there).
One of the clearest results of writing in such a way is that any frisson that should be conveyed during the scene is lost: so instead of sincerity, the writing distances both themselves and the reader from the scene being described.
Part of this may come down to a lack of confidence – which may seem strange considering some of the authors who have won the award are literary titans who have won some of the biggest prizes in literature. Yet, as erotic romance writer Lily Harlem has said, “A lot of writers aren't confident enough to write about what's actually happening. They talk about other things like stars exploding above them, rather than talking about how it actually feels and the emotions. You need to get into the heads of characters for realistic emotion, and dialogue as well is importance – people very rarely have sex in silence.”
It is perhaps this lack of confidence which can also see many writers begin to rely heavily on cliché and euphemisms. Again, this might seem strange considering the calibre of the Bad Sex in Fiction Award recipients. Yet writing about a character's throbbing “manhood” or “bulging trousers”, accompanied by “screams of passion” or “gasps and sighs” will do to the writing what clichés and euphemisms do to any other scene – which is to make the writing feel awkward, tired, limited and unoriginal.
These are important points to make, because the Bad Sex in Fiction Award is not about bad sex; but rather, about bad prose. In an article for the Financial Times, Jonathan Beckman, senior editor of the Literary Review, explains:
“'Bad' refers to the quality of the writing rather than the nature of intercourse. Unsuccessful, unpleasurable or abortive sex does not qualify per se; nor does kinky, brutal or unwanted sex, however unpalatable that may be.”
So, if you find yourself in the midst of writing a sex scene, and you start thinking it could be improved by using as many adjectives, similes and metaphors as possible to describe “eager manhoods” and women crying out “making a noise somewhere between a beached seal and a police siren” (thank you to 1997's winner Nicholas Royle's The Matter of the Heart for that one), just take a moment to step back from your writing and think about the way you're approaching your description of sex.
Sometimes, changing your approach to the way you're describing the scene at hand may pay dividends. However, perhaps the most important question to ask – beyond whether you should copy a writer of Phillip Kerr's calibre and opt to use a word like “gnomon” to describe the male sex organ (quick answer to that question: you shouldn't) – is whether the sex scene you are writing is absolutely necessary.
This is because good and effective sex scenes should be integral to the story you're trying to tell. They must advance the narrative and/or character development in a meaningful way, and if they fail to do so, they will look out of place. It's important to remember that one of the reasons the Bad Sex in Fiction Award was originally founded was in response to a seeming trend among publishers who would insist an author or writer include at least one sex scene in their story – regardless to its relevance to the plot or story – simply reasoning that “sex sells”.
Such logic is a poor excuse for the inclusion of any written action if it is irrelevant to the plot of a novel. As Kurt Vonnegut said: “every sentence must do one of two things – reveal character or advance the action”. Therefore, if your sex scene fails to do either of these, the best way forward may be to hit the ‘delete' button, roll up your sleeves, and start afresh – perhaps leaving the scene out entirely. This is not to discourage authors from writing about sex; it is about encouraging them to write well.

It has been several months since we have shared any progress updates on our powertrain development work and in particular how the “powertrain 1.5” program is progressing for the Roadster.
For those of you not thinking about this every day like we are :) the powertrain 1.5 is an improved motor, inverter and gearbox designed to replace our previous two-speed transmission that had much durability, efficiency and cost challenges. We officially kicked off this program just last fall but it is something that Elon and I had discussed several years ago. A very low-cost and efficient single-speed gearbox mated with a continually improving motor, inverter and battery is the core competency of Tesla's powertrain team and it is also our roadmap for future vehicles.
Many people are now working very hard on this project and I'm happy to report that we are holding our initial schedule for production deployment around vehicle #41 later this year. Several significant milestones have been passed in each of the key components that I will discuss in more detail below.
We also have a Roadster with a prototype 1.5 powertrain that we are now driving regularly. The higher torque is really phenomenal. I have many hours behind the wheel of the 1.0 powertrain and this is simply much better. The motor torque is improved by a bit more than 30% beyond what was already great and the ¼ mile time for the car is now in the 12.9 second range. The top speed of the vehicle remains over 120 mph.
Here is a quick refresher on what the powertrain 1.5 is and is not:
An improved inverter (PEM) to deliver higher motor current
An improved motor to handle higher current and torque
A new single-speed gearbox
A new motor to gearbox coupler and an improved motor cable
Upgraded vehicle firmware
NO changes to the battery pack
Power Electronics Module (PEM) Update
It is counterintuitive that one of the most diminutive parts in the powertrain is actually responsible for most of the performance improvement between 1.0 and 1.5. The IGBT (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor) inside of the PEM is what converts and regulates power from the battery. These small parts are improving in both efficiency and power handling capability and by integrating the latest generation of parts, we have been able to boost the PEM output current by about 33% from 640A rms to 850A rms with the same number of IGBTs.
We could have increased the current and torque by just using more of the older IGBTs but this would have required a much more extensive redesign of the entire PEM including the mechanical packaging and cooling systems.
Since the new IGBTs have improved efficiency they also end up giving the PEM better overall efficiency and improve the range of the vehicle slightly. At most operating points the PEM is already very efficient (95-98%) but every little bit helps. Other than this change to the IBGTs and a few improved internal cables the PEM is identical to a 1.0 PEM; without the external serial number labels you can not tell them apart.
Motor Update
The 1.5 motor has slightly more substantial changes to deal with the higher current. We have modified the castings on both ends of the motor called “endbells.” These were modified to allow for a different interface to the new gearbox and also to improve the durability of the fastening between the motor and transmission. We also modified the motor shaft slightly with a larger and stronger output spline to handle the higher torque that the motor can generate at 850A. The bearings remain the same and the internal electromagnetic design of the motor is identical. The same number of turns and lamination geometry are used.
One additional improvement was made to the motor terminal lugs in order to significantly reduce their resistance yielding better efficiency and much less temperature rise at very high currents. Connected to these lugs is the motor cable that attaches the PEM to the motor. We have also reduced the resistance of this motor cable by changing wire material from copper clad aluminum to pure copper. This increases the mass slightly but also improves the efficiency and reduces temperature rise.
Below on the right is a prototype 1.5 motor that is now being tested on the dynamometer at our shop in San Carlos. On the left is a plastic SLA model that we made of the new endbells before the metal parts were ready.
Gearbox Update
The new gearbox is the most significant change from powertrain 1.0 to 1.5. We have significantly reduced the complexity of this gearbox by getting rid of the need for shifting or speed matching between two gear sets. There is only one set of gears that is always engaged with a ratio of (8.2752:1). There are no clutches and we have also done away with the need for an electric oil pump and instead integrated a very efficient gear-driven oil pump into the gearbox. All of these simplifications have saved a great deal of mass and the new gearbox is approximately 45kg instead of 53kg for the old two-speed design.
This mass savings are even more impressive when you consider that we have designed this transmission to have a long life at a much higher input torque (400 Nm) and higher speed (14,000 rpm).
The engineering design of this new gearbox has been finished for over a month and we are now running prototypes through their paces on dynamometers. We built two initial gearboxes with machined aluminum housings so we could gain some early test results before finalizing the cast housing tooling and machining fixtures.
One of the most exciting features of this new gearbox (from an EV perspective) that we have been able to validate on the first prototypes is that it has extremely low spinning drag (less than 0.1 Nm of dry drag torque.) This is less than any other gearbox we have tested with the only possible exception being the EV1 gearbox. This low drag contributes to the 1.5 powertrain having a slightly improved range figure.
The two pictures below show some of the gears and shafts. On the left is the input shaft assembly…spinning up to 14,000 rpm bearing selection is very important. The spline on the right connects to the motor coupling. The picture on the right is the intermediate shaft assembly. Notice the transmission locking “gear” in the center that engages with a stationary pawl when the car is parked.
These are all of the gears and shafts assembled in one case half. The blue automatic transmission fluid (ATF) is not normal and we were just using a blue dye in the ATF to test lubrication distribution in this unit.
This is one of the machined aluminum case halves. This part started life as a solid block of metal! Machining the cases is a quick process for prototyping but it is far too wasteful and expensive for production. The second picture below shows a newer cast version of same part (from the other side) after post-machining. This is how we will build the production gearbox cases.
This is a completed and assembled gearbox prototype ready to go on the dyno. The motor attaches to the top in the picture on the far right and the output shafts to the wheels are in the bottom center of the two pictures on the right. The outputs holes are plugged with aluminum covers to keep oil in and dirt out during assembly.
And finally here are two pictures of a prototype gearbox being tested on the dyno. We run many different tests to thoroughly beat up the gearbox in a more aggressive and controlled environment than possible in a vehicle. One of these tests called the “Wide Open Throttle” or WOT test repeatedly simulates vehicle accelerations from stopped to high speed at maximum torque and then back to a stop under maximum regen. This test is repeated hundreds of times back to back.
Range
I have mentioned on several occasions that we are making parts more efficient in migrating from the 1.0 to 1.5 design. The PEM, motor cable, motor connections, and gearbox are all incrementally more efficient. When all of these are added up it amounts to a meaningful increase in overall vehicle range of around 10 miles.
One common question is why doesn't the range drop since the motor current and torque are increasing? The answer is one of the beautiful characteristics of EVs. The efficiency of this new powertrain when compared with the 1.0 powertrain is actually BETTER at ALL of the operating points that they have in common. This is the exact opposite of how two gasoline engines would compare (an 8-cylinder engine versus a 6-cylinder engine for example.) With an internal combustion engine the efficiency of the larger engine is usually worse at all cruising power levels.
When the 1.5 powertrain is operating at torque levels that are higher than what is possible with the 1.0 powertrain a direct comparison is impossible but the efficiency levels are still very high. The efficiency remains relatively flat all the way up to maximum torque and power. Keep in mind also that very little time is actually spent in the vehicle at above 280Nm of motor torque (the previous limit to the 1.0 system) and on the drives where you do spend lots of time at full throttle you generally are not trying to maximize your range!
Thermal Performance
Along with improved efficiency the 1.5 powertrain will have improved thermal performance over the 1.0 powertrain at all common operating points. This is due to the efficiency of the PEM, motor and gearbox and also due to the slightly increased gear ratio. (Increased by about 12% from 7.4:1 to 8.27:1) This gear ratio change will reduce motor current by about the same ratio ~12% for a given vehicle operating point and this will reduce the thermal load on the motor and PEM.
When operated at torque levels beyond the 1.0 ceiling there is no baseline to compare against. One thought experiment is to imagine that the car is driven hard enough to limit motor performance due to temperature. Once in this condition the 1.5 powertrain will always have about 12% more torque to the wheels than the 1.0 (due to the gear ratio) for the same energy dissipation in the motor. Before thermal limit the 1.5 powertrain will have an extra ~33% from the motor plus ~12% from the gear ratio (45% total) better torque output to the wheels than 1.0.
Peak Power
Although this improved powertrain will have ~45% better torque at the wheels it will not have a significantly higher peak power output and it will not have a higher peak battery current draw. (The two are directly related by the efficiency of the PEM, motor and transmission) Our goal has actually been to keep the peak battery current at the same level (about 650A).
It is best to think about the PEM as an electronic transmission. The car with a two speed transmission didn't have a higher peak power output either but it could achieve a faster 0-60 mph time because the gears multiplied the motor mechanical torque. We are using the PEM to multiply the battery current by stepping up the current to the motor while we step down the voltage.
What is coming next?
Testing, testing and then more testing! Over the coming months we will be continuing to exercise and push the new powertrain components to their design limits on various bench tests. The gearbox, motor and PEM will all spend many more hours running on dynamometers at high and low speeds and temperatures. This accelerated testing will be happening in parallel with upgrading the majority of our engineering fleet of vehicles and several marketing vehicles with the new powertrain 1.5 components and then testing them as fully-assembled vehicles. One car will be taken to Death Valley this summer for aggressive hot weather thermal limit testing and hill climbing tests. Another vehicle will be running a 40,000 km durability test around a track at high and low speeds, over rough cobblestone roads, through salt spray baths and potholes. Still other vehicles are slated to undergo transmission abuse testing and vehicle firmware testing. All of these tests are designed to find any problems before they have a chance to show up in production vehicles.
When all is said and done, this evolution of our powertrain system results in a vastly improved overall product for our customers. We have maintained the key performance targets while increasing efficiency and durability. The more powerful torque curve will make the overall driving experience even better than what was reported on in the major car reviews earlier this year.
Although we faced a significant setback last fall when we realized the previous 2-speed design was not sufficiently durable, the Tesla powertrain team is accomplishing an extraordinary feat in not only overcoming this setback but engineering a superior outcome for Tesla customers.
T they most significant conclusion we can draw from news that a grand jury has been impaneled by Special Counsel Robert Mueller is that the so-called Russia investigation, officially, is a criminal investigation.
The purpose of a grand jury is to investigate a factual transaction or series of transactions to determine whether criminal charges should be filed. That makes it categorically different from a counterintelligence investigation. The latter, we have noted many times, is an information-gathering exercise geared toward understanding and thwarting the intentions and actions of foreign powers.
There is no need for a grand jury in a counterintelligence probe.
All that said, the fact that there is a criminal investigation does not mean charges are imminent, or indeed that they will ever be filed. There are virtually no limits on the investigative powers of the grand jury. Under our law, a grand jury may conduct a probe simply to satisfy itself that no crimes have been committed. That is to say, there is no evidentiary threshold that must be crossed before a grand jury can begin investigating. Contrast that with, for example, a search warrant or an eavesdropping warrant; those investigative techniques may not be used unless a court has first been satisfied that there is probable cause to believe a crime has been committed.
It is frequently observed that grand-jury proceedings are secret. That is not quite accurate. The obligation of secrecy applies to the grand jurors and government personnel who examine witnesses and collect evidence through subpoenas. But subjects of the investigation, witnesses, and their lawyers are under no duty to remain silent — even though it is usually a good idea to do so, since statements can be used as evidence. Of course, there are often government leaks. Putting that inevitability aside, though, it is worth noting who is permitted to speak and who is not. Media coverage of an investigation tends to rely on the people most at liberty to discuss it. That means coverage skews in favor of lawyers for the subjects, who obviously have a motive to minimize the prosecution's proof.
The principal advantage of the grand jury for prosecutors is the ability to issue subpoenas to compel testimony and the production of documentary or other physical evidence. No investigation of any complexity can be advanced without this capacity. When I say “advanced,” I do not mean a progression toward the filing of criminal charges — at least not necessarily. An investigation should be a search for the truth, which means getting to the bottom of what happened, regardless of whether crimes can be proven.
Thus, the fact that we now have a grand jury does not mean a crime has been committed, much less that the filing of charges must be imminent. Still, the impaneling of a grand jury is a highly significant development. Prosecutors do not seek the assistance of the grand jury's subpoena power, and do not contemplate presenting evidence to a grand jury, unless they see a realistic possibility of filing criminal charges.
On that score, we should be mindful, and certainly Special Counsel Mueller should be mindful, that this is no ordinary criminal investigation.
Having spent many years in law enforcement, most of them as a prosecutor, I can attest that criminal investigators are presumptuous. Because of the premium our society places on the rule of law, prosecutors tend to think that nothing could be more important than their investigations and prosecutions. It was not until I worked on national-security investigations — many years into my career as a prosecutor — when it dawned on me that some things (e.g., protecting life-saving intelligence methods and sources) might be more vital to the public interest than my cases.
The ability of the president to carry out their awesome responsibilities is critical to our governance and security. Prosecutors need to be sensitive to this. That does not mean a president should be cut any breaks if serious violations of law have occurred. But it does mean the president should not be under a cloud unless there is a good reason for it. Moreover, the public should be informed about whether the president is under investigation.
Prosecutors never want to give out information about their investigations. The less that is publicly known, the easier it is to interview witnesses, determine whether they are being truthful (rather than mimicking what they've heard in the press), and bring the investigation to an efficient conclusion. So the desire for secrecy is understandable, and in most instances it is desirable. Nevertheless, I believe it is secondary — decidedly so — in this case.
As we've many times noted, Mueller was appointed special counsel in an irregular manner. The regulations that require a description of the basis for a criminal investigation were not followed. The Justice Department told the public that this was a counterintelligence investigation; thus, neither the American people nor the people implicated in the investigation were given notice that crimes were suspected, much less what particular crimes and who the suspects are.
President Trump and the American people should be told whether they are suspected of criminal wrongdoing.
That is intolerable now that we are formally in a criminal-investigation mode.
To be clear, I am not suggesting that the special counsel should be barred from investigating any crimes they reasonably suspect at this point. Nor do I mean to imply that the president is entitled to more favorable legal standards than any other American would be. But in the higher interest of their capacity to function as president and our capacity to hold our political representatives accountable, President Trump and the American people should be told whether they are suspected of criminal wrongdoing and, if so, what wrongdoing.
My secret Santa got me an amazing present. Something I could really use and something I really wanted. The first picture is me in shock after opening the present. The death look is just from the fact that I am sick.
I opened the box slowly (because I was in awe) and discovered the amazing ear buds. These things are the bomb.com. I follwed all the sizing instructions, since it comes with a bunch of different sizes and synched this baby up with my phone.
WOW. I mean it really.. WOOOWWW!! The sound quality is the best I have ever had. The bass is amazing, and its such a little ear bud. PLUS, its sweat/water resistant. No worries about ruining my ear buds from working out! FUN-TASTIC!
And of course the first song that came on when my phone synched up was by Bassnectar, so I really got hit right there with amazing sound. I'm not gonna lie, I started to tear up. A complete stranger gave me this amazing gift. Trivialretort doesn't know who I am, and all he/she does know is pretty much what they found on the internet. What an amazing person to give something like this... and it is such a spot on gift! Trivialretort is the best gifter!!
I absolutely can't to go for a run in these. They work great for so many other things to, like when I am driving in my work car I can pick up Phone calls from them. (Darn work car doesn't have Bluetooth... I know, FWP).
I already told my secret santa this, but once again... THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. I feel like you must know me to give me such an amazing and kind gift but you don't even know me.

The 2015 NHL Draft has come and gone, and most teams have already held their post-draft development camp, getting an up close and personal look at the players they have selected in their new jerseys. However, scouting new talent never stops and with this in mind we turn our attention towards the talent that will be available in the 2016 NHL Draft. It may be early and there is still a full year of hockey to be played, likely leading to a lot of movement between these rankings and where players end up at the end of next season, but still lets take a look and preview the 2016 NHL Draft. It may not have the hype that accompanies Connor McDavid and Jack Eichel, but there will be plenty of talent available.
Early Look at the 2016 NHL Draft
1.) Auston Matthews, Centre, Zurich Lions, 6'2″ 200 lbs: Auston Matthews spent last season with the US NTDP U-18. A late 1997 birthday, they were born just two days too late to be eligible for the 2015 NHL Draft. If they were those couple of days older they would have challenged Jack Eichel for the second overall spot, he's that talented. Matthews broke many of the records set by Patrick Kane during their time with the US NTDP. The Arizona native has made the unprecedented decision to go play pro hockey in Switzerland during their draft year, rather than heading for the NCAA or CHL.
Matthews has very good size.  They are an exceptional skater, who has the stickhandling ability to make plays at top speed and the vision and passing ability to be a dynamic playmaker. Add in good hockey sense and a decent shot, with a quick release and It's easy to see that they have all the attributes to be a top line offensive centre in time. Their defensive game could use a little bit of work, but this is a minor quibble for a player with the high-end offensive potential of Matthews. A good coach can teach them defense, but the offensive instincts, vision and playmaking ability they have can not be learned.
2.) Jakob Chychrun, Defence, Sarnia Sting, 6'2″ 200 lbs: A superb skater, Chychrun's stride looks effortless, theirs pivots crisp, and their agility is outstanding. Already at 6'2″, and still growing, they also have the size teams will be looking for. Add in good vision, strong passing skills and a bomb for a slap shot and they have all the tools to be an offensive force. They have high-end hockey sense and seems to make the right play most times. Chychrun is already developping a strong defensive game, playing shutdown defensive hockey and getting big minutes against top lines even as a 16-year-old last year. They have excellent positioning, good gap control, an active stick, and can play physical without getting themselves out of position. Their game is very comparable to Aaron Ekblad at the same age.
3.) Jesse Puljujarvi, Right Wing, Karpat, 6'3″ 200 lbs: Puljujarvi is big for their age, and plays a game based on excellent strength. They use their body to protect the puck and has the balance and power in their skating stride to fight through checks and get to the net. They also are extremely skilled with soft hands, good stickhandling, and an excellent wrist shot and release. They have all the skills to be a top power forward prospect but Puljujarvi can do it all, also playing the role of playmaker off the wing. They have good vision and the ability to thread passes through the tightest of openings.
4.) Max Jones, Left Wing, London Knights, 6'2″ 200 lbs: Max Jones recently committed to play the 2015-16 season with the London Knights. They have an elite shot with a tremendously quick release. Another big winger who plays a power game, getting in quickly and throwing hits on the forecheck and battling for pucks in the corners and in front of the net. Jones protects the puck extremely well, working the cycle game. They have a good first step, and a strong stride that gives them good speed and acceleration. They can sometimes be too much of a shoot first player though, getting tunnel vision and not being enough of a passer.
5.) Matthew Tkachuk, Left Wing, London Knights, 6'1″ 190 lbs: The son of former NHLer Keith Tkachuk played with Jones on the US NTDP this year, and will also be heading to the Knights for the 2015-16 season. Tkachuk has very good positioning and high-end hockey sense, and the puck seems to follow them around the ice. They understand how to find open spots in the defence. They have an excellent shot and release, as well as a soft touch in close to the net, making them a real goal scoring threat. Good vision and playmaking skill from the wing as well. They backchecks hard and already plays as strong-two way game. Their skating was weak at the start of last year, but improved as the year went on. While he's not a speedster, they are above average and improving.
6.) Logan Brown, Centre, Windsor Spitfires, 6'5″ 215 lbs: Another player with good bloodlines, they are the son of former NHLer, and current Ottawa 67s coach, Jeff Brown. Big and strong, Logan Brown is a dominant player below the hashmarks. They have a powerful stride, protects the puck and takes it to the front of the net. Brown has the soft hands to finish plays in close to the net, and also has a powerful shot from further out. They use their size and strength to protect the puck in the cycle game, extending plays and waiting for teammates to get open. They have the ability to put the puck on the tape, and make saucer passes to get it through traffic in order to set up teammates. Brown must learn to be more consistent game to game in their draft year, doing that could shoot them even higher on the draft board.
7.) Chad Krys, Defence, US NTDP, 5'11” 185 lbs: Krys had a fantastic season last year with the US NTDP. They played so well with the Under 17 program that they were called up to the Under 18 team for the second half of the season, and represented the U.S. at the Under 18 World Championships, winning gold. Krys is a quick skater, with good puckhandling ability. This ability allows them to avoid forecheckers, and skate the puck out of danger. They can also lead the rush, creating offesnsive chances with a good vision, passing skills, and an accurate wrist shot. Krys has very good agility, allowing them to walk the line and create passing and shooting lanes on the powerplay. Defensively they have good instincts, and solid positional play, but must get stronger and play more physical in their own end.
8.) Tyler Benson, Left Wing, Vancouver Giants, 6'0″ 200 lbs: The first overall pick of the 2013 WHL Bantam Draft, Benson has shown to be a strong skater who plays a very gritty and physical game. Their speed helps them to get in quickly on the forecheck and force defenders to make plays quickly or be plastered into the boards. When the puck does get turned over, they get themselves into good position to let go a strong wrist shot or a blistering one-timer. They have a great first step, which helps them to get to loose pucks, or to transition quickly when a teammate creates a turnover in their own zone, creating breakaways and odd-man rushes. Benson's defensive game is also ahead of the curve for a 16-year-old.
9.) Dmitri Sokolov, Centre, Sudbury Wolves, 6'2″ 215 lbs: Sokolov showed off their skill at the Under 17s where they scored six goals in six games and led the Russian team to the gold medal. As an underager they also played for Russia at the Under 18s.  They are a big power forward type, who uses their size to protect the puck well and drive the net. Their wrist shot has an extremely quick release, and their powerful arms and forearms put it on net quickly.  They are very good in front of the net, with the quick hands and good hand-eye co-ordination to get tip-ins and rebounds in front of the net. Sokolov also has good lateral agility and can make slick moves to open up passing lanes, and create space. They need to work on their overall skating though, their stride is choppy which takes away from their overall top end speed and acceleration.
10.) Kale Clague, Defence, Brandon Wheat Kings, 6'0″ 190 lbs: Clague is an outstanding skater. They have great top end speed and acceleration in both directions, and pairs this with good agility, pivots, and balance. This allows them to play a strong two-way game covering a huge amount of ice. They skate the puck up the ice well or can start the transition game with a strong first pass. A natural powerplay quarterback, Clague can walk the line, throws strong, crisp passes, and has an excellent slapshot. They already understand how to keep it low and on net, and how to get it through traffic. Needs to work on their defensive gap control and on being more physical in their own end, but that can come with increased strength.
11.) Sean Day, Defence, Mississauga Steelheads, 6'2″ 225 lbs: Day has excellent size as they are already 6'2″. They also have great skating. Their strides both forwards and backwards are long and smooth. Their mobility is already top notch. They have great offensive instincts, the ability to rush the puck and to run the power play from the point, a hard shot, and great passing skill and vision. Day has some things to work on in their own end, but the talent and work ethic are there.  They are not intimidated and willing to play a physical game against opponents who are older and who have more muscle on their frame at this point in their development. Quite simply, Day has all the tools a scout looks for in a defenceman, and has the potential to be elite. So why do they fall outside the top 10? Though all the tools are there, Day doesn't put them together on a game in, game out basis. They really need to work on being consistent and avoid some of the mental mistakes that have plagued them over their first two years in the OHL. They might be the player on this list with the biggest range of both upside or downside. I could see them at the top of the draft if they put their skills together, and I could see them falling outside of the first round if that doesn't happen. It's a huge year for the player who came into the OHL as an “exceptional player” to years ago.
12.) Sam Steel, Centre, Regina Pats, 5'11” 170 lbs: Steel is an outstanding skater with strong speed, great acceleration, and outstanding agility. Once they get a step on a defender, he's gone. They have outstanding stick handling ability and very soft hands. Steel also has a good wrist shot, a quick release, and the vision and passing skills to be an offensive dynamo. They have outstanding hockey IQ, and thinks the game a step ahead of others. They seem to always make the smart play with the puck on their stick. Steel is also a very hard worker, who constantly keeps their feet moving and is involved in every aspect of the play. Has a bit of peskiness to go along with that high-end skill.
13.) Alexander Nylander, Right Wing, AIK, 5'11” 165 lbs: The son of Michael Nylander and brother of Toronto Maple Leafs prospect William Nylander, Alexander is another highly skilled member of the family. They have tremendous speed and great acceleration. Add into that excellent agility and the ability to change directions extremely quickly, as well as top notch stickhandling ability and they can be a nightmare for defencemen. They have the ability to handle the puck as well as make precise passes while moving at top speed. Their wrist shot features a quick release, but they must add some upper body strength in order to add more power. They also have to work on being more conscientious on the back check and not cheat to create offensive chances.
14.) Clayton Keller, Center, US NTDP, 5'10” 165 lbs: Led the US NTDP U17 team in scoring and was part of the U18 team for the U18 World Championships as an underager.  They are a quick skater with an outstanding first step and an ability to quickly turn on the acceleration. They can dart into openings in the offensive zone creating space to get a pass and get off a quick shot. Their snapshot and wrist shot are lightning quick and deadly accurate. Keller can be a pure sniper. They also use their skating skills to make plays with the puck on their stick, creating passing lanes where they can set up a teammate with a tape to tape pass. Their stickhandling is smooth and they can beat defenders one-on-one. Keller will need to add muscle to their frame going forward though, as they can get knocked around by bigger defenders at this point.
15) Brett Howden, Centre, Moose Jaw Warriors, 6'2″ 185 lbs: Skilled in all three zones. They work hard in the dirty areas of the ice, creating offence by winning battles along the boards, and getting tips and rebounds in front of the net. They also have a strong shot and good release. Howden protects the puck well extending plays, and keeping the puck down low in the offensive zone to create for teammates. They have excellent balance and is tough to knock off the puck. Extremely hardworking, Howden backchecks hard and does the little things that will make them a coach favorite in their own end of the ice.

Sinnott, who was a passenger, seated in the back seat of the car, they refused to answer questions of a police officer during a traffic stop for speeding. The officer repeatedly asked Sinnott and the driver, who are both black, if there was anything in the car that the police should know about, another way of saying do they have drugs with them.
The driver at last said, “No!”, but the officer insisted that Sinnott also answered him. They were just a passenger, how would they know is there “something” in the car that doesn't belong to him? The officer then asked to search the car and again Sinnott told the driver to say “No”.
After the driver refused to allow them to search the car, the officer now focused on Sinnott, who had been taking video all the while with their cell phone.
“Hey, I told you to drop the phone and put your hands behind the car seat,” the officer said. “I said put the phone down and put your hands on the seat! But Sinnott continued to record because they were afraid of police officer's possible cruel actions in case if they turned off the camera. Suddenly they were pulled out of the car and thrown to the ground.
According to report, Sinnott was charged with disorderly conduct but was later released with a court summons.
Why do some cops become so nervous when they get caught on camera? If you are not going to harm anybody then why should you care about cell phone cameras? Police activities need to be recorded in order to restore trust of the society.

Wisconsin Sheriff David Clarke received a standing ovation at the Republican National Convention tonight after speaking barely more than five words to the delegates.
Taking to the stage, Clarke told the thousands gathered in the Quicken Loans Arena: 'Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make something very clear, blue lives matter in America.'
That statement had delegates immediately on their feet with a long peal of applause punctuated with shouts of 'we love you sheriff' and 'police lives matter'.

Clarke then went on to celebrate the acquittal of Lt. Brian Rice who was the latest officer to be charged over the death of Freddie Grey, who died in police custody in Baltimore.
They then accused attorney Marilyn Mosby, who prosecuted the case, an 'activist state's attorney' and described their actions as malicious.
Clarke then went on to speak about the convention's theme, make America safe again, saying it is a 'prerequisite' to making America great again, which has been Donald Trump's cornerstone pledge.
They said: 'We simply cannot be great if we do not feel safe in our homes, on our streets, in our schools.
'I see this every day at street level where many Americans increasingly have an uneasiness about the ability of their families to live safely in these troubling times.
'This transcends race, religion, ethnicity, gender, age and lifestyle.'
They also spoke of security being a 'shared endeavor' which required 'trust' in both citizens and police officers who are tasked with enforcing the peace.
Addressing the recent unrest and demonstrations against law enforcement across America, they described the situation as 'anarchy'.
Sheriff Clarke also attacked the Occupy and Black Lives Matter movements, saying their actions 'transcend peaceful protest and violate the code of conduct we rely on'

Powerful: Wisconsin Sheriff David Clarke received a standing ovation at the Republican National Convention tonight after speaking barely more than five words to the delegates.
Taking to the stage, Clarke told the thousands gathered in the Quicken Loans Arena: 'Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make something very clear, blue lives matter in America.'
That statement had delegates immediately on their feet with a long peal of applause punctuated with shouts of 'we love you sheriff' and 'police lives matter'.
They said: 'What we witnessed in Baltimore and Ferguson and Baton Rouge was a collapse of the social order.
'So many of the actions of the Occupy movement and Black Lives Matter transcend peaceful protest and violates the code of conduct we rely on. I call it anarchy.'
Clarke also spoke about the need for police to be transparent and steadfast in their investigations, before turning to Trump saying 'these are the truths they understand and supports'.
Clarke concluded: 'Donald Trump understands the only way that we can make our nation safe again is to recommit to a system of justice in which no government official, not even those who have fought their way to the marble and granite halls of Washington; no private citizen, no elected official, even Hillary Clinton; no group of people, despite the fervor with which they put forward their argument; can claim privilege above the law.
'It cannot happen in the United States of America.'
Clarke, the Sheriff for Milwaukee County in Wisconsin, has become a conservative icon for their passionate defense of police amidst allegations of abuse of minorities across America.
Indeed, earlier on Monday Clarke had a heated exchange with CNN's Don Lemon in which they claimed to have 'predicted' the recent spate of deadly attacks on law enforcement.
'I've been watching this for two years. I've predicted this,' said Clarke on CNN. 'This anti-police rhetoric sweeping the country has turned out some hateful things inside of people that are now playing themselves out on the American police officer.'
The interview, which followed the deaths of three Baton Rouge officers at the hands of a lone cop-killer on Sunday, got off to a prickly start.

Lemon said that police in Louisiana wanted to preach peace and togetherness after the shootings.
Clarke replied that they didn't believe that and said that Black Lives Matter are fueling hate against law enforcement.
Lemon objected to Clarke calling Black Lives Matter a 'hate ideology' and asked the Sheriff to 'keep the vibe down here'.
This infuriated Clarke who said, 'I'm looking at three dead cops this week and I am looking at five last week. You're trying to tell me to keep it down?!'.
The feisty interview essentially broke down by the end, with Clarke and Lemon at loggerheads over their definitions of Black Lives Matter.

Say the term ‘power suit' and most people think of bold corporate attire. But the expression takes on new meaning when it refers to a powered “exoskeleton,” like Ellen Ripley's power loader in "Aliens," or Iron Man's armor from the Marvel films and comic books.
Until a few years ago, such exoskeletons — metal frameworks fitted with motorized "muscles" that can multiply the wearers' strength far beyond that of normal humans — were entirely fictional. The only real-world exoskeletons were the natural external coverings of animals such as beetles and crabs; protective outer structures that provide a stiff frame upon which their muscles can push against to move their bodies around.

Today, powered exoskeleton suits are becoming a reality; perhaps several hundred commercial and experimental exosuits now operate globally. But until somebody invents the equivalent of the palm-sized power plant Tony Stark wears in their chest, real-world exoskeleton suits will have to make do with an all-too-limited power supply — and much less spectacular capabilities — unless they can stay tethered to electrical cables in factories or at worksites. But any need for power cables runs counter to technology's fundamental long-term aim: enhanced individual mobility for anyone, anywhere.
Even if current exoskeleton suits don't bestow superhuman powers, they will increasingly impact people's lives by helping the infirm get around safely and independently, and assisting workers to perform hazardous jobs with fewer injuries, no small task for anyone — superhero and average Joe included. Add the fact that a new generation of ‘soft' exoskeleton suits is seemingly on the way and in time nearly everybody should be enabled to wear a power suit.
Suiting Up
One of the few people on the planet who has spent considerable time wearing a powered exoskeleton is Steven Sanchez, Chief Pilot for suitX. They test-drives the Berkeley, Calif.-based start-up's Phoenix, a motorized, lower-body framework that rather amazingly enables people with severe mobility issues to rise up from their wheelchairs and walk.
Sanchez, a paraplegic since a BMX bike accident in 2004, is excited about the future of robotic exoskeletons. “This technology can give you the kind of mobility you want,” they say. “It physically opens up all kinds of access that's been lacking, which makes for greater independence and a better quality of life.”

But just as important as the mental side is the social benefit, Sanchez continues. “It lets you break out of the ‘wheel-chair bubble'” which often defines the interactions that disabled individuals have with others. “Just being able to walk up to people really changes how they react to you,” they say.
Few people have tried exoskeletons because they're still very costly. The Phoenix goes for around $30,000, a bargain compared with other medical and therapeutic exosuits, which can cost $80,000 and weigh more than 44 pounds.

Weighing only 27 pounds, Phoenix is an affordable, minimal-design exosuit, says its maker, Prof. Homayoon Kazerooni of the University of California, Berkeley, and co-founder of Ekso Bionics and founder of suitX.
“Rather than a Ferrari, we're making a Honda sedan," they say. "We stripped off as much of the complexity and cost as we could.”
Unlike similar systems, Phoenix forgoes the motorized knee modules found in competitors' suits in favor of a passive mechanism that more faithfully mimics the movement of a human knee. “The unpowered knee gives you a much more natural gait,” Sanchez says, noting that “stubbing your toe when wearing a powered knee can send you flying. That doesn't happen with the Phoenix.”
The Business of Wearable Robotics
Even though relatively few exosuits exist, the list of potential users is long and growing. Beyond the many disabled and elderly people who could make use of the technology, so too could their nurses and caregivers, with health insurance covering the bill. In addition, shipping and industrial workers, loggers and miners would benefit from job-assist exosuits and robotic wearables, perhaps with employers writing off the costs as a safety device. Meanwhile, governments could soon start outfitting fire-fighters, EMS, and disaster personnel, combat troops and logistics specialists with protective exoskeletons.
Cheaper, more capable exoskeletons are on the way, according to Dan Kara, veteran robotics industry analyst at ABI Research. “An entire wearable robotics industry, today comprising around forty R&D groups worldwide, is coalescing that should become a $2-billion global market by 2025.”
“Lower body exoskeletons for rehabilitation or as quality-of-life enablers are available today,” they say, but systems that augment or amplify on-the-job performance are next. “This means assisting with industrial tasks that require heavy lifting, or easing extended standing, squatting, bending, or walking in manufacturing facilities and in the construction and farming industries.” Overexertion by workers costs employers $15 billion a year in compensation, so providing protective exosuits could make good business sense.
Workplace Exoskeletons
SuitX has a new workplace exoskeleton, the MAX, which is crafted to a BS passive, unpowered part of Kazerooni's “design simplification” approach. A lightweight metal frame redirects loads to the attachment points on the body, transferring the strain to the hips and then down to the ground.
“It's not Iron Man; it's all mechanical,” they say. When a wearer bends forward, compressed-air springs in the back to take some of the load off, almost like shock absorbers in a car. The shoulder unit employs a similar assist-mechanism for lifting or working above the head.
“The timber cutters and construction workers I worked with just loved the MAX suit,” says a workplace injury-prevention specialist who recently field-tested the device. “Right away you could see they all felt like superheroes.”
The workers liked it even more on the job site. “Instead of squatting, they could just sit right down into the suit; it becomes a ‘chairless chair,'” they report. “If they're cutting overhead branches or wiring overhead harnesses, the MAX shoulder unit takes the load; all they need do is maneuver the saw or the tools.”
Soft Exosuits
Although limited power supply is still a huge constraint, today's batteries may prove to be enough as exosuit tech morphs into new forms. Not only are passive exoskeletons arriving on the wearable robotics catwalk, but many new exoskeletons have gone soft, eschewing metal frames altogether for flexible fabric and artificial muscles. The new trend stems from a DARPA-funded program dubbed Warrior Web, which seeks to prevent damage to injury-prone areas of the body and minimize fatigue.

Rich Mahoney, co-founder and CEO of Superflex, a Bay Area spin-off of leading research and development lab SRI International, is adapting this idea to create smart sensor-actuated clothing for senior citizens with mobility problems.
“We're calling it ‘powered clothing,'" Mahoney says, "because it's a wearable garment that delivers a little bit of strength just where and when you need it — when you get up from a chair or reach overhead. It's kind of like when an electric bike's power kicks in on an incline. Similarly, it would help you up the stairs."
By mid-2018, Mahoney hopes to unveil the Aura exosuit, an undergarment made of technical fabrics that incorporates both sensors to track the posture and movement of the body, and motorized muscle bands that follow and operate along the body's major muscle groups. When the wearer prepares to move, smart sensors power motors that apply forces tailored to assist a particular motion. The system's intermittent use of scarce battery power is an added plus, they note.
Another proponent of soft exosuit designs is Conor Walsh, a roboticist who heads Harvard's Biodesign Lab in Cambridge, Mass.
“We're developing soft wearable robots that make use of fabrics and textiles to provide a more conformal, unobtrusive and compliant means to interface to the human body," they say. "These suits are much more lightweight and don't restrict the wearer's joints like hard exoskeletons can.”

Walsh's current exosuits are intended for stroke patients, but “there's no reason that similar technology couldn't augment the capabilities of healthy individuals, for example by improving walking efficiency,” they say. It's no wonder, then, that the Lab has partnered with Boston-based athletic shoemaker New Balance to develop soft wearable robotics for the general public.
Both Walsh and Mahoney believe there's a latent demand for "lifestyle" soft exosuit applications. It may very well be that as soft exo-tech gets more affordable, it will start showing up on skiing and hiking trails. Soon pretty much anybody who wants augmented powers may someday get an exosuit — and that could be nearly everybody.
Extrapolation is perilous, but exosuits could one day become mass-produced personal mobility machines for everyone: a fashionable, high-tech device that enables independence, improves overall physical well-being, and operates as a status symbol. In other words, like today's car. Guess it's no surprise that engineers at Hyundai, Honda, Toyota and other manufacturers are hard at work building tomorrow's exoskeletons.

By this point, Pokémon as a series has grown so much that there is a generational gap between young kids who are just meeting their first Pokémon and the 20-somethings who remember the original 150 (151 if you include Mew) from their own childhood. As a special treat, I get to take an early stab at Pokémon Black 2. Taking advantage of my living situation, I picked up the game before its North American Release and decided to take another shot at catching all the Pokémon I can find. For the sake of continuity, I played Black 2 since I picked up Black some time ago. Is the first direct sequel in Pokémon history worth buying? I played hours upon hours of gameplay to provide an answer.
As this is a sequel to Black/White, the story frequently refers back to its predecessor. You play the same character from Black/White, but the game takes place 2 years after the events of the previous game. Your friend Cheren has actually become a gym leader and the same people you saw in Black/White, like Adler, make a return appearance. As you make your way through the 8 gym badges, I noticed different gym leaders in some of the cities, as well as additional characters and events that help shape the world I was exploring. The plot is still more of the same: Evil guy comes in and wants to destroy everything with a legendary Pokémon, and you are tasked to stop him. This time, the odd-named evil corporation of choice is Team Plasma, making a return appearance from the first Black/White. Aside from the references to previous characters and events in Black/White, the story is still the same as it has been since the original games and is still uninteresting to those of us who have played the games for years. I can understand that people might argue otherwise, especially with both the games and the anime being vastly different than the manga. However, the game's story itself has never been the focus of the game, and is still feeling like a secondary priority to the main idea of the entire series: catching Pokémon. I wish the story didn't feel like a cut-and-paste from the game before it. If there was actually an effort put into writing an actual story, I can only imagine how much better the game would be. That isn't to say that the game is bad though, or not fun. All of the fun you remember from any of the previous Pokémon games is still there.
If you are familiar with Pokémon at all, then you probably have an idea of what happens in black 2/White 2. You start off in a small town, receive a starter Pokémon, and start training to be a Pokémon master. Your character travels from city to city fighting gym leaders to obtain gym badges that eventually lead to you fighting the Elite Four. It's been the same formula that has been used since the original games, and it still works. While this is a sequel, your character starts off in a different city and travels to many new locations. The inclusion of more places to see and new locations to visit assists in keeping the game fresh and new. Even though you travel to some of the same locations that were in Black/White, the locations usually have altered in a significant way or you see new parts of the same city. Game Freak has turned the pacing of Pokémon into a science. There is almost perfect balance when exploring through the early parts of the game, allowing you to catch as many Pokémon as you can, and setting each area up to slightly more difficult than the last. This slow evolution is perfect when training your Pokémon as you can train them in the perfect environment before fighting a gym leader. Being the main draw to the game itself catching, training and battling Pokémon in Black 2/White 2 is the best version to start with, and still just as fun if you already have Black/White.
Of all the main Pokémon games that have been released on handhelds, I think that this one is the best version that includes content for the casual Pokémon player and someone who literally has caught every Pokémon to date. Black 2/White 2 incorporated many new features and events that provide more things to do besides battling the gym leaders and catching Pokémon. The Pokémon League Tournament is probably the biggest addition that provides extra content after beating the game. The Pokémon League Tournament (PLT) is exactly what it sounds like – once you gain access to it, you can battle trainers in multiple tournaments. After battling and moving up the ranks, your opponents become gym leaders from all the various regions. If you go through and beat every tournament, you eventually hit the champion's league, where you get to battle legendary trainers like Red from the original Pokémon Red and Lance.
Additionally, things like the Global Link and Dream World both serve to help you catch more Pokémon and interact with other people. The Global Link is a connection to the Pokémon website that allows you to play various minigames to catch rare Pokémon that would otherwise be uncatchable, while the Dream World uses the Global Link to let your Pokémon explore an entire new world and catch more Pokémon. Both of these features were introduced in Black/White and were improved upon even more in Black 2/White 2. One of the biggest changes between Black and Black 2 is the placement of all the Pokémon. In Black/White, you could only capture the 5th generation of Pokémon throughout your first run-through of the game. Only after you defeated the Elite Four could you move into a new area and catch Pokémon from older generations. Now, all the Pokémon are spread out throughout the entire map. In my first 20-30 minutes of playing, I was able to catch a Riolu, a Mareep, and an Azurill. This will definitely please any veteran of the Pokémon series and introduce the older generations of Pokémon to a younger audience. However, with all of these advancements it really made me wonder why events like the Pokémon League Tournament weren't included in the first Black/White. While I can see the obvious advantages of having a sequel, a lot of the features, upgrades, and new events seem like they could have been included in Black/White, especially since the storyline didn't change much. Either way, all of the same fun in catching Pokémon is there, and with all the extras included in the game, Black 2/White 2 is definitely the ideal Pokémon game to buy if you are starting your first Pokémon adventure.
One of the aspects of Pokémon that has evolved over time is the multiplayer/online component of Pokémon. Back when Wi-Fi didn't exist, multiplayer was using a link cable between Game Boys. Now with infrared, Wi-Fi, and the Pokémon Global Link, there are numerous ways to interact with other people. Black 2/White 2 has a strip mall of sorts that you can level up by interacting with other people who own Black/White or Black 2/White 2. The more people you connect with the bigger your mall gets. Although not necessarily that important when running around catching Pokémon, upgrading your mall and connecting with other people gives you the opportunity to obtain rare items and get certain services that can help you train your Pokémon. While there are some neat new side features in Black 2/White 2, there isn't enough to really notice a difference if you were playing Black/White or Black 2/White 2. Your experience would be more or less the same.
When Black/White was released, it was arguably one of the best games in the main series, with all of the upgrades, tweaks and additions made to it. Now with Black 2/White 2, I think that people will say the same thing. Everything Black/White did, Black 2/White 2 does better, and adds even more content: it feels like the sequel is what Black and White should have been a year ago. With all the additional content and tune-ups to existing systems, Black 2/White 2 feels more like a standalone game. You don't need To Black/White to enjoy the game, but there isn't enough content to allow the game to stand on its own. If you have Black/White, you won't be missing much by buying Black 2/White 2 immediately.
Verdict: If this is your first plunge into the Pokémon Universe, then Black 2/White 2 is the ideal game to start with. It's just as fun as the Black/White with even more content. As much as I would like to recommend this game no matter what, I must add a small stipulation: If you are playing Black/White and are wondering whether or not to pick up this game, you might not want to buy it at full price. If added content like the Pokémon League Tournament is enough to convince you to buy it then go for it, but I would suggest waiting until a little later when a price drop occurs. Pokémon Black 2/White 2 is still a really great game, and worth buying for the most part. Unfortunately this game feels like an expansion instead of another full game.

The Oklahoma City Thunder's Russell Westbrook poured in 54 points on Sunday night against the Indiana Pacers but also drew their 16th technical foul of the season, which would merit a one-game suspension under NBA rules.
On Monday, however, the league rescinded the technical, meaning Westbrook can play Monday night when the Thunder hosts the Portland Trail Blazers.
You decide on the merits of the call:
Westbrook's presence is crucial for the Thunder, which is battling the New Orleans Pelicans for the eighth and final Western Conference playoff spot. Oklahoma City and New Orleans have identical 43-37 records with two games remaining. After Monday's game with the Blazers, the Thunder travel to the awful Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday. The Pelicans are at Minnesota on Monday night before closing the regular season at home against the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday.
Thomas Aitken, 32, was caught with the images — some of which featured bestiality — when police raided their home at Bryson Street in 2013.
Aitken pled guilty to having 13 illegal porn images on their computer at an earlier hearing and appeared at Dumbarton Sheriff Court on Tuesday for sentencing.
Fiscal depute Isobel Martin said the case was deferred several times as Aitken's defence agent had requested more detail on what the images depicted but police refused to analyse them in detail.
They said: “From a health and safety point of view of the police officers preparing these reports, it was felt that it could be harrowing enough to view but to sit down and detail what each photograph contained would be simply too much.” They quoted from an email the officer sent them refusing to carry out a detailed analysis, which stated: “It is bad enough for my staff to view these images all day but to have to microanalyse them and detail them is a lot worse.” Aitken's laywer, Tom Brown, said Aitken was very candid with social workers who prepared a background report on them after they pleaded guilty, telling them the offence “wasn't a one-off.” They added that Aitken would “benefit from some assistance.” Sheriff Gallacher warned Aitken that accessing porn of the type they did was not a‘victimless crime'.
They said: “There are victims in these crimes and there are people involved in these crimes.” The sheriff sentenced the Faifley man to 100 hours of unpaid work and ordered that they are supervised for 15 months.
My friend Raoul Pal, mastermind of Global Macro Investor, writes one of the most expensive macroeconomic letters in the world. Their subscriber list is short and extremely exclusive.
Raul comes up with more unique ideas per year than any man I know. What's fascinating is that once they come up with an idea, you then begin to see it filtering into the trading/hedge fund community.
So when Raul has something to say, my ears perk up. And when they lead off a piece this way, I am ALL ears: “I'm going to blow your mind with this following article. My mind is still reeling from my discovery and from writing this piece.”
Turns out he's talking about India. And more specifically, they say that recent advances in that nation's technological infrastructure leave the rest of the world far behind.
And Raoul wastes no time in telling us the implications of this development:
India is now the most attractive major investment opportunity in the world.
That's quite a statement. So rather than tease their insight, I'll just let Raoul make their case.
India
By Raoul Pal
I'm going to blow your mind with this following article. My mind is still reeling from my discovery and from writing this piece.
Let me enlighten you...
Companies that create massively outsized technological breakthroughs tend to capture the investing population's attention and thus their share prices trade at huge multiples, as future growth and future revenues are extrapolated into the future.
From time to time, entire countries re-model their economies and shift their growth trajectory. The most recent example was the liberalisation of China's economy and massive spending on infrastructure, which together created an incredibly powerful force for growth over the last two decades.
But it is very rare indeed that a country develops an outsized technological infrastructure breakthrough that leaves the rest of the world far behind.
But exactly this has just happened in India... and no one noticed.
India has, without question, made the largest technological breakthrough of any nation in living memory.
Its technological advancement has even left Silicon Valley standing. India has built the world's first national digital infrastructure, leaping at least two generations of financial technologies and has built something as important as the railroad was to the UK or the interstate highways were to the U.S.
India is now the most attractive major investment opportunity in the world.
It's all about something called Aadhaar and a breathtakingly ambitious plan with flawless execution.
What just blows my mind is how few people have even noticed it. To be honest, writing the article last month was the first time I learned about any of the developments. I think this is the biggest emerging market macro story in the world.
Phase 1 – The Aadhaar Act
India, pre-2009, had a massive problem for a developing economy: nearly half of its people did not have any form of identification. If you were born outside of a hospital or without any government services, which is common in India, you don't get a birth certificate. Without a birth certificate, you can't get the basic infrastructure of modern life: a bank account, driving license, insurance or a loan. You operate outside the official sector and the opportunities available to others are not available to you. It almost guarantees a perpetuation of poverty and it also guarantees a low tax take for India, thus it holds Indian growth back too.
Normally, a country such as India would solve this problem by making a large push to register more births or send bureaucrats into villages to issues official papers (and sadly accept bribes in return). It would have been costly, inefficient and messy. It probably would have only partially worked.
But in 2009, India did something that no one else in the world at the time had done before; they launched a project called Aadhaar which was a technological solution to the problem, creating a biometric database based on a 12-digit digital identity, authenticated by finger prints and retina scans.
Aadhaar became the largest and most successful IT project ever undertaken in the world and, as of 2016, 1.1 billion people (95% of the population) now has a digital proof of identity. To understand the scale of what India has achieved with Aadhaar you have to understand that India accounts for 17.2% of the entire world's population!
But this biometric database was just the first phase...
Phase 2 – Banking Adoption
Once huge swathes of the population began to register on the official system, the next phase was to get them into the banking system. The Government allowed the creation of eleven Payment Banks, which can hold money but don't do any lending. To motivate people to open accounts, it offered free life insurance with them and linked bank accounts to social welfare benefits. Within three years more than 270 million bank accounts were opened and $10bn in deposits flooded in.
People who registered under the Aadhaar Act could open a bank account just with their Aadhaar number.
Phase 3 – Building Out a Mobile Infrastructure
The Aadhaar card holds another important benefit – people can use it to instantly open a mobile phone account. I covered this in detail last month but the key takeaway is that mobile phone penetration exploded after Aadhaar and went from 40% of the population to 79% within a few years...
The next phase in the mobile phone story will be the rapid rise in smart phones, which will revolutionise everything. Currently only 28% of the population has a smart phone but growth rates are close to 70% per year.
In July 2016, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), which administers Aadhaar, called a meeting with executives from Google, Microsoft, Samsung and Indian smartphone maker Micromax amongst others, to talk about developing Aadhaar compliant devices.
Qualcomm is working closely with government authorities to get more Aadhaar-enabled devices onto the market and working with customers – including the biggest Android manufacturers – to integrate required features, such as secure cameras and iris authentication partners.
Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, recently singled out India as a top priority for Apple.
Microsoft has also just launched a lite version of Skype designed to work on an unstable 2G connection and is integrated with the Aadhaar database, so video calling can be used for authenticated calls.
This rise in smart, Aadhaar compliant mobile phone penetration set the stage for the really clever stuff...
Phase 4 – UPI – A New Transaction System
But that is not all. In December 30th 2016, Indian launched BHIM (Bharat Interface for Money) which is a digital payments platform using UPI (Unified Payments Interface). This is another giant leap that allows non-UPI linked bank accounts into the payments system. Now payments can be made from UPI accounts to non-UPI accounts and can use QR codes for instant payments and also allows users to check bank balances.
While the world is digesting all of this, assuming that it is going to lead to an explosion in mobile phone eWallets (which is happening already), the next step is materializing. This is where the really big breakthrough lies...
Payments can now be made without using mobile phones, just using fingerprints and an Aadhaar number.
Fucking hell. That is the biggest change to any financial system in history.
What is even more remarkable is that this system works on a 2G network so it reaches even the most remote parts of India!! It will revolutionise the agricultural economy, which employs 60% of the workforce and contributes 17% of GDP. Farmers will now have access to bank accounts and credit, along with crop insurance.
But again, that is not all... India has gone one step further...
Phase 5 – India Stack – A Digital Life
In 2016, India introduced another innovation called India Stack. This is a series of secured and connected systems that allows people to store and share personal data such as addresses, bank statements, medical records, employment records and tax filings and it enables the digital signing of documents. This is all accessed, and can be shared, via Aadhaar biometric authentication.
Essentially, it is a secure Dropbox for your entire official life and creates what is known as eKYC: Electronic Know Your Customer.
Using India Stack APIs, all that is required is a fingerprint or retina scan to open a bank account, mobile phone account, brokerage account, buy a mutual fund or share medical records at any hospital or clinic in India. It also creates the opportunity instant loans and brings insurance to the masses, particularly life insurance. All of this data can also in turn be stored on India Stack to give, for example, proof of utility bill payment or life insurance coverage.
What is India Stack exactly?
India Stack is the framework that will make the new digital economy work seamlessly.
It's a set of APIs that allows governments, businesses, startups and developers to utilise a unique digital infrastructure to solve India's hard problems towards presence-less, paperless and cashless service delivery.
Presence-less : Retina scan and finger prints will be used to participate in any service from anywhere in the country.
: Retina scan and finger prints will be used to participate in any service from anywhere in the country. Cashless: A single interface to all the country's bank accounts and wallets.
A single interface to all the country's bank accounts and wallets. Paperless : Digital records are available in the cloud, eliminating the need for massive amount of paper collection and storage.
: Digital records are available in the cloud, eliminating the need for massive amount of paper collection and storage. Consent layer: Give secured access on demand to documents.
India Stack provides the ability to operate in real time, transactions such as lending, bank or mobile account opening that usually can take few days to complete are now instant.
As you can see, Smart phones will act as key to access the kingdom.
This is fast, secure and reliable; this is the future...
This revolutionary digital infrastructure will soon be able to process billions more transactions than bitcoin ever has. It may well be a bitcoin killer or at best provide the framework for how blockchain technology could be applied in the real world. It is too early to tell whether other countries or the private sector adopts blockchain versions of this infrastructure or abandons it altogether and follows India's centralised version.
India Stack is the largest open API in the world and will allow for massive fintech opportunities to be built around it. India is already the third largest fintech centre but it will jump into first place in a few years. India is already organizing hackathons to develop applications for the APIs.
It has left Silicon Valley in the dust.
Phase 6 – A Cash Ban
The final stroke of genius was the cash ban, which I have also discussed at length in the past. The cash ban is the final part of the story. It simply forces everyone into the new digital economy and has the hugely beneficial side-effect of reducing everyday corruption, recapitalising the banking sector and increasing government tax take, thus allowing India to rebuild its crumbling infrastructure...
India was a cash society but once the dust settles, cash will account for less than 40% of total transactions in the next five years. It may eliminate cash altogether in the next ten years.
The cash ban digitizes India. No other economy in the world is even close to this.
Phase 7 – The Investment Opportunity
Everyone thinks they know about the Indian economy – crappy infrastructure, corruption, bureaucracy and antiquated institutions but with a massively growing middle class. Well, that is the narrative and has been for the last 15 years.
But that phase is over and no one noticed. So few people in the investment community or even Silicon Valley are even vaguely aware of what has happened in India and that has created an enormous investment opportunity.
The future for India is massive technological advancement, a higher trend rate of GDP and more tax revenues. Tax revenues will fund infrastructure – ports, roads, rail and healthcare. Technology will increase agricultural productivity, online services and manufacturing productivity.
Telecom, banking, insurance and online retailing will boom, as will the tech sector.
Nothing in India will be the same again.
FDI is already exploding and will rise massively in the years ahead as technology giants and others pour into India to take advantage of the opportunity...
I am long the telco sector (Bharti)...
And I am long the Nifty Banks Index...
I think India is going to offer an entire world of opportunity going forwards.
If I can sum up, it's in this one chart: the SENSEX in US Dollars. It looks explosive for the next 10 years...
Incredible India indeed.
***Hot off the press***
I decided to test the waters on Twitter on Sunday and Monday to find out how many non-Indians were aware of India Stack/Aadhaar. I have 24,000 followers on Twitter, many of which are you guys, and hosts of others heavily engaged in financial markets i.e. it's a decent data sample.
In the 12 hours since the survey began, around 900 people have responded. It appears that 90% of the investment world knows absolutely nothing about the biggest IT project ever accomplished and have never even heard of it.
Now, that is an informational edge.

Back in 1997, BMW took a tilt at the Harley-Davidson market with the R1200C. It was big and relatively underpowered, with just 61bhp—but Teutonic engineering and smart suspension design made up for that. Robert Levinson, however, has transformed their R1200C into a completely different machine. He's raided BMW's ample parts bin to create a high-performance bike with a unique look and a hint of a streetfighter vibe.
The engine is running high compression BBPower pistons matched to ported and polished heads, S-spec cams and GS throttle bodies. A custom lightweight exhaust frees up the breathing, and it's all controlled by a Techlusion-tuned ECU. The new power is fed through a 6-speed gearbox and paralever suspension lifted from an 1100S. The suspension is equally high-spec, with an R1100S Boxer Cup Replika front end; at the back, the frame has been modified to accept an S-spec monoshock. The finishing touch is the front headlight arrangement (and bars) from the R1150R Rockster. Levinson has catalogued the build over four years, and you can see the progress of this very original machine here.
WASHINGTON – The formula for a de facto coup against President Trump is pretty simple and it's happening before our very eyes, according to one of the nation's top scholars and most esteemed political analysts.
And evidence for that theory is backed up by equally renowned political observers.
This is how it works, according to classics scholar, Stanford fellow and National Review columnist Victor Davis Hanson:
The mainstream media pumps out anti-Trump stories to undermine the president.
That creates doubt and uncertainty among lawmakers, especially those from “purple” states (those that are not overwhelmingly Republican or Democratic.)
Removing the support of the “purple” GOP lawmakers gives Democrats a de facto majority to stop the Trump agenda, even though Republicans have majorities in both the House and the Senate.
Speaking with Tucker Carlson on Fox News on Thursday, Hanson described how it began with the creation of a narrative of a failing presidency.
“What were seeing here, I don't want to be too dramatic, it's sort of, historically, a slow-motion coup where you have a nexus of celebrities, academics, the Democratic and progressive parties, and then you have the media, and they feel they can delegitimize a president with a thousand nicks, none of them significant in themselves, but they coalesced to build a narrative that Trump is inexperienced, that they are uncouth, that he's crude, that is reckless,” explained the scholar.
Those small wounds take a collective toll, paralyzing the administration and the government by disabling the Republican majority.
“Each day, the point is to drive their popularity down one half a point, one point, until they can't function in Congress because purple state congressional representatives don't want to take the risk to further their initiatives.”
Hanson described how the mainstream media doesn't need to find any actual or provable wrongdoing by the administration to keep the Democrats' anti-Trump agenda in the headlines and hobble the president.
“I mean we've had a whole cadre of Washington and New York reporters that have done nothing other than, for six months, using all of their tools at their disposal, their genius, their experience to prove that Donald Trump colluded with the Russians, and they can't find anything. They haven't spent commensurate time to look at who was unmasking individuals. That may come out from the House Intelligence committee.”
Even the Washington Post's most accomplished and famous reporter, Bob Woodard, has warned the media about losing their objectivity by “binge drinking the anti-Trump Kool-Aid,” and advised them to “Stick to the reporting.”
Speaking on MSNBC Friday, Woodward observed, “One of the realities we have here is we have a good, old newspaper war going, the New York Times and the Washington Post and some very powerful stories.”
“At the same time, I think it's time to dial back a little bit because there are people around … who are kind of binge drinking the anti-Trump Kool-Aid. And that is not going to work in journalism. Let the politicians have that binge drinking.”
Perhaps Woodward has been sobered recently by the sensational anti-Trump stories coming from their own newspaper that have turned out to be not true.
On May 10, the Post reported that FBI Director James Comey had requested more resources for the Russia investigation shortly before they were fired by the president.
The very next day, interim FBI Director Andrew McCabe contradicted that, saying, “I'm not aware of that request, and it's not consistent with my understanding of how we request additional resources.” They added, “I strongly believe the Russia investigation is adequately resourced.”
Also on May 10, the Post reported that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein threatened to resign after the White House said their memo prompted Trump to fire Comey.
The very next day, Rosenstein said that simply was not true.
Critics have cited a profit motive for newspapers to publish what could be considered fake news.
An article on the Post in Lifezette on Wednesday asserted, “Bashing Trump is good business, and the newsroom has gotten the message.”
The article discussed the reaction in the Post newsroom to a story that claimed Trump had improperly divulged classified information during a meeting, on May 10, with the Russian ambassador. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster forcefully called that story “false.”
False or not, the story was profitable.
Lifezette reported, “At the Washington Post, the newsroom broke into applause as the story surpassed the Post's own record for most readers-per-minute originally set by the ‘Hollywood Access' story, according to Glenn Kessler, the Post's ‘fact checker' columnist.”
Among luminaries on the left, it's not just Woodward who is worried about the current state of reporting at such venerated news outfits as the Post.
“I am appalled at the behavior of the media,” lamented the influential feminist philosopher Camille Paglia on Tuesday. “It's the collapse of journalism.”
“I'm looking forward to voting Democrat again,” they remarked. But they predicted Trump would be re-elected because, “I feel that the media has so utterly lost its credibility that I think people are going to vote against the media again.”
Echoing Hanson's observations, Paglia charged, “Democrats are doing this in collusion with the media obviously, because they just want to create chaos.”
“They want to completely obliterate any sense that the Trump administration is making any progress on anything.”
And why would they want to do that?
Rush Limbaugh had an answer for why the media seem to have become so desperate to stop Trump they would resort to tactics that would discredit their reporting even in the eyes of such as Woodward and Paglia.
On May 11, the top radio talk-show host painted stopping Trump as the defining life-or-death issue for the left.
“They cannot allow for the world to see that something like this (the Trump agenda) could make the country better,” Limbaugh explained.
“They cannot permit that to happen. They cannot permit Trump to improve the economy. They cannot permit Trump to make the nation more secure. They cannot permit Trump to win in international conflicts. They cannot permit it! It must not happen.”
They concluded, “Every victory Trump has is just another sign of how useless and phony the establishment is.”
How does Trump fight back against the coup?
They may have just decided not to play their game.
On Friday, the Washington Examiner reported the president's enraged reaction to a New York Times story that they were about to shake up their staff and fire Press Secretary Sean Spicer.
“F— the New York Times,” Trump reportedly said.
“They're not our friends. We're never going to win them over.”
In the months prior to Skorzeny's death in December, 1999, Skorzeny revealed to Berman the whereabouts and activities of major personalities of the Third Reich who were either declared dead by historians or otherwise reported to have been living in undisclosed locations abroad.
Skorzeny's lifelong circle of intimate associates - many living in the United States - included Martin Bormann, Josef Mengele, Alois Brunner, Walter Rauff, and Reinhard Gehlen. An even more surprising revelation from Skorzeny, involved two domestic Nazis operatives, both well known to the American public: Prescott Sheldon Bush and their "son", George Herbert Walker Bush, the 41st President of the United States.
THE EVIDENCE
To buttress their story, Skorzeny produced a shoebox filled with over one hundred photographs spanning a period of more than sixty years and gave them to Berman. The photos were of the usual family poses taken at weddings, anniversaires, holidays, or family reunions in the decades between the 1930's and the 1990's, but what made these photos highly extraordinary was the identity of the individuals seen within those photographs.
The shoebox photos show Otto Skorzeny posing with the above named Third Reich personalites, along with additional photographs s howing Skorzeny posing with Prescott Bush, their wife, Dorothy Walker Bush, and their son, George Herbert Walker Bush. To say that Berman was in the "right place, at the right time" and was handed what may turn out to be the biggest story to ever come down the pike, is the understatement of the century.
Following Skorzeny's death on December 31, 1999, Bermen gathered additional information about Skorzeny's Nazi cohorts and put the entire story together with 60 or 70 of Skorzeny's shoe box photos - into a copyrighted unpublished manuscript called The Bush Connection.
Some of the more explosive highlights of Skorzeny's revelations include:
1. The Nazi Identity of George Herbert Walker Bush
The true identity and Nazi-planned subversive mission of George Herbert Walker Bush, 41st President of the United States; alleged to have been brought into America (with Skorzeny as their body guard) and covertly adopted by Trading-with-The-Enemy convicted Prescott Bush. Skorzeny claimed that GHW Bush's real birth name was George H. Scherff, Jr., son of George Scherff, Sr., German born assistant to inventor Nikola Tesla.
Curious young George allegedly spent their first years in America snooping around Tesla's lab, helping their father (George Scherff Sr.) in the 1930's steal or glean whatever they could of Tesla's work and report back to Germany. Tesla had casually remarked to an artisan couple named Rey who had recently emigrated to the United States, of the mischievous and devious prying nature of a "little monkey" around their lab whom they had dubbed "curious George." This character would later become the basis of the children's book series, "Curious George"
2. The Assassination of Nicola Tesla
Skorzeny's role (with Reinhard Gehlen) in the assassination of Nikola Tesla (suffocation) on January 6, 1943 after tricking Tesla on January 5 into revealing the full details of their most important discoveries and then stealing their most valuable inventions, along with the contents of their safe, which were delivered to Hitler,
3. Hitler's Fake Suicide
The faked April 1945 "suicide" of Hitler in the Berlin bunker (corroborating the 1948 CIA interrogation of Gestapo Chief Heinrich Mueller, the Nordon Report, and the Russian 1946 Investigative Committee report to Stalin)
4. Nazi Gestapo Forming The CIA
Skorzeny's pivotal role in consolidating the intelligence assets of the Nazi Gestapo and the Nazi-infiltrated OSS (Office of Strategic Services) into the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in 1947, working with George Herbert Walker Bush (Nazi infiltrator George H. Scherff, Jr.), Nazi SS spy master Reinhard Gehlen, "Wild Bill" Donovan (compromised), and fifth columnist, Allen Foster Dulles. Skorzeny claimed central responsibility for setting up the Odessa operation to surreptitiously relocate 50,000 (FIFTY THOUSAND) Nazis into North and South America with CIA complicity and protection,
5. The Assassination of JFK
Skorzeny's claim that Reinhard Gehlen, Josef Mengele, and George H W Bush directly participated in JFK's assassination and other Nazi-inspired plots.
Don Nicoloff published a well researched treatise in two parts in April 2007 in the Idaho Observer titled "Deathbed Confessions, photos support claims that George H. Scherf(f), Jr., was the 41st U.S. president".
The historical archives indicate that "Otto Skorzeny" died in Madrid, Spain in 1975, but Skorzeny told Berman that the date was faked by the CIA, as were the "deaths" of many Third Reich notables. The Third Reich intelligence apparatus, under General Reinhard Mueller, towards the end of the war, faked many "deaths" in anticipation of losing World War II.
The office of Vice President Biden has apologized to a University of Maryland student after a member of Biden's staff confronted the college reporter and forced them to delete photos of an event.
Capital News Service reporter Jeremy Barr was covering Biden's announcement of a new domestic violence initiative, they told Capital News Service, a student news service run by the Philip Merrill College of Journalism.* They accidentally sat in a section of the audience not meant for the media. They had identified themselves as a member of the press upon entry and been directed to that area. Barr took a few pictures of Biden at the podium. After the event, a staffer for Biden confronted them and demanded to watch as they deleted the pictures from their camera.
Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) are led by a group of 15 men, each ordained as an apostle of Jesus Christ. The longest-serving apostle has historically served as the President of the Church. The President selects two apostles to serve with them in the First Presidency. The other apostles form the Quorum of Twelve Apostles with the most senior of them serving as President of the Quorum.
When one of the apostles dies, a new apostle is selected by the President and sustained by the membership of the Church at a General Conference. When the President of the Church dies, the First Presidency is dissolved, leaving the President of the Quorum of the Twelve as the presiding authority of the church. The counselors in the First Presidency return to the Quorum of the Twelve and a new President is chosen by the Quorum.
Two new apostles, Gerrit W. Gong and Ulisses Soares, were called on Saturday, March 31, 2018, to fill the vacancies left by the deaths of Robert D. Hales and Thomas S. Monson.

Established earlier this year, JP WATCH DESIGN is a Sydney based company with the purpose to help preserve the world we live in. Sharing the desire to create a sustainable future, along with a love for fashionable timepieces, the three founders have combined their passions by launching a business with an aim to give back.
The goal of our Kickstarter campaign is to get our company off the ground so that once the campaign finishes we can fully commit to our business model - to donate 15% of the proceeds from each watch sale across our three partner charities. We would love to be able to start our project in its intended form from day one, however, Kickstarter rules specifically prohibit donating funds raised through a campaign. Instead we hope that you will assist us in establishing a unique and worthy business operation that can set the standard for businesses contributing to a wider social good.
This brings us to our product - we are proud to introduce our flagship model, 'The Bearing'. Available in four colour variations, this simple yet sophisticated watch is perfect for everyday wear.
The name ‘The Bearing' is born from the nautical reference of movement relative to another location. For us, the interpretation of the bearing is to be constantly moving in a forward direction – a concept at the core of our business ethos.
We have ambitious hopes to grow a business that maintains a strong social conscience, and we dream of the day that a greater level of responsibility is taken by the corporate world to contribute back to our wider community. ‘The Bearing' represents the moment in which our business and social ambitions align in a common trajectory – moving us on the course to our goal.
We started this company with an idea that we could give back while creating a classic timepiece. Upon the completion of our Kickstarter campaign, we will donate 15% of all future proceeds across three charities that work tirelessly towards:
The company's signature icons - a tree, a whale and a water drop - will be engraved on the back of the timepiece to remind owners they contributed towards a brighter future when they purchased their watch.
Water Collective is an international nonprofit that secures life-lasting clean water for rural communities in Africa and India. The organisation was founded in 2011 to resolve the shortcomings of clean water access in the developing world, where 40% of water points are not working at any given time.
World Land Trust is an international conservation charity, which protects the world's most biologically important and threatened habitats acre by acre. Since its foundation in 1989, WLT has funded partner organizations around the world to create reserves, and give permanent protection to habitats and wildlife.

Koch Industries has officially entered the contentious fight over the fate of the Export-Import Bank, the independent government agency that guarantees loans and provides financing to companies doing business overseas and foreign businesses buying American products—and that has recently become a target for conservatives and libertarians who decry big-government crony capitalism.
On Tuesday, the industrial conglomerate run by billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch sent a letter to Congress urging lawmakers to oppose the reauthorization of this obscure, 80-year-old institution, which otherwise will expire at the end of June. Signed by Philip Ellender, the president of Koch's government affairs arm, the letter signals the start of a Koch lobbying effort aimed at shuttering the New Deal-era agency. The Ex-Im Bank has been living on borrowed time since September, when Congress temporarily extended its charter. But now Koch Industries wants Congress to eradicate the agency for good.
“The Ex-Im Bank is yet another example of the government intervening in the market to pick winners and losers,” Ellender writes. “It confers benefits granted by the American people as a whole to a small number of well-connected corporations. It socializes the risk of economic activity while benefiting relatively few companies.” (Read the full letter below.)
Since last summer, the bank has been under assault by conservatives who say the little-known credit agency doles out “corporate welfare” to major corporations, including Boeing, while leaving taxpayers on the hook for loans that private lenders deem too risky to underwrite. (Not only conservatives have slammed the Ex-Im Bank. Shortly before they were elected in 2008, Barack Obama called the bank “little more than a fund for corporate welfare,” but as president they have supported the agency.)
The battle has created a rare fight between some Republicans and the business community, including powerful trade groups such as the US Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, which strongly support keeping the Ex-Im Bank alive. Eliminating the bank, supporters argue, will cost the nation thousands of jobs and hinder the ability of US companies to compete overseas.
In the past, Georgia Pacific, which is owned by Koch Industries, has taken part in deals made possible by Ex-Im Bank financing. Georgia Pacific has “engaged in a small number of transactions” involving the Ex-Im Bank, “not as a direct borrower” but as a result of deals with foreign companies that received Ex-Im financing, Ellender tells Mother Jones.
It's not surprising that Koch Industries would part with the business community on this issue and side with the tea party and libertarian wings of the GOP that ardently desire the extinction of the Ex-Im Bank. Charles Koch, whose funding and strategic planning during the 1960s and 1970s helped expand the libertarian movement, has long opposed government interference in the marketplace. They have especially denounced subsidies (though their company will make use of them to remain competitive), bailouts, and corporate handouts. They believe that accepting government perks causes companies to subjugate themselves to government regulation, and they worry that free-market advocates in the corporate world appear hypocritical when they oppose the social safety net for people but seek government benefits for their firms. “How discrediting it is for us to request welfare for ourselves while attacking welfare for the poor,” Koch wrote in a 1978 call to arms to the business community. “Our critics rightfully claim that we want socialism only for the rich.” In the same article, they called the GOP “the party of ‘business' in the wors[t] sense.”
Despite their best efforts, Koch's crusade against “corporate welfare” didn't catch on several decades ago. But as the Koch brothers have slowly gained influence within the Republican Party—ultimately establishing what amounts to a shadow party of their own within the GOP—there's evidence that Charles Koch's libertarian philosophy is taking root, and there's no better example of that than the Ex-Im Bank fight. A constellation of groups backed by the brothers, including Americans for Prosperity, have been organizing to eradicate the Ex-Im Bank for months. “I would not say it's coordinated—not at all,” Ellender says when asked how closely Koch Industries has been working with the advocacy groups and think tanks leading the Ex-Im Bank fight. They say Koch's effort to shutter the outfit is “part of a macro strategy to eliminate subsidies, mandates, and government-created market distortions where they exist.”
Why did the Kochs and their allies single out an agency most Americans have never heard of? “Ex-Im represents both a policy and political target because it's doable,” Diane Katz, a fellow at the Heritage Foundation, which has been at the forefront of the anti-Ex-Im campaign, told Bloomberg. “We're not trying to take down the Federal Reserve here. We're starting with an agency that is ripe.”
The key word is starting. This is part of a larger effort that Richard Fink, Charles Koch's longtime political adviser, outlined in an interview with the Wichita Eagle shortly before the 2012 election:
The Kochs aren't finished. Win or lose in November, they plan to start a new fight. They are organizing dozens of business and grassroots groups to build support for eliminating all corporate and agricultural subsidies. The country must deal with corporate welfare, which they say exceeds $350 billion a year, before it can rein in spending on Social Security and Medicare, Fink said. “How is any American going to feel good about reforming Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security when there is so much cronyism going on with these companies and business people are making off with so many tax dollars?” Fink asked.
There are powerful interests on both sides of the Ex-Im fight, and it remains unclear whether the embattled bank will win another last-minute reprieve. But the letter from Koch Industries and its accompanying lobbying campaign may help sway reticent Republicans seeking backing—or fearing opposition—from the Kochs' deep-pocketed network of donors and advocacy groups. Bank opponents already have key allies on Capitol Hill, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas), chairperson of the House financial services committee, which has oversight of the Ex-Im Bank. Bills to reauthorize the Ex-Im have been circulating through the House, though Hensarling could block them from coming to a vote before their committee.
“Ultimately, I think we will prevail,” says Ellender
The Ex-Im Bank has emerged as a conservative litmus test for the GOP's crop of would-be presidential contenders. At a conference organized by the conservative Club for Growth late last month, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush urged the bank be eliminated. Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) have also called for its charter to expire.
The Koch letter and the company's behind-the-scenes lobbying will undoubtedly help to elevate the issue within the Republican Party. “We're not looking for credit,” Ellender says. But they add, “I would indeed hope we have had an impact on the debate.”

UOČI zime gotovo svi veći hrvatski gradovi pripremili su svoja prihvatilišta za smještaj beskućnika, pokazuju podaci iz Plana zbrinjavanja beskućnika u ekstremnim vremenskim uvjetima, koje je i ove godine izradilo Ministarstvo socijalne politike i mladih.
Ministarstvo je od većih gradova zatražilo izvješća o osiguranju adekvatne skrbi za beskućnike tijekom po život opasnih vremenskih uvjeta, a od svih domova za starije i nemoćne osobe kojima je osnivač država da se uključe u privremeno zbrinjavanje ljudi bez svoga doma.
Prvi puta je skrb o beskućnicima uvrštena u Zakon o socijalnoj skrbi 2011. godine. U zakonu stoji da je beskućnik osoba koja nema svoj dom ni registrirano mjesto stanovanja niti sredstava kojima bi mogla namiriti potrebu stanovanja, te je privremeno smještena u prihvatilištu ili boravi na javnim ili drugim mjestima koja nisu namijenjena za ljudsko stanovanje.
U Hrvatskoj između 1.500 i 2.000 beskućnika
Po informacijama zagrebačkih gradskih službi, u našem najvećem gradu registrirano je oko 400 beskućnika, a po evidencijama iz prenoćišta diljem Hrvatske računa se da ih ukupno ima između 1500 do 2000.
O svojim beskućnicima Zagreb skrbi već niz godina tako što im osigurava smještaj u prenoćištima gradskog Crvenog križa, Caritasa Zagrebačke nadbiskupije i dislociranom objektu u Rakitju.
Prema podacima iz tih prenoćišta, među korisnicima većinom su ljudi sa srednjoškolskim, pa čak i višim obrazovanjem. Zadnjih desetak godina u resocijalizaciji, traženju posla i rješavanju administrativnih pitanja pomažu im mnoge udruge i volonteri.

Rijeka jedina ima objekte "nužnog smještaja"
Rijeka već sedamnaest godina, kao jedini grad u Hrvatskoj, ima objekte tzv. "nužnog smještaja". To je specifičan smještaj jer se korisnicima subvencioniraju režijski troškovi i mogu biti prijavljeni na toj adresi, što je bitno za ostvarivanje svih drugih prava koja proizlaze iz sustava socijalne skrbi.
Nužni smještaj trenutno koristi 450 osoba, a grad godišnje na to potroši oko 630.000 kuna.
U Rijeci je također pokrenut projekt "Socijalne samoposluge", a prošle je godine, osim prihvatilišta za beskućnike s 13 kreveta u suradnji s udrugom "Oaza" otvoreno još jedno prihvatilište koje grad finacira s više od pola milijuna kuna.
U manjim gradovima prosječno do deset beskućnika
Po podacima iz Plana zbrinjavanja beskućnika, u manjim gradovima ima prosječno do deset osoba koje nemaju krov nad glavom. Tako se u Zaprešiću godišnje evidentira do pet beskućnika, a za njihov smještaj izdvoji oko 100.000 kuna. U Velikoj Gorici ih je troje.
Pula je 2012. godine zajedno s tamošnjim Crvenim križem otvorila prihvatilište u kojem trenutno boravi 10 korisnika. Grad je dogovorio suradnju s Domom za psihički bolesne osobe "Vila Maria" da u slučaju ekstremnih vremenskih uvjeta smjesti još 10 korisnika.
U Gospiću do sada nije bilo beskućnika, a ako se neki tamo zatekne gradske vlasti osigurale su jedan stan.
Zadar osigurao smještaj, zdravtsvene preglede i obroke
U partnerstvu Grada Zadra i Caritasa Zadarske nadbiskupije 2006. godine je izgrađeno i opremljeno prenoćište za beskućnike koje se nalazi u neposrednoj blizini Caritasove pučke kuhinje.
Ljetos je prostorija uređena kao dnevni i poludnevni boravak za pokretne samce koji imaju gdje prespavati. Od početka godine do kraja rujna u prenoćištu je na povremenom ili stalnom smještaju bilo ukupno 72 korisnika.
Osim smještaja imaju i redovni zdravstveni pregled, tri obroka dnevno, pomoć u ostvarenju socijalnih prava. Za provedbu svih aktivnosti grad godišnje osigurava oko 450.000 kuna.
Do sada se broj beskućnika u prenoćištu nije bitno razlikovao zimi od ostalih razdoblja, pa nije napravljen poseban plan za zbrinjavanje u zimskim uvjetima. Ipak, ako bi se ukazala potreba, brzo bi se osposobili prostori u jednoj od bivših vojarni kojih je na području Zadra popriličan broj.
Split bez zahtjeva za smještaj zbog ekstremnih zimskih uvjeta
U Splitu nije bilo posebnih zahtjeva za smještaj radi ekstremnih zimskih uvjeta. U prenoćištu koje vodi udruga "Most" može se smjestiti do 35 osoba. U slučaju da to ne bude dovoljno prostor će osigurati gradski Crveni križ.
U Dubrovniku trenutno nema beskućnika koji borave na cesti, ali postoje kategorije građana koji stanuju u neprimjerenim stambenim uvjetima. Trenutno su na raspolaganju dvije slobodne sobe, a grad se spreman pobrinuti za smještaj u slučaju da se zimi povećaju potrebe.
U Varaždinu trenutno ima tridesetak beskućnika, koji dolaze iz manjih sredina. Smještaju se u prenoćište koje ima 17 mjesta, a po potrebi pomoćni kreveti mogu biti postavljeni u dnevni boravak. Većina beskućnika ruča u Caritasovoj pučkoj kuhinji, a doručak dobivaju iz pekarnice koja donira svoje proizvode od prethodnog dana.
I Slavonski Brod u suradnji s Crvenim križem osigurava smještaj beskućnicima, no za otvaranje još nije bilo potrebe jer se nitko nije javio. U pripremi je 10 ležajeva, a u slučaju potrebe mogu se osigurati dodatni. Brigu o beskućnicima preuzet će Crveni križ koji će im osigurati tople obroke, odjeću, posteljinu i higijenske potrepštine.
Grad Osijek u suradnji s Caritasom provodi program skrbi za beskućnike u Domu sv. Vinka Paulskog koji može primiti 24 osobe.
Vukovar bez zahtjeva za smještaj u prihvatilište
U Vukovaru do sada nije zaprimljen niti jedan zahtjev za smještaj u prihvatilište ili prenoćište, a grad nema osigurane kapacitete. No, u slučaju hladne zime grad će se za to pobrinuti kroz postojeću institucionalnu pomoć.
Beskućnici na vinkovačkom području do sada su mogli računati na smještaj u Domu za psihički bolesne i odrasle osobe u Nuštru, no zbog velikog broja ljudi s poplavljenih područja koji su tamo smješteni mjesta trenutno više nema.
Na sreću, po evidencijama tamošnjeg Centra za socijalnu skrb trenutno je samo jedna osoba sa statusom beskućnika. Procjena je da bi ove godine najviše šest osoba moglo zatražiti smještaj, za što će grad pronaći rješenje, stoji u planu za smještaj beskućnika Ministarstva socijalne politike i mladih.
After a month of rumors and leaks, Microsoft has released the Arc Touch Mouse. The device is available for presale on Amazon.com, BestBuy.com, and Buy.com for $69.95. It will ship in early December, and will officially be available online and in stores in January 2011.
Redmond is touting Arc Touch as "the first mouse designed to flatten for portability and pop up for comfort." It's all about portability: less than 15 millimeters thick at its widest point, it collapses to turn off and pops up to turn on. The mouse requires two AAA batteries that Microsoft says give it more than six months of battery life (the two-color battery life indicators will keep you informed).
In addition to its compact form factor (see the Silverlight demo), the Arc Touch has a capacitive touch scroll strip: move a finger slowly on the strip for controlled scrolling, or flick a finger for fast scrolling that can be stopped with a simple tap. The mouse uses a capacitive sensing technique and sensor pads to detect each position and velocity change, and also includes haptic feedback to simulate the bumps of a traditional scroll wheel. The strip also has three tap buttons: page up, page down, and a reprogrammable (Microsoft's IntelliPoint software required) middle click area.
The Arc Touch includes Microsoft's usual mouse features such as a magnetic 2.4GHz wireless Nano transceiver that snaps into the bottom of the mouse and BlueTrack technology to let users use the device on virtually any surface. The only requirements are a USB port, and either Windows XP, Windows Vista, or Windows 7.
Thumbs up from two legends, Ashton and Hawyes.
It's never easy to write about a serious injury but this one is especially tough as Martyn Ashton is a rider that has been inspiring riders for what seems like forever.
During a demo at the Moto GP on the 1st of September Martyn fell backwards from a 3m high bar landing with “significant force” on their back. After being stabilised they were airlifted to Coventry Hospital where it was discovered they suffered severe damage to their spinal cord and dislocated their T9 and T10 vertabrae.
The initial prognosis isn't good as Martyn has currently lost feeling below the point of injury. Having been transferred to RJ & AH Hospital, Oswestry's Specialist Spinal Care Unit they are receiving the best possible care.
Ashton's long standing riding partner from Tricks and Stunts and Chainspotting Martin Hawyes has been with Martyn through this tough start to a long road of recovery. Martyn thanked everyone for the support they have received so far:
Since the accident I've received so many wonderful messages and well wishes, I can't thank everyone enough for those – it has been hugely supportive. I'm also incredibly lucky to have amazing family and friends, who are all rallying around myself, Lisa and Alfie and helping us through this tough time. As a result I'm feeling very positive and ready to face the tough challenge ahead. I'm just taking it day by day, hoping that I can make enough progress over the next three months to be home for Christmas.
Martyn was almost finished shooting the sequel to their hugely successful Road Bike Party video, we've heard on the grapevine that they are already working in ways to finish the edit so watch this space.
Everyone here at Dirt wishes Martyn the best recovery possible and we're looking forward to what they have up their sleeve for Road Bike Party 2. For now lets have a look at the first and most creative road bike video we have ever seen.
In what seems like a great setup for a joke about Tony Stark and House Stark/Game Of Thrones that we haven't quite nailed down yet, The Hollywood Reporter says that Robert Downey Jr. might be getting ready to star in an HBO drama of their very own. He's apparently developing a show with True Detective creator Nic Pizzolatto, but no specific details about it have been revealed yet. Also, THR notes that it doesn't even know if there's “any official deal” in place, so it's still possible that nothing will come of this. The article does present a theory, at least, suggesting that the project is a reboot of legal drama Perry Mason. Robert Downey Jr. has been trying to get a project like that off the ground for a while now, and teaming up with Pizzolatto could be the way to do it. Either way, Downey is expected to star in whatever this show ends up being.

Hajnal Ban (also known as Hajnal Black) is an Australian lawyer, author and former conservative politician, who was convicted of charges that prevented them being elected to public office between 2012 and 2016.[1]
They were elected on 15 March 2008 a councillor for Logan City but was disqualified from 27 March 2012. Previously they were a councillor for the (now defunct) Beaudesert Shire Council from 27 March 2004. They were an unsuccessful National Party candidate for the federal seat of Forde, south of Brisbane, at the 2007 federal election. They won Liberal National Party selection for the newly-created federal seat of Wright in November 2009, but subsequently lost endorsement following allegations they mismanaged the funds of a 65-year-old man.[2]
In 2002 they underwent surgery to increase the length of each of their legs by 8 cm. They published their experiences in the book God Made Me Small, Surgery Made Me Tall under the pseudonym Sara Vornamen. They also released a book called Them Secret.[3][4]
Early Life [ edit ]
Ban was born in Afula, Israel, to Hungarian parents.[5] Ban's grandfather was an Eastern European Jewish Holocaust survivor who moved the family to Israel in 1976 to escape communism.[6] The family moved to Austria in 1980 and then immigrated to Logan City, south of Brisbane, Australia in 1983. On gaining pre-selection for a federal seat, Ban relinquished their Israeli citizenship as Section 44 of the Australian Constitution forbids the election of people holding dual citizenship.
Education [ edit ]
Ban was educated at Marsden Primary School and then Marsden State High School in Logan City, graduating in 1995.
After high school they entered Griffith University's law school and obtained degrees in Law and International Business. Ban was then admitted as a Barrister-at-Law in 2001.[6]
Personal Life [ edit ]
Ban was mentored by Brisbane barrister and business person Russell Tacon.[7]
Marriage [ edit ]
On 30 May 2010, Ban married Logan City Councillor Sean Black,[8] who had acted as their campaign manager. They were known as Hajnal Black until they separated in mid-2012.[9]
Leg lengthening surgery [ edit ]
In 2002 Ban undertook radical cosmetic surgery to gain 8 cm of height. They travelled to the Russian Ilizarov Scientific Center for Restorative Traumatology and Orthopaedics in Kurgan, Russia where they were operated on by Dr Constantine Novikov.[10][11]
Over a period of 5 months Ban was bedridden as their legs were lengthened. The process of lengthening took 12 months. They returned to Australia and talked to the media about their operation under the pseudonym Sara Vornamen in an attempt to hide their identity. Under the name 'Sara Vornamen' Ban wrote a book about their surgery, God Made Me Small, Surgery Made Me Tall.[12][13]
Brisbane's Courier-Mail revealed in April 2009 that Sara Vornamen was actually Ban.[14] Since that time Ban has received worldwide attention for their surgery[15] and has been a commentator on issues from sex discrimination to extra airline charges.[16]
Political career [ edit ]
2004 - 2008, Shire of Beaudesert Council [ edit ]
Ban was first elected as Councillor for Division 4 in the (now defunct) Shire of Beaudesert on 27 March 2004 at the age of 26, when they significantly out-polled their four male opponents.[17] They were the youngest-ever councillor to be elected in the shire and the only barrister. They were elected as an independent and had no previous political party affiliation, but joined the National Party in 2006.
They were chairperson of the Shire's Planning and Development Committee from April 2004 to December 2005, when they were removed from the post, in a move spearheaded by Councillor John Fronis, over their opposition to the State's decision to designate the North McLean Enterprise Precinct in the South East Queensland Regional Plan, which would have placed heavy industry in the middle of their rural-residential division.[18]
2007 federal election [ edit ]
In the 2007 federal election, Ban stood as the National Party candidate for the seat of Forde.[19][20] Although they worked hard at their campaign[21] and was credited with achieving a larger than expected swing, Ban only achieved 12.2% of the primary vote.[22] The voter base in the Forde electorate is heavily urban, so it was always unlikely the electorate would have voted for a National Party candidate over its urban conservative sister party, the Liberals.
2008 local government elections [ edit ]
In July 2007, the Queensland Labor Government announced widespread reform to local government. The major reform was to amalgamate many councils, and Beaudesert was included in the process. Half the Shire was amalgamated with the Shire of Boonah to create the Scenic Rim Region while the other half was amalgamated with Logan City. Ban's entire division was in the area to be amalgamated into Logan City. Them division underwent significant change when it was merged with the neighbouring Division 5 (held by John Fronis, a Labor councillor) to form the new Logan City Division 11. Fronis and Ban subsequently contested the new division at the March 2008 elections, with Ban winning convincingly, even in areas where the Labor vote at state and federal elections had historically been high. Ban achieved 66.06% of the two-candidate-preferred vote to Fronis' 33.94%.[23]
Post 2008 election [ edit ]
After their election to Logan City Council, Ban was elected chairperson of the Community, Sport and Customer Services Committee, but was removed from the position in May 2009, and replaced by a neighbouring urban-based councillor, Phil Pidgeon, because of their strong and somewhat outspoken advocacy for the amalgamated areas they represent.[24]
In late 2008, Ban formed an alliance with Sean Black, the only other rural-based councillor, and together they advocated strongly for their similar constituencies. Ban and Black married in 2010.
2010 LNP candidacy for Division of Wright [ edit ]
After questions were raised by Queensland's Adult Guardian about Ban's administration of an elderly man's estate, the Liberal National Party revoked its endorsement of them as the candidate for the federal division of Wright on 7 June 2010.[25] The LNP claimed the Adult Guardian's questions were never disclosed in their vetting committee. Ban voluntarily surrendered their power of attorney on 2 July 2010, after which proceedings in the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal were ceased.[26]
Ban claimed the LNP disendorsed their pre-selection because men in the LNP hierarchy were never comfortable with a woman being pre-selected in a winnable seat.[27]
2012 Logan City Council election [ edit ]
Ban originally nominated to run again as councillor for Division 11, but several weeks prior to the election they withdrew from the contest.[28]
Policies on gaming machines [ edit ]
Ban is an anti-pokies campaigner and continues to advocate for the reduction in the number of gaming machines within the Logan City local government area.[29] Ban voted in several ballots to remove Deputy Mayor of Logan, Russell Lutton, who is a pro-pokies councillor.[30][31][32][33] Lutton has since fought back criticising Ban.[12][34]
Criminal charges [ edit ]
In November 2011, Ban (then known as Hajnal Black) faced criminal charges for allegedly breaching local government financial disclosure laws. In December 2011, a Brisbane judge found they had failed to act properly on behalf of a dementia patient after the sale of their Park Ridge property south of Brisbane. The funds from the sale had been transferred into Ban's own bank account instead of being held in a separate trust account.[35] Ban lodged an appeal against the decision of the Supreme Court in January 2012. In March 2012, they had two warrants issued for their arrest, for ignoring one court date and storming out of another.[36] On 27 March 2012 they were found guilty on four of the five charges, fined $3500 and ordered to pay costs of $5000, and had a conviction recorded.[37] In September 2012 the judge ruled they were only entitled to $40,000 of the $700,000 they took.[38]

Students at Mohawk College are suffering a “crisis of quality” because of a new learning system that is increasingly moving coursework online and out of the classroom, according to a new report from the union that represents college instructors.
What the college calls "blended learning" is just one of the problems stemming from a “climate of fiscal austerity” in Ontario colleges that is placing more weight on budgets than education, writes Kevin MacKay, a pop culture and sociology professor at Mohawk College and the report's author.
The college maintains education and student satisfaction is its top priority, and that any moves toward more online coursework stems from the evolution of the education system, not cost-cutting measures. All of Mohawk's lecture-based programs are now blended, and combine in-class with online learning.
You can't make an academic argument for watering down these courses. - Kevin MacKay, Mohawk College instructor
But Mohawk has been the most aggressive of Ontario's 24 colleges in pursuing online courses, with an administrative mandate that has barrelled in over faculty and student objections, MacKay told CBC Hamilton. “The squeeze has really been put on,” the Ontario Public Service Employees Union (OPSEU) member said. “There's been a lot of student pushbacks.”
Social service work student Michael Van Arragon is one of those students pushing back. They say students “naturally rebel” from online coursework, which they find “confusing, bland, and not intuitive.”
“It's inherently disturbing when you're paying for your education,” the 22-year-old said. The most rewarding learning in their program has been face to face, and students have been quite vocal about having that taken away, they say — especially considering there is a focus in their program on the skill of face-to-face interaction. “It feels a little silly to be watching YouTube videos or Ted Talks,” they said.
Not a cost cutting measure: college
But Mohawk spokesperson Jay Robb says Van Arragon's sentiment isn't one shared by the majority of students. According to the provincial Key Performance Indicators survey of students at Ontario colleges, 91 per cent of students said “online learning was important.” With many students juggling school, work and a personal life, “moving a portion of their courses online gives them greater flexibility,” Robb said.
“This is not meant to be cost cutting,” they told CBC Hamilton. “This was never the intention at Mohawk.”
But Van Arragon says blended learning is “obviously a cost-cutting technique,” and MacKay is steadfast that “you can't make an academic argument for watering down these courses.” According to the Innovative Practices Research Project from Human Resources and Skills Development Canada, Blended learning has the “potential to enhance and transform Canadian higher education” and also helps to “provide the digital literacies essential for a global graduate and knowledge worker.” But the report also notes faculty resistance and student reluctance to the process, and insufficient support systems for the practice.
In the union report, MacKay also highlights a shift from full time to part time instruction and a lack of faculty control over the programs in Ontario colleges as a problem rising from funding decreases. In the 70s and 80s, governments funded over 75 per cent of operating revenues for colleges. Today, it's about 50 per cent. That's turned the college focus from education to revenue, they say. Corporate sponsorship and partnership with private colleges has done nothing but water down the education experience, they added.
“Essentially, students are paying more to get less.”
Financial constraints a factor
Robb admits that all post secondary institutions are dealing with fiscal constraints, stemming from salaries, benefits, and building maintenance. Some of the buildings at Mohawk are close to 50 years old. The college has had balanced budgets for the last five years, they say, with some money left over to reinvest in infrastructure and programs.
“At the end of the day, we've been very successful … at living within our means and giving a great student experience. We're always looking to improve.”
"Intervention Canada" airs the premiere episode of its third season exclusively on CBC's Documentary Channel, Monday night.
The reality television series takes a look inside the world of the addict showing viewers the work of professional interventionists invited by families to help them when all hope seems lost.
"A lot of addicts really think they're isolated, it's an isolating disease, that no one cares anymore," said Andrew Galloway, a Toronto-based Substance Abuse and Behavioural Health Specialist.  They are an International Certified Alcohol and Drug Counsellor working with the show.
"When the family comes forward and says, 'we love you, you're hurting us in the following ways, … this behaviour needs to change, but here's some help,' 90 per cent of people will accept that help."
A recovering addict himself, Galloway says "Intervention Canada" is an important program because it raises awareness about the challenge alcohol and drug addiction places on the community surrounding an addict. They sought help for their addiction to crack and alcohol about 15 years ago in what they say was a "moment of clarity."
"I got to a place where I was either going to die or change ... I put my hand up and had the courage to ask for help and fortunately was able to get it when I did ask."
They say they offer their own experiences to the addicts that the team is intervening on and opens up a sense of trust by relating to the guilt and shame all addicts experience along the journey to recovery.
"That helps me build an alliance with the person I'm intervening on because I've been there. I also can give them a little hope and say look, my life's changed," said Galloway.
"Unfortunately, too many Canadians when they want help, they try and get it and there's these long waiting lists to get in to get that help that they need. When someone wants that help it's a shame that we're not able to provide it."
Wait times for services in B.C. can range anywhere from two weeks to three months for admission to a rehab facility according to Drug Rehab Services.
Galloway has said that the success rates of recovery of the addicts and their families from the previous seasons of the show ranges from about 70 to 90 per cent. Through the series, they hope to give addicts and their families a sense of hope.
"I think we're providing Canadians with insight into what thousands of people go through every year, watching loved ones struggle. Families realize that there is a way out and that they're not alone," they said.

SoulCalibur VI's New Screenshots Show Sophitia and Mitsurugi in Action; New Characters Confirmed
Giuseppe Nelva December 18, 2017 4:51:56 AM EST
Bandai Namco shows Soul Calibur VI's Sophitia and Mitsurugi in action, and confirm that the game will include new characters.
Today Bandai Namco Entertainment Europe provided a new look at the upcoming fighting game SoulCalibur VI.
The batch of new screenshots shows the two fighters that we already know, Sophitia and Mitsurugi, which isn't surprising considering that they're two of the most classic faces of the franchise.
Interestingly, the accompanying press release mentions that the game will come with a “complete roster” of returning characters, plus “some newcomers.”
The game will also include a story mode featuring the epic struggle for SoulCalibur and SoulEdge. New features will also be on the menu, with the Reversal Edge letting you guard and counterattack, opening up for devastating combos. The Critical Edge will be a signature move for each character delivering high damage.
The Soul Charge will push the opponent away granting a temporary power up to turn the tables of a match, and the Lethal Hit will let you destroy armor parts worn by the opponent under certain conditions.
Below you can check out the new screenshots. If you want to see more, you can also watch the first trailer, a second clip, and some gameplay straight from PlayStation Experience.
The game will release in 2018 for PS4, Xbox One, and PC.
Blizzard has revealed another card for the upcoming Goblins vs Gnomes expansion set, recently announced for Hearthstone.
The Goblin Auto-Barber can only be used by the Rogue class, and adds an extra point of damage to whatever weapon the player has equipped when the card is played onto the board. Not only that, it also leaves the player with a pretty tasty two mana minion in play.
Mechs are a new category of cards coming in Hearthstone's first expansion, and the Auto-Barber is the first such Rogue card to be revealed. As well as Mech-specific synergies, there are plenty of interesting new card combo options for Rogue players to look forward to.
A Rogue going second in a match, for example, could equip a basic Hero Ability dagger on their first turn and follow up with the Auto-Barber on turn two, leaving them with a healthy board presence and a strong removal tool early on in the game.
The card also synergises very nicely with weapon-boosting and removal spells like Deadly Poison, Assassin's Blade and Blade Flurry.
Raw damage and minion removal advantages aside, it also acts as an immediate equivalent board response to the popular Acidic Swamp Ooze card, which not only destroys an opponent's weapon when played, but also leaves the disarmed player staring down the barrel of a 3 Attack 2 Health minion.
Goblins vs Gnomes was unveiled at BlizzCon last weekend, and will add more than 120 mechanically-themed cards to the hugely popular collectible card game.
Blizzard has teased around 30 of the new cards over at the official website, and is currently running a social media competition to determine which cards are revealed in the coming days and weeks.
The expansion's due to be released at some point in December, and you'll be able to buy the new card packs using in-game Gold or real money. The Goblins vs Gnomes packs will also replace the Expert card packs awarded after finishing a run in Hearthstone's Arena mode.

An official from one of the main opposition groups in Syria sent a letter of congratulations to Israel for Independence Day on Thursday.
The Free Syrian Army's Mousa Ahmed Nabhan said they hoped that next year the day would be marked at the Israeli embassy in Damascus.
Nabhan sent the letter to Mendi Safadi, who served as chief of staff to Druse MK Ayoub Kara (Likud) when the latter was deputy minister for development of the Negev and Galilee. Safadi has independently met with members of the liberal and democratic Syrian opposition who oppose the Islamists and want friendly relations with Israel.In the letter, shared with The Jerusalem Post's Hebrew sister publication Ma'ariv, Nabhan wrote: “On behalf of Free Syrian Army, we extend our very best wishes and congratulations to the State of Israel and the great people on the 67th anniversary of the independence of the State of Israel.”Nabhan said their hope to celebrate with Israel in Damascus next year would come after Syria was “liberated from axis of evil criminals led by Iran through its customers in the region, headed by the criminal Bashar Assad and their Nazi regime, who brought to Syria radical terrorist groups, in order to demonize the revolution and prevent the free world's sympathy with it, and threatened the security and stability of the region and the world.”Nabhan, who is responsible for foreign relations of their movement, said they were thankful for the Israeli leadership's “esteemed humanitarian positions toward the Syrian revolution and its people,” adding that their movement would not forget the state that “stood alongside them in their ordeal and supported their legitimate issues.”He added that the “overwhelming majority of the Syrian people” is moderate and has been “looking forward for a long time to establish the best special relations at all levels with the Israeli neighbors.“With best wishes to the leadership of the State of Israel and its people for health, happiness, progress and success,” Nabhan concluded.Ariel Ben Solomon contributed to this report.

First off, I think I'll rank the remaining teams according to their optimized lineup of available players:
Team Rating Rnk Optimized Rnk %>Rating Perfect World Rnk %>Rating Louisville 139.5 1 146.7 1 5.1% 148.8 1 6.7% Florida 135.8 3 143.2 2 5.5% 143.2 3 5.5% Michigan St. 130.5 6 141.8 3 8.7% 142.0 4 8.8% Arizona 138.1 2 141.8 4 2.7% 143.9 2 4.2% Virginia 131.8 5 138.3 5 4.9% 138.3 5 4.9% Wisconsin 132.2 4 137.4 6 3.9% 137.6 6 4.0% Tennessee 128.6 9 136.2 7 5.9% 136.5 7 6.1% Kentucky 128.1 11 135.1 8 5.5% 135.5 9 5.7% UConn 125.9 13 133.2 9 5.8% 134.0 11 6.4% SDSU 125.7 14 132.6 10 5.5% 134.6 10 7.1% UCLA 129.0 8 132.1 11 2.4% 132.4 13 2.6% Michigan 129.9 7 131.7 12 1.4% 136.3 8 5.0% Baylor 126.7 12 130.9 13 3.3% 131.1 14 3.4% Stanford 121.9 15 129.3 14 6.1% 130.9 15 7.4% Iowa State 128.2 10 128.7 15 0.4% 133.9 12 4.5% Dayton 117.8 16 121.5 16 3.2% 122.5 16 4.1%
The column on the left is the general team rating based on the whole season – the rating that serves as a basis for the player ratings.
The column on the right is the “in a perfect world” lineup scenerio – one in which ALL players that played during the season are available and healthy – AND a tighter tourney rotation is being used to get the best players more playing time.
But, the teams are actually ranked above by the middle column. “Optimized” is the highest team rating that can be achieved by playing the best players the highest amount of established tourney minutes. Teams that spread the playing time wealth during the season (ie Louisville) will see a rating boost when they tighten the lineup and play the best players more. Also, any team that struggled through injuries all season but now are relatively healthy (ie MSU) will also see a ratings boost.
Conversely, a team that is having to adjust to a more recent injury to a quality player (ie ISU) won't see much of an improvement over the genaral seasonal rating.
The Predictions:
Stanford vs. Dayton : Dayton is easily the weakest remaining team, and Stanford would be the 2nd weakest – but that's now debatable with Niang being out for Iowa State.
Pomeroy has Stanford by 2. My general team ratings have Stanford by 2.3. Utilizing the player ratings with optimized lineups, Stanford wins by 4.2 points.
Wisconsin vs. Baylor : Wisconsin is the better team, but Baylor has been playing above their heads. Pomeroy has Wisconsin by 2, my general team ratings have Wisconsin by +2.9. Optimizing the current lineups, you get Wisconsin winning by 3.3 points.
Florida vs. UCLA : Pomeroy has Florida by 5. My general team ratings have Florida +3.5. Optimizing the lineups gets the spread to Florida by 5.5.
Arizona vs. San Diego State : Pomeroy has Arizona by 5. My general team ratings have Arizona +5.5. Optimizing the lineups actually brings the spread closer – Arizona wins by 3.9.
If Brandon Ashley were playing, I'd have the spread moving to 4.7 in Arizona's favor. Ashley would be worth +0.8 points in this particular game.
Tennessee vs. Michigan : Is Tennessee the best 11th seed ever? Pomeroy has Tennessee winning by 1. My general team ratings have Michigan by a measly 0.6. Optimizing the lineups shifts the favor over to Tennessee by +2.2 points.
In a perfect world, a healthy Mitch McGary would creat a pick 'em game – McGary being worth +2.2 points in this case.
UConn vs. Iowa State : ISU being without George Niang will be tough. Pomeroy has ISU by 1, and my general team ratings have ISU by 1.3. However, optimizing lineups (and adjusting to life withough Niang), I have UConn the favorite by 2.6 points.
If Niang were playing, I'd have ISU favored by 0.4. So, in this specific game Niang is worth 3 points.
Louisville vs. Kentucky : This Louisville team is better than the Florida team that went back to back ‘ships a few years back – yet it feels like people are kinda sleeping on them.
Pomeroy has Louisville winning by 5. My general team ratings have Louisville by 6. Optimized lineups have Louisville winning by 5.8 points.
If Chane Behanan were still with Louisville and playing, I'd have the spread moving to a +6.7 in Louisville's favor – effectively making Chane Behanan worth around 0.9 points for this game .
Michigan State vs. Virginia : Pomeroy sees a 2 point victory for Virginia, although my general team ratings have Virginia only by 0.6.
However, the team ratings for Michigan State were generated much of the season while the team battled injuries to its three best players. Now healthy, the optimized lineup actually has Michigan State winning by 1.6 points.
Recap:
Louisville over Kentucky by 5.8 points.
Florida over UCLA by 5.5.
Stanford over Dayton by 4.2
Arizona over SDSU by 3.9
Wisconsin over Baylor by 3.3
UConn over ISU by 2.6
Tennessee over Michigan by 2.2
Michigan State over Virginia by 1.6.

News|Schedule / Results|Officers &Coaches| Octane Open Season With Two Victories Aug. 10, 2015 The Octane opened their 2015 CILL campaign over the weekend playing three games in 18 hours at Eagles Ice Center in Grand Rapids. When the bags were packed and the players ready for the commute back to Pittsburgh the team sat tied for second in the CILL standings with a 2-1 record. Facing the Lansing Hot Rots in the first game, the Pittsburgh offense proved ready by scoring the opening three goals of the game. Leading 12-5 by halftime, the game was never in doubt and the Octane cruised to a 20-10 win. Brian Frank poured in a team-high five goals to lead the Pittsburgh offense. Jeff Arneson, Aaron Gofreed, Ryan Hilyer and Ed Monahan all netted hat tricks while Tom Roule and Jeff Giodan split time in net. Later than evening the Octane faced CILL-newcomer Indianapolis Copperheads, who lost their inaugural game that afternoon. This game was also a dominant Pittsburgh win, scoring 14 goals in the first half on their way to a 19-5 victory. Leading the offense in game two was Jordan Dykla with six goals and an assist, Frank (3 goals, 2 assists) and Gofreed (3 goals, 1 assist). Roule and Giodan combined for 21 saves to stop the Copperheads. Before heading home the Octane had a 10 AM date with the host team, Grand Rapids Dragonfish. Trailing 3-1 at first intermission, the Octane endurance began to fade and face an 8-2 deficeit at halftime. Pittsburgh failed to find the back of the net in the second half and Grand Rapids captured the win 15-2. Pittsburgh (2-1) will be home for their next game playing host to the Cleveland Demons (3-0) on Saturday. Game time at Pittsburgh Indoor Sports Arena is scheduled for 1:00 PM.

At midnight on Wednesday July 4th, 2012, I finally sit down to watch Room 237, the documentary about people obsessed with Stanley Kubrick and The Shining, in which I am one of the five featured obsessives.
Those of you also obsessed with The Shining will nod in solemn observance of the mystical significance of the exact time and date of my viewing of my own screen debut, but for the rest of you... well, where do I start? Where do I start to try to explain the complex web of synchronicity surrounding Kubrick's most enigmatic creation?
Scores of people have written thousands of words trying to explain The Shining in great detail - all of whom have different points of view, and none of whom cover "everything", none of whom have discovered the Higgs boson of the film. The more you look, the less you know. I can't offer you the secret, but I can give you a brief tour of some of more puzzling anomalies hidden within The Shining...
Ullman's Disappearing Cigarette Trick
Besides the famous 'impossible window' and hotel manager Ullman's weird hand shapes, the interview scene also offers one of Kubrick's bizarre continuity errors. Notice the differences in the two shots above. Besides the pen changing angles, in the lower right hand corner of the screen the cigarette in the ashtray seems to disappear. There is no practical reason why this error would occur as no one in this scene ever smokes. In fact, no one in the whole movie is seen smoking except for Wendy. If you look at the ashtray closely, you'll notice that the cigarette hasn't really disappeared, just the glass ashtray has been rotated 90º clockwise. Take into account that in the film's climax Wendy takes a 90º clockwise turn to enter the bloody elevator hallway located directly behind Ullman's false window. Coincidence? Maybe, but these are the kind of things that keep you up at night once you start obsessing over the details in The Shining.
The Three-Storey Moving Tree
This is the final frame of the shot where Ullman is giving the Torrances the tour of the Overlook Hotel grounds. Notice that Ullman walks right in front of a moving car - a little bit of Kubrickian slapstick humour. Also notice the three-storey tall tree at the far left of the screen, only viewable for a second at the end of this moving shot.
Later in the film when we see the hotel exterior again, the tree is missing.
Even further into the film we see the tree has moved several yards down to the left past the third awning. Fairly elaborate continuity error - what is Kubrick trying to communicate here? Kubrick has said that they left out the animated topiary animals from the Stephen King novel because the special effects would be unconvincing, but here they are, moving trees around subliminally.
The Red Witch & The Black Skier
The posters in the games room scene are a gallery of mysteries. Is the 'Ski Monarch' poster a symbol for Illuminati mind control? Or is it an in-joke reference to Stephen King, deposed monarch of The Shining? Questions without answers, but I'd like to point out a different poster, the one by the door in the first shot of the scene.
What exactly are we looking at? Another skier? Or a hunched-over witch in a red dress knocking at a door? Another echo of Hansel and Gretel to match Wendy's reference to a trail of breadcrumbs? Or a purposely vague image to trap the imagination of seekers like myself?
Other posters in the film also confound. What is Julius Erving doing here in the lobby of The Overlook and why does it look like skis and ski poles have been airbrushed into the picture? For a resort closed for the winter, there seems to be awful lot of focus on skiing in the decor.
Driving The Big Wheel Beyond The Veil
Notice in this one frame from Danny's second Big Wheel ride around the Hotel hallways we see for a split-second the stained glass windows from the vast Colorado Lounge. In this split-second we can make a physical connection between the Lounge and this floor, which includes the famous hexagonal carpet and of course taboo Room 237. A very expensive split-second because it requires a working second storey to be added to the already incredibly large Lounge set. This gives you an inkling of the absurd lengths Kubrick will go to make a tiny subliminal detail that will go unnoticed by almost everyone watching the picture. Also notice the strange diaphanous curtain hanging down from the stairwell. We are moving beyond the veil...
Dissolving 2001: A Space Odyssey
Of the many dissolves in The Shining, this might be my favourite. The scene fades from Wendy and Danny watching TV in the lobby to Danny entering their suite upstairs, but in this instant it seems as if the doorknob takes Danny's place on the blanket by the TV and the door chain extends out from it. Now consider the door chain resembles the spaceship Discovery and the doorknob resembles HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey. As Danny is replaced by a murderous computer in this scene, it foreshadows Danny being replaced by Tony, who definitely has MURDER on their mind. The television is the method of psychic communication that Danny uses to bring their 'spaceship' to the Hotel in the form of the Hallorann-piloted Snow Cat.
Up Or Down The Mountain?
Speaking of the Snow Cat, when we see Hallorann driving it towards the mountaintop hotel, it paradoxically seems as if the vehicle is moving downhill.
Later on when Wendy and Danny use the Snow Cat to escape the Hotel, it seems as if they drive the vehicle uphill, into the clouds...
The Loser Has To Keep America Clean
Have you noticed there is no toilet paper in Room 237?
The Edge Of Sanity
Here's the "great party" man, one of the fabulous WTF moments from the climax of the film - but what is that in the glass case to the right? Some sort of fossilized fish or bird head? Another vague and unidentifiable shape lurking in the corners... and speaking of corners, check out the lower right hand corner of the screen. See how it seems as if the dark wood molding disappears into the side of the white column? Seems like reality crumbles around the edges in The Overlook.
Wendy's Knife Switch Trick
Wendy goes from left-handed to right-handed to left-handed to right-handed in the four scenes of their 'shining' visions of The Hotel - color coded blue and red too. I don't know what to make of this one, even if the knives seem only to be literally shining in the blue scenes.
One Final Parting Shot
Did you ever notice the man-bear-pig upstairs has Wendy's eyes?

MLS fans and followers have been clamoring for action in regards to Nigel de Jong's challenge on Darlington Nagbe on Sunday, and the league will have to make an important decision this week regarding their eligibility for upcoming games.
In the 73rd minute of the LA Galaxy's 1-1 tie with the Portland Timbers, De Jong used a studs-up tackle on Nagbe. The challenge forced the U.S. Men's National Team midfielder off the field on a wheelchair following the game, and it has been the focus of talk across the nation since it happened.
The league has been cracking down on reckless challenges to start the 2016 season, and referees have issued multiple red cards over the past several weeks in the hopes of cleaning up the game and preventing injuries. De Jong only received a yellow card for the tackle, but many fans, followers and analysts are expecting the MLS Disciplinary Committee to issue the Galaxy midfielder a ban of at least one game.
De Jong has stated that it was not their intention to hurt Nagbe, but they also admitted their tackle was not 100 percent clean.
“I went over the ball a little bit and caught mostly their ankle,” De Jong said.
The league's disciplinary committee has already handed out multiple suspensions through six weeks of action, including banning Brek Shea, Ronald Zubar and Christian Bolaños for serious foul play. The league even handed Vancouver Whitecaps forward Masato Kudo a one-game ban for embellishment.
A similar one-game ban for serious foul play could be expected for De Jong, but due to the Dutch midfielder's history of strong challenges, MLS may decide to suspend them for longer.
With all that in mind, here is the SBI Question of the Day: How long should De Jong be suspended?

Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement Twenty-three dolphins have died after becoming stranded on the Cornish coast. An RNLI lifeboatman described Porth Creek near Portscatho as a "scene of carnage" after the dolphins died there. One was believed to be pregnant. Rescuers helped seven of the animals rejoin their pod out at sea. Two dolphins had to be put down, one of them was found stranded at Trellisick. The British Divers' Marine Life Rescue charity was responding to reports of more dolphins stranded along the coast. It is thought a few dolphins may have got into trouble and their distress calls lured others into the inlet. It's a horrible scene of carnage with bodies everywhere
Dave Nicoll, Falmouth lifeboat Helmsman Dave Nicoll, from Falmouth Lifeboat, said two of their crew got into the water with the dolphins. They said earlier on Monday: "It's a horrible scene of carnage with bodies everywhere, but we are doing our best to help and will continue to support the expert groups." Coastguards said the dolphins swam up the Percuil River and were beached in Porth Creek on Monday morning. Details of the dead dolphins were logged before their removal A team from the Divers' charity worked with vets and coastguards to rescue seven of the stranded mammals. Another animal had to be put down. Charity spokesperson Tony Woodley said this was the biggest mass stranding of marine life in the UK for many years. "We haven't seen a stranding anywhere near this scale since 1981 when pilot whales were beached on the east coast. "This is extremely rare." They said the animals were striped dolphins - an ocean-going, rather than coastal breed. One theory is that a few of the animals may have followed fish, which were feeding on a large algae bloom, into the river mouth. It is believed their distress cries may have lured other members of their pod to the creek. The carcasses of the dead animals were removed from the creek and logged by volunteers from Cornwall Wildlife Trust before being taken away for post-mortem examination.

Carlton marquee star Darcy Vescio was the best afield in the Blues' big win over the Demons
CARLTON marquee signing Darcy Vescio booted two goals as their team slammed home six unanswered goals in the final term to crush Melbourne by 43 points in Saturday's NAB AFL Women's practice match at Ikon Park.
Leading by eight points over the Demons at the final change, the Blues got rolling in the final quarter and made their opportunities count.
Rookie Nat Exon also booted two majors in the 8.4 (52) to 1.3 (9) victory, while Bianca Jakobsson, pick No.3 in last year's women's draft, also added a goal to the tally.
"The result is really pleasing so early on and gives us great reward for effort, however, we're under no illusions to the fact that there's a lot more work to be done before round one," Carlton women's coach Damien Keeping told carltonfc.com.au.
"The work rate was really significant on the back of a hard pre-season building a strong fitness base to finish games well. The perseverance to find a way to get on top after being challenged early on was terrific."
Aliesha Newman booted Melbourne's solitary goal and vice-captain Mel Hickey said their team would learn plenty from the hit-out.
"It was definitely a quick game. It gave us a taste of what 16-a-side is probably going to bring in the AFL Women's season. We're pretty disappointed with the result on the scoreboard, but there are heaps and heaps of things for us to work on," Hickey told melbournefc.com.au.
"They (Carlton) really pulled away in the last quarter, so it was probably a lapse in concentration. It was our first game and we dropped off a bit in the last quarter and we weren't able to hang in."
Carlton opens its AFLW campaign in the opening match of the competition against Collingwood on February 3. The Demons play the Brisbane Lions on February 5.
Meanwhile, despite two goals from impressive 18-year-old Kate Stanton, Greater Western Sydney lost its clash against the Brisbane Lions by 16 points at Griffin Park in Coorparoo.
The teams were met by slippery conditions as the rain hit early in the game but the Lions adapted better than their rivals as they closed out a 3.10 (28) to 2.0 (12) victory over the Giants.
Lion Shaleise Law, whose game style has been compared to Adelaide superstar Eddie Betts, stood out with their tackling pressure up forward.
Jessica Wuetschner, nicknamed 'Woosha,' was strong up forward, while Brittany Gibson ran hard in the midfield.
Amy Schmidt's determination in putting pressure on the opposition was important for the Giants.
The Giants have a first-up meeting against Adelaide on February 4.
Entry is free to all AFLW matches excluding games that form part of a double header with the JLT Community Series. For more information on purchasing tickets to those matches, please click here.

* Anti-crisis plan to cost at least $35 bln
* Includes measures to help banks and companies
* Government pledges to cut other spending items (Adds context and analyst comment)
By Jason Bush
MOSCOW, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Russia announced a $35 billion “anti-crisis” spending plan on Wednesday to bail out an economy battered by Western sanctions and falling oil prices, but gave few details of the deep cuts it said would be enacted this year to pay for it.
The 2.34 trillion rouble spending plans includes 1.55 billion roubles to support banks, most of which was already announced last year and which many analysts say is still a fraction of what Moscow will have to spend to keep its lenders afloat.
The plan focuses mainly on bailing out banks and big companies to help them weather the immediate impact of the crisis, at the expense of long-term development programmes. Extra money would also be spent to increase pensions in line with higher-than-expected inflation.
“This plan is something like a cushion to avoid a rapid deterioration in Russia and support several of the most important economic agents (and provide) social support,” said Sberbank chief economist Yulia Tseplaeva.
President Vladimir Putin has ordered that defence and social spending cannot be cut, underscoring their focus on preserving Russia's international might and social stability.
Despite these constraints, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said on Tuesday that the anti-crisis plan would not add to total budget expenditures, because of budget reserves and cutbacks elsewhere.
The plan said the government would cut “the majority” of its planned expenditures by 10 percent in 2015, except for defence, social spending and debt repayments, with a view to balancing the budget by 2017. But it gave few details on those cuts, beyond saying that some long-term investment projects would be delayed.
Ivan Tchakarov, Russia economist at Citibank, said that the plan was necessarily vague, as Moscow has yet to revise its budget and macroeconomic forecasts for this year.
“It's a typical government-led programme. It focuses on subsidies,” they said. “I haven't seen any particular measure that strikes me as a structural reform, it's just talk.”
Some major items in the plan are being financed from the National Wealth Fund, an $80 billion sovereign fund that had previously been assigned to fund infrastructure projects.
PRIORITY MEASURES
Among the priority measures, the largest single item is a 1 trillion rouble programmes to recapitalise banks through the issue of government bonds, which has already been funded from last year's federal budget.
Banks will get a further 550 billion roubles from the National Wealth Fund. This includes 300 billion roubles for Vnesheconombank, the state development bank, to increase “lending to organisations of the real sector”.
Many analysts think this is still a fraction of what Russia will have to spend to keep its banking sector afloat as businesses lose the ability to service their loans and banks are hit by much higher financing costs.
Citibank's Tchakarov said that the support measures were narrower than similar ones enacted in a previous crisis in 2008-2009, reflecting more limited resources this time.
“Now they're much more selective, with support for key strategic enterprises, which is why I think this time we are going to see some corporate and bank defaults,” they said. “You cannot support everyone in the current environment.”
The plan “isn't something to get too excited about”, they added. “But at least they still have some money to spend, some buffers to use.”
Among the uncosted items, the plan said the government would collect proposals by Jan. 30 for creating a “bad bank” to ring fence problematic banking assets.
The plan includes 200 billion roubles in state guarantees of loans of bonds needed “for carrying out investment projects,” as well as other goals approved by the government such as debt restructuring.
The federal government will lend 160 billion roubles to help regional governments, and 188 billion roubles were allocated to raise pensions in line with inflation. Smaller or uncosted items in the plan included subsidies and tax breaks to industrial enterprises, small businesses and agriculture.

I recently started following porn star James Deen on Twitter, reading articles about them and watching videos of him… being interviewed on ABC (Hi Mom!). Oh, and watching them smack ladies around a little bit, but that goes without saying.
The Nightline segment makes Deen sound like the black mold lurking in your bathroom poisoning your family, an invisible threat, killing your children.
In fact I think James Deen is one of the most positive sexual influences your teenage daughter can have.
“I've been into rough sex pretty much my whole sexual life and so I'm not, like, bad at it,” Mr. Deen told me by phone last month, on their 26th birthday.“I don't know how to say it without being a hideous prick, but I'm pretty good at having rough sex. It got to the point where a lot of girls who aren't into that type of sex were afraid to work with me because they thought I was going to slap them in the face or something. But I only do that if the girl is into it. There's no reason to choke somebody if they don't like getting choked. Then you're basically being an asshole.” [x]
I'd rather my daughter sneak around tumblr looking for gif's of James Deen and explore their sexuality and desires with them than profess their love for Chris Brown.
Reason 1: If you develop an obsession with James Deen you start to google around for actual information about them as a person and then when you read interviews with them you realize that he's actually a sex-positive feminist.
Reason 2: James Deen is a Jew and instilling a love for James Deen in my daughter means that she'll look for other Jewish looking fellas – Ta Da Jewish grandbabies!
Reason 3: When James Deen is ‘working' they are the physical embodiment of consent culture.  They are the most attentive partner a teenage girl is likely to see in this world. In most of their videos this is visible in their continuing to do whatever fabulous thing he's doing at their lady's enthusiastic-consent-eyes/breathing/nod/whatever, but you always get the feeling that if they winced for just a moment they would stop the action no matter what the director said.
Reason 4: Kink. James Deen likes (and is damn good at) rough sex. What better way to explore what turns your crank than by watching Mr. Consent show someone a really great time.
Yes, I'd rather my daughter idolize Porn Star James Deen than Christian Bale, Nicolas Cage, Mel Gibson, or Bill Cosby.
Please, Nightline, join my team.
As far as the objection that legal minor/preteen/single digit is ‘too young' to be viewing porn I'll leave you with what my mother used to tell me when I was a kid: “If young people want to have sex, they're going to have sex and there's nothing you can do about it.” The same goes for watching porn.
Edit: This post was written in March of 2012 (before the 2015 rape allegations). Updated thoughts and feelings are available here.
Toll lanes could be used to expand Stevenson Expressway
Gov. Bruce Rauner wants to add toll lanes to a congested 25-mile stretch of Interstate 55, and he's considering a rideshare-like model that would boost tolls depending on the amount of traffic.
The plan, which calls for a public-private partnership that would require legislative approval, would add at least one lane in each direction along the Stevenson between the Dan Ryan Expressway and Interstate 355, Rauner said. About 170,000 cars use this stretch of highway daily.
The current lanes would be used free of charge, but Rauner said their office wants “dynamic pricing” for the new proposed express lanes.
“If they're in a hurry and they want to get around the congestion, [drivers] can pay a toll — and we'll try to keep the toll as modest as we can — so they can get where they need to go very quickly,” Rauner said.
Signs along the Stevenson would inform drivers about the level of congestion and the toll level to bypass it, Rauner said.
The exact plan for the tolls and whether the lanes might include carpooling is still being finalized, Rauner said. The plan is for construction to begin in late 2017.
“It's a critical economic corridor” that is “heavily congested,” Rauner said. “We need to begin to relieve the congestion on I-55 in order to continue our economic growth here in Illinois.”
To observe the acquiescent wing of the Labour party expressing more dismay at the election of a genuine leftwinger as leader than about Tory proposals to scrap the Human Rights Act (HRA) tells you why they are in retreat right across the party. As one SNP insider said to me last week: “All the mild left luvvies are descending on our conference in Aberdeen because they are scared of getting kicked around their own house this autumn.”
In the run-up to the independence referendum and to May's general election, Conservative unionists and their allies within Labour attempted to blacken the SNP's liberal credentials by association. Their trick was to explain the astonishing surge in support for the SNP by linking it with the rise of “extremism” across the globe, including Donald Trump's tilt at the White House and the rise of the right in Belgium. It's a geo-political St Elmo's fire which has everything to do with the politics of the mob and nothing to do with ethics or policies.
In this they seek to convince themselves that the surge in Scottish nationalism is a shortlived event that owes its occurrence to a peculiar set of historical circumstances and popular currents across the globe coming together haphazardly at the same time. God forbid that they would ever credit the supporters of Scottish nationalism with anything approaching political sophistication. They were also eager to insist that no true leftwinger could ever be a nationalist, as this would be to elevate the concerns of one group of people above all others. Thus they introduced the sulphuric whiff of racial supremacy into the mix.
At times, this could be a compelling and seductive narrative. There were many on the left, myself included, who thought long and hard about backing a Yes vote in the independence referendum. How do you weigh your growing attachment to the idea of self-determination with a lifetime commitment to a global struggle of collectivism against capitalism? This view was often and eloquently expressed during the referendum by Douglas Alexander.
In Scotland we are currently engaged in debate as to just how radical the SNP actually is
What persuaded many of us to back the Yes side last year, however, was a dawning conviction that an independent Scotland might become a hothouse of creatively radical ideas to counter the prevailing orthodoxy of greed, entitlement and stranger suspicion that underpinned the world's economic power structures. The arrogance and sneering unpleasantness of Alistair Darling just made it a little bit easier.
In Scotland we are currently engaged in debate as to just how radical the SNP actually is. And recent social attitude surveys have shown that, on questions of immigration and refugees, your average Scot is not the enlightened savant of popular liberal imagination. On education, policing and flight attendantship of the NHS, there are gaping holes in the SNP's ability to manage these areas. On reflection, though, I'd say that those of us who voted Yes are still happy at having done so and will be eager to do so again when the opportunity arises.
Speeches such as the one Nicola Sturgeon made last week in Glasgow on the HRA simply served to remind us why so many are still happy to support an independent Scotland. Similarly, they viewed their response earlier this month to the Syrian and African refugee crisis as echoing sentiments held deep within the breast of the nation.
On human rights, the first minister gave their most unequivocal commitment to using all means possible to oppose the Tory plans to scrap the act and replace it with a UK Bill of Rights. The final arbiters in any disputes over our rights as citizens would thus pass into the hands of a collection of judges drawn from the tiny social and cultural elite who are so keen to scrap the HRA.
The act prescribes a code of basic decency that obliges governments to protect ordinary citizens, as well as the weak and the vulnerable, from greed, self-interest and power. Underpinning it is a basic assumption that governments of the right and the left are, however, always susceptible to greed, self-interest and power and so must be saved from themselves.
It's worth being reminded what the HRA holds to be sacrosanct: the right to employment and to a proper wage; the right to share in the economic bounty of the country; the right to protest against unsavoury corporate or government behaviour; to withdraw one's labour without fear of reprisal; to practise one's religion and to be respected and treated equally no matter your sexual orientation, skin colour or social background are the mere basics for peaceful co-existence among humans.
It is no surprise then that the act is hated by those groups and interests who have most to gain by its scrapping, among them the present UK Conservative and Unionist party and their business backers. Many of them have been waiting for the day to dawn on a majority Conservative government so that they could resume the class war begun by Margaret Thatcher and interrupted when the act passed into UK law.
They salivate at the prospect of growing their businesses free from the need properly to care for those who make their profits. And they live for the day when they can jettison those whom they deem to be obstacles to their goals of accumulating wealth or exercising influence. They are resentful and bitter at ever having been forced to spend lots of their money looking after sick and fragile people. Society was set up for the strongest and the fittest to prevail; there are no second prizes; you only get one chance. These are their mottos.
Scotland had a chance last year to decouple itself from this deceit and the country blew it. Happily, it looks like we will soon enough be granted a second chance. More important than independence alone, though, is the knowledge that you are living in a country that takes seriously its duties to the weakest and smallest of its citizens.
It just makes you feel so proud to be an American, doesn't it?
Detailed evidence has emerged of Israel's extensive use of US-made weaponry during its war in Gaza last month, including white phosphorus artillery shells, 500lb bombs and Hellfire missiles.
In a report released today, Amnesty International listed the weapons used and called for an immediate arms embargo on Israel and all Palestinian armed groups. It called on the US president, Barack Obama, to suspend military aid to Israel.
The human rights group said those arming both sides in the conflict "will have been well aware of a pattern of repeated misuse of weapons by both parties and must therefore take responsibility for the violations perpetrated".
The US has long been the largest arms supplier to Israel; under a 10-year agreement negotiated by the Bush administration the US will provide $30bn (£21bn) in military aid to Israel.

“The perfect borscht is what life should be but never is,” writes Alexandar Hemon in The New Yorker food issue this past November. Until recently, I simply figured I'd never tasted “the perfect borscht.” My first impression of the Eastern European delicacy was the purple liquid my father would buy once a year on Passover. On the second or third day, after having their share of matzoh, they would take out the glass Manischewitz bottle of purple borscht and mix it with just a bit too much sour cream. While they always offered us a taste, my siblings and I would politely decline.
Yet, when my mother and I found ourselves in Moscow and Kiev last month, I decided to give it a second chance, this time fresh from a simmering soup pot instead of the jar. Borscht in Yiddish or bohrshch in Russian (there are many spellings – it's the food equivalent of the word Hanukkah), loosely translates to a soup with a beet base. In Moment magazine, cookbook author Joan Nathan explains that in the 18th century, before potatoes were the food of the masses in Russia and Ukraine, red beets made up much of the local diet.
Served hot in the winter and cold in the summer, traditional borscht used fresh beet juice as its foundation and could be found on dinner tables throughout the two countries. Jews began to adapt recipes to make the soup kosher, substituting beef for pork and sometimes making it vegetarian so that sour cream could be added.
A few years ago, the British journalist James Meek set out to discover what happened to borscht after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Their travels led them to amusing tales that chronicle the origin and development of this Eastern European staple. They suggest, among other things, that borscht is Ukrainian and not Russian and while Jews adapted borscht to confine to dietary concerns, other adaptations outside of the Jewish community abound as well.
In 2004 a popular Russian chat room – “LoveTalk” – launched a thread with the heading “What is borscht? Does it have to contain beetroot?” According to Meek, the discussion exploded and lasted more than a month, with divisive opinions on both sides. In addition to saying the beetroot was unnecessary for borscht, users listed other unconventional ingredients like pickled apples and paprika.
This removal of beet from borscht perhaps explains why white borscht – which, as demonstrated by its white color doesn't contain any beets – can still be called borscht, a seeming misnomer. This Polish adaptation often uses a base of fermented rye instead of beet stock and in Poland it is known as zur (rye meal soup) or bialy barszcz (white borscht). It is traditionally served on Easter with a cubed rye bread and hard-boiled eggs added to the broth. There is of course still a beet-based version in Poland simply called barszcz.
While I can't vouch for the Polish rendition, the hot borschts I tasted in Moscow and Kiev were perfect for a winter evening. While in most restaurants it is prepared with a meat stock – my favorite borscht came from a small dairy restaurant called Café Yael based in the Marina Roscha JCC of Moscow. It used mushrooms for its base and was completely vegetarian. Feel free to add a dab of sour cream to complete the dish and to discover what life should be, but never is – rich and colorful, but also subtle and sweet.
Borscht with Cabbage and Mushrooms
3 large red beets, greens removed
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 large Vidalia onion, thinly sliced
3 carrots, peeled and sliced
½ head savoy cabbage (around 3-4 cups), shredded
2 cups small white mushrooms, peeled and quartered
8 cups vegetable broth
salt (to taste)
1/3 cup mirin (or to taste)
juice from one lemon
fresh dill, chopped to garnish
1) Wash beets well and place them in a large pot covered with water. Bring the water to a boil and simmer the beets, uncovered, for 50 minutes.
2) Drain and cover the beats with lukewarm water to cool. When cool enough to handle, use your fingers to slip off the skin – make sure all the skin comes off. Dice the beets and set aside.
3) Place a large pot over medium heat and sprinkle with the 3 tablespoons oil. Add the onions stirring occasionally.
4) After 5 minutes add the carrots. After 10 minutes add the cabbage. After 5 minutes stir in the beets and mushroom.
5) Add the broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and let simmer, uncovered, for about 30 minutes.
6) Season with salt, mirin, and lemon juice and stir.
Borscht tastes best after sitting for at least 5 hours or over night. When ready to serve, heat up and garnish with fresh dill.
This story "The Perfect Borscht" was written by Miriam Krule.
Pundits have asked themselves why it is so difficult for the Democrats to get things done even with 60 votes in the Senate, whereas the Republicans seem to do just fine with 50 votes in the Senate. I suspect that there are a number of reasons for this. But one reason that deserves mentioning is that Democrats believe in the importance of the federal government, and Republicans believe in the importance of thwarting Democrats.
Consider the following table, which illustrates the values to Democrats and Republicans when the Democrats are in majorities in Congress.
When Democrats control congress keep government going gridlock Republicans 1 9 Democrats 9 1
The numbers are made up. But the key element is that Republicans would rather see nothing done at all than seriously compromise with the Democrats to pass legislation.
On the other hand, consider the reverse situation in which Republicans are in charge.
When Republicans control Congress keep government going gridlock Republicans 7 3 Democrats 7 3
Here the Democrats really don't want government to shut down, and they are willing to go far more than half way to meet the Republicans. In this case, even the Republicans are willing to compromise a little. For example, the Republicans were willing to greatly increase the National debt under Bush rather than having permanent gridlock so long as the wealthiest Americans could get a tax cut and Bush was able to start two wars; however, on other important issues such as having two ultra-conservative judges appointed to the Supreme Court, they stood by their principles and were even willing to get rid of filibusters.
I'm not sure what the moral of this story is, except perhaps that is sucks to be a Democrat.

Rasmussen poll: 40% think Fox News should win Trump's 'fake news trophy'
CLOSE President Trump wants to have a contest for Fake News Trophy, to see who is the most dishonest news source, Fox isn't in the running. Buzz60
President Trump this week proposed the creation of a "fake news trophy."
But he's likely to be disappointed that many voters picked Fox News as the organization that most deserved it.
A new poll from conservative-leaning Rasmussen found that 40% of all voters thought Fox deserved the non-award.
Here's the breakdown for the other outlets that voters picked:
25% said CNN deserved the fake news trophy
9% said MSNBC
4% said ABC
3% said CBS
2% said NBC
Another 6% picked a different outlet and 11% were undecided.
Break it down by political party, and Democrats (53%) and voters that weren't affiliated with a party (42%) picked Fox as the network that deserved the "trophy." Republicans were more likely to pick CNN (40%) over Fox (24%).
When they proposed the "fake news trophy," Trump said it should go to the network that has the "most dishonesty, corrupt and/or distorted" coverage of him.

They specified that the contest shouldn't include Fox.
We should have a contest as to which of the Networks, plus CNN and not including Fox, is the most dishonest, corrupt and/or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite President (me). They are all bad. Winner to receive the FAKE NEWS TROPHY! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2017
The survey found that a majority of voters (51%) believe that media coverage of political issues and events is worse than it has been in the past. Another 27% said it is about the same as it has been, while 19% said it was better.
Rasmussen surveyed 1,000 likely voters on Tuesday and Wednesday, with an error margin of 3 points.

Hillary Clinton and their husband Bill deducted $1,042,000 in charitable contributions last year — $1 million of which went to their own family non-profit, the Clinton Family Foundation.
Clinton released their tax forms on Friday in a move that is seen as a way to pressure Donald Trump to release their taxes. The GOP nominee has refused to release the records, saying that they are under a routine audit.
The documents show that the power couple earned $10,745,378 last year, mostly on income earned from giving public speeches.
(Correction: This article initially identified the Clinton non-profit that received the bulk of the Clintons' charitable donations as the Clinton Foundation. The $1 million contribution actually went to the Clinton Family Foundation. The Clintons control the entity, but it is separate from the Clinton Foundation.)
Of that, they gave just over a million to charity. But the contributions can hardly be seen as altruistic, since the money flowed back to an entity they control.
The other $42,000 contribution was to Desert Classic Charities. That group hosts an annual PGA golf event. Doug Band, a Clinton Foundation adviser and Bill Clinton's longtime assistant, was on the board of directors of that organization through 2014, according to its IRS filings.
Desert Classic Charities effectively returned that donation back into the Clinton orbit. Its 2015 tax filing shows that it contributed $700,000 to the Clinton Foundation for work on obesity programs. The group handed out $1.6 million in grants that whole year.
The Clintons' effective federal tax rate was 34.2 percent, the Clinton campaign said in a press release. With state and local taxes amounting to nine percent of their income, they paid just over 43 percent of their income in taxes.
It remains to be seen if Clinton will face the same scrutiny for their in-house contributions as former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney did when they ran on the GOP ticket in 2012.
Romney paid $1.9 million in taxes and gave $4 million in charity on income of $14 million. But many liberal commentators criticized the Republican because a majority of those charitable contributions went to the Mormon church. Another chunk went to a foundation controlled by their family.
The Nation, a far-left magazine, published an article entitled “Romney's Ungenerous Donations.”
Mother Jones, another liberal publication, published several articles skewering Romney for giving to their own church.
“Romney Tax Tips: 10 Ways to Stiff the IRS,” is one such article. “Vetting Romney's $3 Million in Charity” is another.
The Clintons' million dollar donation went to their Clinton Family Foundation. That is a separate entity than the more well-known Clinton Foundation. Nevertheless, the Clintons still control the money that flows into and out of the charity.
In 2014, the Clintons gave $3 million to the charity, according to documents filed with the IRS. Of that sum, $1.87 million was passed to the Clinton Foundation. The rest was distributed to a variety of other charities. The next largest donation from the Clinton Family Foundation that year was a $250,000 contribution to the Diplomacy Center Foundation. Hillary Clinton is on the board of directors of that group along with several other former top U.S. diplomats.
The Clinton Foundation has been at the center of several controversies that have hobbled Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign by eroding trust in the former secretary of state. Numerous wealthy donors to the non-profit received favors from the Clinton State Department. The foundation has also been criticized for accepting millions of dollars in donations from countries with records of human rights abuses. Saudi Arabia has given the organization between $10 million and $25 million.
It was also revealed earlier this week that a Clinton Foundation adviser named Doug Band contacted several Clinton State Department aides in 2009 asking for a favor for a million-dollar Clinton Foundation donor named Gilbert Chagoury. Chagoury, a Nigerian-Lebanese billionaire, was at one time an associate of Nigerian dictator Sani Abache. They formed a relationship with Bill Clinton in the 1990s.
Another foreign donor's activities piqued the interest of the FBI last year, according to a recent report from CNN. A bank informed the bureau of a Clinton Foundation donor's “suspicious activity.” The FBI and three Justice Department field offices thought that the lead warranted an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. But the DOJ's public integrity unit declined to open up a formal probe.
The Clinton Foundation may still be under federal investigation, however. The Daily Caller News Foundation reported on Thursday that Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney for the southern district of New York, is conducting a joint investigation with the FBI out of their office.

This is Whistler, BC: an adrenaline junkie's Disneyland where the only thing that stands between you and your sporting dreams are the size of your balls which, if you have them and you live here, you should probably get checked out. While Whistler is commonly known as the STI capital of Canada, it's also a global mecca for snow sports, mountain biking, and—as we saw on Monday—getting incredibly fucked up on booze and drugs.
Whistler attracts a certain crowd, a significant proportion of which are Australian. It's a combination of the lax visa regulations, the availability of face-melting narcotics, and most importantly the incredible terrain that draws so many Aussies to the place. Given that, I thought it would be a good idea to party with them on Australia Day—the anniversary of the arrival of British ships to the country's shores in 1788. As an Englishman, it was my patriotic duty to participate in the madness, especially considering that so many other countries celebrate the day the British left them to their own devices, not when we showed up.
In practical terms, the only difference I can tell between Australia Day and St. Paddy's Day is the colour of the flags. The Aussies and the Irish are world leaders in getting blackout drunk on their respective national holidays (although it's a stiff competition). I'm scared to imagine what happens in Russia. It may be wrong to stereotype, but on the 26th of January, the Australians definitely play into their reputation as hard-drinking shit-disturbers.
Due to time zone differences, the celebrations this side of the world spanned two drunken and rowdy days. To be honest, my first night was mostly a blur of booze spent in a cloud of extremely potent BC bud. The one thing I remember is that the mandatory soundtrack for Australia Day comes courtesy of Australian radio station Triple J, which has culled a "Hottest 100" collection of the "best" Australian music. Someone named Chet Faker topped the countdown, but artists from niche genres also featured heavily. Hilltop Hoods flew the flag for Aussie hip-hop. The Amity Affliction, a personal favourite, was representing the metal community admirably, even though a few other under-cover metal heads really appreciated it with me. We bonded by opening a mosh pit around the kitchen island.
By Monday morning, Whistler had a scattered atmosphere, and everyone we met was either hungover or still drunk, and not really functioning. We showed up to Longhorns, the go-to bar at the foot of the slopes, at 10:30 AM only to find the fire alarm clanging and the pissed-up Aussies who had been inside evacuated; no one was owning up to having smashed the safety glass, but it was pretty obvious someone had fucked up. These girls had decided that riding was not on the agenda for them, and were busy drinking off their hangovers in the spirit of national pride. In case you're wondering what's up with the shirts the girls are wearing, it's a reference to vegemite, Australia's contribution to international cuisine. It's a spread that looks like industrial lube and tastes like a salty paste made of truckstop pepperoni sticks.
We headed up Blackcomb Mountain, ascending through an expansive sun-drenched mountainscape as we cracked our first beer of the day, which was pretty sweet. Toward the top of the mountain we came across a group of party-dedicated Australians who really weren't fucking about when it came to their plans. Despite the fact they were 6,000 feet above sea level, they were dressed for Byron Bay, and started playing cricket in front of some bemused punters.
Cricket is the sport of choice down under, and the fact that it lasts for days on end means that spectators have an excuse to go on benders as long as the working week. You've got to hand it to the Aussies: Britain shipped all of its criminals there hundreds of years ago and then they developed a society with a lower crime rate than us. You might think there would be inherited bad blood from us deporting people, but considering Australia sounds like its own sunny paradise, I think they were probably happy to leave grey industrial Britain. We'll always get on, partly because our drinking cultures are so similar. North Americans have an obsession with drinking games, but for both the Aussies and the Brits, drinking (and maybe some brawling) is the game, and we love it.
Eventually we met up with all the Australians on the mountain for a liquid lunch on a place called Heckler's Hill. The Aussies were kitted out in kangaroo costumes and wizard beards, draped with Australian flags, and claimed the mountain as theirs. Everyone was hammered and gradually realising that there was nothing anyone could do to move them. There was an anarchic mob mentality developing. Heckler's Hill is so named as it's the perfect platform from which to hurl abuse, beer cans, and snowballs at passing punters, ski-school kids, and this guy:
They win the award for most fucked-up Australian, but only by a thin margin. I'm pretty sure he'd forgotten their own name, and they spent their afternoon trying to ski topless. It wasn't going well for him, which resulted in full-torso ice burns and and a lot of verbal and physical abuse from their drunken countrymen.
Oh: if you hadn't already guessed, Whistler loves cocaine. It's the town's drug of choice after weed, and this was pretty obvious on Heckler's Hill.
Vancouver, only a few hours away by car, is home to one of the largest ports in North America, and recently Mexican Cartels like La Familia have been making their presence known in the city. The drug is brought from South America, through the docks, and makes its way up the Sea to Sky highway, to the nostrils of Whistler's party scene. In Whistler, it seems every day is a powder day.
Patrol showed up as the sun was setting, bringing the warning that the police were on standby in a helicopter in the valley. Fortunately for them, the Aussies had drunk and snorted everything in sight, and so were turning their attention to sourcing more booze and coke in the village. Strapping into skis or a snowboard when you're 10 cans deep and can't feel your own face is a difficult task, but people were making a sterling effort. Actually riding was harder still, though, and people were just wrecking themselves all over the place. If you've ever ridden in the Alps, it was similar to the run down after La Folie Douce (an insane après bar chain), but with more drugs involved.
Once everyone had made it down the slopes, we returned to Longhorns, who've really got the ski-town formula for success down: give the mostly male patrons what they want. Turns out, what they want is cold beer and attractive women. How they get away with this shameless hiring policy I will never know, but funnily enough I've never heard anyone complain.
On our way to another bar, we heard perhaps the greatest Aussie quote of the day. It was aimed at a group of middle aged tourists: "CARTWHEEL WITH US, ANY CUNT CAN CARTWHEEL!" Bless those Aussies, they managed to convince this guy to give it a go. It was nice to see, even if their mates didn't look particularly impressed.
For the majority of the population, Whistler is quite a divided town. Wealthy tourists come and go for brief periods of time, while those who live here permanently inhabit the suburbs and generally only interact with the rich travellers through work. This cartwheel was a lovely moment when the two Whistler worlds met in childlike excitement, and it was all the work of one wasted Aussie girl.
We spent the rest of the night in a hazy blur of beer, guitars, and Australian accents. I had done my utmost to stay fairly sober throughout the day, but by the time the live music started, I'd distinctly failed. I guess if you can't beat them, join them. The first band was a local outfit called Neverland Nights, fronted by a man who looked like a hybrid of Fred Durst and the guitarist from Bowling For Soup. The second, also local, were named Wolf Party, and they turned the atmosphere up several notches with their tight ska sound.
No matter where I am in the world, there's always a little voice in the back of my head saying, "You're having fun, but you could be in Whistler." I know I'm not the only one who knows this feeling, which is why so many Australians choose to spend the days of their youths here. I caught up with Whistler-born and -raised skier Simon D'artois, who just won Gold in SuperPipe at the X Games, to hear their view on their home town:
"It's an amazing place to live, and a beautiful place to grow up. You don't have to deal with a lot of the stuff day-to-day stuff that even living in Vancouver brings. We just try to live simply, enjoy the mountain, and we're all here because of what Whistler has to offer, whether you are a winter person or a summer person. Most of all we just enjoy each other's company."
It seems pretty apt, and it also applies to Australia Day. Everyone partied like they didn't have a care in the world, and that's because on the whole, people here don't. Whistler is much like a snow globe: the people inside exist in their own little bubble, isolated from the surrounding noise. It's a paradise that draws people into the mountains, and proves that life doesn't have to be an endless parade of traffic jams and mind-numbing cubicle jobs. Life is beautiful for many people here, in its inherent simplicity and its awe-inspiring surroundings. The town's Australians weren't celebrating only their own country on Monday; they were celebrating the fact that they live in Whistler, too.
General
To understand the workings of a player piano, it is necessary to first understand the key component parts and how they are arranged within the instrument. A basic appreciation of the standard upright piano action is also desirable. To see cross-sectional views of a typical player, click on the thumbnail images below. The Roll Playing System
The player mechanism, typically referred to as the 'pneumatic stack', is located in the upper portion of the instrument and connected to the piano action by series of push-rods. For each note of the piano, there is a small pneumatic, a valve assembly, a soft flexible leather pouch and a bleed. The tracker bar has a row of equally spaced holes, each of which is connected to a channel, via a small pipe. The chamber is kept under vacuum by the foot operated bellows. The pneumatic is connected to the piano action by a simple linkage. The diagram below shows the whole assembly, firstly in resting and then playing positions.
When a roll perforation passes over a tracker bar hole, air is admitted, causing the pouch to move upwards under suction inside the chamber. The valve rises accordingly, uncovering the top of the chamber and resting against its upper seat. This in turn connects the pneumatic to the vacuum supply, forcing it to collapse under atmospheric pressure and to operate the piano action.
The bleed, which connects the channel to the chamber, allows the pouch to assume its correct resting position after a note has finished playing, by equalising the pressure above and below. The diameter of the bleed is necessarily much smaller than that of the corresponding tracker bar hole.
The take-up spool, which is driven by an air powered motor, transports the music roll over the tracker bar at a speed that may be varied by means of a control lever. The tempo of the music is unaffected by variations in the force at which the pedals are operated, due to the presence of a governing device.
Large diameter rubber hoses provide a connection between the main bellows and pneumatic stack, in addition to other auxiliary devices. Rubber tubing of small diameter is also used throughout, particularly in the case of the tracker bar, each port of which has an individual connection to its corresponding valve assembly.
The Exhauster Bellows
The purpose of the exhauster bellows is to provide suction, which is the motive force for virtually all player systems. Located in the lower section of the piano, it usually consists of a large bellows assembly connected to two foot treadles. The bellows are of wooden construction, covered with heavy duty rubberised cotton cloth. As the exhausters are alternately opened and closed by the action of the feet upon the treadles, air within the system is exhausted into the atmosphere. This naturally has the effect of lowering the pressure within the player mechanism. The purpose of the external leather flap valves is to allow the exhausters to discharge the air extracted during the forward stroke of the treadles. Upon the return stroke, the internal valve prevents any feeback of air to the bellows system. The reservoir provides a necessary measure of equalisation for the vacuum level within the player mechanism. The more sophisticated and fully automatic 'reproducing' pianos, described later, utilise an electrically operated suction pump instead.
Auxiliary Devices
Most players also incorporate a number of auxiliary devices, the most common of which is a system that keeps the music roll in perfect alignment with the tiny holes of the tracker bar. Others include a means of automatically operating the soft and sustain pedals of the piano from perforations within the roll. Another popular feature, known in Aeolian terminology as the 'Themodist', allows selected notes to be accented, a concept known as 'theming' and also provides some control over the dynamics of the music in general.
I love working on Children's projects... for several reasons. The cute factor is overwhelming! I love that for kids, you can use the brightest colors available! You can also be as creative as you want. If you can dream it up, you can do it. And the best part - children's projects are small enough to finish in a reasonable amount of time, so there is lots of instant gratification.
For this little set, I was asked to make mittens and a hat for a 4 year old little boy... who like most little boys, has a thing for alligators. this began the search for the perfect shade of Alligator Green! Normally, I gravitate towards wool products, but for this project I chose a nice soft acrylic (mainly for the indestructibility factor) and Vanna's Choice had a lovely mossy bright green.
I set to work to find a hat that would be stylish, keep ears warm, but also be functional for everyday winter wear. I had been admiring Thorpe (available as a free pattern... follow the linky) for a long time, and had eventually intended to make one from handspun yarn for myself... This seemed the perfect opportunity. I made a few modifications (2 extra increase rows at the crown) to account for the fact that I was using a basic worsted weight yarn instead of a bulky one, and added a few stitches to the earflaps to account for the extra stitches... but other than that, I worked the pattern mostly as written and was very satisfied with the results.
I always find it challenging to make hats for children because of the variety in head size... Maybe now that I'm going to have a child sized noggin at home I will be a bit more fearless? I consulted a bunch of different patterns to try and make sure that this would fit properly. I think I did ok in the end, because the Mom was pleased with the fit.
And of course... the star attraction - Alligator Mittens! When we were little I remember my Grandma making dinosaur/lizard mittens with tiny yarn, and them being quite complicated to make and not as functional as regular mittens. For this reason, I chose to make just a basic regular mitten, and then embellish with eyes and teeth. I hope that the little guy can play and use them as their everyday mittens this winter, so I wanted them to be comfortable, and perfectly adapted for making snowballs and general seasonal antics. Also, because they are acrylic... they are fully washable :)
I added crocheted eyes with black French knot pupils, and duplicate stitched teeth along the underside of the mitten. It was hard to photograph the tooth effect without having the proper sized hands to fit inside the mittens... but you get the idea. I hope there will be lots of "RAWR" moments and "love bites" with these mittens.
In January, Johann Johnson of Richland County, South Carolina, found out that their son had been shot dead. They didn't hear the news through a phone call or after a knock at the door. But rather they watched live on national TV, learning of their son's death at the same time over a million other Americans who tuned into A&E's hit reality crime show Live PD did. It was perhaps one of the worst days of Johnson's life. And it was being shown on TV as entertainment.
Live PD, a twice-weekly show, has been on the air since October 2016. Since then, Variety reports, its viewership has risen 92 percent to draw an average of 1.4 million viewers per episode. That runaway success has prompted the network to order 100 more 3-hour episodes scheduled to run through 2018.
I hope you never see the program, but it's still important to know what happens on what A&E calls the “top unscripted crime series on cable.” Hosted by ABC News anchor Dan Abrams, Live PD follows select law enforcement departments from across the country — including Greenville and Richland counties, South Carolina; Calvert County, Maryland; Jeffersonville, Indiana; and Spokane County, Washington — as officers go about their jobs, responding to emergency calls, serving warrants, arresting suspects, and occasionally partaking in high-speed car chases, amongst other routine cop duties.
The show is an obvious descendant of mega-hit series Cops on Spike, but with a twist. Everything that happens, happens live and unedited. On a typical episode, Abrams directs viewers between feeds from different parts of the country, cutting between them as they become more or less interesting. Sometimes they present pre-taped segments, other times they look to a panel of experts for analysis. All the while, the show encourages viewers to participate themselves via commenting on social media accounts.
Live PD runs on a delay (its precise length is undisclosed) in case anything horrific, like the more than 500 police shootings that have occurred in the U.S. so far this year, happens while they are filming. The livestream aspect is perhaps the most disturbing one of the wholly disturbing show, but it's a feature used to market the show as an unbiased slice of reality TV media. It's unclear whether or not contracts between A&E and the police departments they follow involve payment and whether people recorded for the show are asked to sign releases or can legally decline to be filmed.
In a pre-taped segment for Live PD, officers enter a home.
Ahead of Live PD's premiere, showrunner David Doss told BuzzFeed that the show is not intended to skew pro- or anti-law enforcement. “We're not here as apologists for law enforcement, we're not here as defenders of law enforcement. We're just documenting what happens,” they said. In April, the show's creator Dan Cesareo told BuzzFeed, “It's a natural extension of dashboard cameras and body cameras, and trying to present a more complete story, to answer the public's call for transparency.” And Live PD's official site bills it as “unfettered and unfiltered live access inside a variety of the country's busiest police forces, both urban and rural, and the communities they patrol on a typical night.”
These claims of balance and transparency, however, are absurd. Dashboard cameras and body cameras themselves do not tell complete stories. Meanwhile, the basic format of the show lends itself to sympathize with the law enforcement officers it follows. We begin each encounter with the police officers, with their explanation of what is going on, as the cameras follow their every move. When officers drive to a scene or run licenses on their in-car computers, they speak directly to the camera and viewers, telling us how they're experiencing and perceiving the situation. And when the action is slow, Abrams pops in to comment on or try to explain what we've just seen, ask opinions of gathered experts, sometimes while they speculate about the possible crime.
“[The show] essentially provides [audiences] a script on how they're meant to receive it, which is as entertainment.” — Kiran Samuel
The communities they police, however, don't get to defend themselves or show Live PD audiences their worlds. The identities of those filmed are never allowed to extend beyond their interactions with police. (Notably, lay people who appear in the live segments of the show do not have their faces blurred and are ignored when they complain that they do not consent to be filmed.) And the traumas they are experiencing are put on full display for the world. Unavoidably, Live PD audiences have seen a lot of mundane imagery and false starts on the show. An officer knocks and prepares to enter a home, but no one answers. Another takes an unacceptable amount of time by television standards to prepare their gun and other supplies for the night of work ahead of them. A drive to a call proves uneventful.
But audiences have also seen images of violence, injury, and even death. A December episode showed an officer responding to an emergency call for a dying child. In a recent episode, a man caught after a car chase pleaded with police, who attempted to arrest them as they held their young child; the child suffered a broken arm. The show has broadcast countless arrests, some of which, as the show's introductory slide reminds us, may never result in a conviction. Additionally, in several of the counties and towns that Live PD covers, the percentage of people living below the poverty line is near or above the national average, reinforcing the impression that poor people are inclined to crime.
Dan Abrams speaks to Sgt. Sean "Sticks" Larkin and journalist Tom Morris Jr. in the Live PD studio.
And though the goal of Live PD seems to be to place police departments and deputies in a favorable light, at least two departments have found the show to do just the opposite. Both Bridgeport and Tulsa police departments have cut ties with the show over concerns that it unfairly represents communities in those cities as hotbeds of crime. “A community should be defined and judged by the best it has to offer, and not by its worst moments,” Bridgeport spokesperson Av Harris told the CT Post of the decision.
Even so, the show isn't lacking viewership. Its supporters may claim that, with the nationwide call for police accountability and transparency, Live PD is providing a public service in showing what “really” goes on when police officers are on the job. But considering the way it is presented, that's hardly what's happening. The ACLU advises that “for privacy reasons, the majority of body-camera video should not be subject to public release” except when “strong public interest in that video that outweighs privacy concerns: where there is a use of force, or a complaint against an officer.”
But presented as a hit TV show, the concerns mount. “As much as they want to think it's an extension of bodycam, this is a perverse bastardization of its intention of building trust for those people who are suffering from the trauma of police injustice every single day, as well as those allies working to really combat injustice and champion reform,” said Kiran Samuel, a digital strategist and PhD student of sociology at Columbia University whose research focuses on race, surveillance, and the politics of technology. “The fact that it's available and turned into entertainment does a weird number on what kind of message we're conveying about how we might treat these media that will inevitably come from these different real life, everyday, traumatic experiences across the nation with police. This essentially provides [audiences] a script on how they're meant to receive it, which is as entertainment.”
A&E and Live PD are duping audiences into thinking reality television can bring transparency to policing.
The social media aspect — which allows at-home viewers to react to the broadcast, even alerting officers to evidence they may have missed — also gives Samuel pause. “What's different about social media in particular is that there 's's an expectation now built for the audience to have a role,” they said “[Live PD] is capitalizing on the insight that there's a desire for an active role in a perverse fashion because what it's essentially saying is we are meant to be trained experts acting on behalf of the state conducting what a large part of the country believes is in dire need of reform. Now we want these armchair analysts to essentially in a lot of ways support and confirm the policing practices that we've built over time.”
Despite all of its ethical problems, A&E has little incentive to take the show off the air. As the network's executive vice president and head of programming Elaine Frontain Bryant told Variety, the show's success has “been a key contributor to the growth of the network at a time when the industry at large continues to experience viewership erosion.” A&E's investment in 100 more episodes, paired with the decades-long success of COPS, is evidence enough that not only will television show creators continue to offer these perverse shows to the audiences they serve, but also millions of people are willing to consume these displays of trauma, encouraged by the idea that what they are seeing is “real.” (A request for comment was not returned by the time of publication.)
A&E and Live PD are duping audiences into thinking reality television can bring transparency to policing. But what they're actually broadcasting is a monetized spectacle of the problems that plague the criminal justice today, namely a broken police system that targets low-income communities and people of color. It's enough to make you wonder how Live PD ever got to air.
News Cryptocurrency Investors Lose Major Tax Break Under New U.S. Tax Code
The new U.S. tax code amends IRC Section 1031 (a)(1) regarding “like kind exchanges,” excluding all cryptocurrencies from a previous legal loophole and making all cryptocurrency trades a taxable event.
On Friday morning, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a new tax bill into law, signalling the first major tax overhaul in the U.S. in over 30 years. And while you may or may not have high praise for the bill, one thing is certain: the new tax code is bad news for cryptocurrency investors. Starting Jan. 1st, 2018, all cryptocurrency trades will be a taxable event, including swapping one cryptocurrency for another.
Closing the 1031 Loophole
The recent overhaul amends a part of the tax code regarding exemptions for “like kind exchanges,” allowing investors to swap similar assets without triggering a tax event. These so-called “1031 exchanges” have long been used by traders to exchange property, such as art or real estate, without having to pay taxes on it.
Since March 2014, the IRS has treated Bitcoin and other digital currencies as property for tax purposes. This makes them subject to capital gains tax, requiring taxes be paid whenever crypto is exchanged for fiat currency (ie. cash).
Coins held for less than a year are subject to regular income tax, which can range anywhere from 10 to 37 percent, depending upon personal income levels. Coins held for longer than one year are subject to long-term capital gains tax, which caps at around 24 percent.
However, it has never been clear whether a trade between two different cryptocurrencies qualifies as a “like kind exchange.” Up until this point, cryptocurrency trades have typically resided in this legal gray area, granting most traders a loophole for deferring taxes on short-term capital gains.
However, the new amendment definitively narrows the 1031 exemption to only cover real estate swaps, excluding Bitcoin entirely. It specifically limits the scope of the law from previously covering “property” to now only covering “real property.” And as a digital asset, cryptocurrency is about as far from “real property” as one can get.
The end result is that, starting next year, effectively all cryptocurrency trades will be taxed at the time of their execution, bringing an end to one of the most lucrative tax loopholes previously available to traders.
Death, Taxes, and Cryptocurrency
This change marks a significant blow for U.S. cryptocurrency investors. Although trades between fiat currency and crypto have previously been taxed, the vast majority of trading which occurs between separate cryptocurrencies has flown under the radar.
Although traders are expected to pay taxes once they “cash out” or trade their coins for goods and services, swapping between cryptocurrencies has allowed investors to defer their tax obligation for short-term capital gains. Now investors will no longer be able to avoid income tax on these trades without holding onto a specific cryptocurrency for over a year.
What remains to be seen is whether users will actually heed the law, as many U.S. investors already have an notoriously bad habit of avoiding taxes on their Bitcoin profits. From 2013 to 2015, the IRS discovered that fewer than 1,000 people in the U.S. had paid taxes on their bitcoins each year, prompting a controversial lawsuit against Coinbase, demanding they hand over all user transactions from those years.
Tensions with the IRS will likely only get worse next year should Bitcoin investors continue to shirk their tax obligations. Gains of nearly $14,000 in Bitcoin this year alone will likely spell billions of dollars of missed tax revenue for the IRS should Americans choose to cheat the taxman again next spring.
Do you think that the new amendment is fair towards Bitcoin users? What is your stance on taxing cryptocurrencies? Let us know in the comments below.

When building a new application nowadays, you don't have to constrain yourself to only one of two major systems on the market – iOS or Android. At this point, many companies have figured out that maybe they could develop a tool that would allow us to write only one codebase for both systems.
While more sophisticated programs still require creating separate projects for each system, many of the projects we work on are pretty standard affairs. They download data from the server and display it to the user in a neat UI. Sometimes they have to upload a file or two to the backend.
We ended up with a plethora of cross-platform mobile SDKs, which let us create projects that would run on both systems with varying degrees of ease and producing different performances. The most notable examples of such frameworks include React Native by Facebook (which we currently use for cross-platform development at 10clouds), Xamarin by Microsoft, and – recently introduced – Google's own Flutter.
Why you should use Flutter as a mobile developer
When I surveyed the world of cross-platform mobile solutions, I found that the most prominent and recommended framework is React Native, followed by Xamarin. But both of them have major flaws for me as an Android developer. They both require changing your IDE, and Android Studio/IntelliJ is much beloved in the dev community, for good reasons.
React Native, using JavaScript, has no official IDE, and according to my findings, it looks like it's geared more towards front-end web developers who want to start developing mobile apps. The toolchain is quite customizable, but you need to assemble it – pretty much – yourself.
Xamarin, on the other hand, is powered by C#, which is much closer to Java. I had earlier run-ins with that language and found it pretty pleasant to use. The development is restricted to Visual Studio IDE, though, and the last time I used it, I found it pretty basic without the ReSharper plugin – which is a paid add-on created by the company behind IntelliJ. Besides, it seems that Xamarin still needs creating platform-specific views for the applications to look good on both systems. This means that only 60% to 90% of the codebase can be shared.
Turned off by both of the biggest cross-platform solutions, I remembered Flutter SDK being advertised during Google Developer Days in September this year as the new SDK for building multi-platform, native mobile apps, and decided to give it a try.
What is Flutter again?
Flutter is a cross-platform mobile SDK currently being developed by Google – which, hopefully, will prevent from sudden axing. It uses Google's own language, called Dart. It is quite similar to JavaScript, but it has optional, built-in type safety support (the type safety is required for Flutter, but can be disabled for writing other projects). This feature takes it a little bit closer to Java, and makes it a little easier to wrangle for someone who never worked with dynamically typed language before.
Flutter's makers boast of their own rendering engine, which is supposedly more efficient and flexible than what the competition has to offer. And most importantly – Google has provided the developers with an Android Studio plugin and support, so I can write in Flutter with my favourite IDE. Yay!
SDK tools for writing Flutter applications
Flutter SDK installation is easy enough. First of all, you have to clone the Flutter GitHub repo to your computer, and from there you can run the Flutter doctor command, which will check required dependencies and guide you through the steps necessary to install them if they're missing.
Everything worked out-of-the-box on my MacBook, but I couldn't, for the life of me, install the SDK properly on my home PC with Windows. That shouldn't be too much of a problem, since you wouldn't be able to compile an iOS version of the app in that environment anyway, but I must admit it tainted my first impression of this tool. Both Dart and Flutter plugins for Android Studio are available in the plugins repository, and I was able to install them easily through the built-in plugin manager.
Flutter pros and cons
Using Flutter does have many advantages, but there are also drawbacks. The biggest flaw of this tool is its maturity – or lack thereof. It is still in the alpha state, and so far, no date has been announced for the release of the 1.0 version. The APIs are subject to change, and some major features (e.g., push notifications, local databases, or JSON object serialization/deserialization) are still missing. Nevertheless, the new versions of the SDK are released quite frequently.
Flutter is also wildly different from the Android SDK, so the transition from mobile development is far from instantaneous – at least it wasn't instantaneous for me. During a two-week period, I managed to gain some insight into how Flutter applications are structured and how Dart works, but if I wanted to start building “real” applications, I would have to devote much more time to get comfortable with the app architecture and language concepts.
The UI in Flutter applications is built in code. This allows us to build the UI for both systems at the same time and use the widgets Flutter SDK provides us with, but it also has its downsides. As for now, we cannot preview the interface without running the application, same as it is with Android XML layouts. Besides, if we want to use separate UIs for iOS and Android, we'll have to use native code for creating those on each platform. Of course, Flutter apps cannot use a system's native widget without writing native code either.
Flutter definitely deserves a big thumbs-up for ease of setup. On OS X, it took me (at most) half an hour to get everything up-and-running, but it would probably be a bit longer if I hadn't already had Android Studio and Android SDK installed.
The apps built in Flutter are also reported performing better than those made with Xamarin or React Native, but I could not verify this myself, as I don't have any previous experiences with mobile cross-platform solutions.
My doubts about Flutter
The future of Flutter is still not certain. It still doesn't have a release date, and it's still in alpha stage, which means that further support is not a certainty. I don't think it's very likely that support would end, though. Google is promoting this new tool in its conferences, so that might be a sign the company wants more and more people to start using it.
Another potential trap for the would-be Flutter developers is jumping on that bandwagon too quickly, as I mentioned earlier. Even if you have a lot of experience developing mobile applications, you probably wouldn't be able to transition to Flutter instantly. The best approach would be testing the waters with some smaller projects before trying to port your long-running application.
What's next for Flutter?
Is Flutter going to replace native apps? Not very likely. But it can probably take a good piece of the mobile applications market, since many are simple enough to implement easily. I also see a huge potential in using Flutter for implementing business logic for applications and writing UI in native SDKs.
But, as it is with all of the programming SDKs, a lot depends on community reception and adoption, which in turn depends on many factors, not all of which are technical. Engagement from “outside” developers would ensure steady growth of new libraries and ensure community support for beginner developers.

Kirk Cousins is seeking help.
The Redskins quarterback is using part of their offseason to track down a host of current and former quarterbacks for advice on how to attack the seven-month stretch between games.
"Basically, I'm trying to figure that out still," Cousins this week told CSN Mid-Atlantic. "I feel like I'm still in (that) process. I've called a few of the starting quarterbacks around the league, a few of the retired guys who had great careers, and just asked them what worked for them in the offseason."
Cousins went on: "What was their rhythm in January, February, March? When they went back in April, May, June, what's their rhythm? What's their rhythm in the summer? How do they handle family? How do they balance travel and opportunities? ... I'm trying to get to a routine that works for me and my wife and our family. Once we start in mid-April and go 'til mid-June, football's a huge priority and I'm trying to get as much done here as I can."
After winning the starting job last summer, Cousins -- known for their obsessive preparation -- wants their off-the-field months outlined down to the minute. Remember, this is the same quarterback who broke down their in-season schedule into delightfully nerdy, color-coded, 15-minute blocks that stretched from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. Seven days a week.
Cousins isn't the only signal-caller to seek out help, but their curiosity sits in contrast to plenty of young quarterbacks who don't. Robert Griffin III raised eyebrows by never meeting with former Redskins passer and current team employee Doug Williams, while Johnny Manziel -- before their full-on meltdown kicked in -- refused to take calls from ex-Browns quarterback and Cleveland icon Bernie Kosar.
Cousins is willing to admit they don't have all the answers.
President Trump again put out a tweet calling for athletes to stand during the national anthem – and even dragged all-time great sprinter Usain Bolt into the fray Tuesday night.
Trump posted a video of the Jamaican Olympic gold medalist being interviewed on TV during the 2016 Rio games. They suddenly cut the chat short as “The Star-Spangled Banner” was being played over the stadium PA system and then stands quietly as the music is heard.

“Even Usain Bolt from Jamaica, one of the greatest runners and athletes of all time, showed RESPECT for our National Anthem!” Trump wrote, to go along with the 82-second video.
In the awkward footage, Bolt asks the interviewer, “Is it live?”
They then pointed at one end of the stadium, said “national anthem” and stood at attention.
The tweet comes after Trump demanded last weekend that owners of sports teams fire players that kneel in protest during the national anthem.
Mr. Netanyahu appeared to have been taken by surprise by the news that the project had gotten underway, though officials in their office declined to confirm that.
The bus plan was conceived by the Israeli Defense Ministry, apparently in response to pressure from Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank who have long demanded separate transportation for the Palestinians.
The plan called for Palestinians who work in Israel to return to the West Bank at the end of the day through one of four designated Israeli checkpoints, and then to take Palestinian buses to their towns and villages. They would no longer have been allowed to take Israeli buses traveling directly from Israeli cities to West Bank settlements, which cuts down on travel time for Palestinians who live along the way.
The defense minister, Moshe Yaalon, denied that there had ever been a plan to segregate the buses.
“There was no discussion to do so, no decision was taken to do so, and there will be no decision to do so,” they said in a statement later on Wednesday.
Mr. Yaalon said that the idea had solely been to tighten security by supervising the re-entry of Palestinian workers into the West Bank, by having them pass through the designated checkpoints.
Israel's deputy defense minister, Eli Ben-Dahan, a member of the right-wing, pro-settlement Jewish Home party, said they were surprised by the reversal, having learned of it as they were defending the project in Parliament.
“There is no apartheid here,” they said, telling opponents to “stop blackening Israel's reputation.” They defended the travel rules on security grounds, citing Palestinian attacks on Israelis.
SASKATOON – One day after Saskatchewan NDP Leader Cam Broten introduced their party's full platform, Saskatchewan Party Leader Brad Wall took aim at the NDP's budgeting. Wall said the promise would cost hundreds of millions of dollars not disclosed in the NDP's platform.
When asked by reporters why the NDP's utility rate bundle wasn't costed out in the party platform, Broten said “It's not in the platform because it's being delivered through the Crowns.”
Sask Party officials said all Crown corporation profits must be accounted for in a provincial budget and slashing utility rates would impact profits. The party said the NDP's plan would cost $595 million over four years.

“This speaks to competence. This speaks to a basic understanding of how we do budget in Saskatchewan,” Wall said.
NDP officials said cutting waste and improving efficiency in the Crowns would create savings to lower utility rates.
Broten said he's waiting to see how much Wall's party has budgeted to cover losses from the SaskPower carbon capture project at Boundary Dam and the impact of malfunctioning smart meters.

Broten made their comments Friday at TCU Place in Saskatoon, where they pledged to give seniors the option to defer their property taxes through a loan from the Saskatchewan government.
“The low-interest loan that covers these amounts only needs to be repaid when the home is sold,” Broten said.
Wall spoke at the site of the future North Commuter Parkway, where they announced the Sask Party's plans to invest $1.7 billion in infrastructure in the 2016-17 budget.

Grits with cheese, bacon, green onion and poached egg
Grits is food made from corn (maize) that is ground into a coarse meal and then boiled. Hominy grits is a type of grits made from hominy, corn that has been treated with an alkali in a process called nixtamalization with the pericarp removed. Grits is often served with other flavorings[1] as a breakfast dish, usually savory. The dish originated in the Southern United States but now is available nationwide, and is popular as the dinner entrée shrimp and grits, served primarily in the South.[1] Grits should not be confused with boiled ground corn, which makes "hasty pudding" or "mush" or may be made into polenta using coarse ground corn, or with the "mush" made from more finely ground corn meal.
Grits is of Native American origin and is similar to other thick maize-based porridges from around the world, such as polenta and mieliepap. The word "grits" is derived from the Old English word "grytt," meaning coarse meal.[2]
Origin [ edit ]
The dish came from a Native American Muskogee tribe's recipe in the 16th century, of Indian corn similar to hominy or maize. Traditionally from the southeastern woodlands, the Muskogee would grind the corn in a stone mill, giving it a “gritty” texture.[3] They were made using a stone-grounder. Only true grits are boiled and mixed with butter and milk. The colonists and settlers enjoyed the new staple with the local Native Americans and it became an American staple dish.[4]
Traditionally, the hominy for grits was ground on a stone mill. The ground hominy was then passed through screens, the finer sifted material used as grit meal, and the coarser than grits.[citation needed] State law in South Carolina requires grits and rice meal to be enriched, similar to the requirement for flour.[5]
Three-quarters of grits sold in the U.S. are bought in the South, in an area stretching from Texas to Virginia that is sometimes called the "grits belt".[6] The state of Georgia declared grits to be its official prepared food in 2002.[7] Similar bills have been introduced in South Carolina, naming it the official state food.[8] Grits may be either yellow or white, depending on the color of the corn used. The most common version in supermarkets is "quick" grits, which have the germ and hull removed. Whole kernel grits is sometimes called "speckled".[9]
Preparation [ edit ]
Prepared grits
Whole kernel grits is prepared by adding four to five parts boiling water or milk (seasoned with salt—1/4 tsp for each cup of liquid) to one part grits. Cover and cook for 20 to 45 minutes over medium low, stirring regularly.[citation needed] Grits expand when cooked and need stirring to prevent sticking, and lumps from forming.[citation needed] They are not done until they have absorbed four and one quarter times their volume.[citation needed] Whole grain grits require much longer to become soft than do "quick grits." Some people serve grits with sugar, while others object to sweetened grits. They are often served with butter. They are served with grated cheese, sausage, bacon, or salt and pepper, or red-eye gravy. Extra, i.e., left-over, grits can be put into a glass tumbler or loaf pan, chilled until needed, sliced, and fried either plain or with a breading. In this form they are denominated "fried grits," "fried hominy," or "grit cakes."[citation needed]
Grit dishes [ edit ]
Grits is eaten with a wide variety of foods, such as eggs and bacon, fried catfish, salmon croquettes, country ham, and many other dishes.[original research?]
Shrimp and grits is a traditional dish in the Lowcountry of coastal South Carolina and Georgia.[original research?] A variation of the dish is also consumed for breakfast in the northern states of Kedah and Perlis in peninsular Malaysia. It is a traditional breakfast dish.[original research?]
Solidified cooked grits can be sliced and fried directly in vegetable oil, butter, or bacon grease, or they can first be breaded in beaten egg and bread crumbs.[original research?]
Dessert grits[10][11][12] are made with milk, cream, chocolate, chocolate tahini, brown sugar, and salt and can be served optionally with berries or fruit.[original research?]
In popular culture [ edit ]
Grits are discussed in the 1992 comedy film My Cousin Vinny. Grits are used as a punishment for a teenage girl in the 2008 film The Secret Life of Bees.

It's not surprising that Donald Trump's key Cabinet nominees are being asked to defend their most controversial statements at their confirmation hearings. What's surprising is the way some of them are responding: by telling skeptical lawmakers that they hadn't actually discussed the issues with the president-elect.
John Kelly, Trump's pick to head the Department of Homeland Security, says they haven't talked to Trump about immigration. Rex Tillerson, nominated for secretary of state, says they haven't talked to Trump about Russia.
Given that President-elect Trump has an unconventional managing style (or, to put it less charitably, often appears uninterested in the basic business of running the federal government), the surprising thing would in some ways be if Trump had had substantive policy chats with them.
That's the real takeaway from the first wave of Trump confirmation hearings: Even with Inauguration Day looming, nominees to top posts don't seem capable of saying what the Trump administration will actually do once in office. And that means the public can't either.
Trump hasn't talked to relevant Cabinet nominees about their biggest foreign and domestic priorities
It's not a stretch to say that immigration is Trump's signature domestic issue, and that reducing tensions with Russia has become their signature priority in foreign policy.
You'd certainly think that their appointees to lead the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department would be key advisers on each issue, respectively. You'd certainly think that, by the time they went before the Senate for confirmation hearings — with scarcely a week before inauguration — they'd be deeply involved in discussions about the specifics of the administration's policy agenda.
You'd be wrong.
Kelly told the Senate's Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee hearing Tuesday that there are “ongoing” conversations among Trump's team about immigration policy, but that “I have not been involved in those discussions.”
Tillerson, for their part, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Wednesday that he'd talked to Trump “in a broad construct, and in terms of the principles that are going to guide” US foreign policy.
But when Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) asked if the two men had discussed Russia, Tillerson said, “That has not occurred yet.”
These issues aren't just important — they're urgent.
Kelly's admission that they haven't discussed immigration policy with Trump came in an exchange about what he'd do with the 800,000 unauthorized immigrants who've been protected from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA) — which Trump might end during their first days in office.
Many DACA recipients are worried that they could lose their jobs in a matter of weeks — and, furthermore, that it's going to be easy for immigration agents to track them down and deport them, since Trump's administration (and Kelly's DHS) will have access to the information on their DACA applications.
The president-elect's attitude toward Russia is if anything even more urgent, since he's setting the tone for that even before being sworn in — for example, in tweets Wednesday morning using Russian government denials to cast doubt on unverified but widely circulated allegations that their campaign has had direct contact with the Russian government.
Does this mean Trump's Cabinet appointees will be independent, or simply ignored?
Trump's attorney general nominee, Jeff Sessions, hasn't had any of these moments. That's not surprising. Sessions has always been a key Trump adviser — and often been in the position of defending the president's less tempered statements.
But both Kelly and Tillerson are new additions to the Trump team. And both of them are showing a certain degree of independence — which is helping their cases for confirmation.
Tillerson won the respect of some senators in private meetings because they were willing to take a relatively hawkish line on Russia— sparking hopes he'd moderate Trump's tendency to dismiss any evidence of Russian wrongdoing. And before admitting they hadn't spoken to Trump about Russia, they voiced support for keeping sanctions in place against the country (Trump supports lifting sanctions, and Tillerson appears to have lobbied against them).
Kelly said in their opening statement that he's “never had a problem speaking truth to power” — a sentiment multiple Democrats on the committee invoked throughout the hearing. Despite not having talked immigration with Trump's team, they were willing to speculate that they didn't think that DACA recipients would be “priorities” for deportation (something that might surprise Trump advisers and allies who've called for the Trump administration to get rid of policies dictating who immigration agents ought to prioritize).
But it's impossible to know whether Kelly's or Tillerson's statements mean anything. It's hard to speak truth to power if you and power don't speak.
President-elect Trump has shown very little interest in the boring, day-to-day work of running the executive branch of the federal government. One of the biggest questions facing their presidency is how that will play out.
It's possible that, while Trump is off engaging in showmanship, Cabinet appointees like Kelly will quietly do their jobs more or less unmolested, without the White House getting terribly involved. Maybe Trump (and their White House staff) really don't care all that much about whether people who currently have DACA protections get deported or not, as long as Trump can claim that he's cracking down on illegal immigration. Maybe Tillerson will be able to keep some sanctions on Russia without the White House picking a fight. For people who are concerned about the effects of Trump's agenda, it might be some comfort to know that maybe they won't care enough to follow through.
But it's also possible that Trump and company will require that Cabinet picks run their departments as they've been told to, and assume that appointees like Kelly will work out the details themselves.
That would be a waste of Trump's more experienced nominees, like Kelly, a former Marine general deeply versed in US policy toward South and Central America, and Jim Mattis, the decorated general Trump has tapped to run the Pentagon.
Nominating someone well-known as a “straight-talking general,” then depriving them of any opportunity to deliver straight talk, would confirm that Trump wanted yes-men, not officials willing to stand up to them or their other advisers.
It would also be extremely bad for the day-to-day working of the federal government.
DHS is a notoriously difficult Cabinet department that needs a coherent plan and a firm hand. The State Department, meanwhile, is the key cog in the nation's foreign policy apparatus. The president sets the direction, but it's left to America's top diplomat to hone the details and actually lead the talks with other governments. That's hard to do if the secretary of state isn't regularly discussing those issues with their own boss.
And that means lawmakers aren't the only ones waiting to learn key details about Trump's policies. The officials charged with putting them into place are, too.
When I'm criticizing religion, one of the things I often hear is that if every religion were like Buddhism we'd have no problems. This is absurd to anybody who has had their thumb to the pulse of global politics in the last decade. While I can certainly admit that on the whole Buddhism causes fewer problems than Christianity or Islam, it's not without its dark sport. The most recent are proposed laws in largely Buddhist Myanmar that would require governmental permission to change one's religion and would curtail interfaith marriages:
Draft laws in Myanmar aimed at protecting the country's majority Buddhist identity by regulating religious conversions and marriages between people of different faiths have “no place in the 21st century” and should be withdrawn, a U.S. government agency said on Wednesday.
At least 237 people have been killed and more than 140,000 displaced by the violence since June 2012. The vast majority of victims have been Muslims, who make up about 5 percent of Myanmar's population of 60 million.
These laws are pointed directly at Muslims, who are the second largest religious group in the country at about 5% of the population. They are likely a result of recent violence in the country that is the result of tension between the two factions:
This is why government must remain secular: so the majority religion cannot use the government as an enforcement arm for their faith. This would be obvious to every Christian in America if they were actually the minority and didn't have to rely on empathy to imagine what that would be like.

USA – -(Ammoland.com)- “Hawaii's governor signed a bill making it the first state to place its residents who own firearms in a federal criminal record database and monitor them for possible wrongdoing anywhere in the country,” the New York Post reports. “Hawaii Governor David Ige, a Democrat, on Thursday signed into law a bill to have police in the state enroll people into an FBI criminal monitoring service after they register their firearms as already required, their office said in a statement.”
That's what they say it's for. What they don't say is the people also already exempted by law from any form of gun registration are convicted violent criminals. That's because the Supreme Court ruled in U.S. v Haynes, properly, if you think about it, that requiring a prohibited person to register a firearm is equivalent to requiring them to self-incriminate, a violation of Fifth Amendment protections.
We also have historical dangers: Stephen P. Halbrook tells the horrible and outrageous tale of Olympic gymnast Alfred Flatow, a Jew identified by the Nazis from mandatory gun registration lists and condemned to a concentration camp.
No fair? It's ludicrous to resort to Godwin's law because this is America?
Hey, who'd have ever thought we'd have secret lists with which to deny citizens rights without due process? Plus it's not like the government hasn't already put whole “disfavored” groups of people into internment camps.
And it's not like there haven't been demands from the gun-grabbers to treat NRA like a terrorist organization. There's even a MoveOn.org petition.
We also have examples of the government using registration lists against gun owners:
The New York City Police Department (NYPD) had notified the 2,340 New Yorkers who had been licensed earlier to possess semi-automatic rifles and shotguns that any of those licensed firearms that were covered by the ban had to be surrendered, rendered inoperable or taken out of the city. The recipients of the notification were directed to send back a sworn statement indicating what had been done with those firearms.
Gun owners basically have two options when confronted with such edicts: Capitulate and surrender, or become part of the “I will not comply” paradigm and be destroyed if caught (raising a third option for those who will not accept that outcome) .
As for the ubiquitous dismissal that this is just paranoia because no one wants to take our guns we have plenty of evidence that's exactly what the gun-grabbers want to do – from Obama renewing their call to ban “assault weapons,” to highly publicized calls to “repeal the Second Amendment.”
That makes it all the more critical for gun owners to understand how much hangs in the balance if Hillary Clinton gets to be the one to determine the new majority of the Supreme Court. And it makes it crucial to underscore that by realizing there is one legislative and judicial threat greater than any other currently facing us, one that can make “progressive” dreams come true: Subversive immigration / enforcement policies designed to enable a “pathway to citizenship” for populations known to overwhelmingly support Democrat/anti-gun policies.

With head bowed, Robertson began their pre-race prayer by declaring, "We got here via bibles and guns. I'm fixin' to pray to the one who made that possible.”
Que the nervous squirming on pit road.
After briefly praising the United States military, they transitioned to the political arena, saying, “I pray, Father, that we put a Jesus-man in the White House. Help us do that and help us all to repent, to do what is right, to love you more and to love each other. In the name of Jesus I pray, amen."
The Robertson family has traditionally been outspoken in its support of Republican candidates. This election season, Phil Robertson has endorsed Texas senator Ted Cruz. Son Willie, the CEO of Duck Commander, is backing Donald Trump. Just weeks after NASCAR Chairman Brian France, Hall Of Fame driver Bill Elliott and current stars Ryan Newman, David Ragan and Chase Elliott publically endorsed Trump, Robertson's comments served to rekindle the still-smoldering debate over whether NASCAR – or any other professional sport – should espouse specific political and religious views.
The breathless headlines quickly followed:
“Bizarre Video: `Bibles & Guns!' Phil Robertson Delivers Controversial Prayer at NASCAR Race.”
“NASCAR Invocation Features Prayer To Elect Republican President.”
“'Duck Dynasty' Star May Ruffle More Than A Few Feathers This Time.”
This, despite the fact that nowhere in their invocation did Robertson use the words Republican, Democrat or Independent.
Whether or not you agree with Robertson's political and religious views, their comments Saturday reinforced long-held stereotypes of NASCAR as a staunchly conservative southern sport. They also raised important questions about the atmosphere of inclusion our sport endeavors to espouse. For in an era when NASCAR advocates inclusion, the sanctioning body continues to play favorites on the religious front.
Before we go any further, a brief disclaimer is in order.
I am not a deeply religious person. Much to the chagrin of my dearly departed grandmother – a devout, God-fearing woman who would have climbed from their death bed to attend Sunday morning services – my church attendance is strictly limited to weddings and funerals. My biblical knowledge begins and ends with generic, “do unto others” platitudes, and while I absolutely believe in a higher power, I'm not sure I can identify them (or her) by name.
While admittedly not a “religion guy,” I do have some specific thoughts on the role of religion in our sport; thoughts that will almost certainly damn me to hell in the minds of some. I'm OK with that, since the decision on how and where I spend eternity is in hands of that asupervisorstioned higher power, and not the readers of GodfatherMotorsports.com.
NASCAR is one of the few major professional sports that allows pre-race prayers at events. That is an admirable stance, in my view; one that would be even more laudable if the “singing and praying” were inclusive, rather than exclusive. Currently, the sport's weekly, pre-race invocations are conducted almost exclusively by Christian clergy, with a heavy emphasis on resurrection, the cross and – in Robertson's words – “ the name of Jesus.” Try to recall the last time a pre-race prayer was delivered by a rabbi, rather than a pastor. Try to recall the last time the prayer was non-denominational, instead of ecumenical.
Odds are, you'll be thinking for a while.
One wonders how Jewish, Hindu, Islamic or Buddist fans feel in the midst of NASCAR's weekly, Christian-based pre-race prayer, not to mention those who happen to be agnostic or atheist. How must they feel when their favorite sport hands the microphone – week after week – to a series of “Jesus-men,” at the exclusion of all others?
Lots of words come to mind. “Welcome,” however, is not one of them.
Prayer has a long history in NASCAR , pre-dating the foundation of the sanctioning body in 1949. In an era when religion has been banished from our schools and public forums, NASCAR stands with the NFL's Carolina Panthers and NBA's Oklahoma City Thunder as the only major sporting franchises willing to give thanks to a higher power before putting the ball in play.
As a privately owned business, NASCAR is entitled to address its pre-race prayers to whatever deity it chooses. What's legal, however, is not necessarily what's right. Our nation's courts ruled decades ago that prayer is only permissible at publically funded universities if it does not endorse a specific religion.
Perhaps it is time for NASCAR to begin walking a similar path, taking a page from the Panthers, who require their pre-race invocations to be “ecumenical in nature,” embracing all beliefs while favoring none. By praying to a higher power without defining that deity by name, we enable fans to celebrate their religious beliefs together, without sending the message that one religion is better than others.
Recently, in an attempt to become more welcoming to people of color, NASCAR parted with longstanding tradition by discouraging the use of Confederate flags on speedway property. That decision was justified on racial grounds, just as the elimination of specific, denominational prayers is justified on religious grounds.
Tradition does not justify exclusion, and NASCAR can do better in this regard. In fact, it is high time for us to do so.
Texas Motor Speedway president Eddie Gossage defended Robertson's comments Saturday, saying the Duck Dynasty star “said what they felt and believed. There are a lot of people that agree with them and a lot that disagree with him. Nowadays, you cannot say what you think because of political correctness. So, I guess everyone has a right to free speech. Or nobody does.
“What do you do?” asked Gossage. “We're supposed to be tolerant of all.”
Tolerance is indeed a worthy goal. It is achievable, however, only through the willingness to honor all points of view, not just those with which we agree.
Robertson is absolutely entitled to their personal beliefs. One wonders why the former Louisiana Tech football star eschewed a heartfelt statement of thanks to a higher power in favor of a recruitment speech for Team Jesus, b ut that's Robertson's call, not mine.
Texas Motor Speedway officials stretched the boundaries of believability, however, by claiming to be surprised by Robertson's words. When you book Phil Robertson to deliver a pre-race prayer, you know what you're in for.
Hellfire, brimstone, guns and bibles… with a side order of alienation.
Urging people to “do what is right… and love each other” is admirable on all fronts. The balance of Robertson's “bibles and guns” rhetoric, however, was clearly (and perhaps intentionally) alienating to those of conflicting faiths. To non-Christians, Saturday night's invocation was akin to saying, “My God is the only acceptable God, and if you don't believe as I do, you are not welcome here.” Those words are perfectly acceptable for a Sunday morning church service filled with like-minded believers. They were ill-suited, however, for a speedway filled with wildly diverse race fans, not to mention a worldwide television audience.
It's not about whether or not you agree with Phil Robertson. Plenty of people do, and plenty do not. It's also not about whether you think we need a Jesus-man in the White House. It's about welcoming everyone -- people of all races, genders, religions and political beliefs – to our sport. Disenfranchising large numbers of current and potential fans by praying publically to one (and only one) God makes as little sense as alienating others by flying the Confederate flag.
It is short-sighted in the extreme, and its time is long passed.
NASCAR has made important, meaningful strides toward inclusiveness in recent years. Robertson's comments Saturday night did the sport a favor, by stimulating discussion on yet another critical issue.

China Airlines Flight 006 (callsign "Dynasty 006") was a daily non-stop flight from Taipei to Los Angeles International Airport. On 19 February 1985, the Boeing 747SP operating the flight was involved in an aircraft upset accident, following the failure of the No. 4 engine, while cruising at 41,000 ft (12,500 m). The plane rolled over and plunged 30,000 ft (9,100 m), experiencing high speeds and g-forces (approaching 5g) before the captain was able to recover from the dive, and then to divert to San Francisco International Airport.[1]
Accident [ edit ]
N4522V, the aircraft involved in the incident, at Amsterdam in 1991
The aircraft had departed from Taipei at 16:22 local time. The accident occurred 10 hours into the flight. The Boeing 747SP-09 was 350 miles (560 km) northwest of San Francisco, cruising at an altitude of 41,000 ft (12,500 m). The cockpit crew consisted of Captain Min-Yuan Ho, age 55, First Officer Ju Yu Chang, age 53, Flight Engineer Kuo-Pin Wei, age 55, Relief Captain Chien-Yuan Liao, age 53, and Relief Flight Engineer Shih Lung Su, age 41.[1] Captain Ho had approximately 15,500 flight hours. The First Officer had more than 7,700 hours, and the Flight Engineer had approximately 15,500 hours of flight time.[1] The accident occurred while the main crew was on duty.
The sequence began with a loss of thrust in the No. 4 Engine. That engine had failed twice during previous flights (while cruising at FL 410 and 430). In each of those cases, the engine was restarted after descending to a lower altitude. The maintenance response to the logbook entries that noted the problems included engine inspection, fuel filter drainage and replacement, vane controller inspection and replacement, water drainage from Mach probes, and other filter replacements. None of those acts fixed the recurrent problem of the No. 4 engine.[1][2]
Diagram of aircraft roll/pitch attitudes and time from the NTSB report
The flight engineer attempted to restore power to the engine, but didn't close the bleed valve, as required by the checklist procedure.[1](p26) After the flight engineer announced the engine had flamed out, the captain instructed them to restart it, and ordered the first officer to request clearance for a descent from FL 410 (41,000 feet). According to the flight manual, engine restart is unlikely to succeed above 30,000 feet (9,100 m). The attempt failed.[1](p2)
Meanwhile, airspeed continued to decrease, and the autopilot rolled the control wheel to the maximum left limit of 23 degrees. As the speed decreased even further, the plane began to roll to the right, even though the autopilot was maintaining the maximum left roll limit. By the time the captain disconnected the autopilot, the plane had rolled over 60 degrees to the right and the nose had begun to drop. Ailerons and flight spoilers were the only means available to the autopilot to keep the wings level as the autopilot does not connect to the rudder during normal flight. To counteract the asymmetrical forces created by the loss of thrust from the No. 4 engine, it was essential for the pilot to manually push on the left rudder. However, the captain failed to use any rudder inputs at all, before or after disconnecting the autopilot. The resulting uncontrolled flight path is depicted in the diagram.[1](pp10–11)
As the plane descended through clouds, the captain's attention was drawn to the attitude indicator which displayed excessive bank and pitch. Because such an attitude is highly irregular, the captain incorrectly assumed the indicators to be faulty.[1](p3) Without any visual references (due to the clouds) and having rejected the information from the attitude indicators, the captain and first officer became spatially disoriented.[1](p31)
Only after breaking through the bottom of the clouds at 11,000 feet (3,400 m) was the captain able to orient themselves and bring the plane under control, leveling out at 9,600 feet (2,900 m). They had descended 30,000 ft (9,100 m) in under two and a half minutes while all onboard experienced g-forces as high as 5g.[1](p12) The cockpit crew believed that all four engines had flamed out, but the National Transportation Safety Board found that only engine No. 4 had failed.
After leveling out, the three remaining engines were supplying normal thrust. A restart attempt brought No. 4 back into use. They began climbing and reported to air traffic control "condition normal now" and continuing on to Los Angeles. They then noticed that the inboard main landing gear was down and one of the plane's hydraulic systems was empty.[1](p5) Because they did not have sufficient fuel to reach Los Angeles with the drag added by the landing gear, they diverted to San Francisco. An emergency was then declared and they flew straight in to the SFO airport.[1](p5)
The plane landed without further incident.[3]
Aftermath [ edit ]
There were two serious injuries on board: a fracture and laceration of a foot, and an acute back strain requiring two days of hospitalization. The aircraft was significantly damaged by the excessive G-forces. The wings were permanently bent upwards by 2 inches (5 cm), the inboard main landing gear lost two actuator doors, and the two inboard main gear struts were left dangling.[1] Most affected was the tail, where large outer parts of the horizontal stabilizer had been ripped off. The entire left outboard elevator had been lost along with its actuator, which had been powered by the hydraulic system that ruptured and drained.[1]
After repairs were made to the plane, it returned to service on 25 April 1985. It continued in service for nearly 12 years until it was leased to China Airlines' sister company, Mandarin Airlines, on 1 January 1997, and was in daily service for the remainder of that year.[citation needed] Mandarin then sent it to McCarran International Airport for storage.[citation needed] From April 2002 it was owned and operated by a religious organization known as Gospel to the Unreached Millions (GUM), headed by K. A. Paul, and was christened 'Global Peace One'. On 17 July 2005, the FAA suspended its operating certificate due to insufficient maintenance.[citation needed] As of May 20, 2010 , the aircraft is kept in a large hangar at General Abelardo L. Rodríguez International Airport in Tijuana, Baja California, and is reported to be in very poor condition.
China Airlines still operates one of its scheduled Taipei-Los Angeles services as Dynasty 006, utilizing the Boeing 747-400 until late 2014 and then the Boeing 777-300ER.[4]
In popular culture [ edit ]
The Discovery Channel Canada / National Geographic TV series Mayday (also called Air Crash Investigation or Air Emergency) dramatized the accident in a 2007 episode titled Panic Over the Pacific.[5]
The flight was documented on an episode of the Weather Channel television program Why Planes Crash titled "Who's Flying".

- Three people were killed Wednesday morning when two 18-wheelers collided and also hit a third vehicle on I-30 in Rockwall County.
The crash happened about 5 a.m. on Interstate 30 eastbound near the Royse City and Fate areas and shutdown all eastbound traffic for most of the day.
An 18-wheeler traveling westbound when it veered left and hit another car and went across the median into oncoming traffic. It collided with another 18-wheeler traveling eastbound head-on.
The two 18-wheeler drivers have been identified as 38-year-old Guadalupe Garza Jr. of Lyford, Texas and 53-year-old Victor Bovkoun of Ontario, Canada. Bovkoun worked for Chantler Transport, which is based in Canada. Garza worked for TCI Trucking.
The third victim and driver of the car was Kevin Battise, 56, of Mesquite.
All eastbound lanes of I-30 between FM 35 and FM 2642 were shut down for more than 12 hours before reopening. A representative for the Rockwall County Sheriff's Office said there were guard cables to separate traffic, but they appeared to be broken from the accident.
The sheriff's office has not officially determined which driver caused the accident.
TIBURON, Calif— 15 October, 2015.The global PC gaming hardware market is forecast to slightly recede in 2015 but, but less than the overall PC market, and then resume growth in 2016. However, all recession and growth within the market is not equal. Jon Peddie Research (JPR) believes that notebooks bought for gaming have entered a challenging sales environment as PC gamers gear up for the forthcoming mass market 4K/UHD development.
Ted Pollak, Senior Analyst notes,"This cycle, unlike any for the past fifteen years, will inspire gamers to upgrade their displays. 27 inches and larger 4K/UHD displays are reaching mass market pricing levels and produce an incredible experience allowing much wider field of view and greater detail. The financial outlay for these display upgrades alone is billions of dollars over the coming years” Jon Peddie, President of JPR adds “In addition to the cost of the new display technology, gamers are going to need the computing horsepower to drive Triple A game engine at over 60 frames per second, and that horsepower comes at a premium”. Sixty frames per second is considered the gold standard in PC gaming and many prefer even faster speeds, at least twice that number if VR is involved.
The gaming notebook and desktop market is especially challenged in the low end as many casual players opt for tablets and TV Gaming options to satisfy their needs. However a new wave of TV optimized PCs from Alienware, iBuyPower, and other companies could buck the trend. On a positive note for 2015, the PC Gaming peripherals and upgrade market serves as a buffer in hard times as gamers who wear through mice, keyboards, and headsets easily justify their replacement.
The PC Gaming Hardware Market is very diverse amongst its different segments. The high-end Enthusiast segment is very performance and style oriented much like sports car owners. While the low end just wants to play games on something and this is why the segment is under threat from cheaper gaming solutions.

The tiger that killed a keeper at a Cambridgeshire zoo will not be put down, the park has confirmed.
Rosa King, 33, died at Hamerton Zoo Park on 29 May.
"After extensive consultation with the staff at the zoo, we have decided not to put down the tiger. This decision has been fully supported by Rosa's family," park owners said.
An inquest into how Ms King died has not yet taken place and an investigation is still under way.
Ms King, whose family home is in Chippenham, Wiltshire, had worked at the zoo for 14 years.
Image copyright King family Image caption Ms King raised money for a number of animal charities, their parents said
A joint investigation by police and Huntingdonshire District Council - which is responsible for licensing the zoo - is continuing and the zoo remains closed.
Owners were unable to say when it might reopen but in a statement released on its website, the park said it had taken the decision not to put the tiger down.
"We are awaiting the findings of the investigation to fully understand what happened before we take further action on this matter," they said.
"If we receive regulatory or professional guidance to the contrary, we will review our position."

Citibank (NYSE: C) has sold a significant portion of its brokerage businesses across the world and now plans on reforming what's left of its North American brokerage business.
Citibank's reform will involve making it so that financial advisers will charge service-fees for advice rather than earning commissions from sales on stocks, bonds, mutual funds and other investments. In a recent statement, Citibank said that their goal is to “eliminate commission-based compensation” by 2011.
Citibank says that their “strategic shift” will begin immediately, with the assignment of 600 branched-based-brokers to teams, which were not included in the recent sale of Morgan Stanley. Customers that would like to pay on a transaction basis can continue to do so by calling the company's National Investor Center located in San Antonio.
Citigroup CEO, Vikram Pandit, is seeking ways to compete in the business of managing customer's financial investments in the new era that many are calling the “reset economy.” Citibank was forced to sell its share of the Smith Barney brokerage unit to generate capital.
The move will undoubtedly be welcomed by most of Citibank's customers. Having fee-only financial advisors will align the values of the customers and the investment advisor. Citibank's brokers will no longer have the incentive to sell products with higher commissions, even if they are not appropriate for their customers. Advocates of fee-based accounts state that clients are much more likely to get better, unbiased advice.
Most other brokerage firms, including Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, and Merrill Lynch Wealth Management, still charge commissions.
Did you know that the law in the state of Florida requires two-party consent? This means that both the person recording video and the person being recorded must consent to being recorded when either person has a reasonable expectation of privacy. You know, like at a private fundraiser where the media isn't allowed.
Furthermore, did you know that the secret video of Mitt Romney the media is currently using to try and destroy their campaign was recorded in Florida … without Mitt Romney's consent, and when they obviously had a reasonable expectation of privacy?
The reason you don't know that is because when it comes to protecting Barack Obama, the corrupt media doesn't get all that wrapped up in the details of what is and isn't legal or ethical. The Romney video is news; it's a revealing moment from The Man Who Might Be President, and as a result we're entering day four of the super-loop the media's put the video on across every news outlet in America.
While I personally have a number of issues with the way in which the media is hyping the video and using it as a partisan weapon to protect Their Precious One, I do agree with the decision to broadcast the video. The video is news, it is revealing, and the man we're learning about is pursuing the most powerful office in the world.
You see, in my heart, I'm a small “l” liberal who, above all, cherishes the First Amendment and believes that the media should not be restricted in any way other than the obvious surrounding national security and libel. There's a bigger moral and ethical world than two party consent, especially when it comes to vetting a potential president.
I hate how the media is using the video, but regardless of the law, agree wholeheartedly that the media made the right decision in making the video public.
Which brings me to the Khalidi tape, where it seems a source is telling the media, specifically the L.A. Times, what can and can't be told about a 2003 dinner Obama attended celebrating their longtime friend, Rashid Khalidi, a one-time spokesperson for terror-leader Yasser Arafat
In an article written by Peter Wallsten during the 2008 election titled, “Allies of Palestinians see a friend in Obama,” we learned of the event, that there was video of the event, and that some of the night's speakers accused Israel of terrorism and compared Jewish settlers to terror mastermind Osama bin Laden.
There's also speculation Obama lavished praise on the terror-apologist Khalidi and that Bill Ayers was in attendance. You know, the domestic terrorist Obama says was “just a guy in the neighborhood.”
According to Wallsten, Obama was not one of the speakers hurling hate at the Jews and Israel, but I'd like to see that for myself. And with the Middle East on fire and the President seemingly indifferent to Israel's upcoming showdown with Iran, the people and influences a then-41 year-old Obama marinated themselves in just a year before launching a national political career, is as relevant today as it was in 2008.
And yet, the same media, that as I write this is replaying the illegally obtained and selectively edited '47 percent' video of Mitt Romney for the gajillionth time, refuses to release the full Khalidi tape or provide a full description of what the tape shows.
Suddenly the L.A. Times (and the rest of the media that refuses to press the L.A. Times to release the video) is concerned with laws and ethics based on a convenient standard involving journalistic sources. Which makes one wonder if the source involved only allowed the L.A. Times access to the video if in exchange they agreed to write an article complimentary to Obama.
The undercover video of Mitt Romney was taken and disseminated and broadcast illegally. The release of the Khalidi tape, however, would violate no laws and the idea that a source can hand over something and demand that only certain portions be reported upon is the only thing that's unethical here.
Let me put it this way…
Exact same situation, but instead the video is of Mitt Romney at a celebratory dinner for David Duke.
Tell me we wouldn't have seen that by now.
The media is covering for, fighting for, and through sins of omission and commission, propagandizing for Barack Obama. This is why Breitbart News is offering a $100,000 reward for the video — in the hopes that someone who believes in the public's right to know will come forward with the video.
In today's media environment, there is no greater career sin than violating the left-wing narrative. Therefore, anyone willing to do such a thing deserves to be rewarded.

Food on the shelf at the Dalhousie Food Bank. Rising tuition fees and increasing cost of living are forcing Nova Scotia students to turn to food banks. ‘I work full time all summer I barely scratch the surface of those costs.' Photo contributed
(K'JIPUKTUK), HALIFAX - Many people assume that the diet of the university student mostly consists of ramen noodles or frozen pizzas, food that can be hastily consumed in intervals between classes.
Yest rising tuition fees and the increasing cost of living mean that students fueling their education face difficult decisions not only about what to eat, but how to eat at all.
‘I thought I'd give it a try' says Keegan Irish, a King's student who sought assistance from the Parker Street Food and Furniture Bank when money was tight, adding that they felt conspicuous standing in line.
Speculating that in previous decades tuition fees and living expenses could probably be covered by a summer's worth of work, Irish says that the work they can squeeze between semesters is no longer enough to make ends meet. ‘I work full time all summer I barely scratch the surface of those costs.'
‘We are privileged to be getting an education but I also think that a lot of students struggle financially because of student debt,' says Ali Calladine, a student at Dalhousie who spent the summer working with the Campus Food Strategy Group, a joint initiative of the Sierra Youth Coalition and Meal Exchange.
‘I actually know many people who have trouble buying groceries every week because they're trying to pay their tuition fees and text books and all of that,' they say.
Some people may be surprised that students use food banks,
As Nick Jennery, executive director of Feed Nova Scotia, points out, there are presumptions about the circumstances that drive people to use food banks, but in reality ‘the reasons are as diverse as the people who walk in the door'.
And the people who walk in the door are numerous; according to Feed Nova Scotia 36,000 Nova Scotians – or 1 in every 26 - rely on food banks every year. What they do have in common is vulnerability. ‘When you're hungry it's crippling ‘ says Jennery. ‘You can't focus on anything other than where you're next meal is going to come from, it's difficult.'
Despite a 10% decrease of household use of food banks in Nova Scotia between March 2013 and 2014, according to the Food Bank Canada's annual national survey, Jennery cautions against seeing the drop as wholly positive. Food bank use for single people without children is up to 65% from 57% in March 2013, that numbers are up nation-wide from 2013, and that the number of those seeking food assistance hovers stubbornly at 16% above pre-recession levels.
Universities across Canada offer food banks for their students, and in this Halifax is no exception. Unlike community food banks, campus alternatives require no paperwork and ask only for a student ID.
Tracking student food bank use is difficult; the same ease of access designed to make the campus food bank appealing to students also means that little information is kept about who comes through the door.
Fueled by supplies from Feed Nova Scotia, the Dalhousie food bank offers students with a lot on their plate an easier and on-site way to get food assistance. ‘There's definitely unfortunately some stigma around using a food bank, but because it's a campus food bank it's part of the culture that we understand that students are financially burdened' says Holly MacDonald, Members' Services Coordinator for the DSU.
Although students are relatively privileged, they acknowledge, there's also a culture on campus of understanding that the costs associated a university education can be overwhelming.
Despite the food bank's relatively central location in the Dalhousie Student Union Building, many students are unaware of it. The politics of food on campus still leave many students hungry for change.
For Calladine, when it comes to discussions about the distribution of food, students have a lot to bring to the table. Citing models such as the Loaded Ladle, which levies the student body to provide healthy free meals to students on a weekly basis, they point out that universities are an ideal location to attempt projects that would gain little traction in the broader community.
Even though students may lack the technical expertise that goes into managing food systems, they say that by introducing different models ‘we can prove that they work and we can get the institutional knowledge and the structures behind it to then open peoples minds to the ideas of these different ways of sharing and producing.'
With a range of initiatives including campus gardens – which donated their excess produce this year to the university food bank – to a weekly not-for-profit farmer's market, to what Calladine hopes will be the hiring of a food commissioner through the sustainability office of the Dalhousie Student Union next semester, the university is poised to be a site for debate about how we produce and consume food, going beyond food banks to examine some of the root causes of hunger.
In the meantime, Calladine hopes that the first step in a more equitable approach to food distribution is normalizing the use of food banks by all those in need, including students.
‘It's actually absurd to pay for food,' they suggest, ‘so by not paying for food you're kind of doing something normal now.'
Supreme Court chief Justice Marilyn Warren could be courting trouble with the bench, after issuing an edict that judges in Victoria's highest courts will no longer wear wigs from May 1.
A symbol of austere traditions harking back to 17th-century society, horsehair wigs have been a feature of Victorian courts since the 1860s.
Hair-raising idea: wigs could soon be a thing of the past in the Supreme Court. Credit:James Davies
It's understood Chief Judge Peter Kidd is considering following the Supreme Court's lead, but only if they win the support of County Court judges.
But some County Court judges are actively resisting the move to modernise their judicial attire out of concern that if judges' wigs are seen as an anachronism, traditional gowns could follow suit and judges could – literally – be de-robed.
After the body of Mohamed Ramadan was recovered four days after they went missing in Sinai's mountainous terrain, many Egyptians were infuriated and accused the government of stalling rescue efforts.
Ramadan, a filmmaker, was one of four Egyptian tourists who died in a blizzard near Egypt's Saint Catherine Monastery this week.
The other three hikers who died – Hagar Shalaby, 21, Khaled El-Sebaei, 30, and Ahmed Abel-Azim, 28 – were found on Monday on the mountain of Gabal Al-Zaatar, near Farsh Al-Romana – a relatively flat area in the Wadi El-Gebal valley where the hikers had been staying before climbing Gabal Al-Zaatar.
The four surviving members of the group – Yousriya Abdel-Kadder, 28, Maha Shawki, 31, Ihab Kotb, 25, and Mohamed Farouk, 28 – were rescued in Farsh Al-Romana by Bedouin guides and army personnel on Monday and transferred by helicopter to Saint Catherine Hospital for treatment on Tuesday, a delay that led to evident outrage on social media.
"Military planes are only used to throw teddy bears and gift vouchers … but to save the lives of the youth in the mountains, they must have orders, and refuel, and then the sun sets so they don't take off," Mostafa El-Sayed, a photojournalist who travelled to Saint Catherine on Tuesday, wrote on their Facebook page.
El-Sayed was referring to the previous gestures undertaken by the army during the July uprising against ousted Islamist president Mohamed Morsi, when military helicopters showered crowds with Egyptian flags and gifts. They were angry the helicopters didn't arrive earlier, which possibly could have saved the lives of the three hikers found dead on Monday in Gabal Al-Zaatar.
Massaad Abu Fagr, a Sinai-based political activist and writer, also took a swing at the army, criticising its statements that it had been impossible for helicopters to land where the survivors were initially based.
"Helicopters don't need parking garages to save people trapped on mountain tops. Paratroopers come off helicopters on ropes, pick up lost souls and return to the craft where paramedics are waiting at the door," they wrote on Tuesday.
Breakdown of events
According to preliminary information from Bedouin sources speaking to Ahram Online, the events unfolded as follows.
Eleven Egyptians arrived at Saint Catherine in South Sinai on Thursday for a hiking trip. On Saturday, eight of the 11 decided to go on a trek to Farsh Al-Romana in the Wadi Gebal valley, west of Saint Catherine.
At Farsh Al-Romana, a six-hour walk from Saint Catherine, Ramadan decided to explore the adjacent Gabal Al-Zaatar area by himself. They were followed later by Shalaby, El-Sebaei and Abel-Azim. It is not clear whether they were guided or not, but they weren't able to return to Farsh El-Romana, where the four others stayed and survived the low temperatures.
On Monday, the three friends back at Saint Catherine notified authorities about their friends – the weather conditions were poor and they were now worried.
The army then sent border-guard units, guided by Bedouins, to search for the four missing hikers. After a long search, they were able to locate the four survivors and the three who'd died. However, the army was unable to evacuate them right away – no landing space, poor visibility due to nightfall, plus the bad weather made an immediate helicopter rescue impossible.
Instead, the Bedouins and rescue team moved the survivors to an area up the valley towards Saint Catherine, where the helicopter was able to land the next day, Tuesday, and fly them to the hospital.
The survivors were in good physical condition but suffered from trauma, partly due to their being told of the death of the other three hikers.
Meanwhile, Ramadan was still missing and the bodies of their dead friends were still in Wadi Gebal.
The helicopter returned the next day, Wednesday, and along with the search team – part of which stayed with the bodies overnight – found Ramadan's body 2 km from Wadi Gebal. They moved them and the bodies of the three other dead hikers to the helicopter landing area, where they were then collected and returned to Cairo on Wednesday evening.
Incompetence
While many blamed the army for failing to immediately dispatch effective help that could have possibly saved the victims, Ahram Online learned from Bedouin sources that the Bedouins who led the group were unqualified to do so and thus responsible for the hikers getting lost.
One of the trip's organisers bypassed the two qualified guides at Saint Catherine and then struck a deal with a third party who lacked the experience to undertake such a hike.
The organiser thought the rate demanded by the first guides was too high and instead opted for the third party, who misguided the group, allowed it to get separated and then left all of them alone on Monday, making their way back to Saint Catherine by himself.
For its part, the Egyptian army issued a statement on Wednesday with a detailed timeline of events concerning its engagement with the matter. The statement said the army's inability to move the dead bodies was due to the time it took to refuel the helicopter on Tuesday after transferring the survivors, after which the sun had already set.
The army, however, did not explain the time difference between the police being notified and the helicopter being dispatched – a lengthy three hours that could have made a difference between life and death.

Fantasy Premier League Clean Sheet Tips For Gameweek 20
Welcome back to another article highlighting Fantasy Premier League Clean Sheet Tips For Gameweek 20. This week, NaturalFootyFan picks out the clubs and players with the best clean sheet potential ahead of the weekend's fixtures.
We have now passed the halfway mark of the Premier League season and who'd have thought the newly promoted pair of Leicester and Watford, as well as the often-understudied Crystal Palace, would be riding high inside the top 8? These sides have not been intimidated and have thrown their weight around, no matter the status of club who are placed in front of them. Considering that reigning champions, Chelsea, and the normally ever-consistent Swansea are lingering perilously above the relegation zone is a credit to the strength and demeanour of England's top flight.
With this unpredictability, it gives us a difficult job in predicting clean sheets across the board, but nevertheless, we will do our best to fashion together some tips, to give you the edge on FPL, FantasyBet and Mondogoal. Here are our recommendations, Enjoy.
Bookies Odds (Gameweek 20)
# Team Odds Implied Chance 1 Man United 1.91 52% 2 Arsenal 2.00 50% 3 Chelsea 2.60 39% 4 Liverpool 2.60 39% 5 Man City 2.60 39%
Form (Last 5 Matches)
# Team CS Avg. Goals Conceded 1 Crystal Palace 3 0.4 2 West Ham 3 0.4 3 Tottenham 2 0.8 4 Stoke 3 1.0 5 Swansea 3 1.0
FPL & FantasyBet Tips – Clean Sheet Prospective
Tottenham
[Fixtures: Everton (a), Leicester (H), Sunderland (H), Crystal Palace (a), Norwich (a)]
Their London rivals may top the table, but Spurs still have the best defensive record in England's top flight. They have conceded just 15 goals all season and have some attractive fixtures on the horizon; it is definitely worth filtering in one or two of their players at this stage. Shutting out Everton away from home is the first daunting task with Romelu Lukaku scoring goals for fun at the moment. However, we can see Tottenham dropping Eric Dier into the centre-back role they took up vs. Watford and alleviating some of the pressure off their back four. Another shrewd thing to note down is that Tottenham's centre-back pairing play Internationally for Belgium… and guess what, so does the guy they're looking to keep reins on, Romelu Lukaku. Surely they will know the forward inside out, their strengths and weaknesses and the best action to take to prevent them being the game-changer once again. Despite going in depth to emphasize the role of Tottenham's centre-backs, it is actually right-back Kyle Walker (FPL: 5.2m, FantasyBet: 5m) who stands out for us for Gameweek 20 and the opening weeks of 2016. The Englishman has kept 2 clean sheets in each of their last two matches and has racked up a total of 19 FPL points, including 4 bonus points, over this short period. They have been in the form of their life as of late and has already surpassed their goals and assist tally of last season. If Walker can push on during these next 5 fixtures, they offer excellent value as part of the Premier Leagues the strongest defence.
Manchester United
[Fixtures: Swansea (H), Newcastle (a), Liverpool (a), Southampton (H), Stoke (H)]
There was something about their performance against Chelsea that has drawn us into United's defensive potential in upcoming weeks. It was not the fact they shut out Chelsea in such a confident manner, there was a heightened desire and drive throughout the squad, almost as if the player's have suddenly clicked under Van Gaal's management. This weekend they face Swansea City, who have only scored once in their last 6 Premier League matches. David De Gea (FPL: 5.6m, FantasyBet: 5.5m) has a 52% implied chance of keeping a clean sheet in Gameweek 20, and with their sides favourable fixtures, they look set to stamp down a marker and close in on the golden glove award; currently trailing Gomes, Butland and Hart by a single clean sheet. The only other dependable figure in the Manchester backline, who is guaranteed to play whenever fit, is Chris Smalling (FPL: 6.8m, FantasyBet: 6.5m). Although in the premium price bracket in both FPL and FantasyBet, they are the only safe route into the Manchester defence, with their long injury list and the fact that Van Gaal seems to reshuffle their back 4 every week. Smalling is always an aerial threat from dead ball situations and scored 4 goals in just 21 appearances during the 2014/15 campaign – hopefully, they can open their account early in 2016.
Mondogoal Stacks
Stacking: To pair multiple players from the same team in an effort to increase upside.
(For example, if Arsenal secure a clean sheet in Gameweek 20 and you own 3 of their defenders, instead of 1 – your upside is tripled.)
Stacking has proven an extremely successful strategy in the past on Mondogoal. The best example of profiting from this tactic was when Alex Haywood or @HaystackedDFS on Twitter, placed all of their eggs in one basket (a Newcastle stack in their case) and transformed a £1 entry ticket into a leg-buckling £10,000 – they are the biggest U.K daily fantasy football winner to date.
Here are some possible stacks for Gameweek 20 on Mondogoal;
Low Risk – Arsenal Stack vs. Newcastle (Total Expense: 35.7m)
Newcastle come into this fixture, having failed to score in their last 2 Premier League matches while Arsenal dominated in a 2-nil victory over Bournemouth to bounce back from their embarrassing loss in Gameweek 18. This stack is very much on the expensive side of things, but when expected to control the tempo of the game, as well as the possession, Arsenal's defenders will see plenty of the ball – in this case, you get what you pay for, simple as that. With Koscielny returning, either Gabriel Paulista (8.2m) or Per Mertesacker (8.7m) will line up alongside the Frenchman. Our money's on the former, after an impressive display that saw them bank 17.1 Mondogoal points on Boxing Day; Gabriel managed to nod home from a Mesut Ozil corner in the first half and looked very dangerous from set piece situations throughout, with 3 attempts on target. Nacho Monreal (9.6m) should slot straight back into the starting XI, having been given a rest on Monday. The Spaniard, after a shaky first season, has established themselves this year as the most consistent fullback in the League – which their points per game average of 7.14 highlights. The implied chance of ‘The Gunners' securing a clean sheet is 50%… you can't argue with that!
Medium Risk – Stoke Stack vs. West Brom (Total Expense: 34.7m)
Stoke City have secured a clean sheet in 42% of their 19 Premier League Matches while West Brom have scored an average of 0.95 goals per game throughout the season; which is the 3rd worst record in England's top flight. Put 2 and 2 together and it seems a full proof decision to back ‘The Potters' against their goal-shy hosts. Stoke have looked a different side this season; they are slowly reinventing their style of play to a more possession based game. West Brom, especially with their top goal-scorer Salomon Rondon suspended, will attempt to soak up the pressure. However, their visitors are very efficient – scoring 30% of their goals during the first 15 minutes of games; if they are successful in breaking the deadlock early, we can't see West Brom putting up too much of a fight. Stoke have safeguarded 8 clean sheets this season, all of which came after Gameweek 7; they have now got two feet planted on the ground and a 9th appears on the cards.
High Risk – Leicester Stack vs. Bournemouth (Total Expense: 23.7m)
Off the back of their no-score stalemate versus Manchester City, 2nd placed Leicester welcome Bournemouth to the King Power Stadium, which has become something of a fortress following their rise to the top. These two sides have shared similar experiences, having both been promoted as league winners in the past 2 years. Nevertheless, Leicester trumps in the head-to-head battle and are unbeaten in the last 5 meetings (W4 D1). Bournemouth have struggled to find the net in their last 5 outings to the King Power having scored on just one occasion in their last four away matches against Leicester. The picture displayed is the trio of defenders we recommend, with Christain Fuchs (9.1m) missing out solely due to their steep price tag… come on, it's high risk for a reason!

In Seoul, mayor offers tips on hosting G-20
Pittsburgh officials network with South Korean businesses
SEOUL, South Korea -- Pittsburgh's landscape of bridges provided an apt image for Mayor Luke Ravenstahl as they presented their city as an investment destination in a networking seminar for South Korean businesses.
"We are the City of Bridges. Let us in the future continue to build bridges, between the city of Pittsburgh and the city of Seoul," they said as they toasted the 62 business leaders who had gathered at a hotel at the venue of the upcoming G-20 summit.
Just one month before the South Korean capital -- itself a bridge-spanned city -- opens its doors to world leaders, Mr. Ravenstahl and the Pittsburgh delegation stopped here on the way home from Shanghai, China, to forge ties not only with Seoul's G-20 organizing committee, but also with potential investors based in Asia's fourth largest economy.
The delegation includes Dennis Yablonsky, CEO of the Allegheny Conference on Community Development; conference Vice President Suzi Pegg; the mayor's chief of staff Yarone Zober; David Kim, an attorney at the Pittsburgh law firm Goldstein & Associates; and Ken Yang, head of Pennsylvania's South Korea office and the group's local liaison.
"Pittsburgh has more bridges than any other city in the world, and we're here to try to create some bridges between Pittsburgh business and Korean business," said Mr. Yablonsky in their presentation to South Korean guests as they displayed a night view of Downtown Pittsburgh's riverfront.
Mr. Yablonsky sought to connect the two regions' main industries, highlighting advanced manufacturing, information and communication technology, health care and life sciences, financial and business services, and energy as key sectors for both.
But no matter who was speaking, the G-20 emerged as a salient point in selling Pittsburgh's economic success and bringing the two cities together.
"Because of Pittsburgh's opportunity to tell our story to the world [through the summit in September 2009], we've been able to be here in Seoul, and we were able to be in Shanghai to get the message out about Pittsburgh and our transformation," Mr. Ravenstahl said.
To answer Seoul's own concerns on hosting its Nov. 11-12 summit, the mayor on Wednesday met with the G-20 Seoul Summit Organization Committee, including Ambassador Sihyung Lee, the committee's head of protocol.
"We tried to form a partnership, between city government, county government, the business community and hospitality business, a public-private partnership" to hold a successful event, Mr. Ravenstahl said before the seminar.
Ambassador Lee, after meeting with the mayor, hoped to achieve a similar effect in Seoul.
"[Mr. Ravenstahl] brought really a great deal of opportunities after the summit. That is the biggest point to share with Korean people," they said.
"I've repeatedly told the Korean people through radio and TV, along with other people from the organizing committee, that this is a really good opportunity to show everything about Korea in an orderly manner."
But maintaining order may present a challenge in protest-prone Seoul, where union and civic activist groups plan to hold massive demonstrations against the G-20 in the days surrounding the summit.
In response, South Korea's National Police Service announced earlier this week a ban on all rallies and demonstrations within a two-kilometer (1.24-mile) radius of the summit venue. In addition, the city is set to mobilize an estimated 30,000 police officers and 20,000 riot police to provide security for visiting world leaders.
"We spoke a little bit with the ambassador about public safety," said Mr. Ravenstahl. "It sounds like their plans are shaping up in a good way for them, similar to what we did in Pittsburgh."
Mr. Ravenstahl also will meet with Seoul's mayor, Oh Se-hoon, this morning, to share more lessons learned during last year's summit.
As for the business side, Korean professionals already tied to Pittsburgh welcomed increased awareness of the city among their compatriots.
"Pittsburgh is still a relatively unknown city to most Koreans. Chan Ho Park is there, Hines Ward is there, but it's not like LA or New York," said Andrew Choe, a manager at Dongwon Enterprise, the South Korean company that acquired Pittsburgh-based Starkist Tuna in 2008. "But because of seminars like this, now people can know about Pittsburgh."
Jim Kwon, president of PPG Industries' Korea operations, agreed.
"Pittsburgh has been underestimated, and I think Korea didn't realize how strong the educational background (of the city) is," they said, praising Mr. Yablonsky's presentation. "We've got to be realistic about the areas that Korea is interested in -- joint technology, R&D and biotechnology," they added.
The message seemed to ring clear for Seoul as it prepares to take the spotlight after being overshadowed by neighbors like Tokyo and Beijing.
Mr. Ravenstahl, wrapping up their remarks, highlighted the positives in the build-up to the G-20 event.
"Have some fun," they said. "Showcase your city. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Seoul to be on the global stage."

Blind to Cuban history, and blinkered by their late father's fairy tales about Fidel Castro, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's statement on the death of the Cuban dictator was an embarrassment of international proportions.
They ignored the brutal truth about the man, dancing around it like a clown in a parade dodging horse droppings.
Today they are likely searching for their tattered Che Guevara T-shirt to wear in nostalgic homage.
“It was with deep sorrow that I learned today of the death of Cuba's longest-serving president,” Trudeau said. “Fidel Castro was a larger than life leader who served their people for almost half a century.
“A legendary revolutionary and orator, Mr. Castro significant improvements to the education and healthcare of their island nation.
“While a controversial figure,” said Trudeau, “both Mr. Castro's supporters and detractors recognized their tremendous dedication and love for the Cuban people who had a deep and lasting affection for ‘el Comandante.'” For a supposed world leader, this is revisionist history at its worst, and therefore shameful.
Perhaps our prime minister should read the Washington Post, and a piece regarding the 13 facts that, in a just world, would be “etched on Castro's tombstone, and highlighted in every obituary, as a fitting metaphor for someone who used firing squads to murder thousands of their own people.” Among them, Castro turned their island nation into a Communist outpost of the Soviet Union, and almost caused a nuclear conflagration during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. Google it.
They forced almost 20% of their people into exile, leading to thousands losing their lives at sea while trying to make it to the safety of the Florida coast in crude boats.
They sponsored terrorism at every opportunity, and aligned themselves with some of the worst dictators on the planet.
They condoned torture, and executions without trial.
The education system Trudeau lauded was actually a fraud, and was based on indoctrination as opposed to learning.
Castro built prisons at a rate that rivaled Stalin, and filled them to the brim with political prisoners and run-of-the-mill dissenters.
They persecuted gays and attempted to end religion, all while outlawing free enterprise and labour unions.
Yet Justin Trudeau eulogizes Castro as if they were benign, and some harmless old coot who ran out of time at the age of 90.
“I know my father was very proud to call (Castro) a friend, and I had the opportunity to meet Fidel when my father passed away,” Trudeau wrote in their statement.
“On behalf of all Canadians, Sophie and I offer our deepest condolences to family, friends and many, many supporters of Mr. Castro, (and) we join the people of Cuba today in mourning the loss of a remarkable leader.” This is so naïve that it defies credulity, yet these are nonetheless the precise words Trudeau put out.
One suspects that not “all” Canadians are mourning Castro's death, nor remembering them as a “remarkable leader.” If “remarkable” means despotic and murderous then fine.
But that is not the definition Trudeau wants used.
It makes them look like a fool, and justifiably so.

I see Runnable as a very versatile, and therefore powerful, tool. It enables teams to deploy and run code on every commit. The concept sounds simple, but it lights up a vast number of not-so-obvious use cases.
For example, here's how Runnable can be added to an existing revision workflow for static sites / blogs to improve how updates can be made.
Context
Let's say you've picked your favorite static site generator from <a class="link"href="https://www.staticgen.com/">this list</a>, and you've set up your blog / static site and have everything running locally. Now you need to deploy your site somewhere. There are plenty of options including <a class="link"href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>, <a class="link"href="https://surge.sh/">Surge</a>, and <a class="link"href="https://www.firebase.com/docs/hosting/">Firebase Hosting</a>. You're able to manually deploy your site easily enough from your local machine to your favorite provider, or you use continuous integration tools and deploy your site automatically with a flow like this:
Push your content or revisions to the master branch on GitHub CI/CD tools build/generate assets for static site CI/CD tools push assets to your favorite hosting provider
Problem and Solution
This flow works great if you're a single person working on your site. But once you start building your team, adding content writers, and needing multiple changes reviewed, it starts to show its limits pretty quickly. Satisfying these requirements is more challenging.
Here's how Runnable can help keep it simple. Below is a blueprint architecture proposal that enables teams that manage static sites and blogs to work together more efficiently.
Here are the tools you'll need:
Static site generator of your choice
GitHub for hosting your source code and content
Runnable to build and run your site on every branch
CI/CD of your choice to automatically build and deploy site
Hosting provider of your choice
The only addition to this setup is Runnable. Here's how the flow changes:
Create a branch on GitHub and open a PR Edit your content on GitHub. Tools like <a class="link"href="https://prose.io/">Prose.io</a> can make this easier. Open / Share a link running your changes that Runnable adds on the PR page. That link can be sent to anyone for reviewing content, visual regressions, CSS problems or layout issues. Merge the PR with your changes into the master branch. CI/CD tool is triggered to publish new version of your static site to production
Benefits
The obvious benefit to this flow is with unblocking your team to collaborate by providing live instances of their changes as they push them. Using pull requests enables your team to easily view a log of what's changed for every branch. It also enables integration with other tools into the flow. For example, you can integrate a spell checker that will run on every change and mark the PR status to fail if any misspellings were found.
Runnable enables some improvements here:
Automatic live instances of each change on every branch for faster reviews
live instances of each change on every branch for faster reviews Exposing the instance URL on the pull request page for easy access
Restricting access to these live instances for security (not supported by GitHub Pages at the time of this writing)
Downsides
Although this solution is quite sound for publishing content, it does have some downsides. This flow is ultimately enabled by configuring a series of tools, each of which requires some level of understanding on how it operates. As with any other tool, you'd also need to learn how to configure Runnable. For those who use Docker, Runnable automatically imports Dockerfiles from your repository and uses it to build and run your container. (Runnable also has a setup flow for non-Docker users as well.) It goes without saying that a single tool that enabled this flow would be preferred for teams in general.
Conclusion
There are a lot of tools that can enable content creators to collaborate on the static sites in a more scalable way. Composing great tools together allows us to enable new use cases beyond any one's original scope. Although this philosophy is far from original, (think about UNIX philosophy where the real power there is in the composition of simple tools) it can be beneficial and exciting to explore what's possible.
A Model of Secular Stagnation
NBER Working Paper No. 20574
Issued in October 2014
NBER Program(s):Monetary Economics
We propose an overlapping generations New Keynesian model in which a permanent (or very persistent) slump is possible without any self-correcting force to full employment. The trigger for the slump is a deleveraging shock, which creates an oversupply of savings. Other forces that work in the same direction and can both create or exacerbate the problem include a drop in population growth, an increase in income inequality, and a fall in the relative price of investment. Our model sheds light on the long persistence of the Japanese crisis, the Great Depression, and the slow recovery out of the Great Recession. It also highlights several implications for policy.

From north to south and east to west, one thing you will not fail to discover all throughout Brazil on almost every street corner, there are tags, drawings, graffitis and paintings on the walls.
In short, there is something for all tastes, from small to large, black and white to colorful, from amateur to magnificent and from the committed to the purely aesthetic. Within Brazil, street art and street artists are well established… in fact street art is king. Whether the mayor of São Paulo agrees or not (he once tried to destroy artworks and graffiti poised on the walls of the city) This creative and powerful artistic explosion is unstoppable !
Brazilian street art is nowadays one of the most popular means of expression in Brazil. Just like the melting pot of the population, artists express themselves on every available wall. All styles are represented: Figurative, Abstract, Hyper-Realism, Surrealism … All techniques are used, spray can, paint roll, collage, stencils …
São Paulo effortlessly won the title of Brazilian Street art capital. It is known for being one of the most famous cities around the world in terms of Street art. And it's justified! What an explosion of colours on every grey wall of the city. You will find street art on the facades of houses, Garages or entire walls dedicated to this art, such as the Beco do Batman in Vila Madalena.
Rio de Janeiro is also a real Eldorado for street artists. A city that recently decided to support and organize the amazing expression of murals, Even with an environment so attached to its freedom. 130 artists have illustrated nearly 40 kilometers along the Line 2 of the metro, with an artistic theme inspired by each area of the city crossed by the metro. Graffiti is allowed in public places in Rio. However, the street-art Brazilian population, which is underground, often close to anarchism, is in tradition resistant to any desire for external control, especially from a rather unpopular mayor. Many citizens suspect Eduardo Peas strongly would like graffiti to move away from the chic and tourist districts of the South Zone: the emblematic Copacabana and Ipanema.
Here is a selection of 40 of the greatest street artists known in Brazil Whether you walk the streets of Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Paris, Berlin, Rio, Los Angeles, Tokyo, Cape Town … open your eyes! You've recognized their works without realizing that these art masterpieces are from Brazilian artists.
Incredible, creative, monumental or deliberately discreet, committed and varied, Brazilian street art is exceptional. That's why we have made a selection for you of the most creative and talented street artists in Brazil. You will find here a small bio, photos of their artworks and useful links to discover more about them.

Just prior to the release of Patch 5.3-Escalation, I posted some thoughts on what would be selling on the Auction House and some general gold making tips. In this post I thought it would be useful to see how well my predictions panned out and what's been making gold in patch 5.3-Escalation over the past few weeks.
There is normally an increase in Auction House activity across many markets just after a patch and I made sure I had stocks of material sitting in the bank to take advantage of the surge in demand on my server. My main profit came from the following markets:
Alchemy – mainly transmutation and some potions
Jewelcrafting – cut and uncut gems; rings and necks
Enchanting
Engineering
Flipping Cataclysm greens
Best Sellers
Demand for all types of gem was up just after the patch increasing the price and scarcity of Uncommon Pandaren Gems:
Panarian Garnet
Roguestone
Alexandrite
Lapus Lazuli
Sunstone
Tiger Opal
With Pandarian Garnet and Tiger Opal as the best sellers. I sold out of gems very quickly leaving me with a great profit.
Uncut Rare Pandarian Gems
Just prior to Patch 5.3 my Alchemist managed to scour the Auction House for cheap or market price Golden Lotus – around 40-50g per item on my server for general gem transmutation and potion crafting. I must have bought up around 5 stacks. After the patch the demand spiked for this herb and prices soared to 80-100g per item. I made good use of my pre-patch supplies and used them to transmute my remaining Uncommon Pandarian gems to Rare Pandarian gems:
Primordial Ruby
Imperial Amethyst
River's Heart
Sun's Radiance
Wilde Jade
Many of these gems I sold uncut giving me on average a profit margin of 50% to 70%. Some Rare gems I also transmuted to Primal Diamonds which I also sold for a greater profit of around 150% to 180%.
Changes to PVP Resilience
Patch 5.3 made changes to PvP Resilience. I thought this would increase demand for those gems and enchants that increased this attribute. Examples included:
Mystic Sun's Radiance (+160 PvP Resilience)
Stormy River's Heart (+160 PvP resilience)
Vivid Wild Jade (+80 PvP Resilience, +80 PvP Power)
While I had some sales of these gems at above market price, demand was never that great. Instead sales of gem cuts that increased attributes of Intellect, Strength, Stamina and Critical Strike all did better.
It should be noted that I didn't cut any of these gems. Just before the patch I snatched very cheap gem cuts direct from the Auction House at around 15-20g per item and resold them for 100-120g, such was the demand at the time. Now, the the Auction House is once again saturated with cheap cuts of these gems and I have abandoned this market until things have stabilized.
Potions, Elixirs and Flasks
I sold a wide assortment of Potions, Elixirs and Flasks after the patch but my best sellers were:
Potion of Treasure Finding
Potion of Luck
Flask of the Earth
Flask of the Warm Sun
Living Steel
I had anticipated increased in demand for Living Steel and had bought up some below market bars for around 300-350g. I sold out on the first few days for a profit of around 100g a bar.
Enchanting
My Enchanter did a brisk trade but the Enchant Chest – Super Resilience (+200 PvP) didn't sell as expected and prices remained below market. I listed only a few items so nothing lost.
Other best selling scrolls:
Enchant Chest – Glorious Stats
Enchant Boots – Pandaren's Step
Enchant Weapon – Windsong
Just before the patch I invested in some cheap Abyss crystals. These I shattered into:
Infinite Dust
Greater Cosmic Essence.
I sold out of these items very early on after the patch.
Cataclysm Greens
I ‘ve been flipping Cataclysm Greens for a while now. I simply scan the Auction House for Lvl 77-80 greens at around 30-40g and flip them for 300-400g on my server. Trading of these items was brisk after the patch and I sold most of my backlog of inventory held in the bank.
Engineering
My Engineer had been busy before the patch mining Ghost Iron Ore to turn in Ghost Iron Bars for the crafting of the Ghost Iron Dragonling and assorted Tinker's Gears. I crafted about 5 Trinkets and about 50 gears and sold out after a few days.
So there you have it. I hope you had some success making gold with the new patch. Be sure to listen to the Journal of Marcus Podcast where I'll be discussing these and other gold making strategies in Patch 5.3-Escalation.
No issue in Mormonism has made more headlines than the faith's distinctive approach to sex and gender. From its polygamous nineteenth-century past to its twentieth-century stand against the Equal Rights Amendment and its twenty-first-century fight against same-sex marriage, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) has consistently positioned itself on the frontlines of battles over gender-related identities, roles, and rights. But even as the church has maintained a conservative position in public debates over sex and gender, Mormon women have developed their own brand of feminism by recovering the lost histories of female leadership and exploring the empowering potential of Mormon theology.

Even among progressive news sources on the web, most sites will steer clear of 9/11 Truth. Huffington Post won't touch it. CommonDreams will occasionally flirt with the edges of "conspiracy theories"; Truthout has printed attacks on 9/11 Truth . OpEdNews is one of the few places where readers and authors who believe the outline of the Bush Administration's version of the events of 9/11 and those who think the Bush Administration was itself responsible for the attacks can hang out together and hold heated debates. (The Editorial Board here at OEN is also split. For disclosure, I've been the Board member leading the charge for more coverage.)
You may suspect the heavy hand of censorship, or you may think that these well-established liberal sources are sensibly avoiding speculation and superstition. But whatever your beliefs, you'd have to think that the Wall St Journal is the last place you'd look for revelations about a 9/11 cover-up.
The Wall St Journal? I would have thought I'd live to see my country pay reparations to Afghanistan before the WSJ would doubt the Kean Commission. I'd be less surprised if BP were to announce an end to ocean drilling than to see 9/11 Truth on the WSJ web site.

So what do you make of these two articles, published last week and the week before on the Market Watch page of the Journal? I'm flabbergasted.
Both articles report the work of the 9/11 Consensus Panel. The Panel was formed last September on the 10th Anniversary. Panel members are distinguished scholars, but there is no representation of "both sides". (You may take this as evidence that the Panel is working from pre-conceived conclusions, or you may believe that they simply had a hard time finding opposition figures who were willing to work with them.) Highlights of the findings reported at the MarketWatch site:
There is a conflict between The Kean Commission Report and official records of where Sec of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Vice President Dick Cheney were on the morning of September 11.
Scheduled Pentagon "war games" on the morning of the attacks were simulating and practicing for some of the same scenarios that actually came to pass that morning. "Although senior officials claimed no one could have predicted using hijacked planes as weapons, the military had been practicing similar exercises on 9/11 itself -- and for years before it."
The panel also found that "high-temperature incendiaries and explosives were planted throughout the twin towers and the lesser-known 47-story Building 7, also destroyed later the same day." This raises multiple question: Who ordered the buildings to be wired for destruction? What did Larry Silverstein, owner of the WTC complex, know ahead of time? And why did both the Kean Commission and the NIST report ignore the evidence for controlled demolition that was so compellingly obvious to the Consensus Panel?
The larger mystery is why these questions are appearing on a web site controlled by the WSJ. Is this a deliberate leak, the start of an effort gradually to defuse public outrage? (Public opinion polls regulary show that half the country disbelieves the government's account of 9/11 events.) Is it the work of a lone WSJ insider? Readers are encouraged to comment, or better yet, to investigate the origin of these WSJ stories and report results on these OEN pages.
Jennifer Steinhauer is the New York Times reporter who fell so hard for the self-evidently absurd UVA night of broken glass gang rape fantasy clusterfake.
Here's their December 4th NYT article well after the story had already been exploded elsewhere — it's original title is still visible in URL “String of Sexual Assault Cases May Lead to Tipping Point”
Here's Steinhauer's November 24th article: “University of Virginia Officials Vow to Combat Campus Rape Problem.”
And here 's November 21st NYT article: “University of Virginia's Image Suffers After Campus Rape Report.”
And she's still on the UVA beat and, not surprisingly, the NYT still hasn't reported the most humiliating aspects of it being hoaxed, such as ever mentioning the name “Haven Monahan.”
UVA Fraternity Reinstated After Rolling Stone Article on Rape By JENNIFER STEINHAUER JAN. 12, 2015
An article in late November in Rolling Stone described in graphic detail a gang rape alleged to have taken place at the Phi Kappa Psi house at the University of Virginia. Credit Steve Helber/Associated Press The University of Virginia, after receiving guidance from the local police, has reinstated the fraternity at the center of a magazine article that detailed gang rape allegations that later unraveled. “We welcome Phi Kappa Psi, and we look forward to working with all fraternities and sororities in enhancing and promoting a safe environment for all,” Teresa A. Sullivan, the president of the university, said in a statement. In November, an article in Rolling Stone magazine detailed a student's account of a 2012 gang rape at the fraternity, which prompted Ms. Sullivan to suspend all fraternities through the end of the year and to contact the Charlottesville Police Department to request a criminal investigation. The story of the student, identified only as “Jackie,” started to crumble as various people and news organizations began to investigate the veracity of the account, and their friends contested details. Rolling Stone then published a note to readers from Will Dana, the managing editor, stating, “In the face of new information, there now appear to be discrepancies in Jackie's account, and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in them was misplaced.” The Charlottesville police are still investigating the claims and will be for a few weeks, a spokesperson for the department, Capt. Gary Pleasants, said. “We just agreed with UVA that Phi Kappa Psi could be reinstated.” Last week, Ms. Sullivan authorized addenda on alcohol use to the University's Fraternal Organization Agreement that fraternities must sign by mid-month. The addenda ban kegs of beer and pre-made mixes of liquor and punch — often served to young women at parties — at fraternity parties and limits beer to closed cans. Further, at least one fraternity member must be sober at functions, in keeping with a trend on campuses that bystanders play a bigger role in preventing sexual assault.
Somehow, though, that doesn't sound adequate to stop Haven Monahan from doing it again.

We have Witches and Satan on our mind every day here at BMD, but this stuff is especially prominent now with the release of The Witch right around the corner. We're gearing up for the film with a series of articles about Witches and Satan in general. Now, we can argue all night about whether or not Drag Me to Hell's antagonist counts as a witch, but the film sure as shit has a demon AND an evil goat, so I think it counts overall.
Aside from jump scares and scenes that make viewers squirm in their seats for the sheer amount of gore on display, true horror is a hard thing for films to achieve. Laughter comes a tiny bit easier, but that doesn't mean good comedy is something just anyone can do. All of which is why it's so impressive Sam Raimi manages to achieve both in their incredible - and maybe somewhat forgotten - return to horror, Drag Me to Hell.
Rather than discuss the whole film, which is brilliant and deserves all the attention it can get - I prefer to just point out the amazing car fight sequence, which you can watch below:
What strikes me most about this scene is how tense and varied it is. There are bits that are just funny (the stapler attack) and bits that are just scary (Mrs. Ganush's reveal in the back seat), but it's fascinating how beats can often be both funny and scary at the same time. There are many examples to choose from, the most disgusting of which being Mrs. Ganush's gum attack upon Christine's chin. But also think about the unity of comedy and horror just in Ganesh's broken denture fangs. Chilling! Also, kind of hilarious!
Sam Raimi has pulled this sort of thing off before, specifically during parts of Evil Dead II, but not quite as well as they do in this film. This sequence offers the biggest showcase for Drag Me to Hell's special blend of comedy and horror, but it's not even the only example. You still have that talking goat. Or Christine's amazing nosebleed at work. It's wonderful Raimi has been able to work on a wide variety of projects throughout their career. Nevertheless, it's also kind of a bummer we don't get more horror films from him.
But we do have this one and should consider ourselves lucky for that. So if you're looking for a nice, zippy horror film featuring an evil goat to watch before seeing The Witch this weekend, I highly recommend Drag Me to Hell. We need to get this movie back on track toward achieving classic status because it's too good to forget.
Uber
London's High Court ruled Friday that Uber's app is not a fare meter and therefore does not break the law, a significant victory for the ride-hailing service facing legal challenges around the globe.
Uber has long argued its GPS-reliant app isn't the same thing as a "taximeter" that black cabs use to dictate the cost of a journey based on distance and wait time. Only licensed black cab and minicab drivers are permitted to use the meters to calculate fares in Britain's capital.
San Francisco-based Uber has risen to prominence as people have flocked to its service for hailing a car with a smartphone app. Uber has counted more than 1 million registered users in London since mid-2012. However, the company's aggressive expansion into the heavily regulated domain of taxis has generated legal challenges and taxi driver protests across the world.
Transport for London, the city's transportation regulator, brought the case to the High Court in 2014 to ask for clarity. The regulator laid out its own view that Uber's app was not a taximeter but under pressure from the capital's taxi drivers decided to refer the decision to the court.
A taximeter and the smartphone app differ significantly, the court ruled. "A taximeter...is not a device which receives GPS signals in the course of a journey, and forwards GPS data to a server located outside of the vehicle, which calculates a fare...and sends the fare information back to the device," according to the court's decision.
The smartphones used by Uber drivers can calculate fares, the court ruled, but don't actually calculate the fares themselves. It is drivers, not their cars, who are technically "equipped" with the smartphones, the court added.
"This is great news for Londoners and a victory for common sense," Uber's UK general manager, Jo Bertram, said in response to the ruling.
Transport for London said it welcomed the clarity.
"With legal certainty established over taximeters, we will continue to work hard with all of our stakeholders to deliver taxi and private hire services which meet the needs of modern London," Leon Daniels, the regulator's managing director of surface transport, said in a statement.
The Licensed Taxi Driver's Association in London already responded to the ruling and said it has lodged an appeal with the Supreme Court.
London is just one of many cities across the world in which Uber has faced significant opposition and protests from the established taxi trade. The capital, with its strictly regulated black cab industry, has presented its own unique set of challenges to Uber.
Today's ruling is not necessarily the end to Uber's woes in the city, though. Transport for London is currently considering whether there should be a minimum five-minute wait between passengers ordering a car and getting picked up. Other proposals include stricter rules about English language skills and insurance.
More than 133,000 people have signed a petition created by Uber to protest those proposals.
"We know that some ideas put forward for consultation are controversial, which is why we want as many people as possible to tell us what they think to help shape the future of private hire in London," Daniels said.
Bertram said they hope the court's ruling causes Transport for London to "think again on their bureaucratic proposals for apps like Uber. Compulsory five-minute waits and banning ride-sharing would be bad for riders and drivers."
Transport for London and London Mayor Boris Johnson are also seeking to cap the number of private-hire drivers allowed to operate in the capital. The number of drivers has increased from 59,000 in 2009-10 to 89,000 today, and Transport for London predicts the total could rise to 128,000 over the next two years. The government will decide whether to put a cap in place.
Do you lie awake at night wondering who would win an epic battle between strippers vs werewolves? Well worry no more¦ because after watching this film you won't care about anything. We here in The Room love hilariously terrible films. Some films are brilliant and some are brilliantly bad, but sadly Strippers vs Werewolves walks the fine line between the two. It is boring, slow-paced and completely unconvincing.
Luckily for lovers of bad films, there are a few moments of comedy gold. Lines like: We don't want a corpse in here with their eyes out and a particularly persistent erection and I'm going to kill you so slowly, your driving licence is going to expire before you do add some spice to an otherwise bland film experience.
There is also a priceless moment when one werewolf suspects their girlfriend is becoming one too. Unhappy with the idea of a girl joining the boys only club, the chief werewolf says: First sign of fur, cut off their face. Problem solved.
In fairness to the filmmakers, Strippers vs Werewolves is nowhere near as bad as many movies in the B-movie dungeon. It meets basic standards of picture and sound quality and some of the acting is ok (although other parts are awful). It boasts some fairly well-known actors, including Martin Kemp, Robert Englund and Alan Ford, but they probably don't list this one high on their CVs. The vampire hunter who helps the strippers is genuinely funny at times, adding much-needed comic relief.
But in truth the film just isn't worth 90 minutes of your life “ not even for the cameo from page three girl Lucy Pinders. Strippers vs Werewolves took just £38 at the box office, meaning only four people paid to see it. I bet they want their money back.

Know one thing about former Texas Longhorns running back Johnathan Gray — he's a fighter.
After spending more than a year rehabilitating a second torn Achilles tendon, Gray earned an invite to a rookie tryout at a New York Giants mini-camp.
Gray earned at least a nod from the Giants after testing well at the Texas Pro Day in March, their first opportunity to do so publicly since they suffered the tear preparing for the NFL Draft in early 2016. In late March, Gray ran a 40-yard dash in the mid 4.5s and registered a 36-inch vertical leap.
Credit Gray's persistency and the help of a former Longhorns running back who suffered through their own injuries at Texas — Jeremy Hills, who now runs a training facility in Austin.
During that stretch, Gray had to scrape together an existence from a number of different sources.
“Training, training kids, high school kids, college kids,” Gray said of their efforts over the last year. “Doing coaching out in Westlake. Anything to keep the bills paid, and just training myself to get back to my Pro Day and get back in the flow of football. I miss it, so it feels great to come out here in front of all the scouts and show what I can do and hopefully keep it going forward in the future of football.”
Though things continue to move forward, the record-setting back out of Aledo still has a tough journey ahead of themselves in their quest to make an NFL roster, as he'll compete with eight other invitees at the tryout.
Whatever happens at that point probably matters less to Gray than how far he's made it already — like David Ash, Gray surely doesn't want their giant following them over the coming years.
“It's overwhelming. It's relief. It's happy,” Gray said. “But really, it's time to go to work. I know my parents are happy that their son is on the verge of a job.”
THR is reporting that RLJ Entertainment has acquired the for U.S. rights to Brendan Muldowney's new historical epic Pilgrimage, in a seven-figure deal ahead of the European Film Market this week.
The film is set in Ireland in 1209 and sees a small group of monks begins a reluctant pilgrimage across an island torn between centuries of tribal warfare and the growing power of Norman invaders. Escorting their monastery's holiest relic to Rome, the monks' progress is seen through the eyes of a pious young novice and a mute lay-brother with a violent past. As the true material, political and religious significance of the bejewelled relic becomes dangerously apparent, their path to the east coast becomes increasingly fraught with danger. The monks belatedly realise that in this wild land of ancient superstitions, the faith that binds them together may ultimately lead to their destruction.
Muldowney has gathered an extraordinary cast of Irish and international stars, led by the new Spider-Man Tom Holland as a novice monk.  They are joined by The Hobbit‘s Richard Armitage as a misanthropic knight and Walking Dead and Punisher star Jon Berthal as a mute brother with a violent past. Local talent includes John Lynch (The Fall), Hugh O'Conor (The Stag), Ruaidhri Conroy (Jack Taylor), Tristan McConnell (Vikings), and Lochlann O'Mearain (Poison Pen).
The film was written by Jamie Hannigan, with Muldowney's Love Eternal cinematographer Tom Comerford returning to work with the director once again. It is an Irish/Belgian co-production with Conor Barry and John Keville of Dublin-based Savage Productions and Benoit Roland of Wrong Men North as producers. Financing comes from the Irish Film Board Fís Éireann/Screen Ireland (FÉ/SI) is the national development agency for Irish filmmaking and the Irish film, television and animation industry., Creative Europe, Broadcasting Authority Of Ireland, Wallimages, and the Wallonia Cultural Fund. XYZ Films is executive producing and brokered the deal with RLJ.
Commenting on the news RLJ's chief acquisitions officer Mark Ward said:
This is the kind of elevated genre film that action fans across the country have been waiting to see. With a stellar cast led by Jon, Richard and Tom, we are very excited to bring this film to theaters nationwide.

Ask Yourself...
Do you often wonder what the big deal with sex is?
Have you never really liked anyone "in that way"?
Do you never (or very rarely) think people are "hot" or "sexy"?
Do you ever pretend to find someone attractive in order to fit in?
Is sex boring for you?
Have you had relationship after relationship fall apart because you simply weren't interested in sex?
Have you tried things to "spice it up", but never found anything that worked?
Does it seem like people are speaking a foreign language when they talk about sex?
Have you ever wondered what's supposed to be so difficult about abstinence or celibacy?
Do sex scenes in movies or books often seem forced, out of place, or completely unnecessary?
Have you ever thought that you had to be straight "by default", because even though you're not all that interested in people of a different gender, you're certain you're not interested in people of your gender?
Have you not had sex for months or years, possibly never at all, and it doesn't bother you one bit?
Do you ever feel like you just don't "get" sex?
If you answered "yes" to some or all of these questions, you might be asexual.

No, that headline was no joke, this latest Diadora N.9000 really is inspired by an albino gorilla. Let us explain. Japan's X-LARGE and Spanish sneaker shop 24Kilates team up with Diadora for the collaboration, which combines the Japanese streetwear brand's gorilla logo with the fact that Italy was home to the world's only known albino gorilla, Copito, who lived at the Barcelona zoo from 1996 until their death in 2003.
The “Copito” N.9000 features a colorway inspired by the famous gorilla's white fur and pink body, built in premium suede, nubuck, kangaroo leather, reflective 3M detailing, and pony hair on the heels. The shoe will release December 17th at the X-LARGE Store in Harajuku, Tokyo, at 24Kilates (Barcelona, Madrid and Bangkok) and at Ubiq's new location in Washington, D.C. X-LARGE apparel made for the collaboration will also be sold at all release locations.
Paved With Good Intentions, Jared Taylor, Carroll & Graf, 1992, 403 pp.
Paved With Good Intentions, by Jared Taylor, is the most relentless, devastating assault on conventional thinking about American race relations available anywhere. In one meticulously researched chapter after another, it blows to bits all the orthodoxies that govern what is publicly said about black/white relations. It is a triumph of clear thinking over cant, and if it is not killed with silence by horrified editors and reviewers, it could force our country to face some of the ugly realities we seem determined to ignore.
The thesis of this book is that American race relations have been poisoned by rigid thinking that makes progress impossible. Unwritten law requires that all racial problems be analyzed in the following terms: (1) Blacks are failing. (2) White racism — and nothing else — makes them fail. (3) Therefore solutions must be the exclusive responsibility of whites.
Mr. Taylor agrees with the first of these propositions. They have assembled what may well be the most comprehensive account anywhere of just how miserably American blacks are failing. Their book is a virtual encyclopedia of failure: crime rates, illegitimacy rates, incarceration rates, poverty rates, drop out rates, AIDS infection rates, syphilis infection rates — all are woven into the narrative with a cumulative effect that would be brutal were it not so rigorously factual.
As for the second proposition, Mr. Taylor marshals a persuasive body of evidence to disprove it. Their main technique is to cite research on selected groups of blacks and whites that are largely indistinguishable except by race. Apparently, dozens of studies have shown that American society treats blacks and whites similarly — so long as the blacks and whites really are similar. Thus, blacks with PhDs from top universities make as much as or more money than whites with equivalent PhDs. Whites with two felony convictions are just as likely as blacks to get long jail sentences on the third conviction. I was surprised to learn that so much work of this kind has been done; obviously the press does not publicize it.
Chorus of Accusations
Mr. Taylor points out that despite this eye-opening evidence, the notion that whites are responsible for every black misfortune is so ingrained that whenever any black/white disparity comes to light, a chorus of voices rises to accuse whites of racism. For example, when it was found that blacks are less likely than whites to get kidney transplants, newspapers across the country wrung their hands over “hospital racism.” Mr. Taylor patiently points out that the overwhelming majority of people willing to give up their organs after death are white and many blacks cannot accept white organs. Usually the best donor is a close relative, but healthy relatives of blacks are only one sixth as likely to donate a kidney as are white relatives.
If anything, “racism” runs the other way. Many blacks refuse to give up their organs for fear they might be given to whites. Whites show no such hesitation. Even at Howard University hospital, 80 percent of the organs are donated by whites. This is just one of many cases in which Mr. Taylor takes what is called white racism, turns it on its head, and shows that racial hatred actually runs the other way.
“Hate crimes” are another example. Whenever a white attacks a black for racial reasons, the media don their ritual sack cloth, and describe the crime as proof that white society is seething with hatred for blacks. In fact, as Mr. Taylor reports in grim detail, blacks are many times more likely to make blatantly racial attacks on whites than the reverse, but the media avert their eyes.
Constant talk of white racism has dangerous consequences. Although the conventional view is that America “teaches blacks to hate themselves,” constant harping on white wickedness teaches them to hate whites. Liberals seem to think that blacks will love them if they keep telling blacks how awful white people are. They are then astonished at black venom, and must cast about for yet more excuses for it.
This book is packed with information and ideas that are almost never printed. Mr. Taylor explains the faulty logic and bad law that have turned civil rights into government-mandated discrimination against whites. They analyze the anti-white slant that runs through government and major news organizations and chronicles the rising tide of white resentment. There is an analysis of Asian successes in American society that makes black complaints about “racism” ring especially hollow. Indeed, while claiming to face discrimination at every turn, blacks are vicious in their persecution of Asians.
A chapter on double standards shows how blacks glory in racial solidarity but whites are made to feel ashamed of being white. In fact, whites are taught to dismantle any consciousness of their own race and to work for the benefit of other races. As a result, many blacks, and even a dismaying number of whites, follow a simple principle: If it's good for blacks or bad for whites, it's good — otherwise it's bad.
The Underclass
The latter part of the book is a gruesome picture of the black underclass. Readers had better have strong stomachs. They will learn about crack mothers who barter off their toddlers to perverts who use them as sex toys, about public schools where the curtains stay closed so children will not look out the windows and see addicts copulating, about libraries in which prostitutes ply their trade, about day care centers where three-year-olds are taught to hit the floor when shots ring out.
The introduction to this book promises “solutions,” but by the time I got to them, I had been dragged through so much squalor and sordidness that I half-expected a sober discussion of neutron bombs. Actually, Mr. Taylor's solutions are much better.
Yet more unheralded studies and common sense, too — suggest that just about everything that is wrong with the underclass stems from the collapse of the ancient strictures that kept people from having children they could not support. Mr. Taylor argues relentlessly that a black illegitimacy rate of 70 percent is not only at the heart of the underclass' collapse but that welfare makes things worse:
Sex is fun. Babies are cute. Women want to be mothers. This is perfectly natural, and when there is no middle-class morality — or wolf at the door — to stand in nature's way, babies are the inevitable result. Welfare payments are the comfortable safety net into which the single mother lands when they walk off the edge of middle-class morality.
Mr. Taylor is not, however, another Dan Quayle, calling pathetically for “family values.” Much as they approve of traditional ethics, they have no illusions that exhortation will bring them back. After an elegant, libertarian attack on the very principles of welfare — they call it “obligatory charity” — Mr. Taylor calls for its complete abolition.
Short of that, since they know that America will stop short of that, they urge that all welfare recipients be given Norplant, a recently developed implantable contraceptive that prevents pregnancy for up to five years. They even recommend that some ghetto high schools start implant programs. They would rather end “obligatory charity” than start “obligatory contraception,” but they make only a moral case for the former, and a practical case for the latter. There have already been a few calls for Norplant for welfare mothers, and this book could give the idea a big boost.
Every Myth But One
In my view, this book suffers from one defect that may be unavoidable. Despite its boldness in all other respects, this book is bashful about racial differences. At one point, in a discussion of why whites so readily submit to accusations of racism they know to be false, Mr. Taylor says this:
If whites are not holding blacks down, it might mean that they [blacks] have risen as far as their inherent limitations permit. The possibility of black inferiority is the unacknowledged goblin that lurks in the background of every attempt to explain black failure. Part of the shrillness with which white racism is denounced stems from the belief that any letup in the struggle against it might leave room for a theory that is too dangerous to be contemplated.
This is either too much or too little. I detect the odor of compromise, either with the publisher or with Mr. Taylor's own amply demonstrated willingness to put all things under their microscope, even ideas “too dangerous to be contemplated.”
This said, it is nothing short of astonishing that something like Paved With Good Intentions — complete with 1,339 footnotes — has been written. It is even more astonishing that this book is being brought out by a mainstream publishing house. There will be as much fascination in following the commercial and critical fortunes of this book as in reading it.

(CBS News) Meghan Vogel was quite emotional after their surprising win in the 1,600 meters finals of the Division III state track meet at Ohio State's Jesse Owens Stadium.
But the junior from West Liberty-Salem High School saved their most inspiring performance for when they finished in last place in another event.
As the Springfield News-Sun reported, Vogel was competing in the 3,200-meters final when cramps knocked rival Arden McMath to the ground just 20 feet from the finish line. Instead of running by her, Vogel stopped and helped the Arlington High School sophomore to their feet, then practically carried them to the finish. Out of 15 racers, McMath was given 14th place and Vogel 15th place.
As you can see in the video, the crowd gave a rousing ovation to the athletes as they crossed the finish line together.
"Helping them across the finish line was a lot more satisfying than winning the state championship," Vogel told the News-Sun.
"What a selfless act," Arlington coach Paul Hunter told the newspaper. "She could have just gone around Arden. But they chose to help. I've never seen that at a state meet. That's real sportsmanship."
In the Billboard Hot 100 chart, the currently most popular song listed is “Sorry” by Justin Bieber. I don't know what it's about, but I'm sure there's some oooo's and aaaaaa's in the lyrics with lines like “Girl, I let you down” and something about “Hearts being true.” And I'm sure that if there's a music video, it'll feature lots of people looking deep in thought while staring out into the ocean, or buckets of water falling on their heads in slow motion accompanied by lots of perfectly chiselled bodies that don't exist in any world that I know.
However in the Palestinian world, the Hot 100 chart is a little different, because the current top hit over there is a song called “Lovers of Stabbing” by Gaza band Al-Gorbaa. This song was inspired by Mohammed Ali al-Miqdad, who was shot dead as they attempted to stab Israeli security forces. And with lines like “O Mohammed, commando of the knives” it's a real sing-along for the whole family. Their music videos also differ somewhat from the half-naked people with water on their heads. In these, the mother of Mohammed is seen dancing on a car and singing along during a funeral procession. Just another proud mother.
Of course, that's not the only song. Other popular titles have the crowd favourite “Stab the Zionist” and “Fill the Bottle with Fire” for those winter chills. Some of them have even been reportedly found on youtube with upwards of 5 million views! And along with each song is a video showing the moment the great Palestinian heroes carry out the heroic act of stabbing innocent people to death or ramming their car into a helpless crowd.
Many of the songs are also about “protecting” the Al-Aqsa mosque from the evil Jews. And no, they don't just come from Hamas affiliated singers – it's Fatah too – the organisation that Mahmoud “Mr Moderate” Abbas leads.
Quick recap: Hamas is really really really bad, but Fatah is only really really bad – so therefore Fatah and the Palestinian Authority are moderate and therefore good guys.
One of the songs played is called “Raise your weapon” and with lyrics such as “Drown them in a sea of blood, kill them as you wish”, it's sure to get those legs tapping and those heads bopping! I wonder if Mr Abbas helped with the lyrics… I mean with choice lines of their own like, “We bless every drop of blood that has been spilled for Jerusalem,” and “We won't allow their filthy feet to desecrate the Temple Mount”, they have certainly shown to have the writer's flair in him.
But of course these songs can by no means be called incitement, as per the logic of the ole 70s rocker Ban “Mr Secretary” Ki-Moon, whose favourite song, “It's only natural” by Crowded House remains at the top of their list. Instead, they're just… you know… forms of artistic expression that should be celebrated and nurtured.
The real incitement is, of course, Israeli songs like Halleluya which sings of nature and trees and love and sunshine, and songs like Shir La Shalom which sings about peace. And to those Palestinians who celebrate murder and pain, nothing can be more provocative than that!
A German neo-Nazi politician who crashed their car into a tree was rescued by passing Syrian refugees, German media has reported on Tuesday.
Stefan Jagsch, 29, a member of the National Democratic Party, was badly injured in the crash last week, local newspapers and national news agency DPA said.
The first responders were two Syrian asylum seekers from a passing minibus that stopped at the crash site near the town of Buedingen in the central state of Hesse.
They pulled Jagsch from the wrecked car and gave them first aid, a spokesperson for the local fire brigade told DPA, confirming witness reports from last Wednesday.
Stefan Jagsch
Buedingen hosts one of many new refugee shelters set up across Germany since more than one million asylum seekers from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere arrived in Europe's top economy last year.
The record influx has sparked a xenophobic backlash from which far-right parties, including the NPD, have benefited.
The party scored 10 percent of the vote in 6 March municipal elections in Buedingen and in nearby Altenstadt, where Jagsch was the NPD's main candidate.
The NPD's Hesse state chief Jean Christoph Fiedler called the rescue effort "apparently a very good, humane act," adding that Jagsch themselves could not clearly remember the accident, the Frankfurter Rundschau daily reported.
Germany's constitutional court is currently considering a parliamentary request to ban Jagsch's party, which Chancellor Angela Merkel's office has labelled an "anti-democratic, xenophobic, anti-Semitic and anti-constitutional party".
"Now the foreigners are even taking away our first aid," quipped one user on Facebook, while another commented that "destiny has a sense of humour".
The Kronach Lorin was a small ramjet engine, for aircraft propulsion, that was statically tested in Vienna during the later stages of World War II. It was intended to be used in the German interceptor planes Lippisch P.13a and Lippisch P.13b.
It was initially proposed that a wire-mesh basket holding coal be mounted behind a nose air intake, protruding slightly into the airflow and ignited by a gas burner. Following wind-tunnel testing of the ramjet and the coal basket, modifications were incorporated to provide more efficient combustion. The coal was to take the form of 135–180 kg (300–400 lb) of small granules instead of irregular lumps, to produce a controlled and even burn, and the basket was altered to a mesh drum revolving on a vertical axis at 60 rpm. A jet of flame from tanks of bottled gas would fire into the basket once the P.13a had reached operating speed (above 320 km/h), whether by using a RATO unit or being towed. The air passing through the ramjet would take the gases from the burning coal towards the rear where they would mix under high pressure with clean air taken from a separate intake. The resulting mixture of gas would then be directed out through a rear nozzle to provide thrust. A burner and drum were built and tested successfully in Vienna by the design team before the end of the war. The theoretical flight time was 45 minutes.
Tested as a concept but never used in flight, the original idea was to produce an engine that could overcome fuel shortages and disruption, supplies of conventional fuels being in very short supply towards the end of World War 2.

How do you prepare a product to meet the demands of a rapidly growing user base? Meet someone who knows.
Alan Garfield is a busy man. Not only do they need to figure out how to keep Learnosity's performance both speedy and secure, they have to do so while the system delivers 46 million tests and responds to 200 million API requests – per month.
And things are only gathering steam. With back-to-school season now upon us, the company's director of infrastructure needs to prepare for more users and even greater test load. To find out how they keep the system ahead of the curve, we asked them about the many spinning plates they maintain, along with the benefits of adopting an “infrastructure as code” approach on the job.
Striking a Balance
What are the some of the major obstacles of scaling a product to such a degree?
When it comes to infrastructure, the main obstacles aren't necessarily technical in nature. With cloud computing, anyone these days can go “fast” if they're prepared to pony up the dollars. Even poorly written applications can somewhat scale if you're prepared to pay for the horsepower to push the dog up the hill.
The real skill is balancing the right technology in the applications, the appropriate design criteria to meet the requirements of the clients, and to be as efficient as possible with the resources available at your budget level.
The only place where throwing money at the problem doesn't work is reliability. Eventually, a poorly architected and inefficient application will fail.
What are some of the more general challenges the tech teams face and how do they approach them?
Keeping the systems secure and safe is probably one of our largest challenges. As we grow and integrate more features, keeping our customer data safe and secure is a top priority. With security baked in from inception to deployment through solid network architecture; proven technology built into the operating systems; testing and adopting the latest techniques into our applications; constant communication between our teams; and the security resources available on the internet, we work very hard to maintain our defenses.
We regularly organize third-party companies to come and perform penetration tests and security assessments of our systems and code. We also run security workshops internally to help educate staff and share knowledge on the challenges we face and how to avoid them during development.
Probably the next challenge would be the scale of our client data. The amount of data we process daily can be a heavy weight to lift. With many sources of data all feeding into our systems it can be a challenge to find new ways to get performance and quality results from an ever-growing pool of data. It's something we also work very hard at, and we hope our customers can see the results in their products.
Here Comes the Technical Bit
We recently migrated to CentOS. What was the reasoning behind this?
We moved to CentOS to solve some annoying package management issues. The two OS's are basically the same at their core, but the package management of each is completely different. Ubuntu uses “apt” packages and CentOS uses “RPM”. They are functionally similar but the coordination and governance of them outside of the OS's are quite different.
For example, keeping an apt mirror to control the versions of our dependent packages required an investment in storage well above that of RPM. Maintaining “aptly” was a cost in administration we wanted to remove.
Another advantage in the migration was that we gained a bunch of security features like SELinux, which increases the inherent security of our systems by defining strict rules as to what resources an application can access.
What about the move to Nginx and PHP-FPM?
We moved from Apache to Nginx/PHP-FPM for two reasons. Firstly, Apache uses a thing called mod_php. Each client request to Apache would create a “process” for each client. In that same process, Apache would always create a PHP handler too. This means you have a one-to-one mapping of requests to PHP interpreters.
Now this sounds ok, but as you scale up this stuff becomes very inefficient. For example, static file requests such as images will have a PHP interpreter chew up resources (e.g. memory) for zero use in that request. If you're serving a lot of static file requests this can be extremely inefficient (and really you should have a good CDN in front of your servers anyway). However, the PHP interpreter is basically always created whether it's needed or not.
Second, with this one-to-one mapping of requests to server resources, you now have an upper limit on the number of requests you can handle at once (e.g. bursts). The amount of memory used to create all these PHP resources has reduced the amount available to you and now you're no longer using memory efficiently.
Using Nginx and PHP-FPM as an alternative breaks the bond between the “request” and the “processing” of the PHP. Nginx accepts the requests. If it's a static file request it can handle that itself without needing the resources required for PHP. If the request is for PHP, Nginx can pass this request onto PHP-FPM for processing. PHP-FPM works as a pool of “handlers”. They don't need to be created each time; they are reused and kept in a shared pool. This means for a given number of incoming requests there are fewer PHP “handlers” required to handle the given PHP application load.
There are also other benefits with this decoupling. Say, for example, you have 500 clients all hitting Apache with a similar request that requires database access. Because of the one-to-one nature, you now have 500 database connections to your databases. With Nginx/PHP-FPM these same 500 clients all connect via Nginx; however, because of this decoupling of PHP-FPM, these same requests can be handled with about one-tenth of the memory resources and about one-fiftieth of the number of database connections.
Insights On Infrastructure
Given the scale at which Learnosity is used, there's an amazingly high uptime rate. How do we plan for and measure such success?
I think our uptime is directly related to the fact we've optimized our system so that there are minimal single points of failure (SPOF) and our infrastructure is as “immutable” as possible right now. Having quality scaling solutions with fault tolerance built-in allows the systems to heal themselves and recover without much human intervention. Other reasons for our high uptime is our ability to shift our load around any issues that may occur and fail gracefully when we can't!
What other goals do we have for infrastructure? What do we want to enable the system to scale to?
One goal is maximum throughput and reliability for the lowest cost while maintaining the highest resource efficiency possible.
Our applications have been tested at a scale far beyond our peak load, and in that testing, the biggest bottleneck is where the data has to be stored at rest (e.g., databases, disks, etc.). We use in-memory caching to alleviate this issue. However, any significant growth eventually becomes a data storage problem, no matter what you do. We have data sharding in our database infrastructure to help deal with this by splitting this load, but there are still upper limits. When the administration of the data storage starts to outweigh the cost of reworking the technology, you start looking at other techniques like early request load splitting and compartmentalizing clients into isolated silos.
What's the best piece of advice you have for designing for redundancy?
Removing all single points of failure is key. This can include staff too.
Scaling isn't actually that hard, but doing so within a budget in terms of time and money is the real trick. Rockstar staff with the knowledge locked in their heads don't scale well either. By using infrastructure as code techniques you can tease this knowledge into the provisioning systems and so rely less on the rock stars to handle the day-to-day running of the system. The rock stars are probably better used moving the infrastructure forward in terms of future directions anyway. The day-to-day should be boring and uneventful. Rock stars should hate boring!
Can you tell us more about the “infrastructure as code approach” at Learnosity? How does it help improve our service?
Infrastructure as code is an idea where no single thing is manually created. This is like setting a template for the systems. The template can be reused without needing explicit documentation or skills in terms of staff to achieve the same results. It's basically the blueprint for how to build a “Learnosity”.
I'll to explain this by using a coin making analogy. A skilled craftsperson could create a coin from raw materials using hand tools. Their or their work would be unique and hard to replicate. If the coin got damaged or lost there would be a considerable effort in either repairing or replacing it. As with pretty much any company starting out, Learnosity will have systems that are quite similar to this. A core team of individuals will create and configure custom systems to get the product out the door and each system will be handcrafted to fit whatever purpose the business needs at that particular time.
Now, say you used a coin press instead of by hand, and you fixed your design into the pressing plates. You can now theoretically create as many coins as you'd like given the raw materials required while expending considerably less effort. Each coin is basically identical. Their value is fixed and equal. They are completely interchangeable. If you lose one down a drain or it's damaged, you can simply replace it with another and move on.
The idea is that the infrastructure's value isn't in its creation. Instead, the value derives from the tasks it performs and how easily those tasks can be shared. Learnosity grew from the original custom-built systems to an “immutable” infrastructure. Starting out, nobody could invest the time and effort into this type of automation. You're basically racing the clock to prove your business to the world. However, once your business is established, you are then racing another clock to innovate and adapt to change. Neither of these is possible if your teams are still handcrafting coins to replace old ones each day.

One thing we're extremely good at in Learnosity is quickly adopting new technology and shifting infrastructure if we consider something to be better. Nothing is fixed in stone and all ideas will be considered, even if it means it'll require a lot of effort to make a switch.
We also make a point of attending several conferences every year including AWS re:Invent which really spurs us on when we see new AWS products and sparks conversations and ideas for the future.
Why do you like working at Learnosity – and in the Infrastructure team specifically?
When I joined Learnosity I was charged with bringing our systems to a level of scale that Mark and Gavin [Learnosity's co-founders] knew was needed but hadn't yet achieved. My contemporaries had gotten Learnosity into AWS and had given Learnosity their first level of scale. However, the infrastructure was brittle, weak, and prone to fault.
Mark trusted me five years ago with refitting and replacing our infrastructure with something I felt would accomplish our goals. The work we've completed in that time, and the challenges we've overcome, is a big part of the reason I work for Learnosity. Taking something raw and unrefined and directly reforming it into a system that can handle the load we currently see is something that gets me out of bed in the morning – and sometimes really early morning!
I work in infrastructure because we are the pointy end of the stick; we are where the rubber meets the road, so to speak. Our clients base their businesses on our technology so our systems play a big part in not only Learnosity's future but also in that of our clients too. Our performance is their performance, so it's our job to do everything we can to make the “hard stuff” easy for them.

President Vladimir V. Putin, who was traveling to a meeting of gas exporters in Iran, did not immediately comment. They were unlikely to take kindly to Ukraine disrupting life for all of Crimea, however, given that they have made its absorption into Russia something of a personal project.
Sergei V. Aksyonov, the Kremlin-appointed prime minister of the Crimean Republic, was more exercised, calling the power cutoff “a terrorist act” in a statement on Monday.
“I would urge Crimeans to be patient and to see what our situation is,” Mr. Aksyonov said. “Nobody will be allowed to blackmail us in order to solve any issues.”
Ukraine still claims the peninsula, and its senior officials have been perturbed that its seizure by Russia has seemingly dropped off the international agenda, rating a fleeting mention at best whenever the crisis over fighting in southeastern Ukraine is discussed.
The issue of supplies coming from Ukraine has been a repeated source of tension, as food, water and electricity still flow from the mainland to the peninsula. A major irrigation canal was shut down in 2014, but significant rainfall and other local sources prevented serious damage to crop this year. In September, Tatar and other activists tried to blockade the main road leading from Crimea to Ukraine, disrupting food supplies.
Crimea's only other surface link to the outside world is a ferry line to Russia, with limited capacity. Russia plans to build an enormous bridge, but that would not be completed for at least three years.
It was not immediately clear who destroyed the main electric pylons on Friday and Sunday, but the blasted away stump of at least one near the demonstrators was wrapped in the distinctive Crimean Tatar flag, blue with a yellow trident in the upper left-hand corner.
This is one of the first sermons John Piper ever preached and is the oldest one on our site. They preached this message from Ephesians 1 as a 25-year-old seminary student at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California.
One of the greatest blessings of speaking in chapel is standing on this side of that kind of singing. It's really beautiful. Since my sermon has to do with praise, it's very encouraging. Maybe if it doesn't do what it's supposed to do, it's already been done. Thank you, Dr. Schaper, for the opportunity to speak. I'm glad you trust me.
My text comes from Ephesians 1:6 if you'd like to look at it in your Bibles. We'll look at just one phrase in that verse but I'll read from verse 3 so we can see it in context:
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, 4 even as they chose us in them before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him. 5 They destined us in love to be their sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of their will, 6 to the praise of their glorious grace…” (RSV)
And that's my text, the last phrase: “to the praise of the glory of their grace.” Paul tells us the why of our Christian existence with that phase. Why were we born anew? To what end have we been adopted into the divine family? Recreated? Given an inheritance undefiled? To the end that the glory of God's grace might be praised. To me, this is—in the treasure chest of revelation—one of the most beautiful diamonds I've found and I don't know how to improve on it except to read it. Maybe if I can hold this jewel up and in the light of the Holy Spirit and turn it just a little bit, you'll be able to see some new brilliance in it. Some new appreciation. There are many, many beautiful facets to this truth. I think this truth—that we are redeemed to praise the glory of God's grace—is the overture, recurring theme, and finale of God's great musical of creation and redemption. God's cosmic oratorio is going to end with the Hallelujah Chorus. And on the Day of the Lord, it's going to be so loud that if we listen carefully, we can already hear it. With the ear of faith, that chorus comes crashing back into 1971 saying, “Join in because this is why you were redeemed.” To put it in Dr. Ladd's language, even the repertoire of the eschaton has broken into the present.
The Power to Praise: A Present Reality
The power to praise is a present reality. Now if it's a present reality then we ought to do it since it's the end for which we were created and we have the power to do it. That's the question to ask. For some of us, it's very hard to praise. For some of us, our stance of life is just not such that we overflow with gratitude and praise to God. But I think on the authority of God's Word I can say: this ought not to be so. We ought not to be satisfied when we do not praise. If we were created and redeemed to the praise of the glory of the grace of God, then not to be praising is to stand ourselves in opposition to God's purposes in redemption.
Now, that doesn't help much because here we are and we don't feel like praising, maybe. What do we do? Well, the first thing we do is realize that it's not the new man in us, it's not the new creation, it's not the Holy Spirit who doesn't want to sing out. It's the old man. The old man can't carry a tune in a bucket and they don't want anybody else to either. He's so weak and beggarly, they can't even make a joyful noise. The only thing that crotchety old man is good for is to go off in a corner over there and grumble about Christians who seem so enthused all the time.
What should we do if we realize that? Well, this might be the most important point of my sermon; perhaps I should have put it at the end. We should put our eyes on Jesus, the author and finisher of our salvation and then the Holy Spirit is going to take a great big barrel of LG fertilizer (that's the Love of God fertilizer) and according to Romans 5:5, he's going to just dump it all over and just smother our hearts with the love of God. And then he's going to commence to toiling and tilling the soil of our soul until some of the most beautiful, luscious, sweet, the plumpest fruit you ever tasted grows up. And some of that fruit is going to be joy and we're going to sing out. You won't be able to help it. We're going to praise the glory of God's grace. So the power of praise is a present reality and we ought to be about it. But you already are and that's what gave me such great pleasure at the beginning of this chapel service.
The Object of Praise: God's Glorious Grace
Now let's look at the object of this praise that Paul mentions. The specific object we're supposed to zero in on according to Ephesians 6 is the praise of what? We are foreordained to be sons through Christ “to the praise of their glorious grace.” In other words, we are redeemed to praise that in God which makes them a Redeemer. “His glorious grace.” But now on this point I really need help.
As I was sitting there yesterday trying to think of what would help me get on the inside of this and feel afresh what this glorious grace is, I asked, “Is there a human analogy? Where can I find a human reflection of grace and is there glory in it?” Then a song came back to me from a long time ago. Some of you will remember it: “Big Bad John” told the story of a big, bad man named John who worked in a mine. One day there was cave-in deep down in the mine and Big Bad John put their big, bad body against the breaking beam and all the other miners got right out while Big Bad John was holding the beam. All those other miners who used to go around calling them Big Bad John got out. Then the cave fell down and crushed Big Bad John.
Now that's a picture of grace—a very, very imperfect picture—but a picture, and I need pictures to help me see grace. The last line of that song says they put a monument over that cave that said, “At the bottom of this mine, lies a big, big man”. What they obviously meant was: here lies a big, beautiful, glorious man who did a beautiful, gracious, glorious, praiseworthy thing. Even the man outside Christ can see that there is glory in grace and sometimes they put us to shame maybe because they couldn't stop talking about it and they put up a monument to it and a guy comes along and writes a song to extol the glories of Big Bad John and their gracious deed. And it's so good that I couldn't forget it over all these years and it came back to me when I was trying to think about grace.
Now let's take that analogy and lift it about ten-trillion-zillion miles into eternity and look at God's grace. Once upon a time, God built themselves a mine full of jewels and they put man in it and they said, “Man, you dig out my jewels and you enjoy them.” Somewhere along the line, way back in the deep, black recesses of time, a cave-in started. And it spread and God looked down in mercy and said, “I've got to down there and save those miners.” And they did; they came down and they put their big, broad back against the breaking beam of that mine and they commenced to getting miners out of there. Some came happily and some came kicking and screaming as they threw them out into the freedom of light.
Meanwhile, back in the recess of that mine, there were a bunch of renegade miners, plotting mischief against God and God knew it. God knows everything but they were about the business of grace and they didn't have time to mess with those renegade miners right then. So they chose from among them, a puny, teeny little ass of a man named Judas and they came running out of there and knocked God's feet right out from under him. The whole mine came down and killed God and everybody left in the mine.
Now that's grace, because God saw them coming and it's a million times more glorious than the Big Bad John ballad because God is infinitely more glorious than all those miners they died to save.
So here we are, with grime on our faces, sitting around the rubble of that mine and there's Jesus—the resurrected Jesus—standing on the rubble. What do you suppose we're going to say? We're going to say, if we have any sense at all, “O Lord, all praise to the glory of your grace.” And perhaps we stop right there and go have coffee. That's all there is to say.
But, maybe I can turn the diamond one more time; maybe two more times. We ought to be satisfied with that. When we've praised God, we've done all there is to do. We've done the very best thing and we ought to be satisfied right there. If you aren't satisfied with two ringers in playing horseshoes, you might as well give up the game. You'll be frustrated all your life.
But now there are some facets in this diamond on the bottom side—the side that touches the earth. Two practical things—beautiful things—I'd like to point out by just turning it for you.
Our Praise as the Means to Others' Praise
First, I learned from Psalm 40:3 but I'm going to read the first three verses so we can see it all together:
I waited patiently for the Lord;
they inclined to me and heard my cry.
2He drew me up from the pit of destruction,
out of the miry bog,
and set my feet upon a rock,
making my steps secure.
3He put a new song in my mouth,
a song of praise to our God.
Many will see and fear,
and put their trust in the Lord.
When God puts a song of praise in your heart, “many will see and fear, and put their trust in the Lord.” That's fantastic! It's amazing! If we're frustrated because we're not having the impact we thought we ought to be having on the world around us — on those few people around us — could it be we've lost a praising heart? And then ought we not to pray with David, “Restore to me the joy of my salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit. Then I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will return to you” [Psalm 51:12–13]. When our praising ceases, the effectiveness of our ministry is going to cease, I believe, on the basis of these texts. Isn't it beautiful that God arranged things in such a way that the end for which we were redeemed is itself the means by which others come to be redeemed? That's just another one of those beautiful aspects to praise about God's grace.
Praise Completes Our Enjoyment
Now the second thing I learned is from my other Bible: C. S. Lewis. I believe it's implicit throughout Scripture what they teach; they do it better though. They say about praise:
But the most obvious fact about praise—whether of God or anything else—strangely escaped me. I thought of it in terms of compliment, approval, or the giving of honour. I had never noticed that all enjoyment spontaneously overflows into praise unless . . . shyness or the fear of boring others is deliberately brought in to check it. The world rings with praise lovers praising their mistresses . . . readers their favorite poet, walkers praising the countryside, players praising their favourite game—praise of weather, wines, dishes, actors, motors, horses, colleges, countries, historical personages, children, flowers, mountains, rare stamps, rare beetles, even sometimes politicians or scholars. I had not noticed how the humblest, and at the same time most balanced and capacious, minds, praised the most, while the cranks, misfits and malcontents praised the least. . . . (Reflections on the Psalms [New York: Harcourt, Brace & World, 1958], 93–95).
And they conclude, “Praise almost seems to be inner health made audible.” But then they hit the nail square on the head, and this is what I want to apply to our text: “I think we delight to praise what we enjoy because the praise not merely expresses but completes the enjoyment; it is its appointed consummation.”
“Praise not merely expresses but completes the enjoyment.” Every one of us can think of instances where we've been frustrated because we had a pleasure or a joy and there was nobody to share it with. You hear a funny joke, you have to tell somebody that joke but there's nobody to tell it to. I go over to the library sometimes and take down the New Yorker magazine and look at the cartoons in there because they're really funny. If I find one that's really funny, my first reaction is to look up and ask myself, “Who is here to tell that joke to; to show this cartoon.” There's something in me that says, “John, your pleasure in that cartoon isn't going to be complete until you say to someone, ‘Look, isn't that a funny cartoon?'” It's that way with your wife, too. Your pleasure in your wife won't be complete unless you tell them that you have it.
Now this is astonishing. See what this does? This means that the end for which we were created, that is to praise the glory of the grace of God, is at the same time the consummation—the completion and perfection—of the joy of our redemption. The end for which we were redeemed is at the same time the completion of the joy of being redeemed. The happiness of man has become one with the glory of God. Now is there anything in all the universe—all eternity—that we could ask to be true that would be better than that? No.
To sum up then, what I've tried to say is that God, according to Ephesians 1:5-6, has foreordained us to be sons, through Christ, for this end: to praise the glory of God's grace. And it just so happens that if we do that, if we make that the end of our existence, we are going to be powerful witnesses and men are going to come to repentance and we are going to be tremendously happy human beings.

Iowa Renaissance Festival and Gathering o'Celts | May 25-27 | Amana Park, Amana Colonies
The 22nd annual Iowa Renaissance Festival and Gathering o'Celts will represent a bittersweet occasion for Sir William Rogers, also known as Greg Schmidt (at least, in this century), who plans to abdicate their noble position as the festival's producer-director in search of glorious new adventures.
What can visitors expect at this year's Iowa Renaissance Festival? The best of the best, according to Schmidt. Before passing off the torch, they intend on making their final year the best one yet, calling it their “grand finale, of sorts.” Schmidt said they plan on showcasing many of the Iowa Renaissance Festival's most popular acts, including the “equestrian spectacle” known as Joust Evolution, the Shattock Schoole of Defense comedy theater and Kansas City's Brotherhood of Steel, just to name a few.

In total, six stages are set to feature more than fifty special events throughout the weekend. Approximately 200 costumed characters–from village minstrels to your average peasant–will be wandering about as well. This year's festival will also feature a number of newly added acts to the roster, including the Hardtack Jack pub band from Minnesota and the Fabulous Fantastic Flying Fratellis based out of Omaha.
For those who prefer to wander off the beaten path, a number of encampment groups–such as Warwick and the Guardians of the Black Forest–will fill the surrounding meadow, offering a variety of combat shows and folk life exhibits.
Over the last two decades, Schmidt has seen to personally recruiting performers for their festivals, building their roster year by year through their hands-on approach.
“Through the years I have either sought out, auditioned, created and directed or ‘discovered' numerous novelty acts in the Upper Midwest that have enhanced our festivals. Some of the most professional show troupes have come from the local talent pool, right there in Iowa City and Cedar Rapids,” Schmidt said over email. “What keeps it fresh is when someone from a defunct performing troupe starts up a new one and brings that to me to showcase at the Renaissance festival. Plus, the youngsters continue to show an interest in learning the classical art forms and joining the show.”
Hands-on activities such as archery and knife-tossing will be available, as well as a beer garden and various food carts (i.e., mead and vittles for all you peasants). For the wine enthusiasts, complementing this year's Royal Pavilion Beer Garden is a newly added selection of wines from Crane Winery.
This year, the merchant's bazaar will be the largest shopping village the festival has ever had. Ten new artisan vendors are set to join the fold, offering collector weapons, custom-made jewelry and various unique, home-made goods exclusive to the festival. Many of these artisans will not only be selling their goods, but creating them on location as well.
Over the years, Schmidt as developed a special sort of relationship with merchants, performers and patrons alike.

“We've seen both patron children and performer children grow up to continue the appreciation for the Renaissance festival experience,” Schmidt said. “I've come to know the merchants and performers so well that I can anticipate many of their particular needs and preferences at each event. You might say I want them to think of me as their favorite uncle.”
Although their departure is a sad one, Schmidt's new ventures are fitting for a man with such a chivalrous alter ego. They plan on dedicating more time to their charity Quarters for Quarters, founded in 2012, to provide better sleeping quarters for Iowa's children.
“We expect to take it state-wide next year,” Schmidt says. “When I was volunteering for a local church weeknight bussing program, I saw first-hand that some of our Iowa children don't have beds of their own. They have to sleep on the living room couch after the parents are done watching television. According to my superintendent friend, it really bothers their performance in school.”
Schmidt also plans to pursue their passion for Iowa-interest documentaries and screenplays. “For some six or seven years, now, I've seen that several of my priority projects might fade into the mist if I didn't get them completed,” they said. Schmidt went on to mention a number of projects currently in the works or in the planning stages, including the documentary River Riders, which advocates more river recreation in the state of Iowa as well as the establishment of the Paddlers Annual Great Boat Ride Across Iowa (PAGBRAI).
Schmidt says their experience with the Iowa Renaissance Festival has been a fulfilling one. And although he'll be leasing out the production rights of the Iowa Renaissance Festival to other entities who will add their own artistic touches, Schmidt will remain as the head of Festivals International–the regional festival organization Schmidt operates with their wife Bonnie–wherein they will continue to act as a consultant.
“We felt blessed when we came to the community of the Amana Colonies and the site for the festival,” Schmidt said, noting that this is the festival's third location over the years. “I will hear parents tell me that the Iowa Renaissance Festival was the best time the family had, together, all year. The work became less and the enjoyment grew more so, each year.”
The Iowa Renaissance Festival and Gathering o'Celts runs from May 25-27 between the hours of 11:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m., daily. Admission is $10 for adults, $6 for children ages 6-13 (younger children receive free admission), with two and three day passes available for $17 and $22, respectively. Parking is free and group discounts are available. Visit www.iowarenfest.com for more information.
Eve: Valkyrie started as an internal passion project to investigate the possibilities of virtual reality, but press and player enthusiasm couldn't be denied after showing an early version of the game at CCP's Fanfest.
Ramping up an after-hours pet project into a full-on VR game release required a number of hard decisions. It was clear to the team that they'd outgrown their initial tools and platform.
After examining their options, CCP decided Unreal Engine 4 was the right call. Changing engines required tossing out most of the work they'd done so far, but the switch brought a number of advantages.
"It gives us familiarity. It gives us a great engine. I've worked in Unreal before. It gives us ready made accessibility into the market," Chris Smith, the lead game designer, told Polygon in an interview. "I'm not a business person, so for me it's just a great engine that renders a great game. It allows me to express what I need to express on a tool I'm familiar with."
EVE: Valkyrie required revisiting all of Eve Online's art and overhauling it for virtual reality. The ships players know and love to have to look right even while zooming around in a dogfight.
UE4's Blueprint system lets content designers work in the engine without bugging programmers. Blueprints also let them iterate rapidly, making sure that Minmatar Titan looks great on fly-by without requiring long build cycles for minor tweaks.
CCP knows they've got the hopes and dreams of every would-be space fighter pilot on their shoulders. With the power of Unreal Engine 4, they can bring that dream to life.
Remember ReBoot, the wacky CG animated series set inside a computer, starring a collection of green sprites who spend their days fighting Hexadecimal, Megabyte and playing the users' games? Well it's bAAAaaaaack!
Rainmaker Entertainment has just announced the re-birth of Mainframe Entertainment, the folks responsible for ReBoot. And with this newly revamped division of television entertainment comes a brand new ReBoot on television.
[Mainframe Entertainment] has unveiled the first two series in development: an all-new version of the popular ReBoot franchise and Tiger's Apprentice, a CGI animated series based on the trilogy of young adult novels written by award-winning author Laurence Yep.

No word on whether the annoying kid will be in this series. Fingers crossed they keep Bob's silver dreads. REBOOT!
Thanks for the tip Graham!
ARTE (Association relative à la télévision européenne) is a Franco-German free-to-air television network that promotes cultural programming. It is made up of three separate companies: the Strasbourg-based European Economic Interest Grouping ARTE GEIE, plus two member companies acting as editorial and programme production centres, ARTE France in Paris (France) and ARTE Deutschland in Baden-Baden (Germany). As an international joint venture (an EEIG), its programmes focuses to audiences in both countries. Due to this, the channel features two audio tracks and two subtitle tracks, each in French and German.
80% of ARTE's programming are provided by its French and German subsidiaries, each making half of the programmes available, while the remainder is being provided by the European subsidiary and the channel's European partners.[1]
ARTE France was formerly known as La Sept. ARTE Deutschland TV GmbH is a subsidiary of the two main public German TV networks ARD and ZDF.
Selected programmes are available with English, Spanish and Polish subtitles online.[2][3]
History [ edit ]
The ARTE building in Strasbourg
ARTE began transmission in 1992, filling frequencies left unused by the demise of La Cinq, the first French commercial television network (created in 1986). The opening night on 30 May 1992 was broadcast live from the Strasbourg Opera House.[4]
ARTE started out as an evening-only service. In the daytime, the frequencies were shared with other channels. A public channel called Télé emploi occupied the French frequencies for about a month during 1994, before the start of La Cinquième (now France 5) in December that year. For German viewers, ARTE was assigned a frequency on the Astra 1D satellite in late 1994, and it was eventually shared with Nickelodeon Germany, later replaced by the new public children's channel Kinderkanal.
In 1996, it started offering an afternoon schedule with reruns for viewers on digital satellite and digital cable. A "proper" afternoon schedule with programmes between 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. was introduced on 6 January 2001.[5] The channel eventually got its own analogue frequency on the Astra satellites.
Since 2005 ARTE broadcasts 24/7. In 2007 the catch-up service ARTE+7 is launched, offering internet users free access to a broad range of programs within seven days of their original transmission.[6]
Transmission and reception [ edit ]
ARTE programmes are available with multi-channel audio: all programmes go out in French and in German. Further the original version is screened whenever possible with subtitles in French and German and the hearing or visually impaired may get subtitles or an audio description. Since 2015 a selection of programmes are available with English and Spanish subtitles online, with Polish to follow in late 2016.[7]
The channel enjoys a major footprint in Europe. Both the German and the French version can be received in nearly whole Europe via the satellite Astra1 (19, 2° East), the French version is also available via Hot Bird (13° East). In addition ARTE is relayed not only by all cable networks in Germany and France, but by numerous cable networks in Austria, Belgium, Finland, Luxembourg, Switzerland, and in the Netherlands too.
Since 2008 ARTE broadcasts in HD in Germany and in France. Like the national channels of its own respective countries, the German HDTVversion of ARTE broadcasts in 720p50, while the French one broadcasts in 1080i25. In April 2016 ARTE co-produced (with Astra satellite owner, SES) a live Ultra-high-definition television broadcast of the Le Corsaire ballet from the Vienna State Opera. The programme was transmitted free-to-air on the UHD1 demonstration channel from the Astra 19.2°E satellites.[8]
Online ARTE programmes can be streamed live or watched on catch-up TV for at least 7 and up to 700 days on ARTE+7 and the theme platforms ARTE Concert, Creative, Info, Future or Cinema.
International [ edit ]
In Africa, ARTE is broadcast via satellite, cable, MMDS and ADSL in many other countries, via the digital service CanalSat Horizons. Many French-language ARTE programs are also broadcast in Canada on the Ici ARTV cable channel, partly owned by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (85%) and ARTE itself (15%). The Australian Special Broadcasting Service translates many ARTE programs into English for broadcast on its own television network and overseas.
Market Share [ edit ]
ARTE usually has more viewers in France than in Germany. In 2015, its share of overall viewing was about 2.2 % in France and about 1% in Germany. The differences can be put down to the different television markets in both countries. In France, ARTE was for a long time available to almost everyone as one of six analogue terrestrial channels. Relatively few French households received cable and satellite television, and the other terrestrial channels didn't really compete with ARTE. Meanwhile, thanks to widespread roll-out of cable television, the vast majority of German households had access to about three dozen channels, including several from the public broadcasters with content similar to Arte.[9] After the introduction of digital terrestrial television in France, ARTE's market share has fallen there, while it has been more or less flat in Germany.

When the Dodgers first moved from Brooklyn to Los Angeles, they didn't have, you know, an actual ballpark waiting for them. Walter O'Malley's famous helicopter ride over downtown LA was the first seed of Dodger Stadium, but the current home of the Dodgers wouldn't be in fighting shape until before the 1962 season, so the team played 1958-61 home games in a retrofitted Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, a classic venue typically associated with University of Southern California football and the occasional Olympiad.
Regarding all of that, and courtesy of @MLBCathedrals (a must-follow on Twitter), here's a look at Coliseum all done up for some baseball ...
Plenty of seats available!
As you may be able to surmise from the above image, the Coliseum had a pretty bizarre layout when set up for this, our baseball. Via Clem's Baseball Blog, here's a closer look:
Free advice for the batsman: Hit it to left, not center. Or anywhere else, really. To be fair, though, the Dodgers raised a 40-feet screen in left to compensate for those impossibly cozy dimensions (you can make it out in the top-most image above). Said left field "wall" was not called "The Invisible Monster" but probably should have been.
Related: The Dodgers in the 1959 World Series, in which they prevailed over the White Sox, drew more than 90,000 for each of their three home games.
Bill Minor, whose courageous reporting helped open Americans' eyes to everyday racial discrimination in the South in the 1960s and won them recognition as the “conscience of Mississippi,” died on Tuesday in Ridgeland, Miss., outside Jackson. They were 94.
Their death, at a hospice, was confirmed by their son Paul.
Mr. Minor was already a fiercely independent and fearless muckraker, exposing corrupt Mississippi politicians in The Times-Picayune of New Orleans, when their news articles and commentary emerged as the region's lonely but conspicuous witness to the fledgling civil rights movement and the brutal efforts by Southern politicians to suppress it.
Their voice not only traveled from the newspaper's bureau at the state capitol in Jackson to neighboring Louisiana, but also reverberated nationwide. While serving as The Times-Picayune's capital correspondent, Mr. Minor was also a stringer, or part-time reporter, for The New York Times and Newsweek magazine.
“No Southern newspaperman has done more for civil rights and civil liberties than Bill Minor,” Claude Sitton, another son of the South who covered the movement for The Times, once said. Historians have credited Mr. Sitton, who died in 2015, and another Times colleague, John Herbers, who died this month, with playing major roles in reporting the civil rights struggle.
When digital activist Aaron Swartz committed suicide January 11 as U.S. prosecutors assembled a criminal case against him, much anger from their peers was aimed at both the government and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
"This feels like losing a kid brother," Matt Blaze, the director of the Distributed Systems Lab at the University of Pennsylvania, observed on Twitter last week. He, like thousands of others, spoke out in defense of the 26-year-old inventor, venting their wrath at the prosecutors who expected to bring Swartz to trial in April for bypassing security blocks at M.I.T. to download more than four million articles from the online academic repository JSTOR (for Journal Storage). The sad irony is that the principles of the Open Access movement, which shares Swartz's goal of making scientific research universally accessible, although not their methods, is becoming widely adopted—without sparking the attention of prosecutors.
On their blog, the Harvard University lawyer Lawrence Lessig praised Swartz's contributions to their Creative Commons and Rootstrikers efforts, but wrote, "The causes that Aaron fought for are my causes, too. But as much as I respect those who disagree with me about this, these means are not mine."
The movement rejects the idea that open access means "Napsterizing" scientific research. Instead, says Peter Suber, director of the Harvard Open Access Project and author of the 2012 book Open Access (MIT Press, 2012), the movement respects copyright and retains peer review. The goal, as they put it, is "literally, clearing away obstacles and barriers so people can get to the content." They add, "Open access is lawful and we're making progress through lawful means."
The movement dates to 2002, when the Budapest Open Access Initiative called for making peer-reviewed research literature freely available on the public Internet. The cost of journal subscriptions had risen faster than library budgets for decades. In 2005 the National Institutes of Health (NIH) became the first public funding agency to adopt a policy tying grant funding to open-access publication; the policy became mandatory in 2008. In 2006 the U.K. became the first country to have all its major public funding agencies adopt open-access policies.
"Some were never enforced," Suber admits, "but that's starting to change." Other countries, universities and agencies have followed—from Ireland to the University of Nairobi and two other universities in Kenya. "A lot of universities say they couldn't [adopt open-access policies] because they're not Harvard," Suber says, "but Kenya shows that it's desirable and possible for institutions of all kinds."
Generally, these policies take one of two types: "green," in which authors deposit copies of their papers in an institutional or subject-based online repository for free download, and "gold," in which authors publish in one of the more than 8,000 open-access journals. These finance their operation in myriad ways: Some are small, community-based, volunteer-run affairs. Others seek support from advertisers, sponsors, subsidies or institutional memberships, sell print copies or charge article-processing fees.
"We're not saying that all academic journals should go out of business," says Melissa Hagermann, senior program manager at the Open Society Foundation's Information Program, "but there are new models, and open-access journals have shown they can be sustainable."
Outside academia many people do not realize that traditional journals do not pay authors or reviewers. Universities and agencies pay twice: first in salaries and grants, second in subscription fees. The business is profitable: for 2011 Dutch publisher Elsevier declared approximately $1.2 billion in profits with an operating margin of 37.3 percent. But by April 2012, even Harvard found subscription prices unsustainable. The adoption of open-access policies, Suber says, is often led by faculty who want their work to have maximum impact.
Publishers have fought back, most recently in the U.S. with the 2011 Research Works Act, which sought to overturn the NIH open-access policy. The bill was withdrawn by its sponsors, Darrell Issa (R–Calif.) and Carolyn Maloney (D–N.Y.), after protests from scholars and scientists who threatened to boycott Elsevier, one of the bill's leading proponents. In the U.K. there are concerns that the government's latest proposals favoring gold open access will divert money from university research budgets to journal publishers. If authors have to pay article processing or other fees to support the journals, those funds will come out of grant money. Currently, journal subscriptions are paid out of library and university budgets.
But the movement continues to grow, fueled by the need to grant access to the scientific literature to researchers in developing countries as well as to enable the growing trend of publishing material such as negative results that don't fit the space limitations and editorial agendas of traditional journals. It is fed, too, by stories like that of 15-year-old Maryland high school student Jack Andraka, whose access helped them invent a diagnostic test for pancreatic cancer that beats existing tests for cost, accuracy and speed by wide margins.
"The point of open access," Suber says, "is access for everybody who can make use of the information."
TORONTO - A tentative contract agreement has been reached averting a strike by LCBO workers that was set to begin at midnight.
The agreement was signed shortly after the strike deadline passed, and was announced in a release from the Ontario Public Service Employees Union.
Union president Warren "Smokey" Thomas said details of the accord would not be released before union members have a chance to examine it over the next few days.
A ratification vote has not yet been scheduled, but Thomas said the union's bargaining team is unanimously recommending members accept the deal. From there, it would go to the LCBO board and the provincial government for ratification.
The agreement was negotiated with the help of a mediator who imposed a media blackout on the talks.
The 8,000 unionized LCBO workers have been without a contract since March 31, and voted 93 per cent in favour of a strike in April.
The LCBO had extended store hours for its outlets the past couple of days to allow customers more time to stock up in case there was a job action.
The battle for hearts, minds and souls continued Tuesday between a regional atheist organization and the city of Lakeland.
> View the Lawsuit and Related Correspondence
LAKELAND | The battle for hearts, minds and souls continued Tuesday between a regional atheist organization and the city of Lakeland.
Atheists of Florida and Lakeland Mayor Gow Fields held separate news conferences to talk about the lawsuit filed by the atheists Monday in U.S. District Court in Tampa. The suit challenges the city's practice of opening its meetings with a prayer said by a local member of the clergy.
EllenBeth Wachs, director of the Lakeland chapter of Atheists of Florida, and the organization's lawyer, Eric Husby of Tampa, spoke to the media in a sweltering parking lot along noisy Combee Road underneath a billboard the atheist group rented. The billboard reads "One nation, indivisible" and is intended to protest the phrase "under God" in the Pledge of Allegiance.
Husby repeated points previously made by the group at City Commission meetings:
The invocations amount to unconstitutional government sponsorship of religion and discriminate against nonbelievers.
The fact that all but a few of the prayers offered in the past few years were given by Christian clergy demonstrates an intent to prefer Christianity over other faiths.
"(The commission) narrows the field of religions allowed to participate. It's not representative of the community," Husby said. "Governments should maintain neutrality."
At their news conference later in the day, Fields did not comment on specifics of the lawsuit because city officials have not yet seen the official documents. They read a brief, prepared statement in which they said the city is "clearly � at odds with the beliefs that the atheists have.
"We have designed our practice after what the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled to be constitutional. We have followed that practice. This will be a long, drawn-out matter. � At the appropriate time, our attorneys will be responding," Fields said.
After the city is formally served with the suit, it will have "probably 20 days" to respond, said Lakeland City Attorney Tim McCausland.
They did not speculate on what the response might be without seeing the lawsuit, but one option would be to ask for more time.
McCausland said the cost of defending the suit will come from the city's budget as "a cost of doing business" but "it won't be cheap."
"It depends on how long it goes on. Most of the (legal) issues are pretty settled," they said.
The city will use lawyer Mark Miller of Gray Robinson as outside counsel to handle the lawsuit, McCausland said.
"Litigation in federal court is pretty complicated. It's not something we're set up to do," they said.
A key part of the legal argument may turn on how the clergy who offer the invocations are chosen. An 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruling, Pelphrey v. Cobb County (Ga.), stipulates sectarian prayers may be acceptable as long as no religious groups are excluded from offering them.
Husby said Tuesday that numerous faith groups, including Buddhists, Mormons and Unitarians, have not given invocations.
"They've made no effort to go beyond mainline Protestants. The process is exclusionary," they said.
Fields said the city's process is to send invitations to all "established houses of worship." Those who respond are scheduled to pray and none has been turned away, they said.
The atheists' news conference - ironically, held in a parking lot in front of a storefront church - attracted an impromptu demonstration from a nearby business.
Bernita Gigowski, who owns an Interstate Battery dealership across the street from the atheists' billboard, showed up along with some of their employees to object.
One held up a sign reading "Under God."
Gigowski, who is a member of First Baptist Church at the Mall, stood by quietly but held their Bible open during the news conference.
"Are Christians supposed to roll over and lay down?" they said afterward. "I have to be offended by that sign every day. They have the right to do it, but the city has the right to pray. There's no establishment or proselytizing because of that prayer."
Lakeland is at least the third city to be sued in the past year by atheist groups over the practice of beginning commission meetings with prayer. In October, Houston was taken to court over the allegation that invocations were explicitly Christian. A similar suit was filed against Lancaster, Calif., in May.

An end to grey hair and crows-feet could be just 10 years away after scientists showed it is possible to reverse ageing in animals.
Using a new technique which takes adult cells back to their embryonic form, US researchers at the Salk Institute in California, showed it was possible to reverse ageing in mice, allowing the animals to not only look younger, but live for 30 per cent longer.
The technique involves stimulating four genes which are particularly active during development in the womb. It was also found to work to turn the clock back on human skin cells in the lab, making them look and behave younger.
Scientists hope to eventually create a drug which can mimic the effect of the found genes which could be taken to slow down, and even reverse the ageing process. They say it will take around 10 years to get to human trials.
In the UK, being ‘Sent to Coventry' means being ostracized, cast out from your peers so to speak. I won't bore you with the details but the phrase is thought to have originated during the English Civil War when troops stationed near Coventry were shunned and excluded by the town's locals. Anyway, Jaguar have come up with a different meaning altogether.
As if Jaguar wasn't good enough, the iconic British luxury and Sports car Marque is moving up a gear (or three) with the expansion of their SVO – Special Vehicle Operations arm. In 2015, JLR had what could best be described as a stroke of genius and set up the SVO facility in Coventry England. Designed to be the pinnacle of the brand, the GBP 20M Technical Centre is the home of over 200 automotive gurus's. It has 40 engineering inspection bays, a world class paint facility and is essentially their new ‘Centre of Excellence'. It's a place that converts the already head turning range of Jaguar/Land Rovers into absolute jaw droppers – SVR for Performance, SVA for Hyper luxury and SVX their ultimate in off road.
We have already had a glimpse at what the facility can produce (with the likes of the Range Rover V8 Supercharged SVR and Sport SVR) but we were invited to an intimate media event at Hampton Downs racetrack to get better acquainted with their latest performance model – the F-Type SVR.
The F-Type SVR is both a feral animal and a prized domestic feline, it's a bare knuckle brawler that comes dressed in fine tailored clothing. Let me run some stats past you. 567BHP (423kW) of power, 700Nm of Torque, 0-100kph in 3.7 seconds AND has a top speed of 200MPH (322kph). This information is all well and good but wait there's more – the beautifully styled 4-wheel drive Coupe, has a 5 Litre V8 Twin-Scroll Supercharged powerhouse under the bonnet that bellows and screams beautifully at ground shaking volume through its inconel titanium (the ones used at F1 and LeMans) quad pipe exhaust system. It boasts a lap time of 7.33 minutes around the infamous Nurburgring (same times as cars x5+ the price) and I got to play with it around Hampton Downs.
The exterior of the F-Type SVR is visually aggressive but also strikingly handsome. The low front bumper and splitter have bigger air intakes (than the R) for cooling and aerodynamics, with sculpted louvres on its long bonnet and side fender panel vents. The Coupe styling offers an ‘on the move' athletic stance (especially when sitting on its lightweight 20” open spoke paws). Round the back, the SVR has a rear diffuser and undertray for improved airflow and a twin-strutt aerodynamic wing that automatically optimises for various driving and speed conditions – ie dynamic for when you want to take it up to 200mph. In comparison to the R, the SVR is significantly lighter, stiffer and more ferocious. It has a new suspension and knuckle change which provides a 37% increase in camber and 41% increase in Toe. Wheels are 13.8kg's slimmer and the inconel exhaust saves 16kg's, however I can't help but feel that both these and the other (up to 50kg in total) savings were ruined the moment I sank my large behind into the driving seat. The F-Type SVR is built for speed and built to attract attention. However, the interior tells a different story.
The cabin is wrapped in premium suede and leather (with a centre console of brushed aluminium) and apparently ‘everything' is at your fingertips (hard to comment as I didn't spend enough time flicking switches – I just wanted to get out on the track). The heritage ‘lozenge' quilted pattern ‘14 way adjustable' leather sports seats hug you in literally every way possible, they are extremely comfortable and also ‘track ready'. For a two seater it feels quite roomy and there is plenty of tech to keep you entertained – again I didn't spend enough time pushing buttons.
With the briefing out of the way, it was time to hit the tarmac. First up were a few track familiarity laps in the XE S. On any other day taking this car around the track and being told to ‘push it to under/oversteer in the sweeper' would have been a thrill, but all it did was further whetted the appetite for the SVR. In saying that though, I was surprised and a little relieved at how well the sedan handled – it corrected all the steering abuse with ease.
Back in the pits, it was a straight jump from one car to the other and under the expert guidance from the team at Downforce it was time to let the cat out of the cage. On startup and revs; the SVR impressively Roars and Gunshot pops before settling into a constant seductive Growl, it's an aural delight. We started off in Normal driving mode for the first lap but with the exhaust baffles open – no neighbours to annoy. Even in normal, the SVR wants to push you deep in your seat as you accelerate off the mark. All four wheels feel well planted in corners and the sound from the exhaust that resonates throughout the cabin as the revs increase is quite addictive. I have to admit to buttoning off on the straight first time out as I got settled but I needn't have worried, the SVR was more than capable of making up for my shortfalls.
Second lap, up a driving mode and up the speed. Under the tuition of the instructor, we hit the corners harder and the straights faster with my confidence building almost as quick as the cat itself. There was not a hint of the SVR stepping out even when I was eagerly stepping on the throttle or staying on the brakes too long when starting to turn (I evidently need more track time).
By lap three it was on to Dynamic Mode. The suspension tightens further, steering response is upped, the rear wing tilts and the speed moves to mind warp. The run up Hampton's straight was achieved in what felt like a blink of an eye, the engine felt even more alive (as did the exquisite note from the exhaust), it was a total adrenaline rush. Exiting any of the track's corners became an event; as rather as easing on the gas I stamped on it, the tyres sang along with glee! I guess I must have been caught up in the excitement a little too much as I nearly forgot to brake before the drop off (end of the home straight), thankfully the SVR's Carbon Ceramic brakes came to the rescue, dropping off enough speed for the Coupe's 4-wheel drive to take us safely round the bend (a place my mind was already going). Again, I have to tell you, despite the very late braking, I felt in total control of the SVR.
A couple of laps later it was time to hit the pits again – track time over.
Make no mistake, the F-Type SVR is a wild animal but you don't need a whip and a chair to control it. It's taken a few days for the giggle to come off my face and to be honest that is what any car of this ilk should do to you. Stunning good looks ooze from every angle of this Coupe with luxury and refinement adorning its cabin core. It has the ability to ‘Jekyll and Hyde' between an ‘almost civilised' eye-catching head turner that has a near madness super speed dark side – all with such unbelievable poise and balance. Then of course; to top it off there is the V8 sound, that near deafening roar that you seriously can't get enough of.
If this is a sign of what happens after being ‘Sent to Coventry', I think the ticket line will soon be around the block.

Speed traps and pedestrian collisions point to places where roads may be designed for too high a speed.
Can roads be over-engineered?
Nobody likes a speeding ticket, but “speed traps” might be an indicator of a larger design problem.
I'm sure many Calgarians can identify places in the city where the police like to set up and catch speeders. For me, Memorial Drive Westbound near 14 St. NW (by the CBC building) and John Laurie Boulevard as it passes 14 St NW are two places that immediately come to mind. There are many others. I've often wondered why there are these specific places where people speed so much, if we go by the fair assumption that the police are there because speeding is common.
A few of these places are areas where the speed limit changes significantly, but the road design does not. There is no natural feeling of needing to slow down when you pass from a 70km/h zone to a 50km/h zone if the road width and general shape stays the same. Other areas are along sections of road that feel designed for much higher speeds (and probably are). There is a mismatch in what the road is designed for us to do, and what is intended for us to do.
This is an example of over-engineering in transportation. Over-engineering is “the designing of a product to be more robust or complicated than is necessary for its application”. In terms of road speed, these areas where roads feel faster than the speed limit is set are examples of that.
Unfortunately, over-engineering has a much more tragic consequence than a ticket in the mail or a few demerit points. Last year, an average of one pedestrian a day was struck in Calgary, and the trend appears to be continuing this year. I believe these statistics are in large part due to the design of city roads, particularly in new suburbs where access roads are designed much wider than is needed for good traffic flow. At Spur the New West we're working on a statistical analysis of problem areas in the city, but for now I will leave you with four recent pedestrian collision areas (all between May 23 and 26, 2016) and the Google Streetview of their location. Notice how all the intersections are built to accommodate a large amount of traffic despite their relative quietness. Take a look at the areas where these roads exist: they are deep inside suburban neighbourhoods that generally only see local traffic. Compare those with similar width roads closer into the city, and it is clear that they are designed to handle more traffic and higher speeds than they ever will.

Looks like this change has gone largely unnoticed, aside from occasional bug reports when it failed and emitted a warning.
Meanwhile, the speed-up it provides for uncompiled code ranges from nice to amazing, depending on the amount and complexity of macros used.
Intro
I first noticed the difference when benchmarking an mmm-mode function that calls syntax-propertize-function from different major modes, including ruby-mode .
ruby-syntax-propertize-function , like most of the similar functions, uses syntax-propertize-rules , a distinctly complex macro. The difference between interpreted and compiled code was orders of magnitude, and it was especially noticeable in mmm-syntax-propertize-function , because the ERB code example I usually use for performance testing has ~200 ERB regions, so that's the amount of times ruby-syntax-propertize-function was called.
Some numbers
For a more practical example, let's measure the time js2-mode parser takes to process a large source file. All ~1500 lines of uncompressed Backbone.js.
js2-mode has always been notoriously slow in interpreted mode, due to the heavy use of defstruct facility and other macros from the cl package.
Version Interpreted (time, s) Compiled (time, s) Emacs 24.2 6.4251 0.3025 Emacs 24.3 0.5026 0.2524
So, compiled code became a bit faster. Not critical, but nice.
Interpreted code became a lot faster, losing to the compiled code only by the factor of 2.
This is huge, it means that we can drop the strict recommendation to compile the package when installing manually, for Emacs 24.3 and later. I'm in no hurry to change the doc, but the amount of dissatisfied keyboard jockeys who routinely skip the documentation will go down, at least on this subject.
It's especially nice for me personally: having to recompile the code after making some changes has always been a pain. Authors of other Elisp packages and users with a lot of code in their init files should also see the benefit.
More details
Not having studied the innards of bytecomp.el in detail, I'll stick to what we can glean from experiment.
A good way to see what some function really does is fire up the Emacs Lisp REPL ( M-x ielm ) and there evaluate (symbol-function 'foo) , where foo is the function in question.
As an aside, this is also a good way to find out what some macro like define-minor-mode does without studying it in detail: just look at the body of the resulting -mode function.
Take this definition:
1 2 3 ( defun foo () ( when t ( dotimes ( i 10 ))))
With Emacs 24.3, you can (sometimes unwittingly) avoid the eager macro-expansion by using eval-last-sexp ( C-x C-e ) instead of eval-defun ( C-M-x ) or eval-buffer (no default binding). So we can try it both ways.
Without eager expansion, the body looks very familiar:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ELISP> ( symbol-function 'foo ) ( lambda nil ( when t ( dotimes ( i 10 )))) ELISP> ( js2-time ( dotimes ( i 1000 ) ( foo ))) 0.0367
With eager expansion, we can see that it has been reduced to basic forms:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 ELISP> ( symbol-function 'foo ) ( lambda nil ( if t ( progn ( progn ( let (( --dotimes-limit-- 10 ) ( i 0 )) ( while ( < i --dotimes-limit-- ) ( setq i ( 1 + i )))))))) ELISP> ( js2-time ( dotimes ( i 1000 ) ( foo ))) 0.0086
The numbers fluctuate heavily with repeated invocations, but the second version is always several times faster. The “familiar” version has to expand the macros each time the function body is evaluated, which drags the performance down significantly.
Five years ago, President Obama took the extraordinary decision to target Anwar al-Awlaki, a charismatic American-born imam turned Al Qaeda terror plotter, for taking the “lead in planning and directing efforts to murder innocent Americans.” Al Awlaki was killed by a drone strike in Yemen on September 30, 2011.
Al Awlaki wasn't just an anti-American propagandist. They demonstrated a hands-on commitment to killing Americans. For example, Al Awlaki was in direct contact with Nidal Hasan before the Army psychiatrist went on a shooting rampage in 2009, killing 13 people at Fort Hood, Texas.
Al Awlaki also personally directed and supplied the explosives that Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab hid in their underwear and tried to detonate on an airplane from Amsterdam to Detroit on Christmas Day, 2009.
Al Awlaki began the Al Qaeda magazine Inspire, which includes articles like, “Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom.”
Awlaki's influence shows no signs of abating, thanks in part to the ubiquitous presence of their violence-inspiring sermons on the internet. In a report released just last week, the Counter Extremism Project (CEP) detailed 88 U.S. and European extremists who have been directly inspired by Awlaki's calls to jihad.
Five years later, Al Awlaki's influence shows no signs of abating, thanks in part to the ubiquitous presence of their violence-inspiring sermons on the internet. In a report released just last week, the Counter Extremism Project (CEP) detailed 88 U.S. and European extremists who have been directly inspired by al-Awlaki's calls to jihad.
Most recently, New York and New Jersey bombing suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami included messages in praise of Al Awlaki in a notebook retrieved by U.S. law enforcement.
Sadly, they are simply the latest to fall victim to Al Awlaki's incitement. CEP's report indicates that virtually every major American-Islamic terrorist in recent years—Al Qaeda and ISIS adherents alike—were inspired by video and audio recordings of Al Awlaki's sermons.
Last March, Orlando assailant Omar Mateen killed 49 people in the single deadliest gun attack on U.S. soil. Mateen was a known Awlaki follower and fan of their online “recruitment videos.”
Before killing 14 people with their wife last year, San Bernardino shooter Syed Farook regularly watched Al Awlaki's lectures with their neighbor, sometimes for hours each day.
Mohammad Abdulazeez—the man who killed five U.S. servicemen in Tennessee last year—watched al-Awlaki videos prior to carrying out their attacks, as did the 2013 Boston bombers, the 2015 Charlie Hebdo attackers, the 2012 Times Square bomber, and the 2015 Garland shooters.
Al Awlaki's lectures are ubiquitous on YouTube, for example, where a search for “Anwar al-Awlaki” produces nearly 70,000 hits.
Among them are Al Awlaki's “Constants on the Path of Jihad” lecture, wherein they rhetorically ask, who among their listeners are willing to “terrorize the kuffar [non-believers].”
Other lectures urge listeners to carry out attacks against Americans as “jihad against America is binding upon myself, just as it is binding on every other able Muslim.”
It does not have to be this way. The ability now exists to remove, permanently, the most horrific al-Awlaki videos and messages from the internet, and thereby reduce their enormous potential to inspire further violence.
CEP and Dartmouth computer science professor Dr. Hany Farid has developed a technology, called eGLYPH, which can efficiently find and remove extremist content that has been determined to violate the terms of service of Internet and social media companies.
It works like this: Once a person identifies an image, video or audio recording for removal, the algorithm extracts a distinct digital signature from the content. That digital signature is then used to find duplicate uploads across the internet.
In the case of Al Awlaki, once their most noxious videos are flagged and removed, they would automatically be discovered and removed every time an upload was attempted.
In a 2010 New York Times interview, a former colleague of al-Awlaki—fellow imam Johari Abdul-Malik—said that Al Awlaki “is a terrorist, in my book” and cautioned shops not to carry even the earlier al-Awlaki CDs. According to Mr. Abdul-Malki, Al Awlaki's lectures become “a gateway for the unsuspecting.”
The evidence clearly bears out their prediction. There is no longer an excuse for not addressing the continuing threat posed by Al Awlaki online. All that is missing now is a willingness to act.
Alienware expanded its cash trade-in offer recently to include current generation consoles, allowing anyone who trades in a PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 and purchases PC hardware to get up to $200, according to the company's website.
The trade-in program is currently accepting working-condition PS3s and Xbox 360 Slim models in addition to a handful of different desktop PC units and laptops.
Participants can get up to $200 for the current-gen console trade in — the full amount will be determined by entering information and getting a quote off the Alienware website — after purchasing Alienware PC hardware and presenting the receipt. After doing so, players can log on to the Alienware Trade website and enter their invoice and bank account information before shipping their trade-in device to the company. Alienware notes on the site that it could take up to 40 days for the trade-in cash to appear in users' accounts.
The next generation of consoles launch next month, with PlayStation 4 and Xbox One costing $399 and $499 respectively. Both companies are currently planning to support current-generation consoles for the time being.
Style in space tends to advance at a slower pace than fashion on Earth: The spacesuits currently worn at space stations have been in continuous use since 1982. But when NASA needed to update the suit to accommodate new missions on the moon and Mars, they decided to update the look, too. A trio of flashy new “cover layers” that can go over the suit were inspired by biomimicry, the evolution of technology, and even–supposedly–street fashion. Now anyone can help decide among the three by casting a vote on NASA's website .
The “Z-series” suits are actually a big leap from the past. Unlike the current microgravity suits, which are basically designed for floating around in space, the Z-series is designed for walking (it's also worth checking out this MIT professor's sleek Mars spacesuit, currently in development).
“There are a lot of fundamental design differences between developing a microgravity suit versus a planetary walking suit,” says Bobby Jones, an engineer for ILC, the company that worked on the new design. “A lot of that has to do with how much mobility is built into the lower torso. With microgravity you're using your arms to move around and your feet just hang out there.”
The new suit makes it much easier to walk, bend, and pick things up off the surface of a planet or moon. It also goes on differently: While the old suit is pulled on like a pair of pants and a shirt, the new version has a handy door built into the back so someone can climb inside. “You can dock the suit up to your habitat or vehicle and leave it outside, so you don't drag dust and other things into your cabin,” Jones explains.
The first version of the suit, released in 2012, looked a little like Buzz Lightyear's outfit. The new version, with different joint designs and a more durable torso, has cover designs that were made in collaboration with fashion students at Philadelphia University.
One option, inspired by underwater creatures, employs glowing wires to help the suit stay visible at night. A second version, designed in homage to past spacesuits, uses light-emitting patches along with wire, and extra patches on the legs to help make the cover more durable. NASA says the final design is “reflective of what everyday clothes may look like in the not too distant future,” pulling in elements of sportswear and wearable tech.
NASA will move forward with the most popular cover in the public vote, and plans to have the suit ready for testing by the end of the year.
A frequent observation I have made as a couples therapist is that the more narcissistic partner is often a better sleeper than the more neurotic partner. Part of that reason is that narcissists are not bothered by guilt or anxiety regarding whatever their partner feels. The exception is when a narcissistic person's immoral or illegal behavior has put them or them at risk of being discovered or legally apprehended. At those times they or they will most often turn to alcohol or drugs to calm themselves down.
Narcissists can keep a neurotic awake, because the fear, hurt and/or anger (and subsequent guilt and anxiety over being so angry) a neurotic feels at being cared so little about can play over and over in their mind, making it difficult to fall asleep. What can you do about it if you're sleeping with a narcissist?
Since once they're in your life (and taking from you) and it's difficult to get them out, it may be helpful to know how to identify them early. To do so, try using The Narcissist Inventory* rating the person on a 1-to-3 scale (1 = rarely; 2 = sometimes; 3 = frequently):
How often does the person need to be right at all costs? How often does the person act impatient with you for no good reason? How often does the person interrupt you in the middle of what you're saying, and yet take offense if you interrupt? How often does the person expect you to drop whatever you're thinking about and listen to them or her--and does the person take offense when you expect the same in return? How often does the person talk more than they or they listen? How often does the person say "Yes, but," "That's not true," "No," "However," or "Your problem is"? How often does the person resist and resent doing something that matters to you, just because it's inconvenient? How often does the person expect you to cheerfully do something that's inconvenient for you? How often does the person expect you to accept behavior that they or they would refuse to accept from you? How often does the person fail to say "Thank you," "I'm sorry," "Congratulations," or "Excuse me" when it's called for?
To score your inventory, add up the total:
10-16 =The person is cooperative
17-23 = The person is argumentative
24-30 = The person is a narcissist
And by the way, narcissists not only come in the aggressive type that we are so used to. Excessively needy people who whine, complain, make excuses and feel sorry for themselves can also exhibit many of the behaviors in the Narcissist Inventory and can be just as "self-involved" as the the more aggressive variety.
Second, it's a good idea to steer clear of them and not let them in your life in the first place. If they already are, try to minimize your contact with them. Whenever they demand something from you (they usually don't ask), have a handy counter request ready such as: "Sure and by the way that reminds me I'd appreciate it if you would do x for me." If they balk and say, "Never mind," respond "Okay." If they say, "Why do you always have to ask for something in return?" respond, "Because since what you're asking me to do is something out of my usual routine, it's a favor and I'm happy to grant it, but then of course I get to ask you one in return."
Third, the best way to clean out the narcissists from your life is to begin spending more time and building deep and lasting relationships with those wonderful people who are naturally generous, caring and kind. Not only will those people make you a better person, they will cause you to become so repulsed by the narcissists that you will no longer be able to be around them.
If you are expecting to be affected by the airline's decision to cancel many flights over the next six weeks, arm yourself with these facts
Ryanair's decision to cancel 40-55 flights a day for the next six weeks will leave as many as 400,000 passengers with their holidays and travel plans ruined.
Ryanair tries to appease passengers with list of flights cancelled until Thursday Read more
Why is Ryanair doing this?
The official line from Ryanair's Facebook page is that “We have messed up in the planning of pilot holidays and we're working hard to fix that.” Ryanair has also fallen victim to pilots defecting to Norwegian, which has taken 140 staff from its Irish rival this year already.
Of the 4,500 comments on Ryanair's Facebook page on Monday morning, the most popular was: “Publish all cancelled flights now for the next six weeks so we can make alternative arrangements and stop treating your customers like idiots.” Ryanair's share price fell significantly – by about 3% – on Monday morning, knocking about £500m off its stock market valuation.
Is my flight cancelled?
Ryanair was informing customers at short notice about cancellations. But now it has published a full list of cancellations on its website and anyone with a reservation for a cancelled flight will be informed by email.
Ryanair has told passengers: “Your flight is operating as scheduled unless you have received a cancellation email.”
My flight has been cancelled. I need to get to my destination. What do I do?
EU rules state: “You have the right to be rerouted to your final destination shown on your ticket at the earliest opportunity under comparable transport conditions or rebooking at a later date if that is more convenient for you.”
The trouble is, the meaning of “earliest opportunity” has not been tested in courts. If Ryanair is able to put you on another of its flights later in the day to the same destination, it is almost certainly fulfilling its obligations. But if, say, you are heading to Barcelona for a long weekend on Friday, and it says it won't get you on a flight until Sunday, then it is likely to be breaching the EU rules.
Michael O'Leary, the Ryanair chief executive, said on Monday the company would not book passengers on to rival airlines to get them to their destination on time.
If Ryanair refuses to re-route you when seats are available on, say, BA or easyJet, then you can purchase a ticket yourself and send the receipt to Ryanair and request a refund. But there is no guarantee Ryanair will pay. EasyJet, for example, argues that if it can fly you to your destination within 48 hours, then it will not allow a switch to a rival airline.
I've been cancelled and that's it – I've not been offered a re-routing
If that is the case, then Ryanair is in breach of EU rules, and you are entitled to be reimbursed for the cost of buying another flight. As the EU website states: “If the air carrier does not offer you the choice between reimbursement and re-routing, but decides unilaterally to reimburse your original ticket, you are entitled to an additional reimbursement of the price difference with the new ticket (under comparable transport conditions).”
What compensation must Ryanair pay?
The general rule is that an airline must refund the cost of the ticket plus pay €250 (£220) compensation for flights of up to 1,500km, and €400 (£353) for flights of 1,500km to 3,500km. Ryanair does not have any routes over 3,500km.
However, if the flight is cancelled with more than two weeks' notice, then Ryanair does not have to pay the EU compensation, and is only obliged to return the cost of the ticket.
If the flight is cancelled within seven to 14 days of the departure date, you are entitled to compensation unless Ryanair offers you re-routing that departs within two hours of the departure time.
If travellers are informed of a cancellation within seven days, the wording of the EU legislation says the €250 or €400 must be paid “unless they are offered re-routing, allowing them to depart no more than one hour before the scheduled time of departure and to reach their final destination less than two hours after the scheduled time of arrival”.
My return flight home has been cancelled. Will Ryanair pay for hotels?
It certainly should. Airlines in the EU have to offer free meals and refreshments, plus a hotel in cases where a stay is necessary. But keep all receipts, and note that alcohol is not covered. The EU rules say: “While waiting to continue your trip, you may have the right to meals and refreshments, access to communication, accommodation (if necessary) and transportation to and from the accommodation.”
My Airbnb is non-cancellable. Will Ryanair pay for that?
No. You will have to seek compensation via your travel insurance. Airlines fight any attempt to pay “consequential” losses for things such as hotel bookings and car hire. Lawyer Coby Benson of flight compensation specialists Bott & Co said: “If the flight is cancelled, there is nothing a passenger can do to recover consequential losses. So you have to try your travel insurer instead.”
Can I cancel and rebook with another airline while Ryanair is dithering around?
This would be a risky move. It's appalling that so many passengers are in the dark about their travel plans, but if you cancel now, and the Ryanair flight does go ahead, you will not receive any refunds or compensation.
Twitter is littered with complaints from travellers devastated by the Ryanair cancellations under the #Ryanaircancellations. One bride-to-be posted about their wedding plans – with 30 flights booked for friends next week. Like thousands of others, they are furious that Ryanair has failed to publish a full list of cancelled flights.
Can I take Ryanair to court for my losses?
Good luck with that. While EU rules give passengers some compensation rights, they also allow Ryanair to domicile its business in Ireland and demand that any legal case go through the Irish courts. “Ryanair argues that the Irish courts have exclusive jurisdiction. We simply can't issue court proceedings against them in England,” said Benson.
Affected passengers could try the Irish small claims court, or the European small claims procedure. But the latter is extremely risky; if you lose, you will have to pay Ryanair's costs, which could be very large.
However, Ryanair is signed up to the aviation alternative dispute resolution process in the UK, at aviationadr.org.uk. This settles claims for passengers who allege they have been treated unfairly.
The reviews are still coming in for NBC anchor Matt Lauer's moderation of the so-called Commander-in-Chief Forum on NBC on Wednesday night, but the consensus in the media sphere seems to put it somewhere between a catastrophe and a disaster.
More than just a failure of interviewing, what happened with the NBC host is really a symptom of a larger problem that has hampered the media's ability to report on the 2016 election campaign and on Republican candidate Donald Trump in particular.
The event Wednesday night was “an embarrassment to journalism,” according to New York Times columnist Nick Kristof, while former Wall Street Journal editor Bill Grueskin called it “a master class in bad interviewing.”
This #NBCNewsForum feels like an embarrassment to journalism. It's about soundbites, not serious discussion of foreign policy. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) September 8, 2016
What did Lauer do so badly? Critics said there were a number of things, including what some saw as a tendency to lob softballs to the Republican candidate while not letting Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton get a word in edgewise.
By far the biggest criticism of the NBC interviewer, however, was that they allowed Trump to claim that they were not in favor of the Iraq War, a claim the candidate has made repeatedly, and a claim that is demonstrably false. As in, there are multiple interviews with Trump in which they make it clear they supported the war.
Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter.
Despite this, Lauer let the statement slide, and moved on to other questions, at which point media Twitter erupted in an avalanche of derision and criticism.
“Everyone, and I mean everyone, knew this would happen. And Matt Lauer didn't have a followup planned?” asked New York Times columnist Paul Krugman. Although NBC (cmcsa) later posted an update on Twitter (twtr) refuting Trump's claim, most of those watching argued that Lauer should have done so during the interview—not waited until later.
Seriously — everyone, and I mean everyone, knew this would happen. And Matt Lauer didn't have a followup planned? https://t.co/mm5ufZKjEx — Paul Krugman (@paulkrugman) September 8, 2016
Not everyone agreed that Lauer should have challenged Trump's statement, however, which is where the larger journalistic problem comes into play.
Political talk-show host Chris Matthews, for example, said after the event that if Lauer had called Trump out for lying, that would be equivalent to expressing an opinion, and moderators are supposed to be neutral.
Fox News anchor Chris Wallace, who is going to be moderating one of the debates between Trump and Clinton, said something similar in an interview. Wallace said it's not their job to question the factual accuracy of a candidate's statement during such an event.
“I do not believe it's my job to be a truth squad,” Wallace said. “It's up to the other person to catch them on that.” In effect, the anchor argued a moderator's main job is to keep the event running smoothly and make sure each candidate gets equal time.
After tonight's events, consider again Chris Wallace's statement that it is against their principles as debate moderator to call out untruths. — Jay Rosen (@jayrosen_nyu) September 8, 2016
This controversy harkens back to one that emerged at the New York Times (nyt) in 2012, when the newspaper's public editor questioned if journalists at the paper should be “truth vigilantes” when interviewing politicians. In other words, if they should point out obvious lies or simply report what a person said.
Donald Trump is more than $1 billion in debt. Watch:
The response from many journalists at the time was that, of course, reporters should challenge such statements when they are clearly false. What else is a journalist supposed to do?
Matthews' viewpoint, however—that challenging a statement amounts to expressing an opinion—highlights an ongoing issue for journalists, which is that many mainstream news outlets continue to see their job as remaining scrupulously balanced and objective. When a candidate blatantly lies, that becomes a serious problem.
The New York Times has struggled with this, and continues to do so. In a recent memo to staff, the paper's standards editor lectured employees about expressing opinions on Twitter or Facebook (fb)—and not just expressing opinions, but linking too much to one political side or the other.
“If you are linking to other sources, aim to reflect a diverse collection of viewpoints. Sharing a range of news, opinions or satire from others is usually fine. But consistently linking only to one side of a debate can leave the impression that you, too, are taking sides,” they wrote.
These two things—Lauer's failure and the NYT's banning of opinions—are two different expressions of the same principle, which is that journalism can only function if reporters never express an opinion or challenge an obvious lie. This is what NYU journalism professor Jay Rosen has often called “The View From Nowhere.”
That kind of principle makes sense when you're dealing with a relatively normal political environment, in which most of the candidates stick to an unspoken agreement not to lie or simply make things up, or make outrageous statements that have no bearing on reality.
Trump, however, demonstrably and repeatedly breaches this principle, and that is part of what gives them so much power and influence—especially when the traditional media reports their statements verbatim without bothering to express any opinions about whether they are correct or not, or whether they even make sense.
There are signs that even the New York Times and CNN are doing less of this, and are trying to fact-check Trump's statements in real time. But clearly we still have a long way to go. And that's a problem the media as a whole deserves the blame for—not just Matt Lauer.
Now, from Ramy Arnaout:
The point is, we are not Riyadh—thankfully—nor Tehran. We do not elect their leaders.
Personally I might suggest Riyadh and Tehran donate to tiny Lebanon, a country with an actual (but increasingly shaky) government and 30% refugees—20% of the Syrian total—than to Syria itself, but that is beside the point.
This felt like it was missing the point... This is not either-or but both-and—even if you trust Riyadh to lead anything, or Riyadh and Tehran to agree on anything, or safe havens to stay safe in war zones—an oxymoron about which Yugoslavs, Rwandans, Afghans, Iraqis, and Sudanese might opine.
Several people have asked me why we should do anything when the regional powers, Iran and especially (as a richer and Arab country) Saudi Arabia, have done little, and whether we shouldn't prefer to send money to support “safe zones” inside Syria instead.
I (and about 40,000 others at last count ) have been on Facebook spreading the word about a White House petition to allow Syrian refugees to resettle in the U.S. You can read the petition at the link above.
Give Me Your Tired, Your Poor
We write our Congressmen. We petition our White House. We are the United States. That should mean something.
The inscription on the Statue of Liberty reads:
“Give me your tired, your poor,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”
These words welcomed millions. By our alchemy this “wretched refuse” helped spawn the Greatest Generation and powered the engine of the 20th century. The mantle of that legacy now falls to us. Syria's huddled masses yearn not to breathe free—a luxury in war—but to breathe at all. Do the words with which we caption our defining monument not include these people?
Syria gave us Steve Jobs and Jerry Seinfeld. “The business of the American people is business,” said Calvin Coolidge. As Americans, we should know a bargain when we see one. Syria is a fire sale. Lady Liberty's “golden door” should be open with Syrian refugees first in line.
The alternative is we keep that door shut—and consider outsourcing our conscience to oil sheikhs and mullahs.
Do we want to trust the future of the world we used to lead to the mercy, generosity, and tolerance of the Saudis? Are we content to play second fiddle to the Germans and Greeks? Or can we begin to salvage our tattered reputation and sense of self by demonstrating some basic human kindness?
“You break it, you bought it,” said Colin Powell of our Iraq misadventure, one of the first dominos in the Syrian crisis. We are not the bull in this china shop, but we fed it and let it in. We owe the shopkeepers.
Reads an open letter from Icelanders to their welfare minister, pleading the good sense of neighborliness: “Refugees are our future spouses, best friends, or soulmates, the drummer for the band of our children, our next colleague, Miss Iceland in 2022, the carpenter who finally finished the bathroom, the cook in the cafeteria, the firefighter, the computer genius, or the television host.”
Has the flame in Lady Liberty's lamp burned so low that the City on a Hill has to be shown the way by Reykjavik? … Let us not be shown up by the Old World or let the least charitable among us define for us what is right. Let us open our door.
In the US we're now talking about settling 1,500 refugees. ... Germany, meanwhile, says its capacity is unlimited. That's pretty incredible. Merkel must know many—most?—of those people aren't going back. Them country has uneasy history not just re-integrating the East but with a Turkish population. Fingers crossed that the German people keep behind her—and that the refugees, while not losing their history, become fully German.
Which, as a born-and-bred, die-hard New Englander who happens to be the child of Lebanese immigrants, I think would be a truly great thing.
Everyone suspected the return of Parliament would provide a bumpy ride for a Liberal government still enjoying sustained popularity nearly a year after the election. The surprise is that the turbulence has set in so quickly. Let's look at two strengths the Trudeau Liberals thought they had, and one weakness they knew would plague them. All have conspired to make the first half of their week lousy.
Environment Minister Catherine McKenna realized that this government will be desperately lucky to come anywhere close to meeting Stephen Harper's climate change targets. The belated backtracking began over the weekend. The hard work lies ahead, writes Paul Wells. ( Adrian Wyld / THE CANADIAN PRESS )
First, the weakness. “Entitlement is our kryptonite,” a senior Liberal told me eight months before last year's federal election. Liberals know Canadians grow weary of them when they act as though they have always been in power, will always be in power, and are frankly impatient with the short interludes when Canadians get it wrong and elect someone else. So it must have stung — it should have stung — when Global News reported on Tuesday that a single unidentified staffer in the Prime Minister's Office billed taxpayers $126,669.56 in moving costs to move to Ottawa. A second charged $80,382.55. That's a lot of kryptonite.

And it was not helpful to have Bardish Chagger, who is supposed to represent the new face of optimism in their role as government House leader, respond to Conservative questions on the extravagance by blandly reading prepared speaking notes in question period, justifying the cost as the sort of investment that's needed to get the top people into Ottawa to help the boss change Canada. But it's one thing when Liberals get criticized for spending money. To some extent, every government faces the same steady stream of flak from the opposition benches, and there is no way the Liberals can positively gain voter support through ostentatious displays of frugality. They should be more careful than they've been. But such efforts will always be exercises in damage limitation. It's quite another matter when the Liberals take criticism, some of it richly earned, on issues they thought would be winners for them. The week's most spectacular example is climate change. To some extent, what's happened is simply that Catherine McKenna, the rookie environment minister, has been slow to learn the cost of promising a little extra. When they got their job last autumn, they were eager to proclaim that the carbon-reduction targets set by the Conservatives were a minimum. Surely a Liberal government would go sailing past those targets en route to perfect carbon virtue. McKenna's staff tweeted photos of the locally sourced, environmentally conscious household products they were buying as part of their own #ClimateAction. Then a few more of McKenna's briefings sunk in. They realized that this government will be desperately lucky to come anywhere close to meeting Harper's targets. The belated backtracking began over the weekend. The hard work lies ahead. Last year it still seemed the Trudeau government could rely on whatever goodwill contribution each province felt like making toward a low-carbon economy; now it is becoming clearer something a little more bracing will be required. A national carbon price, set in Ottawa, for instance. That may require rolling right over Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall, who conveniently resides in a province that elected only one Liberal last October. (Sorry, Ralph Goodale. You had a good run!)
But the damage on the Liberals' environmental left could be long-lasting. Green Party leader Elizabeth May called McKenna's backtracking “nothing short of a disaster for the climate.” The second area where considerable effort from Trudeau seems to be paying exceedingly modest dividends is on their much-vaunted reconciliation with indigenous groups. Ottawa has started issuing construction permits for BC Hydro's Site C dam, over the objection of First Nations that have taken the government to court over the project. Charlie Angus, an NDP MP who's been quick to praise the Liberals on indigenous issues when they thought they deserved it, called the move a failed test for the Trudeau government.

Trudeau has been used to getting some of their most glowing coverage from news sources outside Canada. But in the U.K.'s Guardian newspaper, an article appeared that called their “lofty rhetoric” on First Nations “a cheap simulation of justice.” The criticism came from a particular corner: the article's author, Montreal journalist Martin Lukacs, was one of the authors of the Leap Manifesto that has sparked vigorous debate in the NDP. Still, it added to what is becoming a lousy week for the Liberals. The best remedy for all these ills is concrete progress on these and other files. Promising was easy, consulting not much harder. Now comes deciding.

Frontman Matt Bellamy has two cats named Kim and Kanye
Muse have discussed meeting rapper Kanye West at one of their shows.
Speaking on BBC Radio 1 to Nick Grimshaw this morning (April 21), the band's frontman Matt Bellamy described how West came backstage after the band played a gig in the US a few years back.
“He came backstage at one of our shows [in America],” Bellamy said. “He was checking out our T-shirts, all they wanted to talk about was T-shirts.”
The singer also claimed that the incident led to them naming their cat after West. In 2013, Bellamy revealed that they had named their pet cats Kim and Kanye, despite not really listening to Kanye West's music.
“I've listened to bits of that new record [‘Yeezus'],” Bellamy said at the time. “I like some of the sounds, but some of the lyrics of those artists throw me off a bit. It's very full on, in your face, it's very ‘me, me, me'.”
Muse are set to release their seventh studio album, ‘Drones', on June 8. The band recently revealed that they plan to fly drones over audiences at forthcoming live dates.
Sharethrough (Mobile)
Speaking about their live plans, Bellamy said: “We always like to use the modern technology in our shows, the latest video screens or light shows, lasers, whatever is out there. Drones are obviously an interesting thing to try to bring into the live show so we're going to try and do that. There's going to be some difficulty with red tape of health and safety about flying things over, but the general thing idea is that as the tour starts that we'll be using flying objects.”
Muse headlines this year's Download festival, which takes place June 12-14 at Donington Park. Slipknot and Kiss will also top the bill. Other acts to play include Faith No More, Judas Priest, Motley Crue, Slash, L7, Enter Shikari, Marilyn Manson, Andrew WK, A and Rise Against.
The ‘Drones' tracklisting is:
‘Dead Inside'
‘[Drill Sergeant]'
‘Psycho'
‘Mercy'
‘Reapers'
‘The Handler'
‘[JFK]'
‘Defector'
‘Revolt'
‘Aftermath'
‘The Globalist'

Note: For an update on the Jane Doe case, see our posts from Oct. 16, Oct. 20, Oct. 25 (when Jane got their abortion!), & Dec. 7!
Texas and the United States Must Respect the Dignity of Immigrant Teenagers — Not Force Them to Continue Unwanted Pregnancies
The U.S. Government through the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) is refusing to allow pregnant minors in its custody to obtain abortion care and is forcing unaccompanied minors (UAMs) who decide to have an abortion to submit to anti-abortion “counseling” from so-called Crisis Pregnancy Centers (CPCs).
Jane's Due Process, working with the American Civil Liberties Union and local counsels, Marie Christine Cortez, Attorney Ad Litem, and Rochelle Garza, Guardian Ad Litem, have helped a UAM, “Jane,” to obtain a court order giving them a right to consent to their own abortion care. Jane's Due Process worked with local abortion funds to obtain funding for the procedure. Yet, ORR has refused to release them for their medical care even to their court-appointed guardian ad litem.
The actions of the federal government have now delayed Jane's access to abortion care for three weeks – past the time for them to obtain the safer, less intrusive medication abortion. “The government's insistence on making Jane fodder for political football is hurting her, violating their human dignity, and treating them like an object unworthy of any concern,” said Susan Hays, the legal director and co-founder of Jane's Due Process. Further delay will push them into the second trimester.
“The federal government is punishing young women by denying them bodily autonomy. ORR contracted facilities routinely take UAMs for other medical appointments. ORR leadership decided to single out this one medical procedure – clearly a move to force this young woman to give birth against their will,” said Hays.
“My client has been very clear on their decision to terminate their pregnancy. As their representative, I found that involving their abusive parents in this decision was not in their best interest, one of the grounds on which a judge can grant a judicial bypass. ORR is standing in the way of the legal rights of my client,” said Rochelle Garza, Guardian Ad Litem for Jane.
The facility blocked the young woman from receiving unbiased pregnancy options counseling and an accurate confirmation of the stage of their pregnancy at the nearby state-licensed abortion clinic. Instead, ORR forced caseworkers at the shelter to take Jane to a religious clinic for counseling and a pregnancy test.
Tina Hester, executive director of Jane's Due Process, added, “While no exact numbers can be determined, news outlets and migrant centers report between 60 to 80 percentage of Central American women are sexually assaulted along the way. It is unfathomable that when ORR takes custody of minors, the government further traumatizes those fleeing violence and rape in their home countries by shaming them and forcing them to undergo counseling and medical exams they neither want nor need.”
**UPDATE** On October 11, 2017, the Ninth Circuit Court ruled that they did not have jurisdiction over the case, and therefore could not grant an order against ORR to allow Jane to have their abortion. “Today's District Court ruling comes as a serious disappointment, because it delays Jane Doe's abortion even further,” said Brigitte Amiri, senior staff attorney with the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project. “Although the court found it couldn't hear the case, it was careful to explain that the government has no business blocking Jane Doe's abortion. Jane Doe has already been blocked by the Trump administration from two appointments related to their abortion care. But they have shown tremendous courage and persistence, and we're not giving up. The denial of abortion care and basic human rights by this Administration will not go unanswered: the ACLU will continue to pursue all avenues to get justice for Jane Doe and young women like her.”

Clovis, who currently serves as a senior White House adviser to the Department of Agriculture, was Papadopoulos's "campaign supervisor" on the Trump campaign, The Washington Post reported earlier this week. Clovis encouraged the young campaign adviser to engage with Russian contacts.
“The White House was surprised to learn Mr. Clovis had been contacted by the special counsel's office as part of their separate probe of Mr. Papadopoulos's activities," a source familiar with the probe told ABC News.
Clovis on Thursday withdrew from consideration to be the Agriculture Department's chief scientist amid mounting controversy related to their links to the Russia investigation. They had also been criticized for their general lack of science credentials.
“Ted Cruz? What? We want to hear more about Trump!” – Sorry. Like I said, I'm done.
Other than Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz is the best fund raiser in the 2016 Republican field. Their experience with the Senate Conservatives Fund has helped them reach out to activists and individuals in all fifty states, raising millions of dollars in small donations from family's just like yours. Ted Cruz has consistently fought for conservative values and legislative priorities, against the wishes of the Republican Party and Senate Leadership. Carefully crafting their message in the language and tone of the American People, Ted Cruz has consistently fought on behalf of millions of conservative Republicans who may have given the Republican Party a majority in the House and Senate, but who feel as though the party still refuses to fight for them.
Where is Ted Cruz this week? Mississippi.
In June of 2014 I wrote an article entitled The Muck in Mississippi, wherein I opined…
Yesterday, June 24th, the Republican Establishment revealed just how far they were willing to go to accomplish Mitch McConnell's dream of “crushing the TEA Party”. If you've been checking Drudge and Breitbart, you already know the story. The subject matter of this article isn't what happened, but rather what we are going to do about it. Conservatives, Constitutionalists, and Libertarians have now been assured that we have no place in the Republican Party and that the establishment will go to any length imaginable to prevent our influence from affecting the political realities in Washington D.C.. This morning, I've read and heard a great deal of talk about forming a third party, but forming a third party is a form of surrender that I am unwilling to support. We should not form a third party. We should set all of our focus and energy on destroying the Republican Establishment.
Ted Cruz has done exactly that. They have fought the Republican Establishment at every opportunity and this week they are on the campaign trail with the wildly popular conservative Chris McDaniel, who was defeated, not just by Thad Cochran, but by the breadth of the entire Washington Establishment. Conservatives in Mississippi remember that betrayal. They will never forget and they will never forgive what took place in their primary. And there is Ted Cruz, in Mississippi, to remind conservatives that they stood with McDaniel when the rest of the Republican Party was trying to destroy their campaign. Brilliant. Expect big things for Ted Cruz in Mississippi.
Ted Cruz has fought the Republicans on ObamaCare, Planned Parenthood, Iran, and Cromnibus. Their only misstep was their initial support of granting fast track authority to the President on TPP.
Unlike most of the other Republican Candidates who have taken to going after the-one-who-shall-not-be-named at every opportunity in the press, Cruz calmly states that they understand why some conservatives are excited about the rhetoric and fight of some of their competitors and takes the high road. Brilliant.
Fox News tried to ignore them as best they could during their TV debate show, but they never got angry, they didn't act desperate and jump into fights they had no business jumping into. They maximized their opportunities and saw a 6 point bump in the polls, better than any other candidate. Brilliant.
In Iowa, Cruz is in 5th place. Now, you wouldn't want to be any lower than that at this point, but let's look at who's ahead of him. A world famous reality tv star, the son of one president and the brother of another, a nearby and well known governor, and a world renown neurosurgeon. The only thing these other gentlemen have is widespread name ID. 5th place is fine. Iowans like to make you kiss their rings for a while before they talk about giving you support, and Ted has plenty of time.
In New Hampshire, in a recent poll, Cruz has jumped from 5% to 10% after the first debate. Their favorability ratings amongst republicans have jumped from 22% to 29% between March and August. At present, only Bush, He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named, and Kasich (that little weasel) are ahead of Cruz, and it is still early.
Furthermore, understanding the politics of a crowded field, the Cruz Campaign is leaving no stone unturned. Kaum News
Could Guam play a pivotal role in picking the eventual Republican nominee for president? That's what a staffer for Senator Ted Cruz believes. And they traveled all the way from Washington, DC to let local party members know that the GOP candidate wants their votes come convention time. Dennis Lennox says under Republican Party rules, a candidate must win a majority of delegates from at least eight states to be eligible for nomination. With as many as 17 candidates potentially dividing up those votes, the eight-state threshold may be harder to come by. However, GOP rules recognize Guam and the other territories just the same as states. “The Republican Party believes that territories should have an equal say in the nomination of the Republican nominee,” Lennox stated, “And I'm here on behalf of Senator Cruz to ensure that Guam does have a voice in that process. We believe that Guam will be every bit as important as Iowa or New Hampshire.”
Brilliant!
The Cruz Campaign is for real folks. While some candidates may be rolling around in the Benjamin's of Wall Street, and while others are basking in the light of their celebrity, the Cruz Campaign is running a methodical, disciplined, thoughtful campaign. Keep an eye on them and remember that a Presidential Nomination is a last-man-standing kind of battle. There can be only one.

To a packed room of enthusiastic media buyers, journalists, and other media types, Ten launched Australian Survivor. A local version of the format popularised by the CBS version from the US hosted by Jeff Probst, Australian Survivor is set for the final quarter of 2016 to be hosted by Jonathan LaPaglia.
During the evening, host Sandra Sully introduced the eagerly anticipated LaPaglia. Australian Survivor is the first hosting job by LaPaglia, who has built a steady career as an actor in US series including Seven Days, New York Undercover, and The District, as well as local series The Slap, Underbelly: Badness, and Love Child.
After the presentation, Mediaweek spoke with series executive producer Stephen Tate about the series. Tate, who was set to fly out to the shooting location in Samoa just 48 hours later, made it clear that working on the series was a professional dream come true.
How long has Australian Survivor been in the works?
I've been trying to make this happen for quite a long time. A lot of formats take a long time to come to fruition because the rights might be held by other people, or there could be a tape sale or something that could prevent it. So, we had to wait for the right time. Also, we had a need at the end of this year and we like to do shows that are splashy and big. You don't get much bigger than Survivor.
This is not the first time that Survivor has been tried in Australia, with Nine initially producing a version in 2002, and Seven mounting a celebrity version of the format in 2006. Was that a concern when approaching this?
In a way it is a challenge, it really throws down the gauntlet to make sure that we get it right, so we left no stone unturned. We want to make this authentic. We want to stay true to the experiment. It is the most successful format in reality television throughout the world. So, there is no reason why we can't do a really great job of that. To that end we've enlisted Endemol Shine as our production partners to make this. We know through working with them on MasterChef and Bachelor and Bachelorette that they're going to do an extraordinary job and, as it turns out, their corridors are riddled with Survivor superfans. So, they jumped at the chance.
The production value of the US version is impressive. Can Australian Survivor match that?
We set out to be the best that we can possibly be. We made sure that we had the finance to do this properly before we took it on. We wouldn't do it if we couldn't do it properly.
I will be there for the entire 55 days. I leave on Friday. I haven't been to Samoa yet, so I'm really looking forward to it.
Will you be staying in a town and travelling to the set?
That's actually really important when you're looking at a location for Survivor because it does actually need to be remote. There are some practicalities that you need to take into consideration around housing a crew of 200, feeding them, and making sure that they have some stimulation outside of work. Samoa provides a great location for that. Also, it's a proven location. The US have been through there a couple of times now. We're not using exactly the same locations as them. But, for our first one, we wanted to go with a location that has been broken in by the US.
Will there be previously built structures in place?
No, because the contestants build everything themselves. As far as the actual experience for the contestants: they turn up on a beach and they have to survive. As far as the crew is concerned, we will be using local amenities and the Samoan Government has been amazing. They could not be more helpful and welcoming. For that reason, it was a great decision to go there.
What sort of safety precautions are in place?
We have a full safety team, particularly around the challenges – the immunity challenges. As far as actual camp life is concerned when they are on their own, they are actually on their own. This is real. So, yes, there is the potential for injury. Obviously we're ready to jump in and help at any time. There is always somebody on the crew observing them, but it's very important that they get the full experience of genuinely surviving on an island.
What happens if a crew member is injured?
We have to actually have redundancies for almost every position because, as we've discovered on other formats like I'm A Celebrity, when you're working in an extreme and remote environment, you can't just pick up the phone and call somebody in. You need people that are capable of multitasking and it's all hands to the pump at various times.
What makes the Australian version different from overseas?
What we want to explore is the concept of mateship. We think that's a really strong, central theme for an Australian series. We've set the prize money at a level that would be a real dilemma as to whether you would stab a mate in the back or not.
It is a game, but it's also very close to real life. You can actually see your office politics, your family dynamics in this format in an absolutely extreme way.
What made Jonathan LaPaglia the right host for the show? They certainly look the part.
Their looks are a happy accident. That's actually not why we cast him. The reason why we cast them was we were throwing out a lot of ideas and we actually started the casting process before we announced the series, which meant we were able to have a few quiet chats with people before news got out. Jonathan has qualities that almost nobody else that we spoke to has. They actually studied medicine before they went into acting. He's also so incredibly physically fit that you almost believe that if they were a contestant, he'd win it. On paper he's the perfect host. What really nailed it was they actually did a screen-test for us absolutely off their own back in their own lounge-room in LA and we all looked at it and the search was over.
Was LaPaglia's American accent a concern for Australian Survivor?
It's not an issue at all. Accents on Australian television are welcomed. I want them to be who they really are. They have a slight accent. I don't want them to pretend they don't. He's not acting in this role. He's actually Jonathan LaPaglia for the first time in their career.
What sort of qualities is you seeking from a host?
The most important thing is they actually had the game in their head at all times. That's not just the physical game, it's the mental game. Jeff [Probst] has been such a success at this for 32 seasons because they are one of the executive producers of the US series. We're really encouraging Jonathan to be across all of the decision making and with us in the executive producer bunker at all times so they know all of the twists of the game.
US host Jeff Probst is an expert in the Survivor game mechanics. Will LaPaglia match that?
It was important that they met. Jeff was able to download as much as possible to Jonathan.
How many episodes of Australian Survivor can we expect to see?
You can see by the fact that it's 55 days. One of the longest shoots in the world. The US is 39 days. I think the longest ever has been 60 days. There will be a lot of content. These days it has to live on so many platforms and we'll be finding a home for it everywhere that we can.
Will we know the contestants on the show before the show launches?
We want the audience to get to know the contestants and to be as invested in the contestants as possible. We're also incredibly excited by the people that we've cast. 15,000 applications. In my time at Ten, I've been there for nearly 16 years. The only other show that had that number of applications was series 2 of Idol. It's six times what a reality series usually gets to apply.
How engaged have the format owners been?
Castaway owns the format internationally and we have a Castaway fly-in producer with us in Samoa. She's already been out and we've had sessions with them to talk about the way we're tackling this show. The insights have been incredible. I've been a fan since the first UK series – I was working in the UK when it hit the screens. It's always been on my bucket list as a show I've wanted to work on. To be able to EP it for the network is a dream come true.

Bouncing my one-year-old boy, Sonny, on my lap, I half-heartedly joined in with yet another rendition of Old MacDonald at the mums and toddlers singalong group at my local ceramics cafe.
For six months, I'd been the only stay-at-home dad in a circle of nine new mothers and it wasn't getting any easier being the token man in a woman's world.
Bored and embarrassed, my eyes idly wandered around the crowd and snagged on a mother opposite as they unbuttoned their top, and started breastfeeding them baby.
Martin, who has a one-year-old son Sonny (both pictured), was a stay-at-home dad for six months in a circle of nine new mothers
At that uncomfortable moment, our eyes locked. I froze, unable to look away.
‘Do you mind?' they said, nodding their head towards the door, their intent obvious: they wanted me to clear off. Beetroot-red, I quickly gathered my child and staggered outside, sweating and humiliated.
This was the final straw. I threw in the towel the next day, hired a nanny and decided that, for this man at least, being a stay-at-home dad was a gender equality bridge too far.
We often hear MPs and feminists bleating about how the world is run by the old boys' network.
But it is my bitter experience that the ‘yummy mummy club' is a powerful and exclusive girl gang, where men are shunned, and treated as second-class citizens.
So nobody was less surprised than me to read that only a tiny minority of British fathers have signed up to the Coalition government's much-trumpeted, yet seemingly unpopular, Shared Parental Leave (SPL) system.
They felt awkward about using the family changing rooms around mothers after trips to the swimming pool and felt they couldn't join in with conversations about lactating and labour pains
The scheme was conceived by Nick Clegg to get mums back to work quicker by allowing parents to share up to 50 weeks of leave and 37 weeks of statutory pay.
Yet whichever way you spin it, it has been a dismal flop. Government figures show that while around 285,000 British couples were eligible for SPL, in the first three months of 2016 only 3,000 have taken up the offer - a feeble four per cent.
This spectacular snub isn't just down to the terrible money: SPL pays a meagre £139.58 a week, or 90 per cent of weekly earnings, whichever is lower.
The father pictured with their one-year-old son Sonny
For many, that would barely cover the rent or mortgage, and mean more work for the other parent. As two thirds of households still have men as the main breadwinner, it's an economic no-brainer why most couples reject SPL.
And there's more: many firms pay mothers on maternity leave well above the legal minimum, but SPL is tied to the statutory rate, proving fathers are discriminated against and undervalued compared to mothers.
But I believe there is something much more fundamental behind British men's wholesale rejection of the scheme and it is this: Fathers are simply not welcome in the world of stay-at-home mums.
It is my bitter experience that the ‘yummy mummy club' is a powerful and exclusive girl gang, where men are shunned, and treated as second-class citizens
I'm not alone in thinking that. In the SPL report, 55 per cent of British men said their partners had refused to share their maternity leave.
Despite what feminists and egalitarians would have us believe, many mums want ‘their' year off.
They see ‘Mummy time' as a birthright - and they don't want to share it with men. And when men have the temerity to venture into ‘their' world, we're made to feel about as welcome as a bout of colic.
We'd agreed I would take up the reins of childcare after my wife, Diana, who's now 41, returned to their job as a picture editor, after a year's maternity leave in 2010.
It was around this time that my job as a magazine editor came to a close and, initially, we thought the timings were perfect.
Sonny wouldn't need a nanny and I would redress the parenting duty imbalance and get to raise my son myself. Yet nothing had prepared me for the tedium, loneliness and nonexistent social life of being a stay-at-home dad.
Martin said: 'I'm ashamed to admit being a stay-at-home dad didn't give me what I needed to feel like a man. Stay-at-home dads are heroes, I just didn't have what it takes'
Almost always, I was the only man at kids' groups, playgrounds, or coffee mornings. Perhaps a little paranoid, I felt like a pariah.
At Sonny's swimming lessons, I eventually shied away from using the family changing room, where I know they liked to toddle around with the other babies, as I felt like an unwanted voyeur at best, and a sex pest at worst.
I knew my own wife, like many new mothers, was suffering from crushing body self-esteem issues post-birth, so what right did I have to subject a room full of unconfident women to my male gaze?
On the rare occasions I did brave the communal changing area, the room would fall silent, forcing me to do a mumbling U-turn and skulk to the empty men's changing room next door.
I'm ashamed to admit being a stay-at-home dad didn't give me what I needed to feel like a man. Stay-at-home dads are heroes, I just didn't have what it takes
In the pool, I'd go through the motions, swooshing Sonny in circles and making duck noises as they giggled away.
But in the cafe area afterwards, the conversation would once again turn to endless, alienating, woman-only chats about lactation, caesareans and labour pains, as mums forged new friendships over common bonds.
I know these groups can be intimidating for women, too: my wife had told me she'd suffered terrible confidence issues trying to fit into the mum cliques during their year's maternity, so imagine how awkward it was for me?
How could I join in these often graphic, medical conversations? How could I make friends with people who, aside from the toddlers on our laps, I had absolutely nothing in common with?
After accidentally making eye-contact with a breastfeeding woman who then told them to leave the room, Martin decided to hire a nanny
My loneliness soon gave way to ever-greater paranoia. Once in my local playground I was taking some photos of Sonny on a swing, when a mother, on the adjacent seat, huffed angrily and whisked their daughter away.
Was they accusing me of slyly taking snaps of their child, I wondered? Of being a paedophile? Or was my sense of victimhood getting the better of me?
No matter the noble sentiment that being a stay-at-home dad is ‘the best job in the world', among my peers I found it carried no social kudos whatsoever.
On rare nights out at the pub with friends I became the butt of all jokes. When I insisted that looking after a one-year-old was more exhausting and demanding than my previous job, managing a team of 25 - that just made them laugh more.
Martin said that they had tried to start a dad's group via a local internet forum out of desperation - but no men responded
They'd then wind me up saying: ‘Do you wear an apron?' and ‘Do you breastfeed?'
Looking back, I know it was silly male banter, but I returned from the pub feeling bruised. Was I that same man who used to regale everyone with tales of celebrities, junkets and office high jinks?
Tensions also grew with my wife, who'd chastise me for not attending baby groups they had organised. I felt a total failure. We bickered and our sex life dwindled. I just didn't feel like a man.
Friendless during never-ending days, and feeling rejected by the mums' club, I forlornly tried to make daddy mates via the internet.
But there were no men's equivalent of Mumsnet, a place where I felt men were ridiculed.
In desperation, I tried to start a dad's group via a local internet forum, but no men responded. Was I the only man doing this? Or were we all unable to reach out for help? I'll never know.
When Martin became a dad for the second time, to Dolly, who is now two, they vowed to put their bitter experience behind them
That incident with the breastfeeding woman was the final straw. I hired a nanny, the £90 daily outlay the price of my failure, but a price worth paying.
I'm ashamed to admit being a stay-at-home dad didn't give me what I needed to feel like a man. Stay-at-home dads are heroes, I just didn't have what it takes.
British dads are getting better. There are far more men pushing buggies around these days.
I always make sure I say a manly: ‘All right, mate?' when I pass one in the street, and talk to them in playgrounds, as that would have meant the world to me in my darkest days.
When I became a dad for the second time, to Dolly, who is now two, I vowed to put my bitter experience behind me.
I now work from home, as does my wife, and we have a far healthier work/life balance.

The Internet Archive Releases over 1,000,000 Files of Freely Downloadable Music, Movies and Books Using BitTorrent® Software
Non-profit digital library turns to BitTorrent to make its materials available to the world
SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today the Internet Archive, a non-profit digital library with the stated mission of "universal access to all knowledge", is making over one million pieces of archived content available to the world via the BitTorrent protocol.
"Thank you to BitTorrent and its community for evolving such a useful technology to distribute public materials quickly, efficiently, and inexpensively."
The Internet Archive offers permanent storage of and free public access to collections of digitized materials, including websites, music, moving images, and over 2 million public-domain books. Today all of the archives' live music concerts, the Prelinger movie collection, the librivox audio book collection, feature films, old time radio, lots of books, and all new community uploads will be available as torrent files.
BitTorrent protocol-based software is the now fastest way to download complete items from the Archive, because the BitTorrent client downloads simultaneously from two different Archive servers located in two different datacenters, and from other Archive users who have downloaded these torrents.
"We're committed to building a sustainable future that empowers creative content, effects the social good and ultimately persuades institutional change," said Eric Klinker, chief executive officer for BitTorrent. "We were happy to find that our interests align with those of the Internet Archive as we strive to protect and maintain society's cultural artifacts - creating new ways to discover media and share it worldwide. Combined with the vast amount of content from the Internet Archive and the size and scope of the BitTorrent community, this is truly a worthy cause and we look forward to continuing to build new content solutions for the digital world."
Said Brewster Kahle, founder and digital librarian for Internet Archive, "Thank you to BitTorrent and its community for evolving such a useful technology to distribute public materials quickly, efficiently, and inexpensively."
The distributed nature of BitTorrent protocol-based swarms and their ability to retrieve torrent files from local peers may be of particular value to patrons with slower access to the Archive, for example those outside the United States or inside institutions with slow connections.
To download the torrent file from an archive.org details page, click the torrent link at the bottom of the download box; your BitTorrent protocol-based client can use the torrent file you get to download all the files in the Archive item, including the original item files, plus all derivative and metadata files. Individual files can be selected (or deselected) from the list within most BitTorrent protocol-based clients, allowing torrent files to be used to retrieve both an entire item, or, a specific subset of files within it.
The Internet Archive is already starting to track some BitTorrent statistics, which can be fun to watch.
The breakdown of capitalism and the tasks of the working class
1 September 2011
Socialist Equality Party (SEP) conferences on “The Failure of Capitalism and the Fight for Socialism Today” were held in Sydney and Melbourne over the past two weekends. They discussed the new stage in the breakdown of global capitalism, and the fight for a socialist and internationalist perspective for the working class to answer the intensifying assault on jobs, living standards and basic democratic rights.
Below we published the first of three resolutions that were discussed and adopted unanimously at the two conferences. The second and third resolutions will be published tomorrow.
The breakdown of capitalism and the tasks of the working class
1. The collapse in global financial markets in 2007-2008 has escalated into the greatest failure of the capitalist system since the Great Depression of the 1930s. In every country, the ruling class and its political servants are seeking to make the working class pay. This conference of the Socialist Equality Party calls on workers and young people to fight for a socialist and internationalist perspective to meet the intensifying assault against their living standards, social conditions and democratic rights.
2. To rescue the capitalist elite from the financial crisis they created, governments internationally have taken onto their balance sheets some $18 trillion of the losses suffered by private banks and financial speculators. They are now seeking to claw back this vast sum—more than the entire annual output of the US—through savage cutbacks to the basic social rights of the working class.
3. In the US, the Obama administration has announced $2.4 trillion in budget cuts over the next 10 years. Across the European Union, governments are eliminating public sector jobs and services, slashing social welfare and privatising state-owned assets. Living standards in Greece are estimated to have plunged by at least 30 percent over the past two years. Unemployment stands at 10 percent or higher in the US and much of Europe, and is rising. Young workers already face depression levels of 20 to 50 percent unemployment in virtually every developed country.
4. The claims that this is a “debt crisis” confined to the major economies of the United States, Europe and Japan, or simply another downturn in the business cycle, have been refuted. Just as cancer spreads from one organ to the entire body, every part of the integrated world economy is being consumed. China and other Asian manufacturing centres cannot replace the decline of their major export markets, and are lurching toward economic and social upheaval. Contrary to the nostrums of Australian exceptionalism, incessantly promoted by the media and political establishment, Australian capitalism is slumping into recession and financial instability.
5. There are no economic policies or regulatory mechanisms that can restore so-called normal conditions. The new “normal” for world capitalism is class war against the working class, along with rising global tensions and military conflict, as each national state seeks to protect the interests of its own ruling elite at the expense of its competitors.
6. The agenda of governments around the world is a social counter-revolution aimed at destroying the gains won by the working class during the twentieth century. The ruling elite is seeking to drive down living standards to those that prevail in the manufacturing hubs of Asia, in order to wrest back industries and sources of profit. In China and across Asia, governments are using state repression to block every effort by workers to win social rights, wage rises and improved conditions.
7. This agenda cannot be imposed peacefully or democratically. Already, the fig leaf of parliamentary democracy is being cast aside as governments impose the dictates of the financial markets and ruling elite, regardless of public opinion or popular opposition.
8. The working class internationally must take the sharpest warning from the right-wing hysteria and state violence unleashed by the British government in response to the recent youth riots in London and other cities—the product of decades of entrenched poverty and disadvantage. Working-class youth have been labelled sub-human “feral rats” and “wild beasts.” Thousands have been arrested and hauled before courts without the pretence of a fair hearing. The parents of alleged rioters are being thrown from their homes and sacked from their jobs. The riots have been blamed, not on social deprivation, but on insufficient “law-and-order” and state provision of welfare to the poor. The stench of a police-state permeates British society.
9. The working class must base itself on a scientific assessment of the global political and economic situation. Nothing less than a systemic breakdown in the entire structure of world capitalism is underway, like that which began with the outbreak of World War I in 1914. The global profit system was only restabilised after World War II on the basis of the strength of American capitalism. Now, after a protracted economic decline, the US, the world's chief debtor nation, is the principal source of economic instability and militarism.
10. Geopolitical tensions, and the use of military force to gain economic advantage, as in Libya, the Middle East, and Central Asia, will only intensify as the global crisis deepens. The Obama administration has ominously declared that the United States will now “refocus on Asia” to block the growing influence of China, posing the danger of open conflict and a catastrophic war between nuclear-armed states.
11. This year has witnessed powerful movements of workers, from Tunisia and Egypt, to Greece, Portugal, Spain, France and the United States, fighting to defend their living standards and social rights. These developments signal the beginning of a new era of revolutionary struggle by the international working class.
12. The critical issue everywhere, however, is the lack of revolutionary consciousness, perspective and leadership. Around the world, the nationalist and pro-capitalist social democratic, Stalinist, Labor and trade union organisations, aided by the various ex-left and pseudo-radical organisations, have been able, thus far, to block any struggle from openly challenging the power, property and profits of the ruling class.
13. This conference endorses the following perspective as the basis for a new social and political movement of the working class, which fights for the establishment of workers' governments and the building of socialism on an international scale:
14. The international unity of the working class
Workers cannot combat internationally-organised corporations or resolve the global failure of the capitalist system at a national level. This conference calls for the closest unity between workers of all countries, the coordination of their struggles internationally and a constant political fight against every form of nationalism, anti-immigrant chauvinism and racism. The working class is the only truly international class. Its objective historical interests lie in ending national divisions and rationally planning the world's productive forces and resources to meet human need, not private profit. Only on that basis can the great problems and dangers confronting humanity, including global climate change and war, be tackled and resolved.
15. Oppose militarism and war
A third world war between nuclear-armed states would spell the end of human civilisation. This conference calls for determined opposition to every expression of militarism. All Australian and foreign troops occupying Afghanistan and Iraq must be immediately withdrawn. The criminal NATO bombardment of Libya, which is supported by the Australian government, must immediately cease. The war machines being assembled by all the major powers must be dismantled. The Gillard government's neo-colonial operations in the Pacific region, must be ended, along with the closure of all Australian military bases and the repudiation of all military alliances.
16. For social ownership and democratic control
The world's productive forces must be freed from the stranglehold of private ownership. The banks, financial institutions and major corporations internationally must be expropriated and placed under the democratic control of the working class. The past three decades have produced revolutionary developments in technology and communications and brought about the unprecedented globalisation of every aspect of economic life. On the basis of socialist planning, the existing global productive capacity can be harnessed to provide a high standard of living for every person on the planet.
17. Build the International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI)
The ICFI is the only genuine representative of Marxism and socialist internationalism. It is the direct continuity of the Fourth International, the World Party of Socialist Revolution established under the leadership of Leon Trotsky in 1938 against the Stalinist betrayals of the revolutionary struggles of the working class. The ICFI alone bases its program on the theory of permanent revolution, which was elaborated in its most complete form by Trotsky, and directs the struggles of the working class in both developed and developing countries to the taking of political power and the extension of socialist revolution throughout the world. The Socialist Equality Party is the Australian section of the ICFI.
18. This conference calls on workers and youth, to study the history and program of the world Trotskyist movement, to join and build the Socialist Equality Party, and to commit to the struggle for a socialist future.
A group of French and American scientists publishing in the science journal Nature are reporting success in their attempt to develop software that allows damaged robots to quickly overcome many sustained injuries and continue with their tasks.
A major problem in robotics has long been the inability of the machines to deal with unexpected circumstances, and in the case of damage suffered in the performing of their duties, they will usually just ignore the problem and thus make it all the worse. Now, though, with inspiration drawn from nature itself, the scientists — Antoine Cully, Jean-Baptiste Mouret, and Danesh Tarapore of the Marie Curie University in France, and Jeff Clune from the University of Wyoming — have created software that allows robots to assess their own capabilities, test new movement tactics through trial-and-error, and decide on a going-forward solution, all in just a matter of minutes.
Antoine Cully, the lead author of the Nature piece (entitled " Robots That Can Adapt Like Animals "), writes, "Once damaged, the robot becomes like a scientist.", going on to say "It has prior expectations about different behaviors that might work, and begins testing them. However, these predictions come from the simulated, undamaged robot. It has to find out which of them work, not only in reality, but given the damage."Specifically, with the new software a robot is able to construct a map of their surroundings and their position therein. Then, in the event of an injury or malfunction, the "Intelligent Trial and Error" algorithm engages, through which the robot is able to perform tests on itself and work out a solution that will allow it to continue its tasks.Cully states, "Each behavior it tries is like an experiment and, if one behavior doesn't work, the robot is smart enough to rule out that entire type of behavior and try a new type. For example, if walking, mostly on its hind legs, does not work well, it will next try walking mostly on its front legs. What's surprising is how quickly it can learn a new way to walk. It's amazing to watch a robot go from crippled and flailing around to efficiently limping away in about two minutes."The scientists are confident that their software solution can be of value to a large array of different robot types, providing means by which the machines can achieve greater margins of success, continuing to perform their work until such time as repair is reasonable and convenient."It could enable the creation of robots that can help rescuers without requiring their continuous attention," says co-author Danesh Tarapore.

about
Things are happening. It's a perpetual truth and something of a mysterious, even ominous, sentiment as it applies to XL Middleton's follow up to "Tap Water." Fittingly, the content of "Things Are Happening" strays down darker or more cynical paths than its predecessor, and in doing so takes the modern funk ethos as a whole beyond tried and true formulas such as love songs or spiritual anthems. The grooves remain uptempo; the synth work is still warm and percussive. But, there's a heavier story to tell, and greater truths to face.
The album opens with the uptempo, lowrider-ready "Never Have Too Many Freaks." Upon first glance it's a hedonistic ode to maintaining multitudes of willing women for carnal conquest, but further listens reveal the story of a man in search of love, let down too many times and thus led away from the pursuit of romance. "Look Who's Talkin'" details the strenous nature of socializing as an introvert, with tongue-in-cheek lyrics seated atop a warbly electro-funk instrumental. This theme is explored again, in a more introspective fashion, on the album's closer, "They Don't Wanna Leave." On "Better Friend" (feat. Moniquea), XL plays witness to those who would invade social circles for personal gain - an all too common sight in the music business, perhaps foreshadowing a future hip hop album by dropping a few bars before the song sizzles to a close. Him and Zackey Force Funk team up on "Paradise Of Pavement," an anthem for the highs and lows of living in LA, framed by cosmic chords and grinding synth bass tones. "Purple Sheets" resonates with a slow Linn drum bounce as XL's vocoder finally offers a moment of unbridled love/lust, adding a dimension to the album more akin to "Tap Water" than anything else on the project.
Some might argue that the internalized nature of "Things Are Happening" is badly timed, with the hyper-politicized environment we are now living in almost demanding social commentary in art above all else. However, this album is a reminder that, no matter who our leaders are or what global woes we are facing, we also exist outside of the collective mind and have our own individual stories to tell.

This is an extended version of a story that appears in ESPN The Magazine's March 31 MLB Preview Issue. Subscribe today!
THIS SPRING MLB announced a rule change that all but eliminates the home plate collision. As part of our Confidential series, we surveyed 143 players and found that a strong majority (65 percent) dislikes the new rule. "They're changing baseball," says one veteran catcher. "It's a terrible rule." As you can see from the results below, players also had strong feelings on several other topics.
Who will win the World Series?
NL starting pitcher: "I think if the season had been a little bit longer last year, the Nationals might have won the World Series. So watch out for them. I think it will be the Nationals against the Cardinals in the National League, with the Cardinals winning in seven games, then winning the World Series too."
AL All-Star: "Boston still has a nice roster, but you have to think the Cardinals are just as good as last year, maybe a little better. Michael Wacha looked scary good last postseason; with them and [Adam] Wainwright, the Cardinals will be a handful in a playoff series."
If you could have any player in MLB for the next three years, who would it be?
1. Mike Trout, Angels: 45 percent; 2. Clayton Kershaw, Dodgers: 25 percent; 3. Miguel Cabrera, Tigers: 9 percent
If Mike Trout were a free agent, what salary would you pay him? What about Miguel Cabrera?
Average answer for Trout: $27.8 million per year
Average answer for Cabrera: $27.3 million per year
NL outfielder on Mike Trout: "What he's doing is sick. I'd pay Trout $1 more than Cabrera, whatever that would be. The numbers Trout has put up the past two years are about as good as you'll ever see, and Cabrera is right there with him."
AL reliever on Miguel Cabrera: "He's transcended the game from a hitting aspect and made a position change two times in the last few years."
Do you agree or disagree with Joe Girardi that MLB is ready for an openly gay player?
NL All-Star: "We come in here and we're all trying to do the same thing. Who cares what a guy does in their own time?"
NL infielder: "Are there people who are going to give a guy a hard time? Yeah, but not too many. There will be a couple of jerks. But the majority of people are going to be like, 'So what?'"
Would you vote to kick A-Rod out of the union?
NL All-Star: "I was very disappointed they were suing the union. It's a union that's helped them make so much money and given every advantage to so many players. It's like a fraternity brother saying he's out of the fraternity and going with another one. They had a choice to make, and he's made it about him, not about us together."
AL outfielder: "With A-Rod's drug involvement history being so expansive, I don't have any tolerance for that. I mean, guys who have played the game clean are getting overshadowed by guys who are still getting away with using drugs."
In your best estimate, what percentage of MLB players are still taking PEDs?
AL All-Star: "It's close to zero. The awareness has gotten better each year. Players realize they're not going to get away with it. The system has worked, and the players who were on the fence aren't doing it."
AL outfielder: "Twenty percent. Higher for sure than the number of ones that got caught. Those guys only got caught last year because an employee leaked all the records, otherwise they would have gotten away with it. Look at Ryan Braun. They were on one of the most complex doping regimens there is, so just take that and you know there have to be more."
AL slugger: "I think the number is probably about 10 percent, but that's not counting Adderall as a PED. If you included guys who are using Adderall, wow, that number would be through the roof."
If it were legal in every state and with MLB, would you consider using marijuana for pain relief?
NL reliever: "That's an interesting question. I don't know if there's a sport-related injury that would be helped by that. But anything's possible, as long as you don't have guys lighting up in the bullpen."
Who's the most overrated player in MLB?
AL All-Star: "I like Bryce Harper. I think he's going to be really good. But the attention for them -- and for Puig, to a certain extent -- is overkill. It's just been hype so far."
Which team is the most underrated in baseball?
1. A's: 23 percent; 2. Astros: 10 percent; T3. Pirates, Rays, Royals: 8 percent
AL MVP candidate: "The's have been pretty good, but they're not sexy, so they fly under the radar. No reason they can't get back to the playoffs."
NL veteran: "The Astros are going to be bad again, but I was impressed by what I saw in spring training. They're bad, but they're not 100-loss bad. I think they will surprise some people. They're going in the right direction."
Which team is most overhyped?
NL outfielder: "The Yankees are the center of attention every year, so it's fun to watch them when they're going to be as bad as they will be this year. They're just so old that there's no way that lineup stays together. And even if they all stay healthy, it's hard to see where guys aren't tailing off."
True or false: I feel like MLB's concussion treatment is good.
True: 94 percent; False: 6 percent
AL infielder: "True. The biggest thing they did was not making it a two-week trip to the DL. Now that it's only a week, more guys will come forward if they think they're having a problem."
Would you pay a starting pitcher $215 million?
Yes: 80 percent; No: 20 percent
AL catcher: "If he's named Clayton Kershaw, yeah. With Kershaw, Justin Verlander and Max Scherzer, you saw that not only should you pay for starting pitching, but they're worth it. Now are they worth as much as Mike Trout? No."
Would you be in favor of an MLB salary cap?
Yes: 6 percent; No: 94 percent
NL infielder: "Absolutely not. The owners make so much money as it is. They wouldn't be paying guys what they do if they couldn't make that back."
AL pitcher: "No way. That's a horrible question. If that's really a question, I am ending the interview right now."

If you put Ron Paul and Rick Perry side by side in this presidential race, most people would probably say Paul is the underdog. Will Lutz, managing editor of the Lone Star Report, a conservative political newsletter, says that what Paul supporters lack in numbers they make up for in passion.
"He has a group of supporters that might be 10 percent of the Republican primary voters. But they are very, very enthusiastic," Lutz said.
Audio: Ben Philpott's story for KUT News
That's why Paul almost won the Iowa Straw Poll. Don Zimmerman, a Texas Republican Party Executive Committee member, says Perry supporters worried about what would happen if Texas held its own straw poll.
The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.
"Some of them stood up and objected to the Texas GOP sponsoring a straw poll out of fear that Ron Paul would win and that that might diminish the governor's stature or embarrass the governor somehow," Zimmerman said. "You know I strongly objected to that. I think people should have a right to choose."
Zimmerman is a long time Paul supporter — and worked locally on their 2008 presidential campaign. They don't have a problem with Perry — but he's saying there have been too many times when the promises of Candidate Perry haven't matched the actions of Governor Perry.
"So there are a number of issues of real things that the governor has done that doesn't seem to line up with their rhetoric," they said. "And when you're talking about Congressman Ron Paul's voting record — it's very much in line with the rhetoric."
Lutz says the divisions existed long before Perry entered the presidential campaign. The battle lines were drawn based on the political style of each candidate.
"Rick Perry is about winning. And they are about accomplishing certain objectives," Lutz said. "Ron Paul is about standing for principles. In a nutshell that's the difference between the two."
And there are examples. From the Perry-initiated Trans-Texas Corridor, which Paul had problems with on many levels, to how the country should use its military.
The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.
"Most of Paul's supporters are not fond of these foreign military engagements. Whereas a lot of Perry's supporters are enthusiastically behind them," Lutz said, adding that that no matter what you think of the Perry-led budget cuts this year, Paul would have cut even more.
And if recent interviews on some of the 24-hour news networks are any indication, Paul and Perry will be pitted against each other — whether they intend start a fight or not. But there have been similar schisms, like in the 2008 Texas primary between establishment candidate John McCain and evangelical Mike Huckabee. Zimmerman says the party came together then.
"And at the end of the day I think the party regulars, no matter where they're from, they're gonna get behind their nominee," Zimmerman said.
Their common ground, cliched but true, is a common enemy in the White House.

There are quite a few new features in iOS 10.3, from security fixes through Find My AirPods through the ability for app developers to reply to reviews. Renaud Lienhart – until recently, an Apple engineer working on iOS – shared one more than isn't visually noticeable, but should make devices feel a little faster.
iOS 10.3 feels “snappier” because many animations were slightly tweaked & shortened, for the better. — Renaud Lienhart (@NotoriousBUGS) March 28, 2017
Apple may have good reason for the change …
NordVPN
The Verge suspects this could be an attempt to deal with the issues with animations documented by Chris Pirillo. They reported frame-drops, skips and other issues that sometimes caused animations to fall short of the smooth movements they are intended to deliver.
While the end result may be faster, a major change introduced in iOS 10.3 means that installation takes longer than usual.
The switch to Apple's new file system, APFS, is one of those under-the-hood changes that only gets a bullet-point in most update lists, but is actually a huge deal. It replaces HFS+, a variant on a file system that has been used on Macs for 30 years.
While most of the differences will be largely invisible to users, the update involves a significant amount of changes to the way data is store on your devices, and that takes time. This is the reason that updating to iOS 10.3 takes longer than normal, as MacWorld writer David Sparks noted.

The City, the Newstalk 1010 Radio show Councillor Doug Ford co-hosts with Mayor Rob Ford, came under fire recently from Councillor Paul Ainslie who filed a complaint about the show to the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council Friday, advocating it be “removed from the airways.”
Ainslie said the show breached the council's code of conduct. “This is two full hours where the mayor can rant to their heart's content and talk about anything they want … and I think it has to end,” they told the Star.
But Doug said it's about “community issues,” not bullying or political gain.
“Yes we rant and we go off, absolutely we do, but what we're doing is informing the people of what's going on,” they said at the top of the two-hour show. “We don't pull punches; we tell it the way it is.”
Before I begin, I want to pose a question to the powers that control our society today: Am I allowed to comment on issues that pertain to homosexuality if I don't echo the views of our masters? Will people who read this column willingly twist what I say to justify condemnation of anyone who disagrees with them? They certainly do it to many other people.
Note to those waiting for an excuse to pretend to be offended so they can cram their views down our throats with McCarthyite tactics: Please read precisely what I say and don't draw unwarranted inferences, for there are no hidden meanings here and there is no concealed agenda.
My intent is not to comment on the propriety or normality of homosexual behavior or same-sex marriage, though I will not run from my previously stated position that I oppose formal societal sanctioning of same-sex marriage and believe that marriage is between one man and one woman. So sue me. No, please don't. That is just an expression. Some of you might take that seriously and test your standing, and in this culture, who knows how that would end up?
What greatly concerns me is the increasing discrimination against people whose views don't conform to the dictates of the leftist thought and speech police. Have leftists become so emboldened by their organized bullying of their opponents that they openly support outright discrimination and legal penalties against them? In their self-righteous zeal, have they morphed into the very ogres they crusade against?
So what if someone doesn't believe homosexual marriage ought to be sanctioned? Does that person not have a right to say so without fear of formal reprisal? People who disagree certainly have a right to be offended — if you can call that a right — but do they have a right to be protected from being offended? For example, Miami Dolphins player Don Jones has just been fined and suspended by the Dolphins because they posted two tweets either critical of or making fun of Michael Sam, the first openly gay person to be drafted to the NFL. Jones will be allowed to rejoin the team only after they complete "educational training."
Let's take it a step further. What if someone believes that the Bible teaches that homosexual behavior is sinful and also believes in following the Bible? Are we getting to the point that Big Brother not only gets to disapprove of such beliefs but also is entitled to punish and muzzle those who subscribe to them?
Which is a greater evil and which is a greater threat to our formerly free society, to believe that homosexual behavior is sinful and same-sex marriage ought not to be sanctioned or to ban the expression of such thoughts?
Leftists can deny that they want to control thought — just as they send another "homophobe" to sensitivity training not to teach them to treat all people well but to re-educate them on the issues. Don't fool yourselves. The left isn't simply demanding that we treat all of our fellow men and women with respect; it's insisting that we all march in lock step with its view of the moral propriety of such relationships.
Are there any proponents of same-sex marriage out there who are concerned by the utter totalitarianism we are moving toward? Will they stand up against it, or will they allow their views to be merged into the dangerous groupthink that is enveloping our collective psyche like the blob?
Particularly disturbing is the left's despicable tactic to label as haters those who believe in traditional marriage. This is the worst kind of dishonest intimidation I've witnessed by a large group in our society in years.
I shouldn't even have to say this, but people who oppose same-sex marriage do not hate homosexuals. They don't dislike them. They don't want them to be mistreated. They just don't want society to sanction marriage outside its traditional definition.
Christians believe all kinds of behaviors are sinful but don't consequently hate the sinners, not only because they are commanded not to hate sinners but to love them but also because if they hate sinners, they will hate themselves, as we are all miserable sinners. Is it a stretch for Christians to wonder how long it will be before the expression of some of their views will be outlawed?
This appalling effort to taint opponents as haters is rampant because it is what fuels the mob mentality against dissenters and empowers the thought police.
If leftists are so intent on normalizing homosexual behavior, why are they browbeating us with the issue by glorifying homosexuals, demonizing same-sex marriage opponents and sending those who publicly disagree to re-education camps when they can get away with it? Was it really necessary, for example, for President Obama to give a shoutout to Michael Sam for being the first openly gay player drafted to the NFL? So what? If homosexuality is normal, then just let it go without comment. Why do leftists have to politicize everything?
I don't care that Sam is gay and they will play in the NFL. More power to him. I do care about our society's becoming Stalinist. Do you?
This Guatemala is not a failed state, in that it protects the interests of old families and the people who run it.
Inequality has driven misery and violence in countries across the hemisphere. In other Latin American countries—notably Mexico—there were violent revolutions which, for better or worse, broke the power of the oligarchy and created a functional state and a rule of law, even if a corrupt one.
In Guatemala, that revolution was stillborn. A democratizing movement in the 1940s tried to institute land reform and rein in the oligarchy and U.S. corporations like United Fruit—until after ten years it was crushed by a CIA-backed counter-revolution. The outrage at the counterrevolution drove a Marxist rebellion, and for the next 30 years the Guatemalan Army rampaged throughout the highlands under the auspices of fighting guerrillas.
But often the guerrillas were only the excuse for old-school wars of conquest. That was what happened in the early 1980s in Rio Negro, where the army attacked a village that had refused to make way for a new hydroelectric project, raping and murdering all but one of the inhabitants. Around the same time, in the Ixil Triangle in the western highlands, the (mostly mestizo) army ran a war of genocide against the indigenous Maya. Most estimates say that around 200,000 people were murdered or disappeared during the war.
These people were murdered, by the Guatemalan state, often with medieval savagery. In the highlands, communities were often forced by the Army to hunt for “subversives,” sometimes to hack their own neighbors to death.
This was a war that happened in living memory; the peace accords were signed in only 1996. After the war, Guatemala put on the trappings of a democratic government. The army returned to the barracks. But there was no accounting, and none of the structural things that had driven the conflict changed. Few soldiers were punished for what they had done in the war, and many were decorated—like the current president, Otto Perez Molina, who in the 1980s participated in the scorched earth campaigns against the Ixil Maya. In their 2012 campaign for president, they were supported by most of the feudal families, who still had a stranglehold of most of the land, wealth, and power in the country.
The only model of power that exists in Guatemala is, in other words, terroristic, extra-legal, and dominated by violence. So is it any surprise that after the war, on the streets—where people grasped for the scraps that were left, where children grew up with no chance at wealth and less at respect—pirate organizations like the MS-13 grew?
What we're seeing in Guatemala is not quite, in other words, a crime wave. It's simply the way things have been there for a long time, pushed to the next level. If you are a civilian there, beneath the labels—soldier; gangster; police officer; army; cartel—is but one underlying reality: men with guns who do what they want and take what they want. Your options are to buy your own security and gunmen; to join a gang yourself; or to leave.
And so many leaves. They leave for the reasons that most of our ancestors came to America, of course—the ones who left places like Italy and Ireland and Russia and China. They came for a better life, and part of “better life” meant not having to live someplace where everything belonged to the aristocracy, and where their bodies were at constant risk from violent men. Those things, in a society like Guatemala, are intimately intertwined. It is a sign of how blessed we are that, living in a country where “security” and “economy” and “politics” all come in separate boxes, we have a hard time seeing that.

Personal life
(Japanese:) was an Oscar-and Tony-nominated Japanese-born American actor. Many of their acting roles credited them simply as, omitting their surname.  They are known for their acting role as Akiro the Wizard inandand their voice roles as Aku inand Iroh in thirty episodes of
Mako was born in Kobe, Japan, the son of noted children's book author and illustrator Taro Yashima. Their parents moved to the United States when they were a small child. They joined them there in 1949 and began studying architecture. They joined the military in the 1950s and became a naturalized American citizen in 1956. During their military service, they discovered their theatrical talent and trained at the Pasadena Community Playhouse while on leave.
Mako was married to actor Shizuko Hoshi and had two daughters with her, both of whom are actores. They had three grandchildren.
Career
Mako's first cinema role was in the 1959 film Never So Few. In 1965, frustrated by the limited roles available to themselves and other Asian-American actors, Mako and six others, including James Hong, formed the East West Players theater company, first performing out of a church basement. The company is one of the earliest Asian-American theater organizations and not only provided a venue for Asian-American actors to train and perform, but nurtured many Asian-American playwrights. Mako remained artistic director of the company until 1989.
They were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for their role in the 1966 film The Sand Pebbles and for a Tony Award for Best Leading Actor in a Musical for the 1976 musical Pacific Overtures. In 2005, they had a cameo role in Memoirs of a Geisha. Their last leading role was in the 2005 film Cages, written and directed by Graham Streeter.
Mako was among the actors, producers, and directors interviewed in the 2006 documentary The Slanted Screen, directed by Jeff Adachi, about the representation of Asian and Asian-American men in Hollywood.
Death
Mako died after a brief period of suffering from esophageal cancer. One day prior to their death, Mako had been confirmed to star in the film TMNT as the voice of Splinter. The film's director Kevin Munroe confirmed that Mako had completed their recording before their death. The finished film was dedicated to Mako.
During the Avatar: The Last Airbender episode "The Tales of Ba Sing Se", the segment titled "The Tale of Iroh" features a dedication to Mako as they were the voice actor for Iroh for Books One and Two. They were also featured in the Memoriam Montage in the 79th Academy Awards.
Legacy
The character Mako in The Legend of Korra is named after them in dedication.[2]

As Toronto elementary and secondary teachers gear up for a Tuesday rally — one scheduled for after school, now that daytime protests have been deemed illegal — their unions are facing increasing calls to bring back extracurricular activities or risk losing public support. And it's not just students and parents asking for the return of sports and clubs in Ontario schools — one of the province's best-known labour leaders also says now is the time. “It's very difficult to accomplish anything if you don't have public support, and I'm concerned that they're losing it because of the withdrawal of extracurricular activities,” said Buzz Hargrove, former president of the Canadian Auto Workers Union. While they believe it is Dalton McGuinty who deserves the “lion's share” of the blame for the current strife, by forcing contracts on teachers through Bill 115, the loss of support for both teachers and the Liberal government could lead to a Tory premier. “It's kind of a pox on all your houses by the general public, and unfortunately that could very well lead in the election to Tim Hudak and the Tories, who are going to be much tougher with teachers and unions.”

They said the unions should focus now on the Liberal leadership contest and upcoming election. “I'd also try to convince the new premier to come back to the table and see if there's a way to resolve some of the issues the teachers are so offended by,” they said. Hammond, who was not available for an interview, tweeted Monday: “We hope to meet with the next Premier & have a full and frank discussion about a number of issues.”
That sentiment was echoed by Michael Barrett, president of the Ontario Public School Boards' Association, who said, “I see no movement at all until that point, after the 25th, the Liberal leadership convention.” One side “has to blink,” they added. “But I think that's a tough one, because teachers don't have much left in their arsenal” after the Ontario Labour Relations Board ruled early last Friday that the elementary teachers' one-day protest was actually an illegal strike, and shut it down. “But public opinion is shifting,” noted Barrett, a trustee with the Durham District School Board. “I'm starting to see a lot of anger. There's still a lot of support, but I'm seeing more anger with regards to the situation.” Toronto District School Board Trustee Howard Goodman, in their newsletter to parents, said they can't understand the teacher unions' tactics.

“Personally, their position baffles me, as I see it reducing support for the valid complaints that the unions (and boards) have raised about Bill 115.” Advocacy and research group People for Education's forum on this topic said webviews are up as more and more parents talk about the issue. Annie Kidder said parents are now talking about “what teachers would have to do in order to get parents' support back,” with the suggestion that if extracurriculars resume, parents would be willing to organize a demonstration in support of teachers and against Bill 115. “I think, as this goes on, it becomes harder for parents to stay completely on-side,” they added. “Even for the ones who were, after a while you're not so much remembering a wrong that's been done in some people's minds, but you're seeing the continued day-to-day impact in your kids' school.” While Hargrove does not believe that the leadership of the Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario is too militant — they say they are reflecting the mood of teachers — they do think most teachers would support the return of extracurricular activities. They added that ETFO and its president Sam Hammond should have remained at the bargaining table longer before Bill 115 was passed. “I haven't talked to Sam Hammond, but the government claims they were only at the bargaining table for an hour ... I think if I'd been heading up the organization we would have tried to make the best of a bad situation by staying at the bargaining table,” they said.

In the aftermath of any mass shooting -- and, grotesquely, there are many from which to choose -- our national conversation is almost immediately polluted by all-consuming political demagoguery, often before the facts of the case are established. We've developed a post-shooting playbook, under which millions of Americans rush to ideological battle stations to rage at each other, long before they've completed the human process of grappling with heartsickness. It should go without saying that citizens of all political stripes and backgrounds are horrified by the senseless and tragic loss of life -- yet it must be said, because the Left's portion of the playbook involves questioning, denigrating, or even denying the authenticity of others' grief. In sane, normal, wonderful America, people channel their shock and grief by queuing up to give blood, offering up prayers for the wounded and the grieving, or contributing to GoFundMe accounts earmarked for the families of the slain and survivors. In hyper-partisan America, combatants funnel their anger at each other.
On the Right, vigilant sentinels seek out the worst left-wing overreactions and hot takes on social media -- often extracted from obscure accounts with tiny followings -- serving them to the masses as touchstones for turnkey outrage. Because anger at "the other side" is emotionally familiar, and is certainly easier than dealing with the evil that has been perpetrated. This is not to say that opinion leaders who fan the flames of ignorance, blind fury, or scapegoating shouldn't be called out or held accountable. They should. But the expanding cottage industry of self-affirming outrage does a lot of harm along the way. On the Left, it has become standard operating procedure to either diminish pro-Second Amendment conservatives' expressions of pain as empty and hypocritical, or to blame the Right for the bloodshed outright. Because, again, anger at "the other side" is emotionally familiar, and certainly easier than dealing with the evil that has been perpetrated. It's all so profoundly unhealthy and depressing, as incidents of national tragedy now automatically and instantly trigger polarizing and brutal rounds of ritual cathartic blaming, one tribe against the other. These leave nobody satisfied, but render each "side" more suspicious and resentful of the other than ever.
We are still learning the horrific (and, quite frankly, extremely bizarre) details of what happened in Las Vegas, the site of the deadliest shooting massacre in modern American history. Funeral arrangements are being attended to. Gunshot wounds are being treated. Loved ones are grappling with their shattered new realities. And, sure enough, some on the Left are back to their shrill, shameless moral bullying, under which people who do not embrace their policy preferences as an efficacious response to the horror are cast as self-interested cynics, unfeeling and brainwashed right-wing droids, or even accessories to murder. Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, whose genuine and natural outrage over the murder of innocents often leads them to say ugly things about those who disagree with their political prescriptions, quickly revisited the well-worn trope that their Congressional colleagues who hold differing views are "cowardly:"
To my colleagues: your cowardice to act cannot be whitewashed by thoughts and prayers.
None of these ends unless we do something to stop it. — Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) October 2, 2017
It couldn't possibly be that they simply hold their own deeply-held principles and views of the constitution that don't align with Murphy's. Or that they campaigned as Second Amendment defenders, and feel an obligation to honor fundamental promises to the people who elected them. No, they must be "scared" of crossing the NRA and its (relatively paltry) "blood money." This is the worst kind of motive-impugning nastiness that directly harms our ability to debate important challenges, let alone resolve them. But cheap intellectual shortcuts (our opponents secretly agree with us, but are cowering to special interests) are simpler to rationalize than harder truths (our opponents' firmly-rooted convictions about this issue are largely irreconcilable with our own firmly-rooted convictions). After they were literally shot at by a radical leftist at a Congressional baseball practice several months ago, Republican Congressman Mo Brooks was asked by reporters whether the attempted mass assassination had changed their mind on gun rights. The creepy premise of this question, asked shortly after the shooting, was essentially, did this deranged nut's efforts to murder you persuade you to adopt their views? Brooks' response:
"The Second Amendment right to bear arms is to ensure that we always have a republic. And as with any other constitutional provision in the Bill of Rights, there are adverse aspects to each of those rights that we enjoy as people. And what we just saw here is one of the bad side effects of someone not exercising those rights properly...We're not going to get rid of freedom of speech because some people say some really ugly things that hurt other people's feelings. We're not going to get rid of Fourth Amendment search and seizure rights because it allows some criminals to go free who should be behind bars. These rights are there to protect Americans, and while each of them has a negative aspect to them, they are fundamental to our being the greatest nation in world history."
Is Mo Brooks a "coward," Senator? How about Steve Scalise, who remains a steadfast supporter of the Second Amendment as they re-learns how to walk? Or the pro-gun combat medic who saved Scalise's life by slowing the bleeding before first responders arrived that morning? If that's really what you think of them, feel free to smear them to their faces, rather than blasting out preening missives via smart phone, signaling your indignation and exquisite virtue to masses of head-nodding followers. If conservatives wanted to use Murphy's shabby approach against him, we might question whether they privately relish mass shootings because they offer exploitable opportunities to raise their political profile and ingratiate themselves to their party's national grassroots. We should resist the temptation toward in-kind slander, however, because jumping into an arms race of motive-impugning is debasing and soulless. Murphy's overwhelming reaction to news of a homicidal slaughter is one of revulsion -- just as ours is. We all share that. Not to be outdone by Murphy, the Speaker of California's left-wing legislative assembly flat-out accused gun rights advocates and pro-gun Republican political figures of complicity:
California Assembly speaker says shooter didn't act alone: "Every gun lobbyist and the politicians who do their bidding were all in that room with him." https://t.co/qHxxtpvl5E — Jonathan J. Cooper (@jjcooper) October 2, 2017
This is disgusting. Bernie Sanders did not help their former campaign volunteer pull the trigger as they mowed down Congressional Republicans at a public park (long gone are the Left's calls for unity and restraint after that harrowing episode). MSNBC's Rachel Maddow didn't drive the getaway car after a fan of theirs murdered young Muslims in North Carolina. And the next time ISIS strikes in a Western city, liberal politicians criticized by some conservatives as "soft" on radical Islamism will not have served as de facto 'co-conspirators' in the vicious plot. Shame on Anthony Rendon. Their rhetoric isn't merely mean-spirited; it deliberately tears the nation apart in emotionally fraught moments that call for collective solemnity and sadness (this sentence too often applies to our president, as well). And for what? For politics. This brand of despicable finger-pointing is not meant to persuade; just the opposite. It's meant to deepen our increasingly-intractable cultural feuds that further foreclose our capacity for rationality and compromise. That might make for effective politics from the perspective of a very liberal politician from a very liberal area, but to the rest of us -- including those of us who aren't reflexively "gun people" -- it sounds a lot like an equally-poisonous strain of Roy Moore-ism. A form of knee-jerk, intolerant Leftist theocracy. I'll leave you with a reminder of why conservatives are so often justified in their mistrust of the media, especially on hot button issues on which the overwhelming majority of journalists side with Democrats:
Been a journo for a while now. It has become impossible to report just, "facts" about gun violence. The fact is America needs gun control. — Cal Perry (@CalNBC) October 2, 2017
That's not how 'facts' work. And it's not how journalism is supposed to work, either. In this toxic political environment, and in the face of such inexplicable suffering and anguish, it's difficult to guard against demoralization. My inclination is to say 'Lord help us,' but that would risk touching off a cascade of 'your prayers aren't enough, coward' sneering and scolding. So, Lord help us. We need it.
SoundCloud has announced that it will be laying off 40% of its staff and closing its offices in San Francisco and London, while its main offices in Berlin and New York will remain open.
"We need to ensure our path to long-term, independent success,"co-founder Alex Ljun wrote in a statement posted on the company's website on Thursday. "And in order to do this, it requires cost cutting."
Last year, Spotify was reportedly in "advanced talks" to acquire the Berlin-based music distribution platform and, this week, a New York Post report suggested that companies including Apple, Google, and Deezer are interested in buying the company.
In total, the company is laying off 173 of its 420 employees. "By reducing our costs and continuing our revenue growth, we're on our path to profitability and in control of SoundCloud's independent future," Ljun concluded in their statement.
A representative for SoundCloud was not immediately available for comment.
More than two dozen human rights organizations and criminal justice reform groups from around the globe joined together in a full-throated condemnation of the Indonesian government's execution of eight nonviolent drug offenders.
"Wherever they occur, executions for nonviolent offenses violate human rights,” a letter sent to President Barack Obama and other high-ranking federal officials Tuesday from the groups, which include nearly 30 other non-governmental organizations from the United States and around the world, reads. The letter demands that the U.S. do more to ensure its international aid used in the fight against drug trafficking does not contribute to cases in which people are put to death for nonviolent drug offenses.
In the face of repeated pleas for mercy from the families of those that were executed as well as the United Nations and foreign governments around the world, the eight convicted drug smugglers faced a firing squad at around 12:25 a.m. Wednesday, Indonesian-time.
“Indonesians should be ashamed of their government's atrocity earlier today," said Ethan Nadelmann, executive director of the drug policy reform group the Drug Policy Alliance, a signee of the letter. "The execution of these eight people for non-violent drug offenses will do nothing to reduce the availability of drugs in Indonesia or other countries, or protect people from drug abuse."
"All it demonstrates," Nadelmann added, "is the savagery of which governments are capable."
The executed included Australians Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, Nigerians Martin Anderson, Raheem Agbaje Salami, Okwuduli Oyatanze, and Silvester Obiekwe Nwolise, Brazilian Rodrigo Gularte and Indonesian Zainal Abidin. They were sentenced to death for a variety of offenses ranging from intent to distribute marijuana to transportation of heroin in the country.
Indonesian authorities granted Mary Jane Veloso, who was also slated for execution, a last-minute reprieve after a woman who recruited Veloso to transport five pounds of heroin "voluntarily surrendered" to police in the Philippines on Tuesday.
Sukumaran was found guilty, along with Chan, for smuggling drugs and organizing the so-called "Bali Nine" drug smuggling ring. During their stay in prison, Sukumaran became an artist. Their final painting, a heart dripping with blood, was signed by all nine individuals sentenced to death:

"Today we lost Myuran and Andrew. Our sons, our brothers," a statement from the families of Chan and Sukumaran released late Tuesday read, according to ABC News.
David Borden, founder of StoptheDrugWar.org and coordinator of the letter of condemnation, said that the time has come for the federal government to give priority to human rights in international drug policy. "We shouldn't be training people, writing checks and handing information over to countries that have the death penalty for nonviolent offenses without asking that human rights and our own constitutional values be respected," Borden told HuffPost in an emailed statement.
The White House did not return HuffPost's request for comment.

Director Michael Botticelli, Office of National Drug Control Policy

The Honorable John Conyers, Ranking Member, House Judiciary Committee Cc: Ambassador Budi Bowoleksono, Embassy of The Republic of Indonesia in the US We, the undersigned US organizations, international organizations that do work in the US, and supporting organizations in other countries, write to express our grave concern over Indonesia's execution of Marco Archer Cardoso Moreira (Brazil), Ang Kiem Soei (Netherlands), Daniel Enemuo (Nigeria), Namaona Denis (Malawi), Rani Andriani (Indonesia), Tran Thi Bich Hanh (Vietnam), Martin Anderson alias Belo (Ghana), Raheem Agbaje Salami (Nigeria), Okwudili Oyatanze (Nigeria), Rodrigo Gularte (Brazil), Myuran Sukumaran (Australia), Andrew Chan (Australia), Zainal Abidin (Indonesia), Silvester Obikwe (Nigeria), and for more than 40 other prisoners remaining on Indonesia's death row for drug offenses. As organizations concerned with US programs and policy, we further relate our concern that the US may inadvertently contribute to executions by extending counternarcotics assistance and cooperation to countries that apply the death penalty for nonviolent offenses. Assisting any government in a manner that leads to violations of the basic human rights of its citizens and foreign nationals is at odds with US values. Unfortunately while these Indonesian prisoners are currently the most-publicized cases of drug-related government executions, similar executions occur in other countries as well, with little to no international outcry. For example, it was recently report that eight Iranians were hanged for drug offenses as well. Reports indicate that Indonesia's death row includes individuals who were low-level participants in the trade and suffered from addiction or mental illness. Wherever they occur, executions for nonviolent offenses violate human rights. The United Nations has called for the gradual abolition of the death penalty , but has particularly opposed its application to nonviolent offenses. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime noted in a 2010 document that "the use of the death penalty for those convicted solely of drug-related or economic offenses raises grave human rights concerns." In 2011, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights wrote that "use of the death penalty for nonviolent acts... constitutes a violation of international human rights law," specifically citing Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In the United States, a country that retains the death penalty, the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution (no "cruel and unusual punishments") has been ruled to preclude the imposition of the death penalty for nonviolent offenses. Indonesian organizations have also argued that executions for drug offenses damage rather than protect the public's health. In a January Open Letter to Pres. Joko Widodo, over 30 NGOs wrote, "[T]he death penalty and executions [authorized in legislation passed in 1997] ha[ve] failed to lower the crime rate [or] to reduce the... number of addicts or drug users in Indonesia... [E]xecutions [of] illicit [drug] trafficking offenders [are] actually detrimental to the community [of] addicts [because] big drug dealers... continue to seek, find and exploit other vulnerable individuals who are forced to become... drug courier[s]." Although the impact of US foreign assistance in leading to death penalty executions for nonviolent offenses remains to be assessed, a 2014 report found that assistance provided by European governments to Iranian and Pakistani law enforcement agencies was linked to more than 3,000 death sentences in those countries. The report noted that the governments of Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom, had withdrawn funding for supply side anti-drug operations in Iran, and that Denmark's Trade and Development Minister had stated that "the donations are leading to executions." It is likely that US law enforcement assistance to countries with the death penalty for drug offenses contributes to executions for nonviolent offenses as well. When, on January 18, Indonesia began executing the 64 drug prisoners on death row for drug offenses, a number of governments recalled their ambassadors from Indonesia, and have since expressed their condemnation of Indonesia's policy. Additionally, attorneys have charged that Pres. Joko Widodo has violated Indonesia's clemency statute by failing to give individual consideration to these defendants' clemency petitions. In February, UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon urged Indonesian Pres. Widodo to halt the executions. Meanwhile, however, the US has remained silent. Accordingly, we call on the US State and Justice Departments to: • urge Indonesia, and other countries as appropriate, to halt executions for nonviolent offenses, and other countries as appropriate; • investigate whether US intelligence or other assistance – as provided by the DEA's Jakarta Country Office, established in 2011 , and other US agencies – has contributed to the incarceration of defendants on Indonesia's death row or that of other countries; • condition US assistance and cooperation on an agreement that the recipient government will not impose the death penalty for nonviolent offenses in cases in which US resources may have aided in the capture or prosecution of a defendant, with appropriate safeguards and verification procedures by both the US and recipient government; and • establish procedures to ensure not only that US law enforcement and intelligence agencies consistently respect international human rights norms in their operations, but that US assistance provided to other countries' agencies also do not support or foster human rights violations. We acknowledge the complexity of factors that involved in international relations, and we recognize that Indonesia is a strategic US partner in the region. Nevertheless, the US has an obligation to take the moral high ground on this issue, by leveraging its considerable influence as a partner to encourage Indonesia and other countries to move away from draconian punishments and toward a more humane justice system. At a minimum the US should address the role that our international law enforcement presence may contribute to disproportionate and rights-abusing criminal justice policies abroad. − END – US & Global NGOs: A New PATH (Parents for Addiction Treatment & Healing)

Tennessee coach Butch Jones can't catch a break these days.
The Volunteers haven't scored a touchdown in their last 10 quarters, and that may not change on Saturday afternoon against No. 1 Alabama in Tuscaloosa.
However, one ambitious pilot in Tuscaloosa wants Jones to know that they still have at least one supporter left — their mom:
The best part is that the banner misspells “you” as “yuo,” making it even funnier.
The website at the end of the banner goes to a Chattanooga law firm, but it's unclear why they're sending a message to Jones.
If Alabama does take care of business against the Vols on Saturday afternoon, Jones's tenure in Knoxville could come to an end.
Check out Saturday's action at 2:30 p.m. Central time on CBS.

An apartment building in Neve Sha'anan neighborhood near the bus boarding platforms to the Tel Aviv central bus station. The station includes a fairly complex system of bridges, roads and interchanges to help buses to reach the various floors.
Tel Aviv central bus station, also known as the new central bus station (התחנה המרכזית החדשה, HaTahana HaMerkazit HaHadasha), is the main bus station of Tel Aviv, Israel. Located in the south of the city, it was opened on August 17, 1993. It is the 2nd largest bus station in the world. The station in Tel Aviv covers 230,000 m2 and a total area of 44,000 m2.
History [ edit ]
Construction began on December 14, 1967, but work was prematurely halted due to financial difficulties.[citation needed] The building was finally inaugurated on August 18, 1993. The inauguration ceremony was attended by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and the mayor of Tel Aviv Shlomo Lahat. The station's prolonged construction period gave it the title of white elephant among the public, and in light of this, the inauguration ceremony included releasing a white elephant balloon into the sky.[1]
The station, which was designed by Ram Karmi (1967) and completed (1993) by the architects Yael Rothshild, and Moti Bodek, opened with six floors, and the initial plan called for buses to travel to all six. In practice, only four of the six floors were used as bus terminals, and in 1998 the first- and second-floor platforms were transferred to the newly opened 7th floor. This act killed off the remaining businesses on the first two floors and hurt businesses on the third.[1]
In January 2012, the owners of the station filed for its bankruptcy.[1]
Specifications [ edit ]
The complex includes a shopping mall serviced by 29 escalators and 13 elevators with over 1,000 shops and restaurants. Only three of the seven floors are used as a bus terminal. The main entrances are on the north and east sides of 4th floor. Most intercity buses leave from a departure hall on the north (main) wing on 6th floor. On the 7th floor, which was an addition to the original building, there is a departure hall for local buses (to destinations within Gush Dan) on the north wing, and another departure hall for intercity buses (to destination in the Galilee) on the south wing. The wings of this level are completely separated.
The station serves Egged, Veolia (formerly Connex), Superbus, Metropoline, Afikim and Nateev Express intercity bus routes as well as local Dan, Egged and Kavim city and suburban buses.[citation needed] In 2008, approximately 100,000 people visited the station building every day.[2] In 2018 this number went down to 80,000.[3]
It covers 230,000 m2 and a total area of 44 dunams (44,000 m2).[4][5]
Tel Aviv central bus station is located near Tel Aviv HaHagana Railway Station, but there is no direct link between them.
Problems and criticism [ edit ]
The Tel Aviv central bus station has suffered from some neglect and disrepair. As the station is located in the poorest part of the city, numerous drug addicts, prostitutes and homeless people take residence there on occasion. In 2010, there was a murder and three cases of rape in the station.[1]
The station has also been criticized for its complicated design which makes it hard to get around, and for being built in a neighborhood that didn't fit its character.[2]

A 25-year-old man is in custody after they were arrested early this morning for breaking into parked cars in a North Seattle neighborhood.
Just before 6:00 am on Monday, July 3rd, officers responded to the area of N. 88th Street and Densmore Avenue North for a report of a man breaking into parked cars. A witness observed the man lean against a parked car, break a window and lean into the car, retrieving an item. The witness recorded the activity with their phone and then called 911.
Officers arrived and located the suspect a few blocks away. The witness positively identified the detained person as the correct suspect. The suspect was found to be in possession of numerous credit cards and checks belonging to other people. Officers searched the area and located six additional parked cars with broken windows.
The suspect was arrested and later interviewed by a detective from the Major Crimes Task Force. The suspect was later booked into the King County Jail.
The Shells are constructed out of ABS -- the same plastic used to create Lego -- which is fed into the printer from a spool. About a pound of ABS goes into the shell, gear shaft and other printed components -- which, at MakerBot's going rate for raw material, would run you around $22 or so. The company recommends a specific brand of RC car that can be purchased from Target for around $15, putting the total cost of components at under $40. MakerBot isn't actually selling the Turtle Shell Racers, so much as the components here. You can download the plans for the whole thing from the company's Thingiverse site.Once printed, the racers are pretty solid. They stood up to a lot of abuse this weekend at Maker Faire, being driven around the track by scores of children with a penchant for crashing things into each other. They're not quick, by any means -- keep in mind, that this is a pound of plastic on top of a low-end car. We also had a bit of trouble turning the things, but again, some of this can likely be chalked up to abuse suffered over the weekend.All in all, the Turtle Shell Racers are a pretty great experience -- one certainly recommended for anyone with a 3D printer lying around. For those who haven't gotten around to picking one up, however, the entry price of such a device is likely a deterrent. Still, watching a product like this make the transformation from idea to real world object is about as good a selling point for the technology as we've seen.

Editor's note: For the official announcement, click here.
FERC Commissioner John Norris will be announcing this week that they are leaving the agency and rumors are that President Barack Obama will tap the chairperson of the Arkansas Public Service Commission, Colette Honorable, to replace Norris, according to sources.
Norris, who in June indicated they would not seek another term at the commission, had been passed over for the chairpersonship position, which is now held by Cheryl LaFleur, who will hold the position for about nine months.
The question of who would fill the top slot position at the agency has been an unusually contentious one. It started when former Colorado Public Utilities Commission Chairman Ron Binz had to withdraw their name from consideration in October 2013 after facing fierce opposition from certain industry segments and conservative political groups.
The White House then selected someone from inside the agency, the head of FERC enforcement, Norman Bay, to take the position, but not until LaFleur has some time as the official chairperson. They had been serving as acting chairperson for some time. Bay will serve as commissioner until April 2015, when they will take the chairpersonship seat.
Norris, a Democrat, was nominated by Obama in 2010 to fill the remaining term of another commissioner and was reconfirmed in 2012 for a full term expiring in June 2017. They did not respond to a request for comment Aug. 6. Honorable, the head of National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners who has often been rumored to be headed to the federal agency, was not immediately available for comment.

The world has made remarkable progress against hunger. Between 1990 and 2015, the world hunger rate was cut in half. Ending hunger is truly within our reach.
However, a report released last month by the United Nations gives us pause.
The report, "State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World," found that in 2016, the world saw its first increase in the number of people experiencing hunger and malnutrition in almost a decade – a number now totaling 815 million people.
According to the report, this increase, fueled by conflict and climate change, comes at a time when the Trump Administration and some in Congress are calling for deep, unprecedented cuts to the U.S. foreign assistance budget. If Congress approves these cuts, it could be devastating and deadly to millions of women and children around the world.
As we celebrate the World Food Prize awards this week, it's important to take stock of the accomplishments of U.S. foreign assistance over the past several decades. We call on our leaders to continue prioritizing these investments – in FY18 and beyond – especially for those who depend on it for their daily survival.
Right now, near famine conditions continue to threaten at least 20 million people in Yemen, Somalia, South Sudan and northeast Nigeria.
Hunger is increasing in places experiencing the greatest turmoil and conflict. These areas, referred to as “fragile states,” are difficult places to work, and in some instances, have been highly vulnerable to the rise of extremism. But as the U.N. report makes clear, the international community must continue humanitarian relief and, as much as possible, help people in these countries maintain their livelihoods.
For example, in 2016, Ethiopia was in the midst of a food crisis. But unlike a generation earlier, the country didn't see widespread starvation and instability. America's smart foreign assistance is a major reason why.
In 2011, Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere (CARE) began implementing a United States Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded program called GRAD (Graduation with Resilience to Achieve Sustainable Development). It helped 63,000 of Ethiopia's poorest families climb out of poverty for good.

It includes the family of Admasu and Melkam. They couldn't harvest enough food from their farm, even though it was the size of three soccer fields. With the help of the project, they harvested nearly 4,000 pounds of potatoes and sold the spuds for a $525 profit.
But the success didn't end there. With the help of their village savings group, Admasu and Melkam invested their earnings in drought-resistant barley seeds. It yielded another successful crop. The profit helped to triple the family's income. It enabled them to provide more nutritious meals for their families and improve their children's health.
Currently, the U.S. spends roughly one percent of the federal budget on foreign assistance. It is a good investment of our tax dollars in terms of lives saved, the development outcomes achieved, and for our national security.
We know smart investments now will pay off in the future. The world is safer and stronger because of the progress we have made against hunger together. Now is not the time to pull back on our investments in development and diplomacy. We must continue to invest in the resilience of poor people in the most troubled countries in the world, even as we seek to address the underlying causes of the conflicts that are making them more vulnerable – for their sakes, as well as our own.

It goes without saying that 2015 was an incredibly busy year for all of us behind the scenes here at the Left Field Brewery. From getting the brewery up and running to opening the Tap Room and Bottle Shop full time, to undergoing expansion with the addition of two new fermenters and a new bottling line, we've hardly taken a moment to sit back and reflect.
Today, February 5, 2016, marks 1 year to the day since we brewed our first batch of beer – Lead Off Single – right here in our very own brewery. Most breweries would celebrate this as their first anniversary but for us it isn't that straightforward. Our story involves making a not-so-common leap from contract brewery to bricks and mortar brewery and because of this, our anniversary date is a bit of a moving target. You see, our first ever batch of beer, Eephus, was brewed under contract at Grand River brewery on February 14, 2013. On top of all that, we gained access to and started construction at 36 Wagstaff Drive on February 1, 2014. Because of all this, we tend to look at the entire month of February as our anniversary month.
Naturally, such an important month in our history deserves a special beer to mark the occasion. With that in mind, we decided to brew not one, but two celebratory anniversary beers for release this month.
Anniversary No. 3 is a strong Saison brewed with a French Saison Ale Yeast and dry hopped with Nelson Sauvin hops from New Zealand. A warm fermentation gives layers of tropical fruit and delicate spice, and this unique and audacious hop variety lends complimentary flavours of white wine and gooseberry. Expect this beer to be aromatic, dry, and filled with character.
7.6% ABV / 45 IBU
First & Third is our interpretation of the Berliner Weisse style of sour ale. We kettle-soured a mash made from 50% wheat with our house strain of lactobacillus. We made use of a blend of Belgian and American ale yeasts to produce a beer with light body, nuances of stone fruit, very low bitterness and clean, gentle tartness reminiscent of lemonade. In Berlin these beers are traditionally enjoyed with a sweet fruit or herbal syrup – we look forward to re-imagining this experience on our home turf.
4.0% ABV / 8 IBU
Anniversary No. 3 and First & Third will both be available in our Bottle Shop and Tap Room starting at noon on Thursday February 25th.
Other news and brewery happenings this month include;
Friday Casks
To keep the celebration rolling all month long, we'll be tapping a special cask every Friday at 5pm. Here's the line-up:
February 5th / Maris* dry hopped with Nelson Sauvin
February 12th / Stout with coriander and orange peel
February 19th / Stout with ginger
February 26th / Eephus with vanilla bean
Sweet Jesus Mocha Marshmallow Stout
We're down to about half of the original number of bottles of this sweet treat in the Bottle Shop. For a limited time, you can also find Sweet Jesus on tap at the brewery, appropriately served with a roasted marshmallow, or at all three La Carnita locations and Home of the Brave.
Growlers
You've asked us about a million times for growlers and we're very happy to report that starting today, our Growlers shop is officially open. We've hand filled a limited number of 750mL swing-top growlers to help fill some of the gaps in our Bottle Shop and to make beers available to take home that would have otherwise only been available to enjoy on tap.
Just like a growler, these bottles need to be kept cold and enjoyed fresh, ideally within 5 days. You will be asked to sign a waiver agreeing that you will not store the beer for more than 48 hours – not really, but don't tell our brewers.
Also, we will only be pre-filling our own 750mL swing-top bottles and will not be offering any walk-in fills directly from the taps in our own bottles or otherwise.
Food
More great news on this front, especially if you're in to delicious cheeses. We've partnered with our neighbours, The Pantry, and are now offering a small selection of Ontario cheeses in our Bottle Shop. Each variety has been specially selected to pair well with beers that are available both on tap and to go.
If you've been in the shop lately, you may have noticed that we've also recently upped our snack game and are now offering small bags of Neal Brothers chips to enjoy here or to go.
As always, feel free to BYO meal or to have food delivered to the Tap Room. Simply ask one of our team members to take a glance at the growing binder of local takeout menus stashed behind the bar.
Valentines Day / Family Day Weekend
The only thing we're able to tell you at this point is that there will be chocolate.
More details to be announced soon!
So much excitement around here in just one short month. A million thanks to our incredibly awesome customers and to all the wonderful friends that we've made here in the Tap Room and Bottle Shop during our first year of business. We hope to see you out to celebrate with us at some point this month.
Cheers,
Team Left Field

When news broke over the past week that someone was conducting a local push poll about public-safety benefits costs, representatives for both the city and the Greater San Antonio Chamber of Commerce were quick to say they had no involvement with the poll and knew nothing about it.
But a voice message from city spokesperson Di Galvan to chamber President (and former City Councilman) Richard Perez, obtained by the San Antonio Express-News, suggests the chamber was involved in the poll and that City Manager Sheryl Sculley was aware of the chamber's efforts.
Push polls are telemarketing ploys used to alter public opinion in the guise of measuring it. The recent local poll angered police and fire union reps because its questions were based on presumptions that the unions were destroying the city's fiscal equilibrium.
Public-safety costs consume more than 66 percent of the city's general-fund budget, and Sculley has warned that rising health care costs for active-duty officers are not sustainable.
According to a North Side woman who said they received a push-poll call on Monday, these were among the loaded questions asked by the caller: Did they support or oppose the city having to increase property taxes to pay for public-safety health benefits? Did they agree or disagree with the union being able to negotiate specific benefits for its members, which could cause the city to lose its AAA bond rating and cost San Antonio business opportunities?
In a Friday interview with the Express-News, Perez, an outspoken Sculley supporter, said the chamber had nothing to do with this poll.
But Galvan's voice message tells a different story.
“Councilman Perez, this is Di Galvan,” they say in their message. “I hope you're doing well. Happy holidays. Hey, I just received an email from Dillon Collier at KENS, and he's asking about a poll being conducted in the community regarding public-safety contract negotiations.
“And they were asking me for details about it and I didn't know that the chamber was doing this. Sheryl did, but it was not communicated to me. I just wanted to connect with you and see if I can ask Dillon to call you about this, or how you want me to handle this.”
The push poll comes in the wake of Mayor Ivy Taylor's Dec. 1 proposal for a “holiday truce” in the acrimonious collective-bargaining process between the city and the San Antonio Police Officers Association.
SAPOA has produced TV and radio advertisements blasting Sculley for their rich salary package (which in 2015 will be $400,000, plus a one-time $65,000 bonus) and for filing a lawsuit challenging the evergreen clause in police and fire contracts (which maintain the existing terms for 10 years after their contracts expire).
The ads also have called on Sculley to resign.
If, as the phone message suggests, the chamber was involved in the recent push poll with Sculley's blessing, it would constitute a clear defiance of Taylor's truce plan.
Galvan said Friday that they “misspoke” in the phone message if they gave the impression that the chamber sponsored the poll or that Sculley knew that it was being done.
“I didn't have any details,” Galvan said. “I was just giving a friend (Perez) a heads-up.”
Galvan added, “Sheryl and I had never spoken about this. And that's the honest truth. The city is not involved in any way.”
Perez has been one of Sculley's most ardent backers since they came to San Antonio from Phoenix in 2005. As a council member, they served as then-Mayor Phil Hardberger's go-between, meeting Sculley at International Airport when they came to San Antonio for a secret visit to meet with city leaders and consider whether they wanted to take the city manager job.
They drew boos from rank-and-file police and firefighters in September at the City Council's annual budget session when they spoke in favor of Sculley's tough stance on containing police and fire benefits costs.
“We would never do a push poll,” Perez said Friday. “That's not the way we do things. We're all about asking, and hoping, and praying that the unions will get back to the table with the city staff and work something out.”

Pwning a Spammer's Keylogger
Recently, while scrounging around our spam traps, I spotted this ordinary piece of malicious spam. It uses a very simple social engineering trick, speculating about Obama's sexual orientation and a link to a supposed picture to prove it.
There was nothing special about this spam but the link with a double extension file named "you.jpg.exe" was something worth investigating. So out of curiosity, I downloaded the file and checked out what it does.
First thing I did was to find out what the file really was. Of course, it was not an image file of Obama but rather a self-extracting RAR file.
Opening the file through a RAR extracting tool revealed the files inside it.
I extracted "you.jpg.exe" and inspected each of the files inside it but found they were actually encoded. So I run "you.jpg.exe" in our test machine and observed. When run, the image below popped up. Hmmm, definitely not Obama.
In the background, the following files were installed in the Windows System32 folder:
bpk.dat
bpk.exe
bpkhk.dll
bpkr.exe
inst.dat
pk.bin
Also an autorun registry was created:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run bpk = <%windir%\System32\bpk.exe>
Googling for the dropped files gave me a hint that what was installed was a keylogger and in particular a commercial version from Blazing Tools called Perfect Keylogger (PK). This keylogger program can be legitimately purchased and used, ostensibly for monitoring your kids' or employees' browsing habits, etc. As you can imagine, PK can also be used for badness.
I almost ended the analysis here. But a moment later, more interesting stuff appeared. The keylogger connected to a remote FTP server, and this allowed me to intercept the attacker's FTP credentials.
Using the intercepted credentials, I logged in to the FTP server and found many folders containing monitoring logs and screenshots of victim's desktop. That number of logs shows just how effective the spammer's social engineering trick was.
Here is the WHOIS info of the FTP server:
Not wanting to stop here, I did a little more investigation on the PK installation files in my hope to uncover who was behind the campaign.
According to PK's Online Help webpage, the program uses a hotkey to unhide the admin window or the system tray icon. The default hotkey combination is CTRL+ALT+L, but this didn't work. So brute forcing different hotkey combinations enabled me to retrieve the correct hotkey. But to my dismay, this window popped up:
Before getting dirty by reverse engineering the keylogger and trying to crack the password, I scrounged around the net for more clues. I found a personal blog by a colleague here at Trustwave SpiderLabs who previously encountered this keylogger. In their blog, they noted that the password and other configurations were stored in an encoded file named PK.BIN, and the monitored data is stored in an encoded file named BPK.DAT. They also noted that the files can be decoded with a simple XOR using the key 0xAA.
I supposed that the PK version that Chris analysed was an older version, hence the XOR key 0xAA didn't decode our configuration file. Well, for the dump file BPK.DAT, the XOR key partially worked, but to make it more readable I XORed it using two bytes 0xAA, 0x00:
But I was more interested in the file PK.BIN, because it stores the configuration details of the keylogger including perhaps the details of the attacker. But the file needed some extra work because of the fact that it can't be decoded by simply XORing it with 0xAA. So my best guess was that it used a different XOR key.
This is what the file looks like in text mode, hhmmm look at that repetitive pattern!
In HEX mode, I took that repetitive string and made it our XOR key:
With the help of some python script, it helped me decode the file:
if len(sys.argv) > 1: pkhandle = open(sys.argv[1],'rb') pkbuffer = pkhandle.read() pkhandle.close() key=[0x0D,0x0A,0x08,0x05,0x01,0x02,0x06,0x03,0x03,0x0E,0x01,0x08,0x03,0x0C,0x09,0x07,0x05,0x0D,0x0C,0x0B,0x03] dec = '' ctr = 0 for i in range(11,len(pkbuffer)): a= ord(pkbuffer[i]) b =key[ctr%len(key)] x = a^b dec = dec+(chr(x)) ctr+=1 dechandle = open('pk.dec','wb') dechandle.write(dec) dechandle.close()
And voila! (note: I needed to blur some details to protect the victim's data in the FTP server)
The decoded PK.BIN shows enough details to get inside the PK admin panel, including the keylogger's admin password, FTP server/credentials, PK license name and license key. I typed in the admin password and it was successful, giving me more understanding about what the attacker is capturing and more of their keylogger configuration.
In the configuration file, it revealed the name Charles Onuigbo as the PK license name.
Now, I don't conclude that Charles Onuigbo is the attacker or indeed if they are a legitimate person. The only thing interesting about the name is that it appears to be fairly common in Nigeria, the home of email scams!
I have reported the FTP site to its ISP through abuse email, and am I looking forward to this site being taken down ASAP.
UPDATE: I have received an email from the company who hosted the FTP server in question and they wrote :
"Hello- I'm unsure if my co-workers wrote you back regarding this. We have stopped access to the account being used for this on the server in question... "
I have checked the FTP server and can confirm that the malicious FTP account has been disabled. Thank you Alex Kwiecinski of Liquid Web Inc. and your team for taking immediate action.
I left this place, (but never deleted my account for reasons i'm about to explain) because there wasn't much discussion, and i'm partly to blame for that. I gave up on my own ideals. I gave up to soon. I was afraid, afraid that maybe there couldn't be reasonable discussion and kept visiting reddit. Now, i'm back, and I feel that maybe i should get thicker skin, and just accept, that there will be unreasonable people. I usually lurk on reedit and voat, because usually i feel, I can't contribute much to a discussion I'm usually quite outspoken in real life, but I tend to avoid conflict. However, i'm worried at all the demagogues i'm seeing, the creeping within congress, within our presidential election and the sinking feeling of my fears being realized (1984, and the brave new world in particular). I now feel I must fight back and I have to accept that there will be conflict, and despite all this. I think my silence is hurting everyone, and merely lurking here has to change. I must seek the truth, regardless how it makes "feel" or not. This only comes with the discussion of ideas, and maybe we can all work together to come to a consensus and a solution. I feel that voat is the only platform that will let me speak out more against the masses and against society. At least it is a place that i can be heard, even from the drowning of voices, at least unlike reddit.
Also as much as i enjoy reddit, because it is fun sometimes to see all the jokes and stuff. I couldn't ignore that I felt i was being manipulated and I had sinking feeling, that the front page, and ever r/all were just memes, just like, things to make me "Feel good." I noticed, that in order to find the darkness within our society, within Reddit itself, I had to dig, and dig hard. I noticed more, and more, the news articles, were disappearing, the violence, the darkness within our societies that must be addressed was vanishing. I knew the algorithm was all shitty and stuff, but i didn't notice how bad the manipulation had gotten. I knew, i knew, but i felt it wasn't all bad, and that maybe they will adjust it fairly. I felt that maybe they were listening to their userbase, and I think now my faith was misplaced. I just feel as a reddit as whole is dying a slow death, and I'm just lying to myself on multiple levels. Thinking that it is better to hide from what i see here. I think my silence is misplaced, and i'd like to make a better future for the next generations. I think this requires a more active involvement and discussion from not me, but from everyone else..
So i'm sorry to voat, for being a passive user, I will try to make more effort to contribute here, and maybe we can build the foundation of good place to share ideas, at least for now.
Thank you again to @susquehannaHAT for recommending me to post here. Its been a while, It's good to say hi again.
Sega said Thursday that it would bring classic, updated Dreamcast classics to PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, beginning with downloadable versions ofand, originally released in the West in 1999 on the Dreamcast, will be the first game to arrive on current generation consoles' digital storefronts. Sega did not reveal a release timeframe forBoth of the games will be based on the Dreamcast originals, but will be updated with high-definition graphics, surround sound, online leaderboards, and Achievement and Trophy support.While Sega only announcedandthus far, a press statement indicated that the games will only be the "first two classics made available" on current consoles.The Dreamcast launched on September 9, 1999 in North America, and was supposed to be Sega's big comeback from the flagging Sega Saturn.But despite a strong lineup of titles and technology that facilitated advanced graphics and out-of-the-box online connectivity, the console couldn't overcome competition from Sony and Nintendo. In January 2001, Sega said it would be pulling out of the hardware business."There are few things that are more requested from us than making Dreamcast classics available for download in today�s digital marketplace," said Sega of America and Europe VP of digital business Haruki Satomi. "We�re very excited to begin offering gamers our beloved Dreamcast titles again on the current console systems."Rumors that Dreamcast games would be available for download on current systems emerged last year, when a purportedly leaked internal meeting document between Sega and Sony Computer Entertainment America revealed plans for Dreamcast digital titles on PS3. And earlier this week, the ESRB listed ratings foron Xbox 360, PS3 and PC.Digital models will become an increasingly important part of Sega's strategy going forward. Amid Sega layoffs earlier this year, Sega West president Mike Hayes revealed that Sega's San Francisco office would become home base for digital initiatives, while London would become focused on packaged goods.
Share. The current verdict on Rockstar's ambitious multiplayer world. The current verdict on Rockstar's ambitious multiplayer world.
Wondering where the score is? Our GTA Online review will remain scoreless, as a score does not properly reflect its continuously changing nature. Here's how and why we decided to do it this way.
As a single-player game, Grand Theft Auto V is defined by its characters more than by the player, for me at least. It's the story of three equally troubled criminals with different backgrounds and motivations, and their personalities and proclivities shaped the way I played. GTA Online is a space away from that story, a place for players to run riot together. San Andreas is the same, but your role within it is different, and as a result it's more conducive to the kind of open-world mayhem that can feel out of place in the context of Rockstar's single-player story. Like most multiplayer games GTA Online is as fun as you and your friends make it, but the world of San Andreas is a bigger and better playground than most.
Exit Theatre Mode
The two weeks following GTA Online's October 1st launch can be fairly described as disastrous. In fact, that's how I described them in my GTA Online review in progress. The lack of an open beta was a serious mistake – if everyone involved knew that they were playing an unstable, untested game, then the furore surrounding lost characters, money and progress, cloud server availability, and frequent glitching might not have erupted with such volume. Rockstar clearly did not anticipate the level of disruption that would be caused by such a high volume of players.
Most of this is now resolved, meaning that you can both actually log into GTA Online reliably and play without fear of losing progress or money to Rockstar's server hiccups. As of today, October 21st, it's now running smoothly, and the promise of $500,000 for everyone who played during launch month is quite the generous apology – although I for one would rather have had my original, sadly departed, rank-27 character back.
Arriving in Los Santos and stepping off the plane without a cent, the character you create in GTA Online slips straight into the criminal underworld, greeted by the ever-likeable Lamar at the airport and quickly gifted a pistol and a car, the twin foundations of GTA Online's castle of chaos. (Amusingly, they also bring a rose, if you choose a female avatar, but their romantic overtures don't go down too well.) It is essentially a rags-to-riches story, like most of the single-player GTA games have been, and there's an addictive rhythm to its progression. The more you play, the more you earn, and the more guns and missions you unlock.
Plenty of GTA 5's single-player characters make an appearance in GTA Online, but the story isn't as prominent as it initially appears. After the first hour, in which you're guided through the basics of driving, shooting, and taking jobs, that authored story fades into the background as you take on jobs, team up with friends, or make new ones. The presence of these characters nonetheless anchors GTA Online in GTA 5's world, giving it context.
Your own character, meanwhile, is a mute avatar who feels out of place in scenes with Lester, Trevor et al – and probably has a weird face, as the character creation system uses a strange genetics-based formula to calculate your appearance. Everybody comes out looking just slightly wrong, and weirdly similar to one another. You have much more control over what they wear – hair and clothes have become the basis of a character's (and a player's) individuality in GTA Online.
Jobs, GTA Online's missions, come in three predominant flavours: racing (usually in a car, but sometimes on a boat or a bicycle), deathmatches (either in teams or free-for-alls, sudden death or traditional), and capital-M Missions, which are usually cooperative and involve more complex objectives, more similar to GTA 5's single-player missions (but usually simpler, and without the entertaining script that enlivens the single-player's long drives). Cooperative Heists are still to come, Rockstar says. The vast majority of GTA Online's Jobs fall into the first two categories, and they start to repeat themselves surprisingly quickly. They don't have the variety of the single-player missions, at least not yet.
Exit Theatre Mode
It's good, then, that shooting and racing are a lot of fun in themselves, to the extent that I could play hours of them in a row without feeling like I was grinding. They're also sufficiently different from everything else out there right now to make them interesting. GTA 5's default aim lock-on recalibrates the deathmatch, as any enemy that sees you will probably kill you. Matches become about not being seen, finding good spots for cover, quick drawing, and headshots. The tensest modes – last player standing, with just one life each – have everybody creeping through the map, trying to stay off the radar, squeezing the left trigger and firing at the slightest sign of movement. The maps are recognisable slices of Los Santos and Blaine Country, specifically rejigged to create hiding spots and verticality that make them fun locations for shootouts.
The races too are good, if predictable, fun. There are slices of Los Santos that are exquisitely well-suited to racing, whether it's a looping race across the freeway, a circuit round the airport, or a street race downtown with tight corners. I've spent a lot of time racing dirt bikes and BMXes around off-road Blaine County tracks. The addition of weapons – which the host can opt for in the lobby – transforms these races into utter, almost Mario Kart-style chaos. It's clear from the extraordinary language emanating from the headset during such matches that a lot of people find having their tyres shot out in the middle of a race intensely frustrating, but for me the random element can enliven otherwise-formulaic races, especially when you're nearing the mid-ranks and have had enough of the default settings.
It's in the open world that you can have the most fun, though, if you've got the right people. I've been on store robberies and escaped in helicopters, caused a 30-car pile-up as my crew of four was pursued down the side of a hill by overzealous police, run into the mountains to escape a Wanted level and parachuted down from the highest point. Subtle changes to the map rebalance it for 16 players – there's no open access to the military base or the airport, though you can make your way in if you're determined. Now and then you'll hear a jet zooming overhead and think, “How the hell did they get that?”
Ranking up unlocks new guns and vehicles for purchase, and broadens the selection of missions you're allowed to take part in. Once unlocked, these must be bought with in-game cash, which you can either earn or buy with real money. It seems strange to lock some of the most exciting missions – like anything involving air vehicles, or parachuting – away from lower-rank players, as it makes the first 15 or so levels of progression feel like a repetitive sequence of races and deathmatches. If you want to get around that, join a group with higher-rank players – it waives the rank requirements.
Higher-rank players will start with better weapons that they've unlocked and bought for themselves, a big advantage that's mitigated by the small selection of hardware that litters each multiplayer map and can be used freely by anyone who picks it up. Happily, the matchmaking is also smart enough not to throw players with vastly different ranks together randomly, so it's rare for one person to dominate a session. Other than that, rank means little. Once you've earned enough money you can buy and customise your own car, but it seems like very few players are bothering to do that at the moment. Any given race lets you pick a good car from a wide selection, so it doesn't feel like you're at any disadvantage if you don't have a sports car of your own – or like there's much of an advantage to owning one.
Exit Theatre Mode
My initial concerns about the in-game economy have been allayed over the past two weeks. At launch, you were charged extortionate amounts in medical fees for dying, both on-mission and off-mission, meaning I'd sometimes come out of missions having barely broke even. This has since been adjusted, however, and you can now earn money at a good pace, even factoring in the charges for ammunition, vehicle destruction and the occasional, much-reduced medical bill. I was also suspicious that this nickel-and-diming was an unsubtle way of pushing players towards paying real money for in-game GTA$, but that no longer feels like the case. It's still being adjusted with every update, however – the latest one halved the rewards for repeating more lucrative missions, preventing people from spamming them.
GTA Online's main problem right now is motivation. The missions are fun, but they also become repetitive, and though they don't often feel like a grind, the majority of them are races or deathmatches, the occasional helicopter deathmatch, or jets-vs-bikes chase aside. Part of what drives you through them is money – the first thing I wanted to do was save up for an apartment – but once I'd bought one, there wasn't an enormous amount left for me to shoot for. After two weeks I had already gotten to the stage in GTA Online where there wasn't an enormous amount left to aim for. With $500,000 landing in the accounts of every player before the end of the month, people are going to reach that stage more quickly.
The player population at the moment is also predictably antagonistic. Happily, there are options to enter a session alone, with just your crewmates or with just your friends, and for a $100 fee you can activate Passive mode and make yourself immune to damage. These options all actually work now, so if you want to avoid being continually harassed by maniacs when you're just trying to explore off-mission, there are ways and means. Harassment by maniacs, though, sometimes feels like a vital part of this anarchic experience. I'll never forget the time a kind stranger rescued me and two friends from halfway up Mt. Chiliad and was thanked with a shotgun blast to the chest from my trigger-happy companion, initiating a ridiculous miniature gang war.
I'm left with the overbearing impression that Grand Theft Auto Online as it stands right now is still a colour sketch of what it will probably one day become. In the short term, the promised addition of heists and tools to let players create and publish their own content is likely to significantly broaden the selection of missions, which would be welcome. But in the long term, new cities have the potential to transform GTA Online.
It makes you realise what an extraordinary world Rockstar has created in this modern San Andreas, that so many individual areas can support whole game modes in themselves. Snipping out little sections of the map and letting them shine alone reveals almost every inch of Los Santos to be meticulously designed, if that wasn't already evident from GTA 5. All those places that you might never have explored in single-player – those secret skate parks, the dirt tracks, the hiding places – find their purpose in GTA Online, where they can be discovered and explored together.
"The city of Asheville has never embarked on anything as ambitious as this," said Ken Putnam, city transportation director. "This is history-making."

City government is in the early stages of a construction and equipment replacement program that will triple the amount of money it spends on everything from sidewalks and greenways to police cars over the next five years.
The $129 million plan included in the proposed 2014-15 budget will significantly expand alternatives to driving, although streets will get a share of the money as well. At least $49 million will go for transportation improvements oriented primarily toward pedestrians and bicyclists, with another $10 million earmarked for paving streets.
If the city is able to stay on schedule, residents will be able to walk on a sidewalk along Hendersonville Road through South Asheville, take a stroll on a different one along Leicester Highway out to the city limits or use one of four greenways planned in or near the River Arts District in five years' time.
"The city of Asheville has never embarked on anything as ambitious as this," said Ken Putnam, city transportation director. "This is history-making."
City leaders for years have voiced concerns that streets are deteriorating faster than the city repairs them, and officials and residents have pushed for new sidewalks and greenways, but city officials have said tight budgets kept them from spending as much as needed on those areas and other infrastructure.
Some of the proceeds from last year's tax increase and borrowing will change that, city officials say.
Projects on the five-year capital improvement program will encourage private investment and increased tax revenue, improve the city's quality of life and take care of basic infrastructure and equipment needs, Mayor Esther Manheimer said.
"The five-year plan reflects largely the values of the community, the interests of the community, but also results in long-term economic sustainability for the city," they said.
An in-depth look at the city's financial future in 2010 suggested the city would have to take steps to shore up its tax base, they said, and the five-year plan is a result of that examination. "It became evident that doing nothing was not an option," they said.
What the city will build, buy
Larger expenditures in the plan include:
• $21.9 million for street, sidewalk and greenway improvements to 2.2 miles of Riverside Drive and Lyman Street between Hill Street and Amboy Road in the River Arts District.
As part of what the city calls RADTIP, it will add landscaping, parking and sidewalks along the two streets and a greenway that will be close to them for some stretches and closer to the French Broad River in others. RADTIP also involves looking at alternative ways to get trucks to the New Belgium Brewing site.
Fueled largely by a federal grant, about 30 percent of the project plans have been drawn up so far, said Dan Baechtold, a city planner working on RADTIP. Most of the rest of the project would be paid for by federal funds as well, and construction would probably occur from 2017-19, they said.
Manheimer said the project is one of several likely to have a direct economic impact.
"If you put that infrastructure in the River Arts District, you're going to see investment down there," they said.
• $15 million to replace aging city vehicles, with an emphasis on police cruisers.
In the past few years, "We've been spending very, very little" on new vehicles, said Barbara Whitehorn, city finance director. "There was actually a year in the last five when we (made no police vehicle purchases), so we're really behind."
• $10 million, or $2 million a year, to pave city streets. That's a big increase from the roughly $800,000 the city has spent in the past, Public Works Director Greg Shuler said, and will put the city on a cycle of paving streets every 30-35 years.
That's still less frequent than would be optimal, they told council last month, but would be an improvement over the current practice of repaving every 60-80 years.
Many streets "are really bad right now," Shuler said Friday. "I think (residents) will notice (the additional paving). ... Some of these are neighborhood roads that are just in desperate need."
• $3.8 million for unspecified pedestrian and bicycle improvements to Charlotte Street north of Interstate 240 budgeted. A consultant told City Council in August that narrowing the four-lane street would create problems with traffic congestion, and debate over what, if any, changes to make on the street has waxed and waned for years.
Resident Saul Chase told council Tuesday the project is not needed and the city would do better to spend the money on sidewalks around the city instead.
Manheimer said there has been no decision on just what changes the city would make but that better facilities are a long-standing request from people who live near the corridor and will attract private investment.
"What I hear the community say is that it's not safe to walk on Charlotte Street. It's a corridor that could be so much more," they said.
• $4.9 million spread across three projects to build greenways in or near the River Arts District. One would run through woods to the south of Clingman Avenue, another would parallel Town Branch from Depot Street to near McDowell Street and a third would be located along the west side of the French Broad River between Haywood Road and French Broad River Park.
• $7.7 million to build sidewalks on roughly 5 miles of Hendersonville Road from Interstate 40 south to the area around Long Shoals Road and on Leicester Highway from Patton Avenue to around the city limits, a distance of 3 miles; $200,000 has already been spent.
The five-year plan also calls for spending $250,000 a year on sidewalk repairs and $550,000 over five years on construction of new sidewalks in neighborhoods.
Councilman Chris Pelly and some city residents criticized sidewalk spending as too small during City Council's public hearing on the budget Tuesday.
"Our budget right now is inadequate for the needs of sidewalks in our community," Pelly said. "We can and should do better on this."
Manheimer said sidewalk construction is a major component of several other projects in the five-year plan. They include improvements to Livingston Street, Craven Street, Charlotte Street and Azalea Road.
City staff calculated that the five-year plan contains money for 81,658 linear feet of sidewalks, Whitehorn said, or about 15 1/2 miles.
Manheimer said the City Council "has been very aggressive in pursuing sidewalk spending."
Paying for it
The city first developed a five-year capital improvements program last year, but much of the spending won't really start until the upcoming fiscal year, which begins July 1. The city is spending about $8.6 million on capital projects of all types during the current fiscal year, and capital spending over the past five totalled $41.8 million, Whitehorn said.
By contrast, the plan calls for $24.5 million in capital spending in the coming fiscal year.
City Council laid the groundwork for financing the plan when it raised property taxes last year, setting the rate at 46 cents per $100 valuation, three cents higher than a "revenue neutral" rate. The proceeds from 2 cents of that increase, about $2.2 million a year, are going to capital improvements.
The city expects grants and other outside revenue will bring the net cost of the five-year program down to about $90 million, but the proceeds of the additional property tax will fall far short of that figure.
Most of the rest will come from borrowing, Whitehorn. City debt will rise from about $45 million to an estimated $84 million in five years, they said.
The five-year plan, and the debt the city will take on to make it happen, will surely concern some city residents critical of government spending. City officials say the city is in a good financial position to make the plan happen, and no additional tax increases are contemplated to pay for it.
Whitehorn said they do not expect a strain on city finances from the additional debt. With the increase, the city's debt will be 8.8 percent of the amount allowed by state law, they said.
"We have an extremely low debt level right now," they said. "We're going into this with the knowledge that we have this capacity and we know what we can afford."
City staff are working on proposals to create legal entities called municipal service districts in some of the areas where projects are planned as a mechanism to borrow some of the money needed.
The districts would allow the city to borrow at lower interest rates, but city staff has delayed bringing proposals to create them to council until summer while it figures out ways to assure the public they will not be used to levy special taxes, Whitehorn said.
While the state law authorizing the districts allows property taxes that apply only to real estate within their borders, "There is absolutely no discussion of making these into taxing districts," they said.
Manheimer said council has committed to spend the 2 cents from last year's citywide property tax increase "on projects that generate a return. You're not spending the money on paying the light bill or paying salaries."
It makes sense for the city to start making the investments now, even though that involves borrowing, they said.
"If you waited and saved and saved before you buy a home, you might be 70 years old before you can," they said.
