PHOENIX (AP) — President Donald Trump says they may grant a pardon to former Sheriff Joe Arpaio following their recent conviction in federal court, prompting outrage among critics who say the move would amount to an endorsement of racism.
Trump told Fox News during an interview Sunday that they were seriously considering issuing a pardon within the next few days. That was welcome news for the former Phoenix-area sheriff, who lost a re-election bid in November and who was convicted of misdemeanor contempt of court on July 31.
But it angered immigrant rights activists and others who say it amounts to support for racism on the same day that Trump disavowed white nationalists whose rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, turned violent this weekend, leaving one woman dead.
A federal judge ruled in 2013 that Arpaio's officers racially profiled Latinos. But the sheriff refused to stop their immigration patrols, eventually leading to the criminal contempt of court case that he's embroiled in. It also contributed to their failed re-election bid last year.
Arpaio said Monday that they learned of the president's comments in the morning and was glad they stood by him.
“I didn't ask for it, but if he's going to offer, I will accept, because I'm not guilty. So appreciate their interest in my matter here in Phoenix,” Arpaio said.
Attorneys for the ex-sheriff filed two motions late Monday afternoon in U.S. District Court in Phoenix for a judgment of acquittal and to vacate the verdict for a new trial. The motions are not appeals.
“We're filing these motions because there was absolutely no evidence in support of the judge's verdict, the verdict was contrary to the evidence provided in court, and the verdict is a gross miscarriage of justice,” said Mark Goldman, a lawyer for Arpaio.
Trump on Sunday told Fox that Arpaio is “a great American patriot” and said they hate to see what has happened to him, according to the news report. They cited their long service in law enforcement and said many Arizona citizens respected their approach to crime.
The two have been allies for the past couple of years. Arpaio campaigned for Trump at rallies in Iowa, Nevada and Arizona, and they gave a speech at the Republican National Convention in which they said Trump would prevent immigrants from coming into the country illegally. Trump has also invoked the former sheriff in their calls for tougher immigration enforcement and has advocated for tactics that made Arpaio a national figure.
“I've been with them from day one,” Arpaio said.
On Monday, the president condemned hate groups and said racism is evil in a statement that was much more forceful than he'd made earlier after the weekend clashes in Virginia that left one woman dead after a car plowed into a group of counter-protesters who opposed a rally by white nationalists. The white nationalists were protesting a plan to remove a statute of Confederate Gen Robert E. Lee from a Charlottesville park.
“Those who spread violence in the name of bigotry strike at the very core of America,” they said.
Cecillia Wang, deputy legal director for the ACLU, criticized the idea that Trump could pardon Arpaio, saying the former sheriff had violated court orders that prohibited illegal detention of Latinos.
“Make no mistake: This would be an official presidential endorsement of racism,” Wang said.
Thomas A. Saenz, president and general counsel of MALDEF, or the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said in statement that Trump's comments to Fox were hypocritical and demonstrate “how inextricably conflicted they are about condemning racism and the targeting of racial minorities”
“That the White House chose to praise such unconstitutional, discriminatory behavior in defiance of a federal judge on the same day that it refused to condemn the actions of white supremacists in Charlottesville compound the damage of Trump's appalling moral relativism,” Saenz said. “In politics, there is hypocrisy on many sides, but the White House's praise of Arpaio as it tries to extricate itself from equivocal statements about the clear domestic hate-based terrorism in Charlottesville will forever stand out as record-breaking, political disingenuousness.”
There are concerns that social networking keeps people apart People's health could be harmed by social networking sites because they reduce levels of face-to-face contact, an expert claims. Dr Aric Sigman says websites such as Facebook set out to enrich social lives, but end up keeping people apart. Dr Sigman makes their warning in Biologist, the journal of the Institute of Biology. A lack of "real" social networking, involving personal interaction, may have biological effects, they suggest. They also say that evidence suggests that a lack of face-to-face networking could alter the way genes work, upset immune responses, hormone levels, the function of arteries, and influence mental performance. This, they claim, could increase the risk of health problems as serious as cancer, strokes, heart disease, and dementia. 'Evolutionary mechanism' Dr Sigman maintains that social networking sites have played a significant role in making people become more isolated. "Social networking is the internet's biggest growth area, particular among young children," they said. "Social networking sites should allow us to embellish our social lives, but what we find is very different. The tail is wagging the dog. These are not tools that enhance, they are tools that displace." Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Dr Sigman says that there is research that suggests the number of hours people spend interacting face-to-face has fallen dramatically since 1987, as the use of electronic media has increased. And they claim that interacting "in person" has an effect on the body that is not seen when e-mails are written. "When we are 'really' with people different things happen," they said. "It's probably an evolutionary mechanism that recognises the benefits of us being together geographically. "Much of it isn't understood, but there does seem to be a difference between 'real presence' and the virtual variety." Dr Sigman also argues using electronic media undermines people's social skills and their ability to read body language. "One of the most pronounced changes in the daily habits of British citizens is a reduction in the number of minutes per day that they interact with another human being," they said. "In less than two decades, the number of people saying there is no-one with whom they discuss important matters nearly tripled." Dr Sigman says they are "worried about where this is all leading". They added: "It's not that I'm old fashioned in terms of new technology, but the purpose of any new technology should be to provide a tool that enhances our lives." A selection of your comments to the BBC news website: I agree that I would prefer face to face contact with my friends and family, but as an immigrant to the UK who is separated from so many friends and family far away in another country and as a disabled person with a variable health condition that means that some days I am unable to get out of bed, the internet and social networking is a real life-line for me. Losing track of old friends can happen so easily. I've re-established many friendships this way. Morgan, Wales Just a week ago I switched off my Facebook account for just this reason. These sites claim greater social networking, but all it really creates are more distractions for people, more isolation in front of their computers, more escapism, and a false sense of relationships with other people. People do not interact with each other properly, becoming more isolated and so more depressed. Travis, Bochum, Germany I don't see this at all. For me, and I think a lot of people with Aspergers and other ADS's, these sites make it easier to meet people. If anything you are meeting people who you might never have spoken to without meeting them online first.Chris, Medway, Kent I can agree with some of this, if you are communicating with your neighbour by facebook then that is a problem. I live in Norway but I come from New Zealand, with facebook I can really be a part of my friends' and family's lives. I think it's great, but in moderation.Simon, Norway I live in a very rural community that unfortunately is seriously lacking in community spirit. There is very, very little to do and very little social interaction. I do not drive and I am home with small children. If it weren't for Facebook I would feel even more isolated from society than I already am. Facebook reminds me that there are people out there who care about me, even though they may be people I grew up with that live thousands of miles away.
Elizabeth, Shetland I am a full-time wheelchair user and use social networking sites as it is not so easy for me to get out and meet people. However, I do agree with Dr Sigman and I am often aware of the need to get out and meet people rather than just type away to whoever chooses to read. I also think the quality of communication is affected; it's all gossip and silly comments, hardly anything of substance. Much better talking to a good friend in confidence, in private, face to face. It's more productive and in the long run more meaningful and good for well-being. Rachel Ellis, Warrington, Cheshire, UK I use most of the social networking sites that there are. I live in a small village where nobody talks to each other in person. I've tried everything to create human interaction and even done a School for Social Entrepreneurs Course to assist me in that but to no avail. I know that online friends are not the same but I am a single parent and not working. It is the only social interaction I can get to drive away the loneliness. When people are not online I miss them.
Shona, Kirkcaldy, Fife I couldn't agree more. I witness my 4 year old son and their 8 year old sister interact wonderfully when playing together, yet they become 'withdrawn' and subdued when playing solitary electronic games. Technology should enhance the human experience, but often fails to live up to its brief and actually causes more harm compared to when we did without. Mark E, Corby, Northamptonshire I'm fed up with the number of people telling me I should join facebook. I have an active social life, I use phone and email to keep in touch and just can't see the point of it all. If I want to keep in touch with friends I will, if I don't I won't so the argument that you can catch up with people that you haven't seen for years is irrelevant to me. I even have a couple of friends who only send invites to their parties through facebook! I'm not a traditionalist at all, in fact quite the opposite, I just think the social networking fad is all a bit sad, I'd rather to go out and have fun with real people.
Andrew, London I used to use Facebook quite a lot. I had a lot of 'friends' on there. These were people who I knew 'in real life' and didn't get a chance to see and speak to regularly, others were people I knew only in passing or as an acquaintance of other friends. I am not a social butterfly and I find making friends very difficult. But after some time I realised that I was spending more and more time altering my 'status' and logging into Facebook, than I was spending with actual real-life friends. I think the report cited is absolutely correct and there is an issue of people becoming distant from human contact. I think it is right that scientists are concerned about us becoming isolated from other human beings. I deactivated my Facebook account because I realised I was spending a lot of time with it which could be better spent elsewhere.
C.A.D, UK These health effects seems pretty far fetched to me. I am a retired teacher who loves Facebook. Surprisingly, I have been in contact with former students I had forty years ago. It is a wonderful tool. The health benefits to me have been wonderful. I am grateful for such services. Who would have ever thought so many former students would stop by my site and say hello?Richard Orndorff, Mason, Ohio, USA I think it brings people together, in a sense that I communicate with people I wouldn't even be interested to in real life. I have managed to get invites to social functions more than I did before. My social scene has in actual fact improved.Martha, Johannesburg SouthAfrica The very best friends I have ever had in my life, I met online and this was before the social networking sites came to be. I've travelled to visit them and attended one of their weddings. Anything that helps people make friends is good and not harmful in my opinion. Mark Townsend, Cambridge, UK

I guess they won the lottery:
Wedding bells will ring over at off-Broadway's Avenue Q on July 24. To celebrate the first day same-sex couples can legally marry in New York, the show's puppet characters Rod and Ricky will tie the knot at City Hall before the show's matinee.
"To have this finally happen for us—especially so soon after Will and Kate—is unbelievable to me," Rod said in a statement released by the production. "I realize there are a lot of broken hearts out there now that Ricky and I are off the market—step back, all you chorus boys!—but I've known since Day One that Ricky is the husband for me. He's the furry fellow I want to spend my life with both on and off the stage."
As I mentioned last week, the St. James Theatre, where Broadway's production of Hair is staged, will also host several same-sex weddings on July 25th, the day after couples begin marrying.
Back in 2000, I stumbled across an album by a little known indie band called Soulwax that I ended up becoming absolutely obsessed with. The record, Much Against Everyone's Advice, was a scattered mess of a thing- a sort of smorgasbord of popular culture at the time- but their pop hooks and unique style (white suits, light up mic stands, Casio guitars) made them one of Belgium's best kept secrets.
I remember following everything about them for years - I went to see them live every time I could, I diligently collected all the CD singles, the albums, the special edition albums, the mailing list CD, everything bar start a fucking fan club.
After their unexpected hit mash-up mix As Heard On Radio Soulwax pt.2 under their 2manydjs moniker (named after one of the standout tracks on MAEA by the way) blew up, the Dewale brothers re-emerged as Soulwax in 2004 with a much darker, harder sound - as much influenced by clubland as it was the Radiophonic Workshop and Queens of the Stoneage. They'd been listening to a lot of techno it would seem, and so their follow up, 2006's Nite Versions was basically a remix album consisting of them playing tunes from that album but jamming them out in a more dancefloor friendly environment. Then, that was that for Soulwax - the Dewale bros. carried on with 2manydjs and production work, and kissed goodbye to their weird little rock band.
Well, actually, they had one last fling before they journeyed onwards with everything else, and that was documented in 2007, an album of komische jams and space rock atmospherics that they did under the guise of Die Verboten, which was the two Dewales, joined by Fergus Purcell and Henry Riton and saw them basically kicking out massive, massive jams armed only with analogue synths, a drum kit and a bass guitar. Sadly, the album never saw the light of day back in 2007, and was promptly forgotten about until 2009, when they snuck out an 18-minute-track on a small Vinyl Factory pressing. Another six years passed, and perhaps realising they were sat on something quite special, they've now dusted off the master tapes, mixed it, mastered it, and it's finally being unleashed to the public.
About fucking time too, as it's absolutely amazing.
It actually follows on quite nicely from ‘Nite Versions', and feels like a sort of older, more bizarre companion album - the same elements are all there, but used in very different ways. Instead of channeling DFA or pumped up nu-rave remixes, here they're scraping the skies with odes to Kraftwerk, Neu and Can - relentless slo-mo disco drums, bubbling synth arpeggios and floating melodies all expand as the record goes on - indeed, each track here gets progressively longer, starting with the buoyant seven minute romp of 'Dafalganger', which sounds somewhere between 'Autobahn''s filtered sweeps, and 'Hallogallo''s racing, motorik pulse.
Clocking in at just under nine minutes, 'White Islands' slows the pace to a 'Halleluwah' crawl, brimming with choppy guitars, cowbells and rumbling bass, before ‘E40' builds and builds for almost half it's near-13-minute running time, and then promptly bursts into a defiant disco groover, filtered synth gargles zipping from speaker to speaker.
The whole thing then culminates in ‘Nacht Winkel's 15-minute Harmonia-meets-James Murphy journey to the outer reaches of the galaxy, before the madness ends on the comparative brief, but equally spaced out ‘Aquarius'. For digital fans, there's an added bonus of 2009's asupervisorstioned languid groove leviathan ‘Live In Eivissa' included for good measure, but this needs to be taken on its own, rather than an extension of the record, lest krautrock exhaustion set in. Still, for those strong enough to take on nearly 72 minutes of unfettered analogue-techno-kraut-jam, it keeps the party going nicely enough.
It's kind-of, almost, the krautrock album you always wanted - all the jams, all the fun, with non of the heady, drug induced madness. Before the komische purists burn me at the stake for that remark, I might add that 2007 is a very, very faithful krautrock album. It's not a parody, or a lame facsimile, but updates a tired genre with an equal mix of influence and experimentation.
I'd actually been recently lamenting the loss of Soulwax the band recently, as those three (four if you count the still-kind-of-alright bluesy rock album they did in 1996) albums are still pretty damn incredible. Sadly, this isn't much of a Soulwax album proper, but as good as you're going to get in 2015 - and anyway, it's still very much worth your time. I only wish we could hear David's sultry tones over some pummelling drop D riffs sometime soon…

If you are not into politics, you might think libertarianism has nothing to offer you. There are a lot of misconceptions that might cause you to dismiss libertarian ideas as just another political ideology. The truth is, there is a lot more to libertarianism than politics. If you give us a chance, you might find that libertarians have ideas that are much more in line with your own values than you ever thought. Here are five things you might not realize about us.
1. We want you to be able to live the life you want. You shouldn't have to ask permission or convince anyone that your choices are right when they don't hurt others. Your personal values can be liberal, conservative, or neither. If you stay out of politics because you just want to live your life, that's ok. You should be able to do just that! When you boil it down, that's what libertarianism is all about.
2. We are not all in love with big banks and corporations. Although sometimes the rhetoric of prominent libertarians is focused on deregulation, that doesn't mean we think the big banks and corporations are good. The very existence of the government opens the doors for lobbyists to protect mega-corps from smaller, emerging businesses. What's worse, the cost of these resultant protections trickle down to regular people.
3. Many of us recognize that government is not the only oppressor. Although libertarians do have a lot of beef with our government, most of us know that government is not the source of all injustice in the world. We tend to focus on government because it is the biggest and most powerful threat and because the force of government gives other oppressors the power to do much more damage.
4. Many apolitical people are secret, or unknowing, libertarians. There are segments of libertarianism that entirely reject the use of the political system as a means of achieving liberty. When you take away the politics and keep the individual freedom, you might find a lot in common with these libertarians.
5. We don't just complain. We try to practice liberty in our own lives. A growing portion of the libertarian movement is shifting the focus from politics to individual action. As someone who prefers to live life outside of the political system on your own terms, this is an exciting way to enjoy your own liberty while spreading it to others. Maybe you will even get to enjoy a little laugh at the thought of subtly working against the system. I know I do.
Give us a chance to show all the diversity and opportunity we have to offer! Libertarianism doesn't require you to get political. The political system presumes some people have the authority to decide how you should conduct your life. Libertarians reject that idea and empower you to create your own life without interference, so why not join us?

LOGAN SQUARE — If the success of the Sunday Logan Square Farmers Market has shown anything, it's that neighborhood residents love them.
Now locals will have two from which to choose.
The city's new Logan Square Night Market is launching Wednesday 5 p.m. at the Logan Square Blue Line plaza, located at Kedzie and Milwaukee avenues.
Organizers had originally planned to hold the night market in Palmer Square, but city farmers market coordinator Yescenia Mota said they decided to hold it somewhere more visible and closer to public transit.
"We always try to be very accessible with all of our markets," they said.
The market will be held from 5 to 9 p.m. each Wednesday through Sept. 4, and will feature all the standard farmers market fare, such as fresh produce, meats, cheese and baked goods.

Russian bots and trolls on Twitter have stayed plenty busy lately. In the days before charges against three former Trump campaign officials were unsealed on Monday, Russian influencers tracked by the Hamilton 68 dashboard were pushing stories on Twitter about “collusion” between Russia and Hillary Clinton—a narrative regarding a 2010 sale of uranium rights that has long since been debunked. According to the nonpartisan security research project, a week's worth of tweets from late October turned up a wave of content with “some variation on a theme of corruption, collusion, cover-up by the Clinton-led State Department and/or the Mueller-led FBI,” as well as content attacking special counsel Robert Mueller and former FBI Director James Comey. And since Friday, when news reports made clear that the special counsel's team was moving ahead with indictments, the dashboard began registering a sharp increase in attacks specifically against Mueller.
As such propaganda campaigns continue to infect social media, researchers face a daunting challenge in diagnosing their impact. Thanks to how Facebook, Twitter, Google, and other tech giants currently operate, the underlying data from social-media platforms can easily become inaccessible. And the frustration extends to increasingly agitated congressional investigators, who will hear testimony from tech leaders on Tuesday and Wednesday concerning the Kremlin's propaganda war on the 2016 election.
“You can launch a disinformation campaign in the digital age and then all evidence of that campaign can just disappear,” says Samantha Bradshaw, a lead researcher in Oxford University's Computational Propaganda Project, which found that battleground states were inundated with fake news and propaganda from Russian sources in the days before Trump was elected.
Facebook recently removed access to thousands of posts by Russian-controlled accounts analyzed independently by Columbia University researcher Jonathan Albright. And while Albright told the Washington Post recently that those posts likely reached millions more than the 10 million people Facebook had originally estimated, Facebook is now set to tell Congress that Russian-linked content may have reached as many 126 million users. For its part, Google will testify that Russian agents uploaded more than 1,000 videos to YouTube.
“If Boris Badenov is sitting in some troll farm in St. Petersburg pretending to be the Tennessee GOP, I think Americans have a right to know,” said Sen. Mark Warner.
Researchers say that links to fake news stories or YouTube videos may work one day and return an error message the next. Propaganda-spewing Twitter accounts may suddenly go dark—perhaps because the owners deactivated them, or perhaps because the accounts were flagged and the social network suspended them, as Twitter did this fall with 201 accounts discovered to be part of a Russian influence operation. Recode reported Monday that Twitter will tell Congress it has since found more than 2,700 accounts tied to the Kremlin's Internet Research Agency.
Three senators recently introduced the bipartisan Honest Ads Act, which would require social-media companies to disclose the sources of political ads; a companion bipartisan bill also was introduced in the House. “If Boris Badenov is sitting in some troll farm in St. Petersburg pretending to be the Tennessee GOP, I think Americans have a right to know,” said Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), one of the bill's sponsors.
Last week Twitter made a preemptive move to open up more data about advertising, announcing a new Advertising Transparency Center that would show the sources for all ads posted on Twitter and reveal audience-targeting information. Twitter also said it will no longer accept advertising from RT and Sputnik, two Russian-media organizations that have spent $1.9 million on Twitter ads since 2011 and were identified by the US intelligence community as key players in Russia's 2016 election interference. On Friday, Facebook also announced plans to improve transparency for its ads ahead of the US midterm elections in 2018.
“Two years ago, I would have been arguing that data retention is bad because of privacy reasons. Now, I would say that some data retention is good.”
But researchers say these efforts don't address the fact that propaganda is often spread through sock-puppet accounts or groups that produce authored posts rather than paid ads. For example, as BuzzFeed reported, the “TEN_GOP” Twitter account—which posed as the “Unofficial Twitter of Tennessee Republicans” but was revealed by Russian journalists to be operated by a Kremlin troll factory—had 136,000 followers before it was shut down. And the account was retweeted before the election by multiple Trump aides, including senior adviser Kellyanne Conway, according to the Daily Beast. Many TEN_GOP posts appeared to be authored posts rather than ads, says Ben Nimmo, a fellow at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab who recently did a deep dive into reconstructing some of the TEN_GOP tweeting history. Twitter has said that none of the 201 Russian-linked accounts it closed were registered as advertisers on the platform.
A key challenge here is that user privacy has been baked into Twitter and Facebook's platforms since their inception. “Their first instinct was to protect people's privacy,” Nimmo says. “And then when a malicious Russian account is found, their instinct is to get rid of it. And then you don't have it at all. There goes a lot of evidence.”
They add: “The platforms are between a rock and a hard place. They have to balance protecting people from the minority of anonymous malicious users with protecting the privacy of the majority of users.”
Some researchers' attitudes toward data and privacy have begun to shift as disinformation campaigns have hit social networks. “Two years ago, I would have been arguing that data retention is bad because of privacy reasons,” Bradshaw says. “Now, I would say that some data retention is good.”
But it's not an easy equation to solve. Nimmo recalls how the social-media networks' anonymous accounts were celebrated as an asset to democratic movements during the Arab Spring protests in 2010. “Pro-democracy demonstrators were using anonymous accounts to organize protests because then they were safe,” they say. “Now, malicious users have figured out they can hide behind anonymous accounts as well.”
“There is no need to physically destroy such content in the company's servers. It can be just hidden from the public interface, and records should be kept for auditing purposes.”
Emilio Ferrara, a University of Southern California research professor whose work showed that 1 in 5 election-related tweets last fall were generated by bots, says Twitter's instinct to remove propaganda may be understandable, but if it involves actually deleting data, that's problematic. “There is no need to physically destroy such content in the company's servers. It can be just hidden from the public interface, and records should be kept for auditing purposes,” they say. “Their implementation raises critical issues on accountability that social-media service providers should be asked to address moving forward.”
A Twitter spokesperson declined to comment to Mother Jones about what types of data might be preserved, but said that the company looks forward to discussing these issues on Capitol Hill.
Lisa-Maria Neudert, another lead researcher at Oxford, believes the social-media companies, lawmakers, and researchers should be working together as they investigate the Russian influence campaign. “It is a year after the US elections and slowly we are being spoon-fed with tiny chunks of data and reveals about potential Russian election hacking,” they say. “These analyses need to speed up and engage research and government. It seems to me that just because they are occurring in a new sphere, online, they go unaddressed. Imagine a state had hacked our national TV channels for propaganda—there would be an uproar.”
For now, in order to protect research even when data disappears, Bradshaw says Oxford researchers have started capturing more screenshots from suspicious accounts. In the meantime, researchers can still make some painstaking headway with data that's publicly available, Neudert says.
Ultimately, the question over what responsibility social-media companies should bear for disinformation may become a First Amendment debate. Leah Lievrouw, a professor at the University of California-Los Angeles who researches the intersection of media and information technologies, says the government could model regulation of the tech companies using rules that historically have governed the broadcast media or telecom industries—but they say that they see an even higher bar for social-media companies, pertaining to the First Amendment.
“They want to avoid taking the responsibility of the cultural institutions they are,” Lievrouw says, noting that publishing and advertising companies set their own rules to safeguard the integrity of their content. “Come on, Facebook. You're one of the big media grown-ups now.”
Fred Wilson, the venture capitalist known for backing Twitter (twtr) and Tumblr, has made a big bet on blockchain cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin—and they think regular investors should buy some too.
Speaking Thursday at a conference hosted by StockTwits, the social network for stock traders, Wilson said the equivalent of a Wall Street bank now exists for the digital currencies, in what is otherwise a Wild West: Coinbase, the Bitcoin and Ethereum brokerage that has recently come under fire for the apparent failure of its investors to disclose their profits to the IRS.
Coinbase was Wilson's very first investment in Bitcoin and now has a reported valuation of more than $400 million. “They're like J.P. Morgan or Goldman Sachs for blockchain,” they said at the event, called Stocktoberfest East.
Not only has Wilson's Union Square Ventures backed several blockchain companies, but the VC has also personally bought cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin and Ethereum as well as a bit of Litecoin, representing “some small percentage of my net worth,” they said.
“If I were a trader, a stock trader or hedge fund person, I might think of having 5% of my assets in something like this,” Wilson added. “It's still early days; I don't think you want to go all in on it, but I think you want to be in it.”
Earlier that day, they said, a retail investor had emailed them wanting to invest in private startups, wondering how to put money into Union Square Ventures. But Wilson had to inform the man, who made $50,000 a year, that they were not wealthy or experienced enough to qualify as an “accredited investor” and was therefore prohibited by law from investing in startup companies before they went public.
Wilson was able to give them an alternative recommendation: Buy Bitcoin instead. “The cool thing,” Wilson said about Coinbase, is that “anybody can buy”—accredited or not.
The accessibility of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, however, has also raised questions as to whether the average investor should own the assets, which are not only unusually volatile but vulnerable to risks including theft via cyberattack, leaving many Bitcoin buyers burned.
Yet that's where Coinbase has an advantage, and why blockchain investors will see it as a safe haven akin to Goldman Sachs (gs) or J.P. Morgan (jpm) in a world of robber barons, Wilson said.
“If you look at what they are world class at, it's security, trust, safety, fraud—all these things that frankly banks are good at,” they said. “If you go back to the 19th century, banks got robbed a lot, and the truth of the matter is, most companies like Coinbase have gotten robbed, because it's pretty easy to rob these companies—you hack in, you take the Bitcoin, and you get in the car and you drive away.”
That's not to say that other problems won't arise among Bitcoin traders on Coinbase, just as they did in the early days of Wall Street, and still continue to a lesser extent. “We're going to have all the same things that happened—we're going to have pump and dump, front-running, all the things that people did,” Wilson acknowledged. “There are some people who are going to use it as a way to defraud people. But I think a lot of people should do it for the right reasons.”

Players,
In a game that emphasizes strategy and competition as much as League of Legends, information can be incredibly powerful. We've been itching to provide more data on how you play the game, and we're ready to introduce the evolution of your match history. The beta is now live!
Our goal is to deliver robust, intricate details about your previous matches in an accessible, intuitive interface that allows you to share game histories with your friends. We're making more of your games visible, not just your last 10. We're expanding the end-of-game information, using graphs and heat maps to display dragon kills, gold-per-minute, death locations and more. And now you can share links to your match history across all of your favorite social channels.
Related to sharing, there is one aspect of the new match history we want to dive into deeper. We believe ranked play is the highest sphere of competition. Players opt in to ranked play to measure their skill in an amped-up competitive environment, and the focus is much more on winning. In order to maintain that legitimacy, we believe that ranked game stats should be open knowledge, so unlike match histories for normal queue games, ranked games will be publically available.
As we said before, the evolved match history is in an early state, so we'll continue to refine the online experience. For now, if you have any additional questions, check out our FAQ. As always, we're looking for your feedback as League continues to evolve, so join the discussion below!

As on many Saturday mornings, this past weekend I sipped my morning coffee while listening to ABC's Saturday Night Country from Radio Australia's Shepparton shortwave transmission site on 9.58 MHz…some 9,800 miles from my home.
In this program, Emma Swift continues to fill in for Felicity Urquhart (who is on maternity leave). Swift, who is an amazing host and songwriter in their own right, focuses in this show on country drinking songs (amongst others) and on a few nostalgic country songs in the final set. Fortunately, I captured the whole show in two recordings.

Mass migration to the United Kingdom has been found to cost the Exchequer billions of pounds in a new analysis of academic studies just days before Britain's referendum on the European Union.
Only a minority of migrants are net financial beneficiaries to the United Kingdom, and overall migrants themselves cost billions of pounds every year. The new study by Migration Watch, released today has found the true cost of migrants is between four and seventeen billion pounds annually.
Despite claims to the contrary, there was also no evidence found that supported the idea that migrants boosted Gross Domestic Produce (GDP) per capita. Citing research by the House of Lords and a 2008 report by National Institute of Economic and Social Research found there was “no evidence that there was any significant economic benefit for the existing UK population”.
Commenting on the new report, Migration Watch boss Lord Green of Deddington said: “There has been a lazy assumption in much recent comment that immigrants are unquestionably an economic benefit to the UK but this very much depends on where they came from and when they arrived.
“Of course many immigrants are hard workers and valuable contributors to our society and EU migrants are often particularly valued by their employers. However, in the context of the referendum debate, the overall economic impact of EU migrants is a relatively small part of the picture”.
The Migration Watch report makes a clear distinction between arrivals from the most developed nations such as the original member states of the European Union including France and Germany which benefit the treasury. On the other hand are migrants from the newer EU nations, which take more out of the Exchequer than they pay in.
The report slams official government figures as “completely misleading”, as when the state calculates the cost of migrants — and claim them as “net fiscal” contributors — it excludes spending on housing benefits and other welfare.
One key area the report establishes is that the longer the time-frame studied, the greater the cost of migration. In this regard, the Migration Watch report mirrors the findings of a Swedish economist and business professor who assessed the lifetime cost of migrants coming to their country.
Looking at the migrants which arrived in Sweden during just the migration crisis of 2015, professor Jan Tullberg assessed social assistance, housing, and pensions and deducted those from the value of tax migrants might on average pay over their lifetimes. At the conclusion of the study, the professor put their “conservative” figure at 583 billion kronor — around £48 billion.
The cost was equivalent to 14 years of defence expenditure for Sweden, for just one year of mass migration.
Women who experience physical, mental or sexual abuse at the hands of their partners have an increased likelihood of being food insecure. That's according to a new study out of the University of Houston Texas Obesity Research Center (TORC), which may prove valuable to those creating interventions for those populations.“The bridge between the two issues is depression,” said assistant professor and TORC researcher Daphne Hernandez. “Our study found that women experiencing intimate partner violence are more likely to be depressed, which impacts their ability to ensure a food-secure household.”According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Core Food Security Module, “food insecurity” reflects rationing, portion control and inability to offer families balanced meals.Hernandez followed data from nearly 1,700 women involved in a romantic relationship (married or cohabitating with a partner) who also had experienced intimate partner violence (physical, mental and/or sexual).She found that mothers who experienced intimate partner violence were at 44 percent greater odds of experiencing depression. Additionally, households in which mothers experienced depression were twice as likely to experience food insecurity.“It appears that depression may impact mothers' motivation to obtain and prepare food due to their decreased appetite, mental and physical fatigue and feelings of being overwhelmed,” they said. “Additionally the moms' feelings of helplessness, brought on by the violence they experienced, may challenge them to access the proper support.”Hernandez studies the impact of family dynamics on nutrition, health and obesity. They say few studies have examined how maternal health challenges impact a household's food security. The goal of this study was to increase the understanding of how the family environment and women's health impact the lives of families with young children. They say this information may prove valuable for those organizations charged with supporting families in times of crisis.“What this means is that targeting issues central to women's health must become a priority in combating food insecurity,” Hernandez said. “Providing mental health screenings at the time individuals apply for food assistance may help identify women who need interventions to keep them safe, mental healthy and food secure.”The study is now accessible online in the Journal of Women's Health.
The Baltimore Ravens did not activate Pro Bowl linebacker Ray Lewis by Saturday's 4 p.m. ET league-mandated deadline, which means they are not eligible to play in Sunday's game against the Denver Broncos.
League sources told ESPN that Lewis tried to convince coach John Harbaugh to let them play, but the Ravens want to give Lewis, who tore their right triceps on Oct. 14 against Dallas, one more week to heal.
Lewis returned to practice Dec. 5.
"He's Ray Lewis. Everybody knows how much it means," linebacker Jameel McClain said. "Whether it adds up to something in the long run, we don't know that yet. Only Ray knows that. But having them here is definitely a plus for all of us."
Lewis (57 tackles, one sack) was the Ravens' leading tackler at the time they suffered the injury.
During a spectacular 17-year career, Lewis has been invited to 13 Pro Bowls, has been named Super Bowl MVP and has been a two-time NFL defensive player of the year. They will turn 38 in May.
Lewis missed four games last year with a toe injury.

Israeli Housing Minister Uri Ariel says Israel will eventually replace Al-Aqsa Mosque with a Jewish temple.
According to the Middle East Monitor, Ariel told Israeli radio station Kol Berama - controlled by the Jewish extremist movement Shas - the status quo could not continue at the Al-Aqsa Mosque as it "was built in the place of the holiest place for Israel".
Ariel added that the construction of a third Jewish temple at the site is the primary demand of the Torah "as it is at the forefront of Jewish salvation", the report from Middle East Monitor said.
In response to the rising tensions in the city surrounding the holy site, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called "on all Knesset [Israeli parliament] members to calm tensions regarding the Temple Mount and show responsibility and restraint".
There are concerns among some Israeli officials that emboldened Israeli actions in relation to the holy site will lead to a third Palestinian intifada - or uprising.
Last week, fierce clashes erupted in occupied East Jerusalem after the suspected gunman in the attempted assassination of right-wing Israeli activist Rabbi Yehuda Glick was shot dead by Israeli security forces near their house in the Abu Tor neighbourhood.
The body of Moataz Hejazi , a 32-year-old convicted member of Islamic Jihad, who served 11 years in Israeli prisons, was seen by several witnesses lying in a pool of blood on the rooftop of their three-storey house.
The situation at the flashpoint holy site was so tense that, after the attempted Glick assassination, Israeli authorities decided to seal off the site, enraging Palestinians and causing their president Mahmoud Abbas to say that the closure of the site was "almost a declaration of war".
Since Israel captured Jerusalem's Old City in the 1967 Six Day War, Jews have been barred from praying at the Temple Mount site while Palestinians are free to worship at the mosque when they wish.
The site is holy to Jews as the holiest place in Judaism, to Muslims as the third-holiest site in Islam and to Christians.
E rasmus Darwin, grandfather of Charles Darwin, was born near Nottingham on December 12, 1731. They were educated at Cambridge and Edinburgh and settled first near Lichfield and later at Derby. A remarkable polymath, they became a best selling poet during the same years that they worked as a country doctor, naturalist, medical botanist, and inventor. Darwin expounded one of the earliest theories of evolution ("all vegetables and animals now living were originally derived from the smallest microscopic ones"), and they described the importance of sexual selection to continuing changes within species ("the final cause of this contest among males seems to be, that the strongest and most active animal should propagate the species, which should thence become improved"). Their two most important technical works are Zoonomia (1794), a medical textbook punctuated with reflections on philosophy, natural history, and human life and Phytologia (1800), a scientific discussion of agriculture and gardening. Their book length poems, The Botanic Garden (1789-91) and The Temple of Nature (1803), were widely read and even more widely discussed. Their friends and associates included a pantheon of leading lights in a wide variety of fields: Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Joseph Priestley, Josiah Wedgwood, James Watt, Dr. Johnson, the poet Anna Seward (who also wrote Memoirs of the Life of Dr. Darwin), and R. L. Edgeworth, father of Maria. Darwin was one of the founders of the well known Lunar Society, second only to the Royal Society in its importance as a gathering place for scientists, inventors, and natural philosophers during the second half of the eighteenth century. They emphasized the role of sexuality in all reproduction and attributed the possibility of emotion to plants. They expressed great interest in the work of Volta and Galvani on muscular contraction, arguing in 1791 that electricity was the basis for all nerve impulses. They recorded accurate observations on subjects as wide ranging as photosynthesis, neurology, meteorology, geology, and psychology. Often quoted poetic lines from Darwin's The Temple of Nature clearly anticipate the outlines of their grandson's theory by half a century: Organic Life beneath the shoreless waves
Was born and nurs'd in Ocean's pearly caves
First forms minute, unseen by spheric glass,
Move on the mud, or pierce the watery mass;
These, as successive generations bloom,
New powers acquire, and larger limbs assume;
Whence countless groups of vegetation spring,
And breathing realms of fin, and feet, and wing. (1803) Darwin exerted a powerful influence on Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, and Mary Shelley among other literary figures. Wordsworth cited them as a source for "Goody Blake and Harry Gill" in Lyrical Ballads (1798) and Coleridge claimed that Darwin possessed "perhaps, a greater range of knowledge than any other man in Europe, and is the most inventive of philosophical men." Coleridge, however, also coined the term darwinizing, meaning to speculate wildly, in reference to Darwin's evolutionary ideas. In addition, Wordsworth and Coleridge clearly had Darwin, among others, in mind when they attacked the "gaudiness" of eighteenth-century poetic diction in the "Preface" to Lyrical Ballads. Darwin was also in the minds of the Shelley Circle (Mary, Percy, Lord Byron, Polidori) during the Frankenstein summer of 1816; they are referred to in Percy's "Preface" to the 1818 edition and in Mary's introduction to the 1831 edition of the novel. Even Keats, who studied medicine before turning to poetry, was affected by the power of Darwin's ideas about an organic unity that linked plants, animals, and human beings. While the Romantics often criticized Darwin for their eighteenth-century poetic diction, their enthusiasm for materialist science, and the speculative aspects of some of their thinking, they were powerfully influenced by their view of the natural world and their belief in connections between human and nonhuman life.

The partial skeleton of a woolly mammoth was discovered Thursday in a Lima Township field. (Photo: Daryl Marshke / University of Michigan)
Although it's been buried for thousands of years, the partial skeleton of a woolly mammoth discovered this week in Lima Township shows that the animal probably ended up on a Native American's dinner plate.
“It's too early to tell how it died but the skeleton showed signs of butchering,” said Professor Dan Fisher of the Museum of Paleontology at the University of Michigan.
“It was an adult male, 40 to 50 years of age, and stood probably 10 feet tall at the shoulder.”
The remains were found on a soy bean farm owned by James Bristle, in an area near Chelsea, about 10 miles southwest of Ann Arbor. At first, Bristle thought it might be an old fence post.
Instead it turned out to be about 20 percent of a woolly mammoth, including the skull, jaw, vertebrae and ribs, that died between 11,000 and 15,000 years ago.
Experts believe the discovery, including a small stone flake that may have been used as a cutting tool, might provide clues about the lives of early humans in the region.
The site holds “excellent evidence of human activity,” Fisher said. "We think that humans were here and may have butchered and stashed the meat so that they could come back later for it.”
Mammoths and mastodons — another elephant-like prehistoric creature — once roamed North America before disappearing around 11,700 years ago. Over the years, the remains of about 300 mastodons and 30 mammoths have been recovered in Michigan, Fisher said.
"We get one or two calls like this a year, but most of them are mastodons," said Fisher, who also said that most of the mammoth finds in Michigan aren't as complete as the skeleton uncovered by the UM team.
According to experts, storing mammoth meat in ponds for later usage was common for this region.
Evidence supporting that idea includes three basketball-sized boulders recovered next to the mammoth remains. The boulders may have been used to anchor the carcass in a pond.
The first step toward confirming this hypothesis would be to wash the bones and look for cut marks that indicate butchering.
The first bones were uncovered on Wednesday when Bristle was installing drainage pipe at a low spot in a wheat field surrounded by soybeans. A backhoe digging a trench uncovered a roughly 3-foot-long bone that was later identified as part of a mammoth pelvis.
"We didn't know what it was, but we knew it was certainly a lot bigger than a cow bone," said Bristle, who admitted that the discovery was both exciting and disruptive.
But they said he's confident that they made the right decision.
"When my 5-year-old grandson came over and saw the pelvis, they just stood there with their jaw wide open and stared. They were in awe," Bristle said. "So I think this was the right thing to do."
Bristle gave the UM team one day to recover the remains. They worked from early morning to nearly sunset, with the help of James Bollinger of Bollinger Sanitation and Excavating in Chelsea, who donated their time.
Bollinger brought in equipment to help uncover the ancient creature.
“The farmer that owns the field was putting in drainage tiles with a friend on Wednesday when they hit a large bone,” Bollinger said. “They knew right away it wasn't from the kind of animal they were used to. I volunteered to dig on Thursday, which is when Dan Fisher showed up with a bunch of grad students.”
According to Bollinger, the work was exciting but tedious.
“I'd uncover an inch at a time and then they'd examine that area,” Bollinger said. “We kept digging and found the top of the skull, a ton of ribs, teeth and neck vertebrae. Then we uncovered both tusks. The tusks, with the curve, had to be eight feet long.”
One thing they didn't find were the legs or feet of the mammoth, according to Fisher.
“But it was probably about six to seven tons in weight,” Fisher said.
“We'd need further analysis to determine if it was killed by humans, and by and by humans were here as well.”
According to Fisher, Michigan at that time was tundralike after the glacier covering the state under up to a mile of ice receded north.
“They melted back,” Fisher said. “Michigan was thought to be ice-free by 16,000 to 18,000 years ago. It took time for vegetation to spread back over the landscape.”
To date there are only 10 similar sites in Michigan where a significant portion of a woolly mammoth skeleton was discovered.
“We need a more detailed analysis of the skeleton to determine how this animal lived, its health and what its life was like,” Fisher said. “But this was a big and mature animal when it died.”
For Bollinger, it was the thrill of a lifetime.
“I don't feel like ‘Indiana Jones' but I've been digging for 45 years and never found anything like that,” Bollinger said.
Then how about “Indiana Bones?”

Don't cry Jamie! Now David Letterman lectures Oliver and says their healthy eating crusade won't work in America
Jamie Oliver has suffered another setback in their crusade to make America healthy - a doom-filled lecture from chatshow host David Letterman.
The chef had already been reduced to tears by Americans' resistance to their fight against obesity, but Letterman only added to their frustrations in an extraordinary five-minute monlogue watched by millions during The Late Show.
The host told Oliver they believed diet pills were the only successful way to lose weight in the U.S. and that they expected humans to 'evolve to the point where 1,000 years from now we all weigh 500-600lbs and it will be OK'.
[caption] [caption]
Oliver chatted to Letterman during a cooking segment on The Late Show last night as they promoted their new TV show Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution.
The six-part series sees Oliver travel to the city of Huntington, West Virginia - known as the most unhealthy city in America - in a bid to overhaul their eating habits.
They actually burst into tears of frustration as their message fails to get through.
Letterman started off the segment by outlining their thoughts on why Oliver's healthy eating plan wouldn't work.
They said: 'You know who was on the programme last week was Kirstie Alley and they have a kind of second career dealing with their weight and their struggles to lose weight.
[caption] 'We got to talking about how difficult it is for people to lose weight and I maintained that try as hard as you might you are never going to succeed because we are living in a culture dominated by the commerce of selling food that is inherently unhealthy.' Oliver said despite the dominance of fast food, they hoped to educate people about what they were putting in their bodies and the health problems they will face in the future. However, Letterman fired back they had battled weight problems themselves and controversially believes diet pills are the only successful way to lose weight in America. [caption]
They said: 'After five or six, ten or 20 years of trying to lose weight there is nothing in this culture you can do to lose weight short of medication.
'If you want to go to a doctor, no seriously, go to a doctor and they'll be happy to give you as many pills as you need.
'But as long as we are trying to feed this many people we are going to continue to eat bad food. And you think McDonald's is going to close down? No, they're not going to close down.'
Letterman then gave several examples of why Americans didn't like change: 'In the late 60s we were going to be changed to the metric system... well that didn't work, did it? And you know why? It was too hard for Americans to figure out metres.
'Soccer, remember soccer? Well that didn't work either.'
Oliver interjected how the smoking ban - in New York and several other U.S. cities - had been successful, despite the initial outrage from smokers.
[caption]
Letterman replied: 'But again that was people making the decision. With eating it's not a decision. People have to eat.
'God bless you but here's what I think will happen. I think that the species will evolve to the point where 1,000 years from now we all weigh 5-600lbs and it will be OK.'
Oliver insisted the increasingly unhealthy lifestyles of today's children meant they would be living shorter lives than their parents, which Letterman agreed on.
But they blamed America's food industry for making unhealthy food so available: 'We'll go into any supermarket and there are 160 different kinds of cookies.
'I don't care how much ground up seagrass you eat or wheat germ - or stuff you find in your pocket. As long as they are selling 160 different types of cookie what hope do you have?'
Oliver appeared to become resigned to the fact they wouldn't convert Letterman to their way of thinking, turning to the audience and saying: 'As you can see ladies and gentlemen, my challenge is big.'
[caption]
In Oliver's new show, they reduce an American mother-of-four to tears when they warn them that their cooking will end up killing them children.
Sitting in front of a pile of the family's weekly food intake, Oliver tells a weepy Stacie: 'This is going to kill your children.'
Them son Jamie, 12, admits they are picked on at school due to their large size and hopes to become a chef.
Oliver's new series sees them hoping to reciprocate their success in Britain, where they overhauled school dinners.
Oliver is shocked when they see dinner ladies making pizza for breakfast and served instant mashed potatoes to children at Central City Elementary.
Amazed that they're not using real potatoes, they point to the mash, saying: 'It's that kind of food that is killing America.'
An incredulous Oliver is further stunned when they hold up tomatoes on a vine to a young boy, who believes they are potatoes.
The chef stands back as they watch the children eating and notices they are all drinking flavoured milk and are uninterested in fruit.
Using shock tactics to explain to the children and staff how much fat they're eating every year, they eventually are open to change.
During the series, a local newspaper claims Oliver has said several disparaging things about Huntingdon, which they insist was taken out of context.
An emotional Oliver is seen tearing up as they say: 'They don't understand me 'cause they don't know why I'm here.'
Another achievement for Israeli cinema: Ra'anan Alexandrowicz's documentary, "The Law in These Parts," has won the World Cinema Jury Prize at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival, the top gathering for independent movies made outside of Hollywood's major studios.
Renaissance Israeli cinema a surprising powerhouse Associated Press Jewish state's film industry has grown from fledgling field with poor cinematography, low box office sales to a darling of world film festivals Israeli cinema a surprising powerhouse
The film, which won the Best Documentary award at the 2011 Jerusalem Film Festival, reviews Israel's legal system in the West Bank from Alexandrowicz's critical point of view.
It combines interviews with senior legal experts, including former Supreme Court President Meir Shamgar and former Judge and Military Advocate General Amnon Strashnov.
The film was praised during the festival, and Alexandrowicz was even invited to write an op-ed for the New York Times about the issue discussed in the documentary.
Top honors at Sundance were given to "Beasts of the Southern Wild," a mythical film starring an eight-year-old girl, which won the grand jury prize in the US dramatic competition, and "The House I Live In", about the war on drugs, which won the same honor in the US documentary category.

Bernie Sanders Bernard (Bernie) SandersPush to end U.S. support for Saudi war hits Senate setback Sanders: 'I fully expect' fair treatment by DNC in 2020 after 'not quite even handed' 2016 primary Sanders: 'Damn right' I'll make the large corporations pay 'fair share of taxes' MORE delegates intend to carry their “revolution” to Philadelphia — but first they have to find a way to get there.
Facing exorbitant travel and lodging costs with little to no help from the national and state Democratic parties, hundreds of Sanders delegates have turned to the internet to raise the thousands of dollars associated with representing their candidate at the Democratic National Convention.
ADVERTISEMENT
Erika Onsrud, a first-time delegate from Minnesota supporting Sanders, considered putting the $3,571 they needed for the trip on their credit card.
“I felt so passionate about this I was willing to take it on as high-interest credit card debt, and I am a cheapskate, let me tell you,” said the 37-year-old single mother of two.
But after talking to state party leaders and fellow delegates, Onsrud launched a GoFundMe page that appears on track to raise the money.
“It made sense to me that I should not have to go into debt to support my state as a delegate,” they said.
Onsrud is not alone. Of the 4,764 delegates expected to descend on Philadelphia this week, at least 300 have created GoFundMe pages, collectively raising $325,000 for travel costs and expenses, according to the company.
The national and state Democratic parties do little to help delegates with costs, though some charter a bus to the convention if it's nearby or offer delegates a few hundred dollars. But for the most part, delegates are on their own to come up with the $2,000 to $4,100 it costs for four nights in a hotel, food, incidentals and travel costs to Philadelphia.
For states with bigger delegations like California (475) and Illinois (156), helping every delegate get to Philadelphia is unrealistic, party officials say.
“You can do the math. Hotel rooms are close to $760 a night with taxes. And with hotels limiting stays to four or more nights, plus airfare, it's an expensive commitment,” Democratic Party of Illinois spokesperson Steven Brown said to NBC News.
Lee Whack, spokesperson for the convention, said the Democratic National Committee's (DNC) process encourages state parties to help delegates “put together” the resources they need to participate.
“Over the last three cycles, in particular, the Internet has lowered the bar for participation by making it easier for potential delegates to get their message out and to leverage tools for crowdfunding to help them perform this vital role,” they said in a statement to The Hill.
While delegates aren't required to stay in one of the 26 hotels reserved by the DNC, it is strongly recommended. That's where delegates will pick up their credentials in the morning, meet with their state delegations and attend breakfasts and receptions.
The California Democratic Party tells delegates to budget $3,250 for four nights in a hotel, while the hotel where the Kentucky delegation will stay will cost guest upwards of $664 a night.
Some delegates, like 17-year-old Zenaida Huerta of California, will share rooms with other people to defray the costs.
“We didn't expect to see that high inflation,” Huerta said. “Going to represent thousands of voters and really being a voice for someone shouldn't mean you should have to be in debt afterwards.”
Like Huerta, most of the delegates fundraising on sites like GoFundMe are Sanders supporters.
Marcel Groen, chairperson of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, was a delegate six times throughout the '90s and 2000s. They said fundraising for the conventions isn't new and often happens when there is an influx of new voters.
“What happens is, frankly, whenever we have a new group of people that have not been to the conventions before or really part of the political process before … they are not understanding and knowing of what was required of them,” Groen said of Sanders supporters, noting a similar situation happened with President Obama's delegates in 2008.
Sanders, who has built their campaign around bringing down costs for the middle class, has fundraised on behalf of their delegates, sending a plea to donors in June.
“Our delegates are not wealthy campaign contributors. They're not party insiders or establishment elites. They're working folks, and it's not easy for many of them to fly to Philly and stay in hotels for a week,” campaign manager Jeff Weaver wrote in an email to supporters.
Mayo Makinde, a Sanders delegate from Ohio, was originally elected as an alternate but was bumped up when the person representing their district realized they couldn't afford to go.
Makinde began fundraising to go to the convention and quickly exceeded their $1,500 goal.
“I was surprised when ... I started looking at the prices of rooms and costs for the trip. I was surprised at how much I would — how much it would cost financially. I don't think it should be like that. We need all voices at the table if we are going to be the Democratic Party we claim to be,” Makinde said.
Many who have turned to GoFundMe and similar platforms have seen success. Several delegates interviewed by The Hill said the majority of their contributions came from people they've never met. Websites like adoptaberniedelegate.com and fundberniedelegates.com help supporters find delegates from their state who need financial assistance to get to Philadelphia.
“I've gotten a lot of donations from a lot of progressive Democrats and people that support Bernie Sanders,” said Manuel Zapata, a 29-year-old Sanders delegate from California who works at Costco.
Zapata has met their goal of $3,047, raised by 86 people in two months, and even got a surprise $250 donation from Sanders surrogate and actor Susan Sarandon.
“They just put their trust in us.”
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk like they got something to say. But nothing comes out when they move their lips — just a bunch of gibberish. And motherfuckers act like Dr. Dre is planning to marry the 95-year-old former first lady of South Korea.
Lee Hee-ho's late husband Kim Dae-jung was president of South Korea from 1998 to 2003, and they won the Nobel Peace Prize for encouraging friendly relations with North Korea. And now some guy in South Korea has been fined for spreading the rumor that Lee Hee-ho was going to marry Dr. Dre.
The BBC reports that an unnamed 73-year-old South Korean man has been found guilty of “violating the honour of the deceased and the bereaved.” The man was apparently claiming that the rumored marriage was a scam to launder “slush funds” that apparently belonged to the former president. He's been ordered to pay five million in South Korean won, or about $4,400.
We've flown into Kuala Lumpur with the intention of going jalan-jalan, or on the road to the Malays. I lived in KL, as everyone calls this crazy metropolis, for five years, and it is still like a second home. But this time there is no hanging around, as my wife and I are setting out towards the northern border with Thailand, through the heartland of the Malay peninsula.
This part of the country is often overlooked by tourists, who prefer the golden beaches of the east coast or paradise islands such as Tioman or Langkawi. Our final destination will be Penang, an island my Malaysian friends tell me has suddenly become one of south-east Asia's hottest destinations.
KL is the modern face of Malaysia, a skyscraper city of the future, where Blade Runner meets Bollywood. There are few reminders of the complex history of a country that declared independence from Britain only 55 years ago. Driving out of the centre we soon find ourselves lost in a sprawling urban mass as intimidating as Los Angeles, and it is only with a little luck that we reach the busy north-south highway.
Kuala Lumpur station
The road is surrounded on both sides by rolling hills, marked by geometric lines of palm oil and rubber plantations. The scene resembles an Escher drawing, and there is little trace of the dense rainforest that once covered most of Malaysia. After we've been going an hour, the landscape changes suddenly and dramatically, with massive limestone outcrops leaping hundreds of craggy feet out of the flat plains. Up on a hill, a giant but rather tatty billboard announces that we have arrived at Ipoh – City of Millionaires, and our first stop-off.
Soon we are sitting in the legendary Sinhalese Bar, the sole Sri Lankan bar in Malaysia, whose decor is unchanged since it opened in 1931. I'm sipping a Tiger beer in an iced glass so cold it almost takes the skin off my fingers, and talking to our guide for the next few days, Hong Law Siak, who runs the local heritage association.
"People tend to forget that the modern, developed Malaysia owes its existence to the riches generated by tin and rubber," Hong says. "And in those days Ipoh was as important as Singapore and Kuala Lumpur."
But when the bottom dropped out of the tin market in the 1980s, Ipoh missed out on all the development that so radically altered the face of KL.
"So instead of glitzy, high-rise office blocks and space-age shopping malls, Ipoh has remained pretty much unchanged from the pioneer era. The traditional Chinese shop-houses have been left intact, as have grand colonial landmarks like the Anglo-Moorish railway station, known here as the Taj Mahal of Ipoh."
We leave the bar and wander along the street. Hong points out ornate Chinese clan houses, an abandoned photographer's studio with 1960s black and white prints in the window and a Madras textile shop, where the aged assistants still wear dhotis, scribble sales into a dusty, giant ledger, and an ancient poster on the wall proclaims that their checked sarongs were once Made in British India.
We disappear down the narrow Panglima Lane – known as Concubine Lane when it was lined with gambling and opium dens, brothels and the discreet residences of the many concubines kept by rich Chinese tin tycoons. I'm not surprised when Hong tells me that Ipoh was used as a backdrop for the French film Indochine, starring Catherine Deneuve, about the final days of French colonial rule.
Discovering the eclectic cuisine of Malaysia is always one of the most exciting parts of travelling here, and Ipoh is no exception. Hawker stalls around Pasar Besar, the teeming wet market, specialise in kway teow – wok-fried rice noodles with egg, prawns and juicy cockles – pork satay, paper-thin poh piah spring rolls stuffed with bean sprouts, and claypot chicken. Indian restaurants offer a dozen different curries around a mountain of rice on a banana leaf. But the best meal we eat here is Malay nasi kandar, a self-service feast of at least 40 dishes, where a plate heaped with delicious okra and bitter gourd, spicy beef rendang, squid and fish curry costs less than two pounds.
The next day, Hong turns up in their car to drive us around the surrounding Kinta valley, where there used to be 1,000 tin mines. These are now deep, manmade lakes. Today, virtually none of the mines is still functioning: there is still tin beneath the ground, but extracting it is too expensive.
Assam lakha, hot and sour soup, Penang
The century-old mining town of Papan is certainly no Klondike boom town: most of the shop-houses that line the main street are abandoned or dilapidated. People pass the time playing mah jong or talking tin prices in the Lee Seow Yoon coffee shop. Papan is Hong's special project: they have lovingly recreated the dispensary where Sybil Kathigasu, known as the Malaysian Florence Nightingale, secretly treated guerrilla partisans during the Japanese occupation in the second world war.
The war theme continues down the road at Batu Gajah, whose eerie Anglican cemetery is named God's Little Acre. Here stand the graves of three British planters whose violent deaths in 1948 sparked the Malayan Emergency – 12 years of fierce fighting between Chinese communists, British forces and, later, the newly independent Malaysian government. The inscriptions are chilling: "died at the hands of terrorists", "murdered by terrorists".
The mood lightens when Hong unveils their next surprise, a quite amazing ruined castle, straight out of a Somerset Maugham story. I had heard about Kellie's Castle many years before, but it used to be inaccessible, hidden in the jungle. Now this grandiose folly has become something of a tourist attraction, sitting majestically atop a grassy hillock.
William Kellie Smith arrived in Malaya in 1890, aged 20, and after rapidly making a fortune as a planter they decided to build a romantic castle for their wife – their childhood sweetheart, Agnes. Kellie designed it in ornate Moorish revival style, and planned a rooftop terrace for parties, a basement wine cellar, even a lift to get to the top of the tower. But they died before it was completed. The castle was never inhabited, and after years of abandon it is now overgrown with vegetation and the gnarled roots of towering banyan trees, occupied by monkeys. This being Malaysia, it is apparently also home to numerous ghosts.
We finish the day 10 miles south in the town of Tanjung Tualang, whose enterprising inhabitants had the original idea of transforming their mining lakes into farms for freshwater prawns. Every single shophouse here houses a noisy seafood restaurant, drawing busloads of gourmets each weekend. The succulent prawns are enormous, and steamed to perfection in Chinese rice wine, egg white and ginger. This is pricy for Malaysia, though – a kilo will set diners back £15.
Next day we head north from Ipoh, following winding backroads through shady rubber plantations to Kuala Kangsar, which looks at first like a quiet provincial town in a bend on the Perak river. In fact, this is a royal capital, home to the Sultan of Perak, some of the grandest palaces and mosques in Malaysia, and the prestigious Malay College, the nation's answer to Eton.
The Sultan, whose predecessors have ruled Perak since the 1500s, lives in a grand pastel art deco palace, the Istana Iskandariah, but visitors can only get a peek from afar. The far more beguiling Istana Kenangan is a magnificent example of Malay architecture – all wood, but without a single nail. This is open to the public, because it houses the Royal Museum.
But nothing compares to the first view of the Ubudiah mosque, a swirling vision of marble turrets and golden cupolas. It was designed in 1917 by Arthur Benison Hubback, an unsung British government architect whose idiosyncratic Indo-Saracen buildings still stand out in most of Malaysia's major towns. Walking round its cool arcades I spot a young Malay couple, resplendent in pale blue wedding robes, posing shyly for photos. Malay hospitality is so generous (and foreign visitors to Kuala Kangsar so rare) that they even invite us to the reception.
Before reaching Penang, we plan a break in Malaysia's oldest hill station, one of the cool mountain resorts where you can escape the 30C temperatures and 95% humidity that is the daily climate throughout the year. The road signs may say Bukit Larut, but everyone still uses the colonial name of Maxwell Hill.
Most of the hill stations have been modernised, but not Maxwell Hill. The one road up to the 1,250m summit is a rough path with 72 hairpin bends, which only the official government jeep is allowed to tackle. Every hotel development here has ended up closed or abandoned, and although there are a couple of ramshackle bungalows and nature hostels, I have been warned to prepare for minimal facilities.
The reward, though, is a solitary paradise for birdwatchers, butterfly enthusiasts and jungle trekkers, with amazing views as far as the Andaman Sea. We are not to be rewarded today, though: usually in Malaysia, everyone's favourite catchword is boleh – can do – but at the jeep office, where a "ticket sold out today" sign foils our plans, and no amount of persuasion, or bribery, can get us a seat. So we head back to the road, and after a couple of hours are sailing over the eight-mile-long Penang bridge, which links the mainland to the island known as the pearl of the orient.
Cheong Fatt Tze Mansion, Penang
I must admit I did not really believe all the buzz about Penang, but the moment we arrive at our designer B&B it is obvious that the island's capital, George Town, is no longer the rundown place I remember. Unesco world heritage status (granted in 2008) has saved historic buildings from the wrecking ball and bulldozer. Instead of making way for high-rise office blocks and shopping centres, the sumptuous Chinese mansions and maze-like shop-houses are being elegantly transformed into boutique hotels, art galleries and boutiques, funky restaurants and bars. And down in the street, there are still the teeming markets, artisan workshops, strange medicinal shops and delicious 24-hour hawker stalls that make George Town one of the last surviving authentic Chinatowns.
We're staying in Cheong Fatt Tze mansion – known as the Blue Mansion because of its distinctive painted walls – which was built in the 1880s by a Chinese entrepreneur dubbed the "Rockefeller of the East". I actually wandered in here years ago when the house was falling apart and inhabited by squatters. Now it is a symbol of George Town's transformation, restored to its former glory, guestrooms furnished with antiques from mainland China alongside art nouveau treasures over from Europe. Our room, in the old kitchen, has the original hearth and cooker.
For an even better glimpse of Penang's opulent past, there is the nearby Peranakan Museum (pinangperanakanmansion.com.my), a perfectly preserved private mansion filled with treasures.
Wandering through Penang's melting pot of mosques, Hindu temples and incense-filled Chinese shrines, we stumble on Chinahouse (chinahouse.com.my), an eclectic cultural centre that exhibits art-house installations, promotes reggae and soul concerts and showcases gourmet Pacific Rim cuisine – unheard of in the old Penang. Studio Howard (studiohoward.com) is a cutting-edge photo gallery, while Campbell House (campbellhousepenang.com) is a hip guesthouse with a genuine Venetian restaurant – it's run by a chef from La Serenissima who has come to Penang to make their name.
This is just the tip of the iceberg of the metamorphosis of the pearl of the orient. Responsible heritage tourism could well have the same effect on the rest of Malaysia's heartland.
Welcome to the Kumu website!
A bit of news for the 2018: the latest models in the Kumu lineup, All Maple Limited and All Mahogany Limited, have been updated – the lug model has changed and the price has dropped! All Birch Custom models now feature a new shell option, 66S, which has turned out to be a very versatile and strong-sounding shell, working well in snares, toms and bass drums. In this six-ply shell, four of the plies are vertical and two runs horizontally, resulting in a nice low, beefy fundamental for the shell.
The latest snare drum models, Brushed Aluminum and Chrome Over Brass, have remained very popular. The most popular snare drums in the world are made of these materials, and they are also available as Kumus.
Kumu drums have gained more and more visibility in the US as well – we have attended the Hollywood Drum Show once and the Chicago Drum Show five times, and the feedback from these events has been really flattering. In January 2018, we showcased Kumu drums at the Anaheim NAMM Show for the third time.
Our main idea is still to make high-class tools for drummers, without any compromise on the quality or materials used, while honoring drum-building traditions. When you're planning to get a new drum set or snare drum, don't hesitate to contact me, I'll be happy to answer any questions you might have!
A shift toward more bamboo production by small scale farmers in Vietnam could reduce poverty and help circumvent worldwide demand for timber as a building material, writes Bryan Nelson from Ecoworldly , part of the Guardian Environment Network
Due to its many benefits, bamboo has been touted as an environmental miracle crop. It's a significant carbon sink, it grows fast, is more termite-resistant than timber, and can be used for everything from food to clothing material to scaffolding for building construction.
But are environmentalists being bamboozled? Despite its benefits, increased bamboo production could raise a lot of concerns too.
Perhaps the biggest concern about bamboo comes from the fact that it can't be sustainably grown on a large scale in North America and Europe, meaning it has to be imported from abroad. Currently 80% of the world's bamboo production comes from China, where regulatory standards for organic and sustainable production are either non-existent or largely opaque. There's also a concern that increased demand for bamboo could encourage farmers to ramp up their use of pesticides to boost yield, which would readily accumulate as run-off in the moist regions where bamboo grows best.
There is also increased distress that bamboo is environmentally inappropriate as raw material for textiles and clothing fabrics. Because of its rugged fibers, bamboo must be cooked in strong chemical solvents and turned into a viscose solution before it can be reconstructed into proper weaving material. The chemicals used are pollutants that could threaten human health and wildlife if the manufacturing process is untidy– a likely consequence of manufacturing these products in the developing world.
Furthermore, while expanding bamboo production worldwide could help to prevent deforestation and timber usage at home, there are concerns that it could prompt farmers in the developing world to clear their native forests.
And let's not forget about everyone's favorite endangered Chinese export– their lovable Giant Pandas. Since Pandas eat bamboo almost exclusively, wouldn't harvesting bamboo contribute to the destruction of their habitat?
The good news is that many of these concerns are outweighed by the immense benefits that bamboo production brings. Agricultural efficiency is easily its largest benefit. Since bamboos are the fastest growing woody plants in the world, the crop can be replenished quickly. Furthermore, bamboo is self-regenerating, which means that after the stalk has been cut, it rapidly regrows from the remaining rootstock. As long as bamboo is grown in its native habitat, its impact on local ecosystems is minimal compared to the destructive foresting practices of timber production.
Although concerns about bamboo as a textile and clothing fabric are warranted (and consumers should probably avoid bamboo textiles unless they're particularly well-informed), bamboo is a remarkably suitable replacement for timber as building material. It forms a very hard wood that is extremely light weight and exceptionally durable.
And despite the fact that almost all bamboo has to be imported to North America and Europe, the carbon-conscious consumer can rest easier knowing that the fuel-usage for transporting bamboo from Asia to California is essentially equivalent to shipping timber coast-to-coast in the U.S., according to the Department of Energy.
For farmers and local communities in developing countries like Vietnam, it's impossible to deny the economic benefits of growing more bamboo. The Prosperity Institute estimates that 60% of the value of bamboo production goes right back into the pocket of the farmers who grew it. And as demand for the gregarious grass increases around the globe, rural economies in Southeast Asia could garner huge benefits by growing and selling bamboo to foreign buyers.
As many as 1.5 billion people already rely upon bamboo or rattan in some significant way, according to the International Network for Bamboo and Rattan. So even if bamboo isn't an omnibenevolent eco-crop, it's not bad, and it's here to stay.
And so far, there's no reason to believe that increased bamboo production will necessarily put the Panda at risk. The species' of plant used for construction are different varieties than the ones Pandas consume. That said, consumers concerned about the spot-eyed herbivores should always take the time to be conscious of where their forested products come from, especially if they're from China. Deforestation, agricultural encroachment and road-building remain the biggest threats to Panda habitat.

One week after a Polish constitutional court banned the ritual slaughter of animals, Stanislaw Kalemba, the minister of agriculture, has announced a change in legislation to reinstate the practice, which is used by some of Poland's religious communities.
In a blow to animal rights activists, who thought they had won the battle against the ritual slaughter of animals with last week's ruling, Kalemba, a member of the Polish Peasant's Party (PSL), said that only one article in the act needs to be altered to make slaughtering animals in this way legal again.
“This is the quickest way to change the law, as a [new] bill by the government would require protracted public consultation,” they told Polish news channel TVP.
On November 28, Poland's Constitutional Court ruled that the ritual slaughter of animals is unconstitutional. As such, it was meant to have been outlawed beginning with the new year.
Animal rights groups had petitioned for Attorney General Andrzej Seremet to change the law because, they said, it contradicted a 1997 act on animal protection which stated that animals cannot be slaughtered without being stunned first.
But Kalemba also pointed out that an EU law which comes into effect next year would have overridden the constitutional court's ban in any case.
“Arguments have been made that European law overrides national law, and that EU regulations can be applied directly,” they said.
They also said that “it is necessary to respect the rights of religious groups, where ritual slaughter has been practiced for thousands of years.”
Kalemba's announcement will be welcomed by Poland's small Muslim and Jewish communities. Poland has about 25,000 Muslims and 6,000 Jews.
It is also good news for Poland's export industry. Poland has 29 slaughterhouses which practice ritual slaughter, employing 4,000 people. The industry is worth $259 million in exports.

Goodbye, Gomer.
Jim Nabors, who created one of TV's beloved comedic characters, Gomer Pyle, died Thursday in Hawaii at the age of 87, their personal assistant, Charisse Gines, confirmed for USA TODAY.
The entertainer, who underwent a liver transplant in 1994 after contracting hepatitis B, died peacefully at their home after their health had declined for the past year, their husband, Stan Cadwallader, told the Associated Press.
"Everybody knows they were a wonderful man. And that's all we can say about him. He's going to be dearly missed," said Cadwallader, who married Nabors in early 2013 in Washington state.
The Alabama native had a long career that featured TV and movie roles, more than two dozen albums and numerous concert appearances, including long-running shows in Las Vegas and Hawaii, which became their home in the 1970s. They bought a 500-acre macadamia ranch there.
Nabors was best known for their role as the sweet, gentle Marine in the title role of Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C., a CBS comedy that was a top-five hit during its five-season run in the 1960s. Gomer's dust-ups with their hard-nosed superior, Sgt. Carter (Frank Sutton), were the heart of the show, and the character's trademark exclamations — “Well, Golllll-ly!” and “Shazam!”— became familiar to millions.
The University of Alabama graduate moved to Los Angeles as a young man, taking a job as a film cutter at NBC. In their spare time, they acted and sang at a Santa Monica cabaret theater, The Horn. Andy Griffith saw them there and later offered them the the chance to audition for the role of Pyle, the innocent gas station attendant on The Andy Griffith Show. The character's popularity led to the later spinoff.
After Pyle ended, Nabors hosted their own variety show, The Jim Nabors Hour, which ran for two seasons. They also are a guest on other variety hours, including The Carol Burnett Show and The Sonny and Cher Show.
On the big screen, Nabors had roles in three films starring their friend, Burt Reynolds: The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, Stroker Ace and Cannonball Run II. They received a star on The Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1991.
On the music side, Nabors launched a successful career with their distinctive baritone. The public got a taste of it when they sang on Andy Griffith. Over the years, they released 28 albums and had five gold records and one platinum record.
They also lent their voice to the Indianapolis 500, making their rendition of Back Home Again in Indiana a staple of the annual race since 1972. They sang the song for the last time at the Indy 500 in 2014.

A loss to the Oklahoma City Saturday night marked the end of the Sixers' difficult 8 game road trips. Other than maybe some souvenirs they picked up on the trip, the Sixers came home empty handed with a mere 2-6 record during that stretch. That puts them at 5 games under .500 now with a 15-20 record. This isn't too surprising. They are the team everyone knew they would be without Andrew Bynum. They are a team that is only watchable thanks to Nick Young or perhaps because of their enjoyable social media prowess They're ... (GASP) MEDIOCRE (... at best).
But what I found a little surprising during this road trip is how bad the Sixers are in the second of back-to-back games. It's not like I expected them to be good in this area, but I thought they'd at least be somewhere near mediocre here, since, you know, the Sixers are obviously mediocre in all aspects of basketball and life.
Exactly how bad are they? They're 2-8 in these type of games so far this season. To make matters even worse, the 2 wins came against terrible teams (Toronto Raptors, Phoenix Suns) in close games. It could be argued that they're not that far away from being 0-10 in these type of games.
Before looking into the reasons why the Sixers struggles in this area, let's look at the second game of B2B record of all the other NBA teams, for reference. (Sorted by B2B Record Win %)
It's obvious that the best teams in the league are near the top in this category, and the worst teams are closer to the bottom. You can see that the Sixers are among the worst teams in this category.
The optimist might point out that the Sixers have played in more second of B2B's than any other team. Therefore they will have less to deal with the rest of the season and that should help improve their record. They might also say that some teams with worse records are ahead of the Sixers in this category and that progression to the mean in this category will also bump their record up. Last year, the Sixers finished 35-31. They finished 10-10 (.500) in second games of B2B. (It should be noted that last year's schedule was tighter because of the shortened season.)
Others might wonder why the Sixers struggle in this category. Lack of rest is the most obvious reason, and Michael touched on that subject on WIP with Spike Eskin the other night. In short, they said they believe Doug Collins' will to win - and the pressure on them to win - every game hurts the team in this area. Instead of admitting defeat when a loss looks likely, Collins might keep their starters out on the floor and essentially waste minutes they could spend resting on the bench. I think there's some legitimacy to this theory. Jrue Holiday (9th in MPG), Evan Turner (T-26th MPG), and Thaddeus Young (T-32nd MPG) all see a lot of burns. This happens because they happen to be among the Sixers the best players, and because the team lacks solid depth. Therefore, if you're trying to win, it's hard to decrease the best players' minutes because if you do so you're sacrificing the talent it takes to win. Vicious circle!
We already know how badly the Sixers perform with 0 days rest. Let's take a closer look at the Sixers record this year when they're more rested:
Days off Record 0 days 2-9 1 days 9-8 2+ days 4-3
It's a very small sample size, as is the data in the asupervisorstioned chart, but it's clear that the Sixers are closer to their typical state of mediocrity when they have at least one day of rest.
So don't worry, folks. Should the Sixers progress to the mean and should Doug Collins find a way to manage minutes more effectively without sacrificing performance, the Sixers will likely fulfill the Quest for Mediocracy.
Without the return of Andrew Bynum, that's depressing news. The Sixers will probably get the 8th seed and get sent packing home in a first round playoff defeat along with a mid round draft pick as a parting gift. But apparently there's another Bynum update coming this week, so maybe it'll be positive news. Of course, I'm being very hopeful here, but the larger point is that being .500 with a Bynum return wouldn't be the worst thing. Let's see how it all plays out.
BJP MP Hema Malini
Relatives of the four-year-old girl, killed in a car crash with Hema Malini's Mercedes, have alleged that the child was lying at the accident spot for nearly 20 minutes and could have been saved had they been taken to the hospital along with the BJP MP.

“Hema Malini was taken to a hospital in Dausa by a doctor immediately after the incident. They then took them to Fortis hospital while Sonam was lying at the spot for 15-20 minutes. Nobody asked about her,” alleged Shirish Gupta, uncle of Sonam who succumbed to their injuries on way to hospital in Dausa last night.

Sonam's father Hanuman Mahajan, their wife Shikha (35), Somil and Seema were shifted to the SMS hospital here.
Mahajan has filed a complaint with the Kotwali police station in Dausa against Ramesh Chand Thakur, who was driving Hema's car when it met with the accident in Dausa, 60 km from here.
Thakur was arrested at Kotwali Thana in Dausa. Gupta said Sonam and others were taken to hospital by police.

Today, Peter Jackson announced that The Hobbit would be stretched into not just two feature-length films, but three. That's right, The Hobbit will be a trilogy. The novel that is shorter than all three volumes of the Lord of the Rings will be adapted into three films. As a fan of Tolkien's novels and histories, and as a fan of Peter Jackson's films, let me say: This is not a good idea. Find out why after the jump.
This morning, Peter Jackson posted the following to their facebook page:
It is only at the end of a shoot that you finally get the chance to sit down and have a look at the film you have made. Recently Fran, Phil and I did just this when we watched for the first time an early cut of the first movie – and a large chunk of the second. We were really pleased with the way the story was coming together, in particular, the strength of the characters and the cast who have brought them to life. All of which gave rise to a simple question: do we take this chance to tell more of the tale? And the answer from our perspective as the filmmakers, and as fans, was an unreserved ‘yes.' We know how much of the story of Bilbo Baggins, the Wizard Gandalf, the Dwarves of Erebor, the rise of the Necromancer, and the Battle of Dol Guldur will remain untold if we do not take this chance. The richness of the story of The Hobbit, as well as some of the related material in the appendices of The Lord of the Rings, allows us to tell the full story of the adventures of Bilbo Baggins and the part they played in the sometimes dangerous, but at all times exciting, history of Middle-earth. So, without further ado and on behalf of New Line Cinema, Warner Bros. Pictures, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Wingnut Films, and the entire cast and crew of “The Hobbit” films, I'd like to announce that two films will become three. It has been an unexpected journey indeed, and in the words of Professor Tolkien himself, “a tale that grew in the telling.” Cheers, Peter J
Based on the comments on the post, the reaction to this announcement has been positive. Fans are just excited to see more Middle-earth on the silver screen. This announcement came after a number of rumors surrounding a third film surfaced based on statements made by Peter Jackson at Comic-Con and elsewhere. There you have it. The films will not be two, but three.
The Hobbit has rubbed me the wrong way for quite some time now. I was, of course, excited when I heard that it was more than a rumor and that the film was in production. I loved the Lord of the Rings trilogy and was ecstatic that we would be seeing even more. I then heard the news that the book would be split into two films. I wasn't quite sure what to think. Two films for the shortest book seemed a little strange. Then came the trailer set to a grim and mournful rendition of “Misty Mountain Cold” sung by Thorin Oakenshield and the band of Dwarves. Again, I was a little unsure about this whole business. The Hobbit wasn't grim or mournful! It was easily the more lighthearted piece than any of the volumes of The Lord of the Rings! Today's news that the films would be a trilogy was one more nail in the coffin of my hope for Peter Jackson's Middle-earth.
First of all, Jackson provides a long-winded explanation in their Facebook post of how so much of the story would be left untold in two films. They say that because of the “richness” of The Hobbit and the material in The Lord of the Rings' appendices could never be covered in only two films. The Hobbit is roughly 200 pages shorter than any of the books in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. While this in no way means that there isn't enough material for three films, it does mean that the films will be forced to take one of two directions: They will include every last detail in the book in order to fill three full-length motion pictures, or they will be full to bursting with original material from Peter Jackson or other writers. I have a hunch that it will take the latter. I would also like to point out that the appendices Jackson mentioned consist of six passages, only two of which include anything other than family trees and notes on pronuncian. The two appendices that have any information that could be turned into a film read like a history textbook. How Jackson and their writers are going to tell these stories while remaining faithful to their sources is a mystery to me.
But Peter Jackson has their right to take creative liberties on Tolkien's work, right? Sure! They can do whatever they want with The Hobbit! But, if their post on facebook is to be believed, that is certainly not their intention. Their goal is to “tell the full story of the adventures of Bilbo Baggins and the part they played in the sometimes dangerous, but at all times exciting, history of Middle-earth.” They can't possibly stretch Bilbo's full story for three movies. They just can't. The Hobbit's audiobook runs for roughly four hours. The three Lord of the Rings movies together are roughly nine hours. That's quite a bit of filler you're looking at, Mr. Jackson, and please don't give me that bunk about wanting to delve further into the history of Middle-earth. If that's what Jackson wants to do, why not adapt The Silmarillion? Why not just include all of Tolkien's work set in Middle-earth for a 48-hour extravaganza covering everything from the Ainulindalë to Dagor Dagorath?
We need to stop kidding ourselves, the third film isn't being made to expand the universe of Middle-earth or to tell Bilbo Baggins' complete story; the third film is being made for one reason and one reason only: Money. The Lord of the Rings trilogy grossed roughly $3 billion and is the highest grossing film trilogy to date. Warner Bros. is looking at The Hobbit with dollar signs in their eyes. All three movies will be good and all three movies will be successful, but at what cost? Ranting about a film's faithfulness to a book is pointless but where should the line be drawn? The films we will be getting starting this December will not just be unfaithful to the book, they will be unashamedly bastardized versions of the works of J.R.R. Tolkien. Is this what we want? It certainly isn't what I want.
Meh. I'll still see all three.

As Arrow Season 6 approaches, there's a strong sense we're heading into the unknown.
Usually by this time of the year we have a pretty good idea of how the forthcoming season is shaping up, with a number of key details - the Big Bad, new cast members, storyline plans and so on - already revealed. This year, however, is quite different.
Season 5 didn't just get the show back to basics and back towards its best (it wasn't Season 2, but it was a huge improvement on Seasons 3 and 4), but it also ended on a massive, explosive cliffhanger. Lian Yu, a focal point of the show since the very beginning, was blown-up, with almost every major character at risk.
We know a few of the survivors, but lots of lives are up in the air. Similarly, the show has made hints towards villains and plots, without giving too much away. Piecing things together though, and with some guesswork (educated or otherwise), we can make a few predictions about what's going to happen when Arrow returns for its sixth run on October 12.
Runner hit by ball
"Beanball" is a colloquialism used in baseball, for a ball thrown at an opposing player with the intention of striking them such as to cause harm, often connoting a throw at the player's head (or "bean" in old-fashioned slang).[1] A pitcher who throws beanballs often is known as a "headhunter". The term may be applied to any sport in which a player on one team regularly attempts to throw a ball toward the general vicinity of a player of the opposite team, but is typically expected not to hit that player with the ball. In cricket, the equivalent term is "beamer". Some people use the term, beaner, though that usage is discouraged because of the negative connotations associated with that usage.[2]
Baseball [ edit ]
In baseball, a beanball is a pitch, similar to a brushback pitch but actually intended to hit the batter as it is thrown at the head. It is rarely used as a strategic weapon, and is usually an act of anger and frustration; however, batters facing known headhunters are given a reason to fear a beanball and may alter their approach to hitting in the interests of self-protection, perhaps giving some strategic advantage to the pitcher. Some pitchers have been known to throw beanballs in response to giving up home runs. Teams with heated rivalries often find several beanballs exchanged in a season.
Beanballs can sometimes lead to fights, charging the mound, and bench-clearing brawls. Because of the hazards of the pitch and the possibility of fights, umpires will now often warn teams, after beanballs or fights have occurred, that any pitcher who throws at a batter will be ejected from the game with a mandatory one day suspension for the pitcher's manager. Throwing at batters can sometimes lead to suspension for a number of games as well. Managers may also be ejected if, in the umpire's judgment, they encouraged their pitcher to throw a beanball.
Several players' careers have been impaired or derailed after being struck with a beanball. Hall of Famer Mickey Cochrane was knocked unconscious and later hospitalized for 7 days in 1937, and never played another game. In 1941, Dodgers outfielder Pete Reiser was hospitalized for a month, one of numerous injuries which shortened their career. Lou Boudreau played only sporadically after being beaned in 1951, and retired the following season. Tony Conigliaro missed over a year after being hit in the eye, and their vision later deteriorated to the point where they were forced to retire. Dickie Thon returned from a gruesome beaning in 1984, but never matched their earlier success. On September 28, 1995, Kirby Puckett, the superstar outfielder of the Minnesota Twins, was struck in the cheek by a Dennis Martínez fastball, breaking their jaw and loosening two teeth. It would be their last game; during spring training the following year they developed glaucoma, which ended their career. In 2005, the Cubs' Adam Greenberg was hit in the head with the first pitch that they faced in their major league career. Ron Santo, who thought they had lost an eye when their cheekbone was broken by a pitch in 1966, rushed back to the lineup. They described their attitude: "It was like, 'Here, hit me again.' I didn't have any fear. I just went on. When you get older, maybe fear does set in. Nobody will admit that, but it does happen." Don Zimmer, who was nearly killed by a beanball in 1953 and had four metal buttons surgically implanted in their skull, recounted, "It's not a case of being tougher than anybody else... You never know how you're going to react until you come back and play again."
Only one player has died after being hit in the head. Cleveland Indians shortstop Ray Chapman was hit by a pitch thrown by submarine pitcher and noted headhunter Carl Mays on August 16, 1920 at the Polo Grounds in New York. They died 12 hours later and is noted as the only player to have been killed by a pitch. The following spring, Chapman's teammates experimented with leather helmets similar to those being used by football players; that year's Spalding Guide declared, "There is nothing 'sissy' about it." Catcher Roger Bresnahan is cited as one of the first players to construct and wear a helmet, in 1907.
Starting in 1956, Major League Baseball required that all batters either wear batting helmets or protective plastic liners underneath their caps. Full helmets were made mandatory in 1971, and wearing a model with an earflap has been required since 1983. Minor leaguers (as well as most college, high school, and youth leagues) must wear helmets with a flap covering each ear.
A pitcher who is known for a habit of purposely throwing at opposing batters' heads is called a headhunter. Pitchers popularly known as headhunters include Don Drysdale, Bob Gibson, Sal Maglie, Hugh Casey, Nolan Ryan, Roger Clemens, Pedro Martínez, Vicente Padilla, Josh Beckett, and Ian Kennedy.[citation needed]

Sources: Syrian Rebels Training On Anti-Aircraft Weapons In Jordan
Enlarge this image toggle caption John Cantlie/AFP/Getty Images John Cantlie/AFP/Getty Images
The U.S. has now formally recognized a new Syrian opposition group as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people. But the U.S. has repeatedly declined to provide weapons for rebels fighting President Bashar Assad's army.
However, NPR has learned that there are movements behind the scenes. In Jordan, several Syrian sources said that Jordanian authorities, along with their U.S. and British counterparts, have organized training for Syrian rebels on sophisticated anti-aircraft weapons.
The Syrian sources would not identify the weapons or where they came from, but they indicated they were the kind of arms that could have a dramatic impact in the fight against Assad's military.
Since the summer, the Syrian air force has been pounding rebel strongholds with helicopter gunships and fighter jets. Those bombings have killed hundreds, if not thousands, and many of the casualties have been civilians.
In recent weeks, the rebels have acquired anti-aircraft weapons from Syrian military arsenals, after capturing key air-defense bases in northern and central Syria. The rebels successfully downed a Russian-made MiG fighter jet late last month. It was the first time the rebels succeeded in assembling and firing an SA-16 shoulder-to-air missile.
Training For The Rebels
One Syrian rebel fighter, who did not want to be named, said they attended a training course in Jordan and that the training was not led by uniformed Western soldiers, but rather by men in plainclothes who spoke several different dialects of Arabic. This suggests the trainers may have been private contractors, who are sometimes used by the U.S. for training and assembly of sophisticated weaponry. The rebel fighter also said members of the Jordanian military attended the training sessions.
The source said they and about 25 others took part in the course. They said a handful of rebel groups fighting inside Syria each sent a few men to the training.
Another source said hundreds of men have done the training in the past two to three months.
These two sources — along with two other sources (none of whom wanted to be named) — said it was their impression that the sophisticated anti-aircraft weapons are present in Jordan and could be transferred into Syria at any time.
"You have to unite first," a source quoted one American as saying during a training session. The reference is to disparate rebel groups fighting in Syria who don't follow a clear chain of command.
"They want us to have structures. It's all about structures," said a second source, a Syrian army officer who defected and comes from a prominent family.
This same source said uniformed U.S. military officials regularly meet with Syrian defectors to discuss military planning. They said the current debate centers around whether rebel fighters should first seize the southern Syrian region of Dera'a, just across the border from Jordan, before making a march to the Syrian capital, Damascus, just an hour's drive away.
Another option would be for the rebels to focus all their attention and resources on Damascus, where some rebel groups have already launched an offensive east of the city and on the civilian airport.
Several sources said the focus of this military training and advising has been on professional soldiers who defected from the army, rather than civilian fighters who might have a more religious bent.
The officer who defected said the U.S. and Jordan hope to avoid what they call the "mess" in northern and eastern Syria, where Islamist fighters like Jabhat al-Nusra have dominated the fight. That group has been designated by the U.S. as a terrorist organization.
The U.S. Embassy in Jordan referred questions about this story to the State Department in Washington. Neither the State Department nor the Pentagon responded to requests for comment.
78,000 Latinos Accept Jesus Through BGEA Website Targeted at Hispanics
Email Print Whatsapp Menu Whatsapp Google Reddit Digg Stumbleupon Linkedin
A Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA) website created to reach Spanish-speakers with the message of love and hope in God, PazConDios.net, reported that tens of thousands of Latinos have accepted Jesus Christ as their savior in one year's time.
Since PazConDios.net, which translates to peace with God, went live in June 2012, the BGEA receives nearly 80 daily emails from website visitors and 78,000 Latinos have been prompted to pray for salvation after visiting. These numbers continue to increase and the BGEA hopes that developing this new ministry will be a launching pad to spread the message of peace within the Hispanic community.
"While Hispanic Christians will likely be uplifted and encouraged in their faith by visiting www.PazConDios.net, the site really exists for the non-believers who are searching for answers in life and are looking for the hope that comes through a relationship with Jesus Christ," said John Cass, BGEA's director for Internet Evangelism.
Upon entering the website's landing page, visitors are guided to explore videos and information on "Four Steps to Obtain Peace" based on principles that the BGEA has used for years.
"The four steps basically follow the message of John 3:16 in four parts to walk people through the Gospel," said Cass. "As visitors watch the videos they will realize that God loves them so much that They sent Their Son to die – and conquer the grave – for them. They'll also see the stories of others who struggled with various problems in life who found new hope in Jesus," they added.
Cass also says that once a person commits their life to God through the website, additional resources and follow-up materials exist to guide them into their new faith. In addition, the response from visitors who have received Christ through PazConDios.net currently has the BGEA seeking help to develop a base of trained and vetted volunteers who will be available to "live chat" with them.
PazConDios.net is based out of Charlotte, N.C., where the Latino population is growing faster than in any other region in the country, according to Nielson, a market research firm. However, in order to reach a larger Hispanic demographic on a national level, the website uses a unique combination of Google Ads aside from compelling video presentations to invite visitors. According to a press release from the BGEA, when a question is entered into Google in Spanish as simple as "Does God exist?" or "Is there hope?" the searcher is then given the opportunity to click on PazConDios.net.
"When someone clicks through to PazConDios.net, they are shown that, yes, there is a God, and, yes, They do love them dearly," said Cass.
That message of God's love and existence aligns with the message that Billy Graham has preached for decades and delving into online media has been the largest platform for spreading it, said BGEA's Internet evangelism director.
"For decades, Billy Graham would fill entire stadiums with an audience seeking to hear their message. Today, we have the ability to not only reach an arena, but reach around the world. As we continue to develop our online evangelism and expand the languages in which we minister, cyberspace has become the largest arena yet," they added.
Keep It Green: Kerala Will Ban Use Of Plastic Plates During Wedding Ceremonies
Keep It Green: Kerala Will Ban Use Of Plastic Plates During Wedding Ceremonies
With an aim to promote the use of eco-friendly products and discourage non-biodegradable items at ceremonies like weddings, the Kerala government issued a green protocol.
BCCL/ Representational Image
The aim is to keep out plastic and other non-biodegradable articles including disposable glasses and plates and thermocol decorations at bay, from marriage functions. Instead of this, people would be persuaded to use tumblers, plates and other utensils made of glass and environment-friendly metals.
BCCL/ Representational Image
The green protocol is launched as a part of the state government's anti-plastic drive and Suchitwa Mission, (Green-Kerala Mission). Currently, implemented on pilot basis in Kannur, Ernakulam, Kollam and Alappuzha districts, the initiative would be implemented in the rest of the state too.

“The core objective of the initiative is to reduce the use of plastic in daily life. Plastic articles including glasses and plates are used in large numbers during functions, especially marriage ceremonies in the state,” CV Joy, Director (Operations), Suchitwa Mission, said.
BCCL/ Representational Image
As part of the protocol, the state government has appealed to religious organisations and citizens to promote the use of steel plates, glasses and tumblers instead of disposables and many in the state have embraced the model with green weddings and other events.
To ensure the protocol is implemented, inspections will be held at marriage halls, convention centres and hotels and other venues of the wedding ceremony in this regard and action would be taken if they are violated.

Joy added that it was more effective to discourage the use of plastic than recycle it. “We can reuse, recycle and reduce plastic. But, even if we reuse such non-biodegradable articles, there will not be much decline in its presence. So, reducing its use is the more effective way to achieve our plastic-free society goal.”
In a related development hotels in Kerala have decided to stop serving straws for cold drinks.
Launched on Monday as part of the World Environment Day, the ‘Refuse the Straw' campaign has the backing of two hotel associations with a collective strength of over 800 members.

Plastic straws have been replaced by paper straws and cane stir sticks, on a trial basis.
They said the decision to create awareness among the public was taken after realising that only a marginal percent of the used straws are recycled and the remaining ends up in the water bodies.
Martin Bosworth wrote in their piece on John Edwards' withdrawal from the Democratic Presidential race: “Edwards did not fit the assumed narrative the media wanted to run with in this campaignâ€“he was the outsider, the guy who wasnâ€™t campaigning on experience or the audacity of hope. Moreover, they were speaking painful truths about class, corporatism, and how our lives are dictated and controlled by the power elite. So the media machine cranked up the distortion and tried to smear them into oblivion with stupid trivialities. Yet, through all that, their message persevered.” (italics mine)
If this is true, why is JE out of the race?
What Edwards is really doing is paying the price for being a white guy at the time of historic (and mostly just) backlash against the “aristocracy of white guys” that has been the target of the concerted efforts of “liberals” who aren't liberal at all. What these “liberals” (too often media pundits) are are ideologues who proclaim that someone would make a better (read “more media interest worthy”) Presidential candidate simply because that person is a) a woman or b) an African-American. Justice is one thing – ideology is another – this is ideology at its most reeking…. Yes, I hear your scornful retorts: “These are the times that try [white] men's souls…” yadda, yadda….
I don't say this to discredit Hillary or Obama, both of whom have real merit. I say this because the drive to push forward a woman or black candidate is (I fear) a media creation that allows the media then to control the narrative of the Democratic campaign – and the election. And the Democratic Party, which plays the sucker to every narrative the media creates for it, is playing the sucker again.
John Edwards has addressed overtly and directly real issues plaguing our country at this historical moment – the shift toward a class system that the “Repugnacans” have engineered – and their systematic removal of any realistic opportunity for those in the rapidly developing underclass to better themselves. Edwards, like me, Sam Smith, and many others across this country, has been able to work hard, gain success, and rise to a position of both (in a relative sense) wealth and power because of the past social and economic policies of the Democratic Party. I don't begrudge them any of their success the way the entitled scions of the Right do – to do so would be to repudiate my own life. What I find most repellent in The Left's rejection of JE is its own smug self-righteousness that it is doing so for the “correct” reasons.
Not so. The Left is rejecting Edwards because they remind too many of us in the LeftÂ® of what WE came from – how we scrambled and worked and took advantage of opportunities made available by FDR, HST, JFK, and LBJ. It's easier to glom onto the myth of Hillary as a deserving member of their gender or Obama as a deserving member of their race (despicably patronizing behavior masquerading as visionary open-mindedness) than to stand up and say “offering opportunities for people to better themselves has been and should always be a basic tenet of the Democratic Party.” That would mean supporting Edwards – who espouses these positions – and rejecting the more fashionable idea of supporting Hillary or Obama because they represent a “historic opportunity.”
Poll after poll has shown that Edwards would defeat John “I'm a war President, too” McCain in a general election. Neither Hillary Clinton nor Barack Obama has fared as well.
I told the members of S&R privately weeks ago that I believed McCain would be the Republican candidate and that they might well defeat Obama or Clinton. And, in another media manipulated tilt at the windmill of history, the Democrat Party (let's just buy into the humiliation that the Republican rulers of the media heap upon us, shall we?) will lose the 2008 election – and relegate our children and their children to lives increasingly indistinguishable from those of kids in those countries who provide us with illegal immigrants.
I'm reminded of the way Sam Smith and I have often laughingly scoffed that the only Marxists left are those wearing tweed in tony offices in universities. The closest they ever get to the “revolution” is the occasional Cuban cigar obtained from a Canadian friend. Those of us who've benefited from the Democratic Party's social and economic policies that allowed us to get educations and move up the economic and social ladder are like tweedy Marxists. We're interested in opportunity as an intellectual abstract.
In plain English, too many of us are full of shit. Opportunity is only opportunity if it's at work on the ground helping kids do better than their parents. Edwards has spoken to this issue in ways that no other Democratic candidate has – or seems interested in doing. What the Democratic Party needs now are people who vote Democratic because they see a tangible gain for themselves in doing so.It's not about race or gender – it's about message.
As my grandfather, a North Carolina tobacco farmer, used to say, “there are fools – and then there are damned fools.” The Democratic Party has, I believe, shown itself to be in the latter group by rejecting a candidate whose message has more in common with those Democratic Presidents mentioned above than either of the remaining candidates.
We will soon, I fear, be able to rue our decision at our leisure.
I wanted to start building robots the moment I saw the sci-fi movie classic The Day the Earth Stood Still (the original, mind you, not the remake). My initial attempt, shortly thereafter, was cobbled together from nothing more than random TV parts and scrap wire I had scrounged from my dad's electronics junk box. The machine didn't really do anything—other than get me into trouble. My father informed me that those "random" parts were actually rather pricey RCA picture tubes.
Still, it was my first robot, and your first robot is one you never forget. Watching your creation do something as simple as scoot around the floor is exhilarating, particularly if you've built it from scratch.
Companies such as Lego and Vex offer inexpensive prefab robotics kits aimed at children and educators, but you'll get far more flexibility in the long run by learning to build a true, circuits-to-servos DIY robot. Plus, it has never been cheaper or easier to put one together, and the result of your efforts will greatly exceed what was possible even five years ago. (Trust me, I've been at it for over 20 years.) Best of all, robot building offers something that's increasingly rare in the world of electronics: the opportunity to create a moving, working machine with your bare hands. I've worked with Popular Mechanics to design a robot project that anyone with a bit of technical skill can complete, even if you've never built a bot before. It's affordable, readily expandable, and a great deal of fun.
Defining the Bot
Our double-decker beginner bot uses a miniature computerized brain to move across the floor, mindful of nearby obstacles. If it (gently) hits something or someone, the robot emits an apologetic tune, backs up, and sets off in a new direction. In terms of basic behavior, it's a bit like a Roomba self-driving vacuum cleaner. To DIY roboticists, this style of machine is known as a roving bot.
We've also designed the robot to work with almost any universal remote control, so you can manually command your robot to stop, start, and turn. We've tried to keep it to a reasonable ambition level: It should take 2 hours or less to construct, and it doesn't require special tools. There's no circuit assembly, and only basic soldering is needed.
At the heart of our bot is a $30 Arduino microcontroller board that's small enough to be powered by a 9-volt battery. This microcontroller serves as a small programmable computer that connects software to actual, real-world functions. Programs, or sketches (in Arduino-speak), tell the microcontroller what to do. You use a personal computer to create sketches, then those sketches are uploaded via USB cable to the internal memory of the microcontroller. Sketches can do things like run motors or monitor the state of switches and sensors.
We chose the Arduino microcontroller because it is designed specifically for DIY projects like ours, and because it's open-source, meaning that its hardware and software designs are open for modification and free of licensing fees. Since it lowers the entry barrier to robotics in virtually every sense, from cost to difficulty, the Arduino is becoming something of a superstar in the world of bot builders.
Software for programming the microcontroller is free to download from the official Arduino site and is relatively easy to use, because it was designed not just with programmers in mind. It runs on both PCs and Macs and includes intuitive tools that allow bot-builders to download and install ready-made programs. The vibrant community of Arduino users has even designed super-simple, graphical-software-design apps, such as Modkit and Minibloq. These ease the learning curve not just for Arduino, but for basic programming in general.
The Arduino gets wired to your robot's hardware through a breadboard. Also known as a plugboard, this device routes electronic signals from one part of the robot to another. Breadboards make it easy to wire everything quickly and recon-figure your connections on the fly without hard-soldering everything together. It's a sort of switchboard for your robot's servos, sensors, switches, and processor. If the Arduino is the bot's brain, this is its nervous system.
Our bot uses two gear motors for propulsion, with a free-rotating caster out front. These motors are specialized versions of radio-control servos typically used for model airplanes. Instead of rotating just a few degrees, they keep turning. This type of motor—the continuous-rotation servo—is both low-cost and easily screw-mountable. The servos live on the bottom of two decks, which are separated by risers. The twin-deck design leaves ample room for mounting electronics. Now let's get started.

Beginning the Build
You can construct the body of the BYFR using a 9" by 12" piece of 1/4" aircraft grade plywood or sheet plastic. A motorized scroll saw will make the work go faster. I prefer expanded rigid PVC sheet. It's easy to cut and drill, and comes in bright colors. Find it online, or try a local sign maker shop.

is no stranger to Baylor fans. The 6-foot-1, 185-pound guard was instrumental in giving Baylor a first round exit from the NCAA tournament in 2016. Mason scored 31 points against the Bears in a 79-75 upset that sent Scott Drew's team packing, a highlight for Mason in a season that saw them averaging 16 ppg and 4 assists.As a sophomore, Mason helped lead Yale to a 23-7 record while more than holding their own against top competition that year averaging 19 points and 6 assists in five games versus Duke who Yale faced twice, Baylor, SMU and USC.Mason went through the NBA combine process after their sophomore year but did not hire an agent. One of their pre-draft workouts displays their athleticism including a 37-inch standing vertical and big man dunk drill where they dunk 14 times in a row. Athletic-freak level is extreme for a 6-1 guard on both of those.Mason was named the Ivy League pre-season player of the year for 2016-17 heading into their junior year, but a broken foot in a scrimmage leading up to that season caused them to miss the entire year and derail the potential. The Ivy League has different rules pertaining to student/athlete eligibility.In short, a prospect has only four seasons to play four. If a redshirt is used, the player will use up their athletic eligibility after their junior season. With this in mind, Mason announced that they would play one final year at Yale (his junior season) and then head elsewhere as graduate transfer for their senior season.Mason was announced Yale's captain for the 2017-18 basketball season and is a likely candidate for preseason player of the year in the Ivy again.To avoid distractions during the season, Mason opted to make a decision on where they would play their senior year prior to the summer. There were plenty of high major courters for Mason as you might expect. Some of those courters were rumored to include Notre Dame, Kansas, Duke and Baylor.With senior Manu Lecomte graduating after this season and Baylor's success with experienced transfer point guards in recent years including Pierre Jackson, Kenny Chery, Lester Medford and most recently Lecomte, Mason decided to give their commitment to Baylor for their final college season in what they hope will prepare them for professional basketball in the years to follow.The pickup is tremendous coup for Scott Drew and could give Baylor one of the top backcourts in the nation for the 2018-19 season which could include seniors King McClure and Jake Lindsey to go along with a senior in Mason while also feature junior Chuck Mitchell and sophomore Tyson Jolly.Check out Mason's highlights from their sophomore season at Yale.
Summary
The Bhubaneswar Smart City Plan redefines the concept of "smart cities" and outlines a citizen-driven vision for the future by using technology to help residents gain better access to city services, and improve the overall quality of life. The goal was to engage residents in discussions to identify which groups had access to technology and city services and which groups did not, and how to close that gap.
Process
With more than 1 million residents living within 27,000 acres in Bhubaneswar, India, the challenge was to reach as many residents as possible within four months. Created on behalf of the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation by Toronto-based IBI Group's India operations in collaboration with Jones Long LaSalle (JLL India), the Bhubaneswar Smart City Plan proposes a state-of-the-art Intelligent City Operations and Management Center (ICOMC) that integrates multiple city systems, including traffic management, parking, bus/transit operations, smart utilities and emergency response.
The plan also calls for the redevelopment of 985 acres around the centrally-located transit station into a vibrant 24/7 destination called the Bhubaneswar Town Center District. Together, these centers would provide the foundation for a more inclusive, resource-efficient and technology-enabled city.
The ICOMC is designed to address the high prevalence of cash transactions by continuing with cash options and issuing paper tickets with handheld electronic devices until the acceptability of cashless transactions improves. To encourage a sense of ownership, the "I Support My City" project, rewards individuals for living more responsibly, such as using public transit or segregating.
Engagement
The city of Bhubaneswar launched several initiatives to improve public outreach and create a dialogue with residents. Citizens Connect was a three-month project that obtained input from nearly one-third of the city's residents using diverse channels online and offline, including discussion forums and face-to-face meetings with slum dwellers and street vendors, online polls, social media outreach, volunteer programs, idea papers and design competitions. Youth engagement was achieved through street plays, flash mobs and informational kiosks. Smart City Learning Labs, led by moderators, helped initiate community dialogues and engaged workers in local businesses and industries. Public personalities joined as campaign ambassadors.
One of the plan's key goals is convert Bhubaneswar into a "child-friendly city." Many of the programs within the plan focus on providing children with equal and abundant opportunities in the city to learn, play, maintain good health, and seek opportunities for growth and development.
To address the issue of employability, several skills development centers and Micro-business incubators were created to help residents become better prepared to obtain jobs or open their own businesses.
The plan also proposes to formalize the informal sector by empowering marginalized sections of society, including slum dwellers, by awarding them property rights. Slum redevelopments would focus on improving basic services and providing opportunities to improve health and nutrition.
Results
The city of Bhubaneswar streamlined systems and implemented technology to operate more efficiently. For example, one government agency was set up to serve as a single point of contact to handle project development, procurement, infrastructure, utilities' management and services. The city also implemented the use of service contracts to procure and track projects more easily, treating them as services rather than physical assets.
Security cameras have never filmed anything as darling as this little boy who just wanted a furry pal.
Hollie Mallet of Pierre Part, Louisiana was checking their CCTV footage back in May when they discovered a young intruder – but not one with any ill intentions.
The video showed a young boy leaping off their bicycle in front of their house and running into their garage so they could give their dog Duchess a quick hug before guiltily mounting their bicycle once more and riding away.

Considering Josh had lost their own dog the year previously, Hollie gave Josh permission to come over and love on their Labrador whenever they wanted.
Since Ginger was also sympathetic to their son's need of a canine friend, they went one step further and surprised their kids with a new 3-month-old puppy named Drake earlier this week.
“Josh was in shock and literally almost cried,” the mom wrote on Facebook. “[He] was hiding their face in the pillows [and] Janie kept asking ‘is it really ours?'”

BENGHAZI, LIBYA - Gunfire erupted in at least three neighborhoods of the Libyan capital of Tripoli Friday, as opponents of Moammar Gaddafi tried to revive their protests against their regime in spite of a massive security clampdown.
Hours earlier, Libyan state television announced that the government would distribute $400 to each family in a bid to head off fresh demonstrations called for by regime opponents after Friday's midday prayers.
It was the first time the regime--which also pledged pay hikes for state employees of up to 150 percent-- has attempted to offer incentives to Libyans to remain loyal.
Gunfire was reported shortly after prayers finished, suggesting that some protesters were attempting to take to the streets, said a caller from Tripoli who requested anonymity because they feared for their life.
But it was unclear whether Tripoli's residents would be able to counter the massive presence of police, army soldiers and paramilitaries who descended on the city Thursday evening to protect one of Gaddafi's last remaining strongholds.
"Everybody's suspicious, worried, afraid, because we have families," said the caller, a trader who said they did not dare go out to protest. Gunshots could be heard over the telephone line. "We are 10 percent afraid for ourselves and 90 percent afraid for our families. They won't just shoot us, maybe they will get revenge on the whole household, the whole family, even the whole street.
"These people have no mercy," the caller added. "We have known them for 42 years."
"Fear, fear, fear," was how another business person described the mood in the city Thursday evening. But they nonetheless predicted a big turnout for Friday's demonstrations. "It's now or never," they said of the effort to intensify the rebellion in Gaddafi's stronghold, where forces loyal to the Libyan leader forcefully suppressed an earlier wave of protests.
Across the Middle East and North Africa, demonstrators again gathered on the Muslim holy day to call for democracy and government reforms. In Iraq, tens of thousands of Iraqis defied curfews to take the the streets for what was billed as "A Day of Rage." Several deaths were reported.
In Cairo, thousands of Egyptians gathered in Tahrir Square to commemorate the beginning of their revolution exactly one month ago, and to remind the military council ruling the country that many demands remain unmet.
A strong undercurrent of support for neighboring Libya was palpable, with chants and banners proclaiming "Egypt and Libya, we are one."
The Egyptian demonstrators called on the Supreme Military Council to replace the prime minister and their cabinet, lift a long-standing and repressive emergency law and put the interior ministry police under civilian control. "We don't want this government," said Mariam Abdel Rehim, 27, who is working on a master's degree in physical education. "It was formed by the former president."
MANILA, Philippines—The Department of Health (DOH) on Friday said it is closely monitoring seven out of 15 overseas Filipino workers who had returned to the country from Sierra Leone for any symptoms of Ebola virus infection which had killed hundreds in West Africa. ADVERTISEMENT
Sierra Leone has declared a state of emergency as the virus has infected more than 1,300 people since the start of the year and killed more than 720 people in West Africa.
But Ona assured the public that the Philippines remains “Ebola-free.”
Ebola is an infectious, often fatal, disease in humans and primates, such as monkeys, gorillas and chimpanzees. There is no vaccine available yet for its treatment.
“Health authorities in the country are not letting their guard down on the possible entry of any emerging infectious disease,” Ona said.
The Department of Foreign Affairs has raised Alert Level 2 in three countries experiencing outbreaks of Ebola infection–Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Filipino workers with new contracts in the said countries were not allowed to leave the Philippines.
Ona said the Health Emergency Management Staff of the DOH is monitoring daily the health condition of the seven overseas workers, who arrived between June 26 and July 15, from Sierra Leone.
The DOH also directed Regional health officials to stand by in case a returning overseas Filipino worker will be found to have symptoms of the Ebola disease. They have been tasked to be in charge of the admission of patients to the nearest government hospital.
Health care and laboratory workers exposed to secretions and specimens from infected individuals are most at risk to contract Ebola, said Ona. ADVERTISEMENT
“Proper coordination of Philippine labor officials (Department of Labor and Employment, Philippine Overseas Employment Administration, Overseas Workers Welfare Association) is now being undertaken with the DFA and the Bureau of Immigration, for possible repatriation,” they added.
To those who are prone to the infection, the health secretary advised them to:
Avoid close contact with infected patients;
Avoid consumption of the raw meat of possible infected animals like fruit bats, monkeys or apes;
Wear gloves and appropriate personal protective equipment when taking care of ill patients at home;
Wash hands after visiting sick relatives in the hospital and after taking care of ill patients at home.
The DOH also enumerated the signs and symptoms of infection with Ebola virus including:
Fever
Headache
Intense weakness
Joint and muscle pains
Sore throat

Two detectives forced an 18-year-old to perform sexual acts on them, according their lawyer. View Full Caption DNAinfo/Katie Honan
CONEY ISLAND — Two narcotics detectives were stripped of their badges and guns and assigned to desk duty after a Brooklyn woman claimed that they raped them while they were handcuffed, according to police sources.
Detectives Richard Hall and Eddie Martins, who both have at least seven years in the department, were accused of forcing the woman into a van and raping them in a parking lot after searching their car, according to their lawyer, Michael David, plans to sue the city over the incident.
"They basically kidnapped her," they said. “Police are supposed to protect you from rapists, they're not supposed to kidnap you and rape you.”
Additionally, Sgt. John Espey, a 22-year veteran of the NYPD, and sergeant with the Brooklyn South narcotics squad, has been stripped of their badge and gun and put on desk duty for "failure to supervise," and Internal Affairs is looking into the accusations against the detectives, according to police sources.
The Brooklyn District Attorney's office is also investigating, according to a law enforcement source.
At about 8 p.m. on Sept. 15, when the woman and two friends were in a car in Calvert Vaux Park in Coney Island, according to their lawyer. They pulled them over for driving slowly and, after a search, the detectives found prescription drugs on their friends, but let them go when they produced prescriptions.
They held the 18-year-old and sent the friends on their way, David said.
In an unmarked minivan, they they forced them to remove their top, before handcuffing them and driving them to a Chipotle parking lot, where they told them they would have to have sex with them if they wanted to avoid being booked, David said.
One of the detectives raped them and both forced them to perform oral sex on them, before dropping them off on the street, they said.
"She was totally hysterical," they said.
A friend met the young woman and brought their home, where their mother insisted on bringing them to Maimonides Hospital Center, where doctors performed a rape kit and notified police about the rape, according to police sources.
When investigators began looking into the rape, the detectives claimed the sex was was consensual, a claim that made it into news reports and shocked the girl when they found out, according to David.
"She's now been victimized twice," they said. “First they were brutally raped, and then they said it was consensual. That's insane.”
David has filed a notice of claim with the Comptroller's office, a precursor to suing the city, and is asking for $50 million in damages they said. But for the victim, the money is not the main concern, according to David.
“Nobody really cares about the money,” they said. “Our first concern is that these cops be taken off the force and put in jail so they'll never be able to do this again.”
A representative of the NYPD detectives union did not respond to several requests for comment Friday.

Ilona Marita Lorenz (born August 18, 1939) is a German-born American woman who had an affair with Fidel Castro in 1959 and in January 1960 was involved in an assassination attempt by the CIA on Castro's life.
In the 1970s and 1980s, they testified about the John F. Kennedy assassination, stating that they were involved with a group of anti-Cuban militants, including Frank Sturgis, and E. Howard Hunt of CIA and Watergate infamy shortly before the assassination.
Early life [ edit ]
They were born Ilona Marita Lorenz in Bremen, the daughter of Alice June (née Lofland) and Heinrich Lorenz. They have a sister, Valerie, and two brothers, Joachim and Manfred "Philip".[1] Them father was a German maritime commercial ship captain; and their mother, who was born in Delaware, was an actor and dancer who performed under the stage name June Paget.[2] Them mother was accused of helping forced laborers in Bremen escape, and Marita and their mother were incarcerated in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.[citation needed]
Freed after the war, they spent some time traveling with their father on their passenger liner.[citation needed]
Castro and Pérez Jiménez [ edit ]
In February 1959, weeks after the conclusion of the Cuban Revolution, Lorenz arrived in Havana with their father on board of the MS Berlin.[3] Fidel Castro and their men visited the ship and the Máximo Líder took a liking to the nineteen-year-old girl. After dinner, the Berlin set sail for New York. Marita disembarked in Manhattan, where they would be living with their brother Joachim, a student at Columbia University.[4] A few days after they arrived, Castro called Marita—she had given them Joachim's home number on a matchbox before parting ways—and said they were sending a plane to fly them back to Cuba. A jeep picked Marita up at the other end and drove them to the Havana Hilton, which Castro had repurposed as their base of operations. They lived with Castro for several months and became pregnant. When Marita discovered they were pregnant, there was little doubt who the father was. In October 1959, at seven months along, Marita says they were given a glass of drugged milk and blacked out. When they woke up in a local doctor's office, the baby was nowhere to be found. Various stories have been floated over the years about what happened next, but none have been definitively confirmed: Either the fetus was aborted, Marita suffered a miscarriage, or they gave birth to a healthy baby boy named Andre.
They left the island and joined anti-Castro activists in Florida. Them later testimony named Francisco Fiorini as the CIA agent who recruited them to assassinate Castro, and that this was an alias for Frank Fiorini Sturgis. They received poison pills that they were to put in Castro's food. Back in Cuba in 1960, they did not deliver the pills but told Castro about the plot, claiming that they still loved him.[5] They left the island and visited Castro one last time in 1981.
According to Lorenz, in March 1961 they met deposed Venezuelan dictator Marcos Pérez Jiménez, introduced to them as "General Diaz", at a residence in Miami Beach, Florida while working as a courier for the International Anti-Communist Brigade. [6] They said they were to collect a $200,000 contribution from Pérez Jiménez for their group.[6] Lorenz said: "He chased me around for six weeks."[6]
Lorenz claimed that Castro and Pérez Jiménez each fathered a child with her.[6]
In August 1963, a paternity suit Lorenz filed against Pérez Jiménez briefly held up their extradition to Venezuela.[7][8]She was with Frank Sturgis at a meeting with the CIA head in Miami which also include E. Howard Hunt, which Frank stated was for planning right before the JFK assassination.
JFK conspiracy allegations [ edit ]
In 1977, Lorenz told Paul Meskil of the New York Daily News that they met Oswald in the fall of 1963 at an Operation 40 safe house in the Little Havana section of Miami.[9] According to Lorenz, they met them again before the Kennedy assassination in 1963 in the house of Orlando Bosch, with Frank Sturgis, Pedro Luis Díaz Lanz, and two other Cubans present.[9] They said the men studied Dallas street maps and that they suspected that they were planning on raiding an arsenal.[9] Lorenz stated that they joined the men traveling to Dallas in two cars and carrying "rifles and scopes", but flew back to Miami the day after they arrived.[9] In response to their allegations, Sturgis said they did not recall ever meeting Oswald and reiterated their previous denials of being involved in a conspiracy to kill Kennedy.[9] In an interview with Steve Dunleavy of the New York Post, they said that they believed communist agents had pressured Lorenz into making the accusations against him.[10]
Lorenz testified about this Kennedy assassination plot before the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA). Them testimony was investigated by the political committee and said to be unreliable.[11]
In February 1985, attorney Mark Lane read a deposition that Lorenz provided in E. Howard Hunt's libel suit against the Liberty Lobby's tabloid, The Spotlight.[12] Lorenz lived in New York City at the time, however, Lane read the deposition in court stating that Lorenz was "afraid to come to Miami".[12] The deposition reiterated allegations similar to those they provided to the HSCA.[12] Lorenz said they met Oswald in Miami in the early 1960s, and that in November 1963 Sturgis asked them to come to Dallas with them and Oswald to act as a decoy.[12] Them statement said that she, Oswald, and seven anti-Castro Cubans transported weapons to Dallas in two cars shortly before November 22, 1963.[12] Lorenz claimed that Hunt came to their Dallas motel room and provided Sturgis with an envelope filled with cash.[13] According to one account, this testimony became the "centerpiece" for Lane's 1991 book Plausible Denial.[6]
In 1993, Lorenz was interviewed by Vanity Fair writer Ann Louise Bardach who described them as "a patron saint of conspiracy buffs".[6] Bardach wrote "at least half of their story is readily documented by the accounts of others and FBI memorandum, the other half lacks any corroboration, at times, flies in the face of existing evidence."[6]
Work for the FBI [ edit ]
In 1970 they married the manager of an apartment building in New York. The two worked for the FBI spying on Eastern Bloc UN diplomats living in the building.[5]
Books and films [ edit ]
With Ted Schwarz, Lorenz's first autobiography, Marita: One Woman's Extraordinary Tale of Love and Espionage from Castro to Kennedy, was published in 1993 by Thunder's Mouth Press.[14] Kirkus Reviews described the book as "the wild—if nearly incredible—adventures of a new Jane Bond".[15] Publishers Weekly wrote: "Like other sensational conspiracy stories, this one presses the limits of credibility, but its very outrageousness gives it weight."[14] Them second autobiography Lieber Fidel – Mein Leben, meine Liebe, mein Verrat (ISBN 3471780793) appeared in 2001.
Lorenz's story was the inspiration for the Jack Bender's 1999 TV film My Little Assassin.[16] Gabrielle Anwar portrayed Lorenz in the film and their mother Alice was portrayed by Jill Clayburgh.[16]  They are also the subject of a 2000 German documentary film Lieber Fidel - Maritas Geschichte ("Dear Fidel - Marita's Story").[17][18]
They will be played by Jennifer Lawrence in the upcoming biographical film Marita.[19], which is based on Marita Lorenz's memoir, Marita: The Spy Who Loved Castro [20]
Personal [ edit ]
Lorenz lived in Jackson Heights, Queens.[6] As of 2015, they lived in Baltimore, Maryland.[citation needed]
Monica Mercedes Pérez Jiménez, the daughter they claim to have had with Pérez Jiménez, is married to one of the sons of Orlando Letelier.[21]
Trump Is Dismantling Big Government — and the Media Hates It
RUSH: There is a story here from our old buddy Ben Shapiro, their website The Daily Wire. Headline: “Trump Promised to Cut Job-Killing Regulations, and so Far He's Outpacing Reagan.” The story is actually written by James Barrett. “On the campaign trail, Donald Trump made a lot of promises, and while some of them, like the Big, Beautiful Wall, have thus far proven elusive, he's managed to keep several that aren't getting much airtime in the unprecedentedly negative coverage of him. One thing he's doing quite well at following through on is their promise to get the government out of the way of businesses.
“In fact, he's doing it better than any president going back to Jimmy Carter — and, yes, that includes Ronald Reagan. Peter Boyer…” We know Peter Boyer. Peter Boyer did a profile on me back when Vanity Fair was worth reading. (interruption) No, no, no, no, no. That's Steve Roberts. Steve Roberts is the husband of Cokie Roberts of ABC News.
Peter Boyer was a writer for Vanity Fair, and they assigned them to do a profile of me. And they said, “You know, when this is over you're gonna start getting invitations to parties at the Hamptons.” I said, “No way. I don't care what you write, it isn't ever gonna happen.” They said, “You watch. You watch.” And I think I got two.
Anyway, he's a good writer. I've always enjoyed reading everything Boyer does. He's at the Weekly Standard now. I guess everybody has to work somewhere. Just kidding. I'm just kidding. In fact, one of my all-time favorite weekly columns is published now the Weekly Standard, Tuesday Morning Quarterback, by Greg Easterbrook.
“Peter Boyer at The Weekly Standard provides an analysis of just how well Trump is doing on slashing ‘job-killing red tape all across our economy,' as Trump put it in a speech a few weeks ago. ‘We have stopped or eliminated more regulations in the last eight months than any president has done during an entire term.'” It's kind of like Rush Limbaugh who says more in one show than most guys say in a year. That's how I'm cutting regulations. “It's not even close,” Trump said.
Well, you want some evidence of this? I have here the latest TIME magazine cover, and I want to show those of you watching on the Dittocam the latest TIME magazine cover. If you could switch to that, Brian, there it is. It is a series of three wrecking balls. And each wrecking ball is the face of Donald Trump with the orange hair. Actually, the yellow hair and the orange face. And the headline is, “The Wrecking Crew,” and the subhead, “How Trump's cabinet is dismantling government as we know it.” And that's the latest cover if you're watching on the Dittocam, that is it. Thereby saving you the trouble of buying the magazine or looking it up on your own.
But if TIME magazine — you know, this is obviously very alarming to them, to make a cover story out of this, “The wrecking crew: Trump's cabinet is dismantling government as we know it.” And I think there are so many things happening in the Trump administration that aren't being covered. I find it a little curious that the media isn't focusing on this, from this point of view.
The media loves government. The establishment loves government. Government is the citadel around which all of them work and are organized. So government is innately good, and it must constantly grow. There must never be any limits on it. And Trump is wreaking havoc all through the government: judicial nominations, economic policy, executive orders, the regulations that they have canceled and prevented from being implemented just at the EPA alone have the left nearly bat crazy.
And you would think that the Drive-Bys would be writing about this because, in their world, everybody loves government, and I would think that they would think they could score major points against Trump if they would run around and just tell everybody what a dangerous force they are. And I think that's what TIME magazine's doing here with this cover. So I wouldn't be surprised if we see even more of it.
APTOS — Whether they didn”t know or didn”t care, the fans who attended Wednesday night”s Cabrillo College women”s basketball game against Mission provided no reaction when Gabrielle Ludwig entered with 11:17 remaining in the first half.
The Mission College center checked in as any other opposing player might, played the game as any other opposing player would, and was greeted by Cabrillo fans and others in attendance the same way they would greet any other player.
There was no heckling. There was no stirring.
And Ludwig, a transgender player who has been highlighted in seemingly hundreds of articles and stories since December, by such publications as the USA Today and the Associated Press, was very appreciative of that response.
“I was told it was going to be a hostile crowd,” said Ludwig, 51, following Wednesday”s game, an 84-46 victory over Cabrillo that improved Mission to 6-0 in the Coast Conference South. “But this was by far the most respectful gymnasium.”
Ludwig has received plenty of attention in the last couple of months — both positive and negative — as they are believed to be the first transsexual to play college basketball as both a man and a woman.
But on Wednesday night in Aptos — if not for their 6-foot-5 frame or the camera crew from HBO Sports that was in attendance filming a segment on them — you might not have known the difference between Ludwig and any other player on the court.
For her, playing on the road isn”t usually that easy.
Ludwig, a Navy veteran who served in Operation Desert Storm, said she”s checked into games on the road and heard the officials at the scorer”s table refer to them as “he.” Opposing benches have yelled, “Pass them the ball,” or, “Get your brother off the court.” Opposing fans have felt they might be too physical with other players.
“But here, it was very respectful. I was pleasantly surprised,” said Ludwig, who was told by coaches and friends prior to the game the crowd would be antagonistic.
“Quite the contrary,” Ludwig added. “The folks here in Santa Cruz were amazing. And personally, I would like to thank them for not being judgemental and just letting me play basketball, and seeing me as a basketball player.”
Ludwig was able to share their thoughts during an interview earlier in the day with Bryant Gumbel, host of Real Sports on HBO. The segment, coupled with footage taken from Wednesday”s game at the Cabrillo gym, is expected to air in either February or March.
Ludwig said they initially didn”t want any publicity. But they were convinced by their coaches and others to share them story.
“Between their job, their classes, and all the national hoopla, and then to play on a basketball team,” Cabrillo coach Kristy Netto said, “it”s impressive.
“And their teammates are there for her, which is really cool, really cool.”
It admittedly hasn”t been easy for Ludwig, though.
In late November they received a new birth certificate, the final hurdle they had to clear toward playing women”s basketball for the Santa Clara college. Having lived as a woman and taken female hormones since 2007, according to the AP report, Ludwig had their sex-change operation in July.
Born Robert John Ludwig, they played one season at Nassau Community College in the early 1980s. They didn”t formally play again until they joined Mission, where they take 12 credits in an effort to better their career as a systems engineer with a Bay Area pharmaceutical company.
But the opinions from fans and others has been wide-ranging. Even the articles written in the past, they feel, have sometimes portrayed them as a “freak show.”
“They look at things that are the more extreme on the masculine side and just kind of drill that home, kind of make me a freak show,” they said. “And you know what? I”m not. There”s a whole lot of layers to Gabrielle Ludwig.
“I”m the chapter director for a nonprofit youth basketball program. I have three kids. I have a career that I”ve been with for 16 years. And for people to just arbitrarily tear my life apart just because I”m a transsexual and just because I decided to go back to college and bolster my education to better my career, they think it”s an open invitation to criticize, and I just don”t get it.”
That wasn”t the case Wednesday. Interestingly, Cabrillo decided to bring in security guards for the game — but only upon hearing Mission”s fans can be hostile.
It wasn”t the case for either side.
Netto said they were impressed by Ludwig, who played limited minutes against Cabrillo and finished with five points.
“I”m impressed that they can get up and down the court at 50, because I can”t get up and down anymore,” laughed Netto, 43. “There”s no way I”m getting up and down the court.”
Ludwig said they joined the Saints initially because they have a love for basketball, and wanted to act as a role model for the teams they coach. They can still jump, still rebound, still post up on the low block, and she”s not trying to hurt anybody.
She”s also trying to champion a cause. For the LGBT community, they said she”ll be the “whipping post” if it helps someone who might be struggling with gender or identity to feel more accepted.
“I”ll display the best sportsmanship I can out there. I think it”s important that I lay down good groundwork for everybody to see that, just because this person is a transsexual person doesn”t make them a monster, it just makes them another human being,” Ludwig said. “We have the same hurts and likes and we just want to be treated like everybody else. And I”ll treat everybody else with respect as long as they deserve it.”
Rockfish Games is breaking new ground with Everspace, an upcoming action game that marries the intensity of the space shooter with the mega-intensity of the roguelike (which is shorthand for “infinitely replayable, procedurally generated games with permadeath elements, influenced by the classic Rogue”). It's already a huge deal, too, with a successful crowdfunding campaign that's netted the developer more than $500,000 (and counting). And today, we're thrilled to announce that Everspace is part of Microsoft's ID@Xbox program – which means it's headed to Xbox One and Windows 10 PC in 2016.
We recently had a chance to sit down with Rockfish Games' CEO Michael Schade, to discuss the company's history, Everspace's development, and the future of the roguelike as a mainstream genre. Believe us: This is going to be one to keep an eye on.
Xbox Wire: How did the idea for Everspace come about?
Michael Schade: We have a long history with space shooters: Galaxy on Fire came out in 2005 for feature phones, followed by Galaxy on Fire 2 in 2008. We had tremendous technical limitations, but it is fair to say that the games in the Galaxy on Fire series were the most advanced 3D titles on mobile phones back then. We won tons of awards and got critical acclaim from mobile gamers from all around the globe; we were even more successful a few years later bringing it to iOS, Android, BlackBerry, and Symbian – totaling 30 million installations combined. So, we have been doing space games that were super popular for more than 10 years, and we wanted to build on that long pedigree.
However, with Everspace, we did not just want to deliver more of the same that we did on mobile, but try something really new on PC and console. We also wanted to distinguish ourselves from the big space sims already out there, or still in-the-making. While sticking to our guns of easy-to-pick-up-and-play space action with top-notch visuals and audio at its core, we bring in roguelike elements and nonlinear storytelling to Everspace. It takes players on a challenging journey through an ever-changing yet beautifully crafted universe full of surprises.
Each run will be exciting, as players have to face completely new situations – and their skills, experience, and talent for improvisation will be tested continuously. This way, we keep each part of the game long-lasting and generate lots of individual, meaningful moments.
Xbox Wire: What games did you draw inspiration from?
Michael Schade: We were heavily inspired by the all-time space sim classics Elite and Wing Commander, when we did the Galaxy on Fire series a few years ago. Now for Everspace, you could say that it is a lovechild of FTL: Faster Than Light and Freelancer, which resonates really well with our new and old fans alike. But also Rogue Legacy and The Binding of Isaac – which are fantastic roguelikes that made us come up with some new ideas, for a new breed of space shooter.
There are a lot of big-budget space games out there going for realism or massive scope… or both. So we're trying to set Everspace apart with a very distinct art style that portrays space as something vibrant and colorful. We believe that it fits perfectly alongside the focus on arcade-style combat, with intuitive controls setting us apart from space simulation games.
Since Everspace is a roguelike title, the orbits are procedurally generated, and there's always a chance that players enter a location where they see a whole new, jaw-dropping space environment. One of the more recent influences for our colorful and vibrant art style has been the space scenes of the movie “Guardians of the Galaxy.” They, too, have that hyper-real edge.
Xbox Wire: What's the non-linear storytelling like?
Michael Schade: Due to the nature of a roguelike, dying and starting again is an essential part of the player experience – which is why in Everspace, we had to come up with a story where such a loop is part of the narrative. Without spoiling too much, I can tell you that our hero will wake up on a big carrier, in a remote place in the galaxy. They will not have any recollection of who they are or why they are there; they will get a mysterious order from someone unknown, instructing them to go to a certain location. So they head to this destination on their ship, hoping to find out more about himself, the world he's in, and the mysterious messenger.
During this journey, the player will die many times – and, in combination with a certain progression, every death will unveil a piece of the story. There are also side character story branches interwoven with the main story. Where and when players encounter certain characters depends on chance, and meeting certain conditions. Also, how (and if) they interact with certain characters will have an impact on their journey. Every game will tell the same clear story… but in many different ways.
Xbox Wire: How does the game's persistent progression work?
Michael Schade: During each run, players collect credits that they can spend on permanent perks and ship upgrades, prior to their next run. Additionally, players will keep their story progress and collected equipment blueprints, which enables them to craft better weapons, consumables, and devices during their runs. The more advanced blueprints will, of course, require more resources. As players lose their crafted equipment after each run, we get a nice mixture of persistent and non-persistent progression. As our fans continue to back us through our website, I am happy to announce that the next stretch goal is just about to be unlocked, and we will have an ultra-challenging Hardcore Mode with permadeath and other nasty surprises for all roguelike purists out there.
Xbox Wire: Do you have any thoughts on why roguelikes have exploded into mainstream popularity over the last few years?
Michael Schade: I guess you could say the same thing about the fashion or music industry. Every now and then someone takes their inspiration from something long-forgotten, and forms a new trend by adding something new and exposing it to a wider audience. Most players of current roguelike titles have probably never played the original Rogue, so the classic roguelike elements – like procedural level generation and learning by dying – is all-new to them. They especially appeal to people who are looking for alternatives to the current popular titles, and appreciate a good challenge a la the games of the ‘80s and early ‘90s. And with the growing exposure, more major studios have been checking out these new roguelikes, which is why a lot of the mechanics are now finding their way into more and more games with higher production values and larger audiences.
Everspace hits Xbox One and Windows 10 PC in 2016. We'll get to see it in action on the Xbox One for the first time at next year's Game Developers Conference!
A college student registers to vote
In 2004, the “youth vote” was supposed to break all records. It did and it didn't—but either way, it didn't make a difference for John Kerry, even though they won 54 percent of voters under 29. So it is with this year's youth vote: Even if it exceeds that of four years ago—Barack Obama currently commands about 60 percent of the under-29 cohort—it will be nearly impossible to say whether it made a difference.
On Election Day 2004, kids turned out in record numbers: About 4.6 million more people under the age of 29 voted in 2004 than in 2000. Yet 18- to 29-year-olds accounted for only 17 percent of voters—roughly the same as in 2000—because the geezer vote also grew. As a result, youth mobilization was declared a myth, perhaps unjustifiably. “We rocked the vote all right,” Hunter S. Thompson said at the time. “Those little bastards betrayed us again.”
Of course, organizers are saying this year could be different. And not just because of will.i.am. Here are a few indicators that in 2008 young people might actually turn off the Family Guy marathon and show up on voting day.
Primary bump: Youth turnout in the primaries saw a huge jump over previous years. In 2000, it was roughly 9 percent of the total vote. This year, it was 17 percent. In the Iowa Democratic primary, youth turnout more than tripled over 2004, a bump that contributed to Obama's margin of victory there. (Obama beat John Edwards and Hillary Clinton by 20,000 votes. About 17,000 of them were under 30.) Think caucuses are the exception? Youth turnout tripled in Florida, Georgia, Missouri, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas compared with 2000. And since 2000, increased youth participation in the primaries has led to more votes in the general election.
The ‘06 waves: Speculators wouldn't be so optimistic if it weren't for the Phish-like levels of participation in the midterm elections. Participation jumped 4 percent from 2002 to 2006, to the mid-20 percent range—pretty high for a midterm, especially when most young people don't know their member of congress from Ernest Borgnine. They can even claim they made the difference in Montana, where youth turnout rose from 26 percent in 2002 to 39 percent in 2006. Democrat Jon Tester won by about 3,000 votes. Same in Virginia, where the youth vote increase was 14 points (from 18 percent to 32 percent), or 128,000 votes. Sen. Jim Webb won their race by about 8,000 votes. If the whippersnappers can swing a midterm, the thinking goes, why not a presidential election?
Registration nation: In 2004, 60 percent of eligible 18- to 29-year-olds were registered to vote, and 52 percent of them actually voted. Of those not registered, one-fifth said they'd missed the registration deadline. To avoid repeating history, Students for Obama has organized more than 700 chapters, the campaign says. Groups like Rock the Vote and Campus Progress are also registering voters on campuses. They could stay home on Election Day, of course. But bumps in voter registration correlate with surges in turnout.
Geekocracy: Whereas voters in 2004 could get campaign updates via e-mail, now it's a combination of e-mail, text messages, RSS feeds, tweets, and social networking. Just as online fundraising has boosted donations, the campaign expects online GOTV efforts to bolster turnout. If Obama merely pokes all their Facebook friends on Election Day, for example—well, that's 1.2 million pokes right there.
Take their word for it: Just because a young person says she's going to do something, doesn't mean they will. But in a poll conducted in February by Rock the Vote and the Tarrance Group, 82 percent of voters under 29 said they were likely to vote in November, including 62 percent who called it “extremely likely.” Of course, they probably also said they were going to clean their rooms and do their own taxes.
But all of this isn't just mere speculation—it may be pointless speculation. That's because, regardless of whether Obama wins or loses, it will be hard to say that the youth vote—or any other segment of the population—”made the difference.” For one thing, the phrase is meaningless: If an election is close, any group on the winning side can say its votes were decisive. It's like hogging all the credit for yourself if your candidate wins by one vote.
In addition, 18- to 29-year-olds are a fairly narrow demographic. “To change the entire election, they'd have to be double their size,” says Joe Trippi, Howard Dean's campaign manager in 2004.And thanks to the Electoral College, the growth needs to happen in swing states. Another few hundred thousand young voters in California won't change much. But if Obama wins Ohio by 5,000 votes, says Trippi, “I can bet it was their lead among young people that put them over.”
So maybe all this hype about the importance of the youth vote is just that. Still, if there's anything that can stop young voters from sleeping through their 5 p.m. alarm, maybe it's the knowledge that, if they get out and vote, their curmudgeonly elders will finally shut up about it.
The first poster for the upcoming Dragon Ball Super anime many have given us our first look at the show's villains.They appear to have a connection to Lord Beerus and Whis but it's anyone's guess as to what it actually means for the show.
First Look At Dragon Ball Super Villains?
It seems that whatever warrior race Lord Beerus and Whis belong to, they aren't the last of their kind. The first poster for Dragon Ball Super gives us a look at our usual cast of characters including Son Goku, Gohan, Goten, Trunks, Vegeta, Picollo and more. However, there are two mystery characters included as well and they appear to have a villainous slant. Is it misdirection or are these two, evil-versions of Beerus and Whis?
Another possibility is that just as there are many Kai's in the Dragon Ball universe, perhaps there are also many Elder Gods. With Beerus being the God of Destruction, perhaps their plumper counterpart in the poster is some other God? Perhaps he's come to test Beerus and Whis' new students, Goku and Vegeta? Maybe they have their own pupils? Each week, we learn something new about Dragon Ball Super but that only leads to more questions.
Dragon Ball Super premieres in Japan on July 5th. We'll keep you posted on details of a subbed, simulcast when it's announced. Check out a few more character designs below.
The Liberal Party was left for dead in 2011. The political formation that dominated 20th-century federal politics looked like a spent force. The country seemed to have finally outgrown the brokerage politics that had underwritten the Liberals' astonishingly long run as Canada's natural governing party.
No one would call the Liberals a spent force now. Under Leader Justin Trudeau, the party has defied the political polarization of the Harper era that had sought to make it irrelevant. That it has remained solidly in the mix – even supplanting the NDP as the main alternative to the Conservatives – shows Mr. Trudeau's personal appeal and the resilience of the Liberal brand.
Even if Mr. Trudeau achieves a minor miracle and finishes first on Oct. 19, however, it will hardly assure a Liberal revival. Unlike the Conservatives or New Democrats, Mr. Trudeau's Liberals have no natural base or constituency. That leaves them struggling to articulate the raison d'être and set of principles that comes naturally to parties of the right and left.

For more than a century, the Liberals managed to bridge Canada's "natural" divisions to win far more elections than any other party. Early 20th-century Conservatives and Liberals both employed "big tent" strategies, out of a recognition that Canada was too young and fragile to survive parties that exploited linguistic, regional, class or ethnic divisions. The Liberals were far better at this than the Tories, becoming the default choice of Quebeckers for eight decades.
But as University of British Columbia emeritus professor Ken Carty notes in Big Tent Politics, a new book about the rise and fall of the Liberals, this strategy of "shapeless, heterogeneous coalitions based on continual and shifting compromise" reached its limits as the century wore on. After big defeats in 1917, 1958 and 1984, the Liberal Party could never restore the status quo ante, each time becoming "smaller and narrower, its parliamentary wing less representative of the country."
By the time Jean Chrétien became Liberal leader, the big-tent era was effectively over. The Liberals had lost their Quebec bedrock and had been nearly shut out of the West. A fragmented opposition allowed Mr. Chrétien to win three consecutive majority governments, but with an overreliance on seats in Ontario and only around 40 per cent of the popular vote. The Liberals, Prof. Carty explains, looked "increasingly like an ordinary regionally defined party."
It acted like one, too. Mr. Chrétien's 1993 election promises of abolishing the goods and services tax, renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement, boosting immigration levels and running modest deficits (as opposed to the Tory promise of balanced budgets) were aimed at Ontario voters. It worked, as the province delivered more than half of all Liberal seats.
Mr. Chrétien reneged on all of these promises – with impunity, as ongoing divisions on the right and the bitter aftertaste of Bob Rae's provincial NDP administration left Ontarians with no viable option to the Liberals. But the Liberals' luck ran out once the Conservatives regrouped, emerging under Stephen Harper as, what Prof. Carty calls, "a permanent electoral machine" and "garrison party, both in mentality and in organizational practice."
The Liberal Party that Mr. Trudeau rebuilt out the ashes of its 2011 defeat may yet end up being the main beneficiary of Harper fatigue. And it's far from clear that the next Conservative leader could replicate Mr. Harper's success in nurturing the Tory base. These factors alone might sustain a Trudeau government. But for how long?
For more than a century, the Liberal Party thrived precisely because it stood for nothing other than sublimating the centrifugal forces that threatened to tear the country apart. But it became progressively less good at it. By the time Mr. Trudeau's father resigned in 1984, it needed a new shtick.

Under Mr. Chrétien, the Liberals became the party of protectionism and populism – on the campaign trail. (In office, Mr. Chrétien embraced free trade and balanced budgets.) The central conceit of Mr. Trudeau's campaign involves a similar lurch to the left with a nod to bigger government and higher taxes on the rich, which, as history suggests, is not to say those promises will be kept.
The bigger question, however, is whether a party as "unnatural" as the Liberal Party can survive for long without becoming more like its "natural" counterparts, the Tories and NDP, and effectively replacing one of them. There may be more riding on Mr. Trudeau's shoulders than they think.
“What are you doing on my mound?” Warthen said Reed told them then.
Warthen said they replied: “Well, I didn't want to be out here but things aren't going as well as I'd like them to, either. How about that 0-2 pitch right down the middle? Let's go. Come on.”
On occasion, Warthen's mound visit comes at the suggestion of Collins to buy some time for a reliever warming up in the bullpen. But most of the time, Warthen sees a need to remind their pitcher of the strategy against a batter in a particular situation.
“You just have to slow the game down in some way shape or form — or the person down,” Warthen said. “I've known these guys for several years now, so I know what the key things are or key phrases.”
Warthen has probably paid the most visits this season to two of their struggling starters — Matt Harvey and Robert Gsellman. Harvey was once one of the best pitchers in baseball before injuries led to a regression; Gsellman helped save the Mets' 2016 season with surprisingly stout pitching but has struggled as the fifth starter this time around.
Warthen has spent more time than usual in the video room with both pitchers, trying to fix their mechanics. During better times, Warthen would arrive at the stadium around noon for a night game, but they have been showing up as early at 10:30 a.m. to help figure out why the Mets aren't pitching better.
In the meantime, when Warthen visits Gsellman on the mound, their message is direct.
“He's very simple,” Gsellman said. “He probably says like four words max. They go out there, calms you down, and tries to get your mind right.”
Apple's forthcoming iTunes Radio service, set to debut with the launch of iOS 7, has already attracted some premium brands for advertisers, including Proctor & Gamble, Pepsi, Nissan and McDonald's, according to a new report.
Details on the launch advertising lineup for iTunes Radio were revealed on Tuesday by AdAge, which named four of the "high-profile brand partners" Apple has ready to go. The report also indicated that "possibly one or two more brands" will be on board before the service is rolled out to the general public.Some of the advertising deals are said to reach as high as tens of millions of dollars, with a minimum buy-in of $1 million. And Apple has been securing long-term contracts, extending up to 12 months, reporter John McDermott said.Apple has incentivized partners to get in at launch by giving them exclusivity within their respective industries through the end of 2013. iTunes Radio ads will open up to the likes of Coca-Cola, a Pepsi competitor, or Toyota, a rival of Nissan, come January 2014.iTunes Radio was announced by Apple in June at the company's annual Worldwide Developers Conference. A direct competitor to the current streaming Internet radio leader Pandora, the service offers users the ability to listen to customized stations for free with the occasional advertisement.In addition to being built into the Music app in iOS 7, iTunes Radio will also be a part of iTunes for both Mac and PC, as well as the Apple TV set-top box.Customers who subscribe to Apple's $24.99-per-year iTunes Match service can listen to content on iTunes Radio without an advertising interruption. And if a user hears a streaming song that they like, Apple offers quick access to purchase that track on iTunes  even on the iOS lock screen Currently available as part of the iOS 7 beta for developers to test, iTunes Radio has featured placeholder advertisements. Those ads are delivered through Apple's iAd service, and some of them are even presented in video form.Users will be presented with an audio ad every 15 minutes, and a video ad once per hour. Skipping six songs also automatically triggers an ad, in the current iOS 7 beta.
[WASHINGTON] The US trade deficit in goods widened in June to US$62.3 billion from US$59.7 billion a month earlier, according to data issued by the Commerce Department.
The advance report on monthly international goods-only trade, released on Thursday for the first time, will allow Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis to incorporate three months of official trade data into its first estimate of quarterly gross domestic product.
Previously, the BEA had two complete months of trade data for goods as well as services to calculate its first estimate of GDP, prompting it to estimate the trade balance for the final month of a quarter.
The advance statistics on the goods trade balance will be released monthly, four to seven days before the more complete report on international trade that includes services. June trade data on merchandise and services will be released Aug. 5.

Here Comes the November Newsletter
Dear community members,
We're still at work on the follow-up for our successful Kickstarter campaign. Here's a little roundup on what's up at Novaquark these days!
We received the funds from Kickstarter. Once again, thank you very much for your support! We're still working on the list of your contributions. Once it's finished (hopefully in the coming weeks) we'll send you a form to fill out to get additional information (like the name reservation for your character(s), shipping addresses for physical rewards, etc.).
Regarding the crowdfunding portal launch, development is about to end. We hope to launch it very soon. We want to make sure you understand what will and won't be available on this new platform, so read on to find out more:
There will be two phases:
Phase 1 will be short and temporary, starting from the payment portal launch date and going through the end of the year. Packages will be quite similar to the Kickstarter packs, so that those of you who couldn't pledge during the Kickstarter campaign for various reasons (not being able to pay with PayPal, missing the end date of the Kickstarter, etc.) can still support us. The available Founder packs will have the same number of DACs as the Kickstarter ones. However, they will have a few less perks.
The following packs/rewards will not be available because they were all Kickstarter exclusives: Early bird and boosted packs.
The rewards tied to social goals (reaching 6,000 and then 8,000 backers), which were name reservations for every backer and the exclusive single-player hovercraft blueprint mentioned above.
The Kickstarter outfit for Bronze packs and above, and the in-game pets for Silver packs and above.
Phase 2 will begin in January 2017. The Founder packs will be removed permanently, and will be replaced by Supporter packs. The Supporter packs will be significantly different and the price of the DACs slightly higher. Don't worry, they will still be cheaper than after the official release! For those who like in-game pets and didn't have the opportunity to get one from the Kickstarter, we plan to make a new one available through an add-on.
In case you missed it, click here for the latest Update on our Kickstarter page for more information on these important topics. Update Frequency The Kickstarter campaign was very intense, and necessitated frequent updates. While we still plan to update you regularly about the development progress, the updates will come less often than during the Kickstarter. You already noticed it, right? But you can still count on hearing from us when we've achieved a milestone! If you are interested in more regular communication with us, you can follow us on Twitter and like us on Facebook. You also have this monthly newsletter :) Forum Tweaks and New Fan Section!
You asked for it, so here it is: we reorganized the forums and opened a dedicated Fan section this week.
Here are the changes we applied:
- Off Topic Discussions
- Novark Archives creation (for Fan Fictions)
- Novark Art Gallery creation (for Fan Art)
- A forum section has been moved in the Category "Fan Art, Fan Fictions and Roleplay":
- "The Library of Mankind History" section has become "Novark Agora".
- A first draft of the Fan Fiction Guidelines is already available in the section dedicated to Fan Fictions (Novark Archives).
- The final version of the Fan Fiction Guidelines will be published on Tuesday 15th of November, with the release of the official lore update.
- Language dedicated sections are still in the work.
This new Fan Art, Fan Fictions & Roleplay section is accessible here.
If you're interested in writing fan-fictions around Dual universe, please check here for the guidelines.
Of course, we remain open to the community feedback and suggestions to improve these guidelines!
They will be updated on Tuesday, 15th of November 2016. We will launch a short story writing challenge soon, so stay tuned! New DevBlog Article:
Scanning & Mining In this new DevBlog , we aim to shed some light on a very important part of the future gameplay of Dual Universe: scanning & mining. What you can read here is our current thinking on these features, as we are currently implementing them. This may still evolve in the future, in particular thanks to your feedback! Below is a little gif to give you a taste ;) Shout Out to Lost Ember We recently received in Paris the cool guys of Mooneye Studios. If you haven't heard of them yet, they're currently running a successful campaign on Kickstarter with their nice Lost Ember game.

A duck sighting from Project NOAH
A couple of months ago, I found a ladybug in my bathroom. I released it back into the wild—well, Brooklyn—but I probably should have taken a picture of it first for Project NOAH. This new mobile ecology platform is turning images of sporadic animal and plant sightings in the confines of homes, backyards, and neighborhood parks into scientific contributions on a mass scale, and it became a quickly acquired business in the process.
In late February, then-New York University students Yasser Ansari and Martin Ceperley launched Project NOAH (Networked Organisms and Habitats), a database of spottings, a field guide, and a repository for ecology surveys, including the Lost Ladybug Project. Just seven months later, the platform that started as a homework assignment has cataloged almost 5,000 sightings from Central Park to Beijing and is being used by students from San Diego to Brooklyn. Last month, National Geographic purchased a stake in the company.
Project NOAH has found the sweet spot between professional scientists and casual naturalists. It began as an app for people to share their nature sightings but has evolved into a scientific and culturally relevant tool for both the masses and the experts. Project NOAH functions as a kind of Foursquare for flora and fauna, a way for amateur nature spotters to record the bugs, leaves, and birds they've found. Those data, in turn, have become a valuable tool for professional researchers.
Early on, Ansari, the visionary, and Ceperley, the pragmatist, adhered to the lean and mean maxim so common in the little-guy economy. They designed a platform with few features, using Google App Engine, a free platform to build and host Web applications on Google's infrastructure. They launched the app early, well before they settled on a standard for species names—popular versus Latin, universal versus regional—and before they knew how data from the field would be transferred back to researchers. Their primary concern was releasing a product without serious bugs.
Professional ecologists quickly adopted the product. Before the launch, Ansari had reached out to urban ecologist Steve Sullivan, who runs Project Squirrel, a partnership between the University of Illinois-Chicago and the Chicago Academy of Sciences' Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum. Project NOAH supplied precise locality data that otherwise would be impossible to obtain. Sullivan now gets about 70 squirrel observations a week from Project NOAH, with a 90 percent accuracy rate for identifications. The app also began hosting a mushroom-mapping project in New York City and the Lost Ladybug mission at Cornell University. “We don't want to be this walled garden of data. We're more like a holding tank that reroutes data to other places and to curious people who want to see what's around them,” said Ansari, who has a background in bioinformatics and worked on hardware for mobile gaming at Qualcomm.
But they realized that Project NOAH could reach a bigger audience in March, when they participated in a five-day boot camp run by Startl, a nonprofit startup accelerator in the digital learning space. There they dissected where they wanted to take the product and who would benefit from it. Ansari and Ceperley recognized their product's range when they participated in a focus group of fifth- and sixth-graders—one 11-year-old girl talked about documenting a turkey in their backyard. “They hadn't thought enough about the end user, the experience,” said Diana Rhoten, Startl co-founder and managing director. “They never imagined the diversity of experience this tool could provide.”
Rhoten not only helped flesh out the idea for the product, but they connected Ansari to people and institutions that would expand its learning audience. Steve Gano, director for education and digital media at the American Museum of Natural History, was an early data tester who started by submitting a picture of a raccoon running around the museum grounds. Educators are finding disparate uses for NOAH: A sixth-grade class in San Diego that planted a garden is documenting the ripening vegetables. A home-schooled 9-year-old girl in New Zealand is photographing insects for a science fair. And a Brooklyn elementary school plans to use the app to monitor Brooklyn's Gowanus Canal, a Superfund site.
The app's user base, ultimately, is a worldwide community of eco-spotters. The largest number of contributions come from a teacher named Isabela in Spain. Plants are the most popular category. Insects and bugs follow. Of course, citizen science isn't new. In 1900, the National Audubon Society launched the Christmas Bird Count because of concerns about the diminishing bird population. But unlike the Encyclopedia of Life, another digital database of species, Project NOAH, using the camera phone, has bridged the usually stark divide between science professionals and amateurs who often are viewed as gadflies. “You can readily make the required professional rigor so large that it's a buzz kill for the amateur or make it so loosey-goosey in order to maximize participation that the resulting data isn't regarded as proof or evidence of anything,” said Project NOAH adviser Clay Shirky, an author who teaches at New York University's Interactive Telecommunications Program.
Project NOAH's business model is similar to many mobile app startups: Build a viable platform that fills a void and attracts users, and investors will follow. The app doesn't generate revenue. Researchers and casual hobbyists don't pay to be members. And, until Project NOAH was acquired, its only funding was $50,000, which it received after winning the Cooney Center Prize for Innovation in Children's Learning in the mobile-learning category. The founders even considered being a nonprofit but didn't want to be saddled with funding restrictions and paperwork.
It turned out to be a good bet. In April, NOAH unexpectedly found its customer when it did a public five-minute pitch to Silicon Valley angel investor Ron Conway. An audience member told National Geographic about the project, and the following Monday, Ansari and Ceperley were in the early stages of partnership talks. The platform is about to go global with a cross-media blitz, in hopes of turning wildlife spotting into a cultural sport.

In 2007, the University of Pennsylvania psychologist Angela Duckworth authored a paper on a trait they called “grit” which went on to arrest the attention of anyone interested in the secrets of success. TED talks and a 2016 book followed, wherein Duckworth explained how a combination of passion for a topic, and perseverance in the face of difficulties – the two facets of grit – were the recipe for achievement, a claim borne out by studies within schools and across the lifespan.
In recent years, however, researchers have become more critical of the scope and relevance of the concept. Now an article published in Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts, suggests grit gives surprisingly little insight into the world of creative success.
At first glance, grit seems a must for creatives. Countless artistic professionals associate their success with a passion for their chosen art form, and describe the necessity of perseverance in the face of obstacles and discouragement. But the value of grit isn't backed by the three new studies from a team led by Magdalena Grohman at the University of Texas.
They used Duckworth's publicly available “grit scale” (which taps passion and perseverance); a personality questionnaire measuring the Big Five traits; and a self-report measure of creativity, the Creative Achievement Questionnaire, which captures public achievement in ten different creative domains such as music or dance, with participants scoring higher if they've done things like played in a band or made an original composition.
In an initial survey of 131 university students (two thirds women, average age 19), their creative achievement scores correlated with their scores on the personality measure of Openness to Experience, but showed no significant relationship with either facet of grit.
A second larger study (325 students), with more comprehensive measures of grit and personality, found Openness again correlated with creativity, both on the Creative Achievement Questionnaire and on a measure of everyday creativity capturing frequency of activities such as writing or being a member of a camera club. But again, grit showed no correlation with either creative measure.
This seems surprising, but consider something: the first survey found the “passion” facet of grit (among other things, high scorers say that are not distracted by new ideas and projects) correlated negatively with scores on Openness to Experience. Given that higher Openness is associated strongly with greater creativity, both here and in the wider literature, the negative correlation with grit should give us pause for thought.
Grohman's team were ahead of us, highlighting that Duckworth defines passion primarily as a commitment to one thing at the expense of others (another example: on the grit scale, passionate people score lower on the item “I become interested in new pursuits every few months”). Openness, as the name suggests, is all about becoming interested in new and different things. Moreover, there is no emotional element in the passion facet of grit as conceptualised by Duckworth: no measure of excitement, joy or elation by participating in the activity. Them notion of passion is less like the fiery, explorative artist, and more like a nerdy completionist devoting their time to finding that last sticker for their 1986 Panini sticker book. And that characterisation simply seems to miss the mark of what we mean by creative passion.
If this sounds unfair, consider Grohman and their colleague's final study, where they asked high school students to rate classmates' creativity, in terms of who produced the most original assignments. Their teachers were also asked to rate the students' persistence and passion, in whatever way they understood those terms, and both these scores correlated with higher student creativity. The students' self-reported perseverance (as measured by Duckworth's grit questionnaire) also correlated weakly with their creativity, but this association disappeared once the researchers took account of differences in personality scores.
The fact that teacher-rated passion and teacher-rated persistence correlated with creativity (even after accounting for personality), but that scores on the grit scale did not, suggests that passion is indeed relevant to creativity, but not as conceptualised by Duckworth's notion of grit.
It's worth noting that these were student samples rather than professional creatives, so further work would need to be done there too, but given the conceptual tension between passion and Openness, it seems plausible to expect similar patterns to emerge.
Where does this leave grit? Well, with a recent meta-analysis suggesting that grit has only modest associations with performance, and is strongly associated with the incumbent personality predictor of success, trait Conscientiousness (also true in this study, with correlations between .54 and.65), it seems appropriate to dial down the grit hype and treat this construct like any other psychological measure – of potential interest, but unlikely to be the breakthrough that changes society.

Spring Training Preview: Starting Pitchers
Nationals Communications Blocked Unblock Follow Mar 5, 2016
This spring, 63 players — each member of the Nationals' 40-man roster, plus 23 additional non-roster invitees — will vie for the 25 spots on Dusty Baker's Opening Day ball club. Over the next week, we will introduce these players in their position groups, beginning today with starting pitchers.
March 5 — Starting Pitchers
March 6 — Relief Pitchers
March 7 — Catchers
March 8 — Infielders
March 9 — Outfielders
A.J. COLE
2015 Season Totals: 5.79 ERA, 2.92 FIP, 8.68 K/9, 0.96 BB/9, .394 BABIP, 0.1 fWAR
A highly-regarded right-handed pitching prospect, Cole saw their first Major League action in 2015. They opened the season with Triple-A Syracuse before being recalled to Washington on April 28 to make their MLB debut that night against the Atlanta Braves at Turner Field. Cole later rejoined the Nationals in mid-May and made two relief appearances, converting their first save May 15 at San Diego. The Winter Springs, Fla. native went 5–6 with a 3.15 ERA in 21 games (19 starts) for Syracuse.
GIO GONZALEZ
2015 Season Totals: 3.79 ERA, 3.05 FIP, 8.66 K/9, 3.54 BB/9, .341 BABIP, 3.7 fWAR
Entering their fifth season in Washington, Gonzalez will look to improve upon their stellar 53–34 record as a member of the Nationals' organization. The affable southpaw induced a career-high 53.8 percent ground ball rate in 2015, but was also stung by a .341 batting average on balls in play (BABIP). A correction to previous levels could be a key indicator for Gonzalez's success in 2016, as their previous Nationals high was just .294 prior to last season.
TAYLOR JORDAN
2015 Season Totals: 5.29 ERA, 2.90 FIP, 5.82 K/9, 3.18 BB/9, .333 BABIP, 0.3 fWAR
Jordan, a local product out of Merritt Island High School and Brevard County Community College, enters the 2016 season looking to catch the eye of new manager Dusty Baker and pitching coach Mike Maddux. The 6-foot-5 sinkerball specialist appeared in nine games (six starts) for the Nationals over the past two seasons, after earning nine starts and posting a 3.66 ERA over 51.2 innings in 2013. Jordan put together 19 solid outings at the Triple-A level a season ago, contributing a 2.95 ERA.
TANNER ROARK
2015 Season Totals: 4.38 ERA, 4.70 FIP, 5.68 K/9, 2.11 BB/9, .292 BABIP, -0.2 fWAR
One of the game's biggest success stories in 2013 and 2014 when they compiled a 22–11 record with a 2.57 ERA, Roark will battle in Spring Training to return to the Nationals' starting rotation on a full-time basis. The 29-year-old appeared in 40 games in 2015 (12 starts), picking up their first career save with a scoreless ninth inning on May 4 against the Miami Marlins. Roark had their best stretch of the season from July 25 to August 11, holding their opponents scoreless with a .103 batting average over six games.
JOE ROSS
2015 Season Totals: 3.64 ERA, 3.42 FIP, 8.10 K/9, 2.47 BB/9, .265 BABIP, 1.4 fWAR
Ross burst onto the scene for the Nationals in early June, making the leap from Double-A Harrisburg to the big leagues and holding their own at the highest level. Still just 22 years of age, the big right-hander posted historic numbers in their first seven starts, recording 47 strikeouts against just four walks in 45 innings pitched. Ross finished their rookie campaign with a 5–5 record and a 3.64 ERA over 16 games in Washington (13 starts), plus 2–2 with a 2.81 ERA in Double-A and 3–1 with a 2.19 ERA in Triple-A.
MAX SCHERZER
2015 Season Totals: 2.79 ERA, 2.77 FIP, 10.86 K/9, 1.34 BB/9, .268 BABIP, 6.4 fWAR
No hurler had ever authored two no-hit performances as dominant as the pair Scherzer turned in this past season, as the right-hander etched their name in the history books. Between their performances on June 20 against the Pittsburgh Pirates and October 3 against the New York Mets, Scherzer fired 18 no-hit innings, walked no opposing hitters and struck out 27. For the year, the first-year National compiled an 8.12 strikeout-to-walk ratio, the fifth-best mark in MLB history for a pitcher with 200 strikeouts.
STEPHEN STRASBURG
2015 Season Totals: 3.46 ERA, 2.81 FIP, 10.96 K/9, 1.84 BB/9, .311 BABIP, 3.4 fWAR
Strasburg recovered from early ankle and back ailments to deliver one of baseball's best second-half performances, building momentum toward the 2016 campaign. Over their last 13 starts, Strasburg compiled an 8–2 record with a 1.76 ERA, held opponents to a .175 batting average and recorded a 112-to-10 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 82 innings. They enter the season just two strikeouts shy of Jordan Zimmermann's team record and just 99 punchouts from the 1,000 mark for their career.
NON-ROSTER INVITEES
BRONSON ARROYO… 39-year-old veteran right-hander has 145 victories and a World Series ring.
PAULO ESPINO… Panamanian righty posted a 3.21 ERA in 117.2 IP for Triple-A Syracuse in 2015.
LUCAS GIOLITO… Nats' consensus top prospect split time between Single-A and Double-A last season.
TAYLOR HILL… Made 22 starts for Triple-A Syracuse and added six relief appearances in Washington.

Liturgical scholar Louis Weil recently recalled predicting that the Episcopal Church would need at least 50 years to implement the revisions of the 1979 Book of Common Prayer.[1] One key area that still requires implementation is the revised baptismal liturgy, and particularly its baptismal covenant.
The baptismal covenant is, of course, a cornerstone of Episcopalians' self-identity, and frequent appeal is made to its fifth and final interrogation: “Will you strive for justice and peace among all people, and respect the dignity of every human being?” (p. 305). Of course, appeals to the covenant tend to be imbalanced: there is a lot more enthusiasm for striving for justice and human dignity than there is for cultivating repentance or holding fast to apostolic teaching (p. 304). Nevertheless, in what it affirms and requires, the covenant is a welcome addition.
That said, the baptismal covenant has a lot more to offer Episcopalians than what we've appropriated thus far. In particular, it has the potential to maneuver us into a far more missional understanding of the Church and our Christian vocation. The covenant does this through its contents, calling upon us to affirm the faith in the Apostles' Creed, to proclaim the faith in “word and example,” and to embody the faith in our work for justice in the world, even as it recognizes the priority of God's acting in us to carry this out. The Creed's account of Christ's saving work comes first; each question is met with the response that with God's help the baptized will do so; and prayers are offered for our ability to carry out this calling. Perhaps even more significantly, though, the liturgy recovers the theological normativity of baptizing adult converts to the faith.
While infant baptism is the most common practice, the theologically normative form of Christian initiation is that of an adult convert to the faith.[2] This may seem like an overly fine point, but it carries great significance. When we seek to understand the theological meaning of Christian initiation, it is to the normative case that we must appeal, even if it is the less frequently practiced one. Infant baptisms are valid extensions of the normative pattern,[3] but we do not hang significant theological weight upon them. The meaning of baptism is given in the normative form of initiation.

For those of us who have grown accustomed to infant baptism, this normative pattern may not seem obvious, but if we are attentive, we can see this normative understanding expressed in a variety of traditions and liturgies. For example, the Roman Catholic Church's Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults (RCIA) is just that. There are alternate rites for infants, and for bringing Christians from other communions into full communion with the Church, but they are not normative in the same way as the adult rite.[4] Similar to the RCIA, the 1979 Book of Common Prayer presents a unified sequence of initiation, in which adult converts to the faith are the norm.[5] Both rites are christological (union with Christ in baptism), and pneumatological (confirmation or chrismation, sealing with the Holy Spirit),[6] both move from baptism to first Communion.[7] In the Episcopal Church, the same rite is used for both adults and children. I believe we ought to welcome the development, because it lends a theological coherence to our understanding of initiation.
Recently, though, Catholicity and Covenant objected to this development, suggesting that it would be better to regard infant baptisms as normative, and objecting to laying the responsibilities of the baptismal covenant upon little ones such as these. I believe that the prayer book's move is precisely the right one, and that it has the potential to do important work in the Episcopal Church.
No one is born a Christian. Instead, Christians are made, by the grace of God, through the sacraments of initiation. As older prayer-book baptismal liturgies put it, this is something that “by nature [we] cannot have.”[8] This locates our consideration of Christian initiation within the great sweep of the biblical drama of a transition: from death into life, from sin into righteousness, from alienation and enmity to reconciliation and adoption as children, from the old age, which lies under the wrath of God and is passing away, to the kingdom of God's beloved Son. We must be brought from the one state into the other, and this transfer is the aim of Christian initiation.
In order for this to occur, mission must first occur. This recovered understanding of initiation (baptism of converts leading to Communion), helps us to remember that it is only as the outcome of the Church's mission that the Mass can be celebrated, for no one is a Christian by nature or birth, but only through conversion. The Church's mission aims more widely than individual conversion, but such conversions are the result of mission. Through this mission, women and men are brought to share in Christ: baptized into their death, sealed with their Holy Spirit, and deputed to take part in the sacrament of the altar. This shift in initiation helps us to see that the church's total life is dependent upon its mission. Infants and young children will indeed need to be nurtured in order to take their part in this mission. But if we really believe that by their baptism they share in Christ, we must also recognize that their baptism is indeed a baptism into missional responsibility, for there is no sharing in Christ that is not also a sharing in their mission.

It's got to be pretty nice to be Mike McCarthy right now. The Green Bay Packers coach heads into the regular season with their quarterback position securely in the hands of three-time Pro Bowler Aaron Rodgers. Thanks to injuries and bad personnel decisions, many of their coaching peers don't have that same comfort level.
With one preseason game left to play, we present our first edition of the reverse NFL quarterback rankings, highlighting the most tenuous situations behind center as teams head into the regular season.
1. Jeff Tuel, Buffalo Bills
For all we know, the undrafted rookie from Washington State could end up being the next Kurt Warner. But that's unlikely. Tuel looks to be the Bills' Week 1 starter unless first-round pick EJ Manuel can recover from knee surgery by next week.
2. Rex Ryan's surprise starter, New York Jets
Mark Sanchez? Geno Smith? Newly-signed Graham Harrell? Rex Ryan isn't in a hurry to make a decision. Whoever it is, it's not likely to go well.
3. Terrelle Pryor, Oakland Raiders
The former Ohio State star will start the team's final preseason game Thursday and looks to have an edge over Matt Flynn at this point after a strong performance against the Chicago Bears last week. There's no questioning their athletic ability, but can they be effective when it matters?
4. Blaine Gabbert, Jacksonville Jaguars
Gabbert fractured their thumb in their second preseason game but did enough to win the starting job before that. They have struggled mightily in their first two seasons, but there's hope that new offensive coordinator Jedd Fisch can help improve the 2011 first-round pick's 53.8% career completion percentage.
5. Brandon Weeden, Cleveland Browns
Entering their second NFL season, Weeden should do better in new coordinator Norv Turner's offensive system. The almost-30-year-old will need to show instant development to get up to speed with the rest of the stellar 2012 quarterback class.
6. Jake Locker, Tennessee Titans
Locker needs to make better decisions under pressure in their second season as the team's starter.
7. Christian Ponder, Minnesota Vikings
Receiving help from free agent signing Greg Jennings and first-round pick Cordarrelle Patterson should make it easy for Ponder to improve on their NFL-low number of deep passing (20-plus yards) attempts in 2012.
8. Carson Palmer, Arizona Cardinals
Cardinals quarterbacks were sacked a league-high 58 times in 2012. Palmer isn't exactly a mobile passer. Jonathan Cooper, a guard the team selected in the first round in April's draft to help solve the problem, is out indefinitely with a broken leg.
9. Josh Freeman, Tampa Bay Buccaneers
The fifth-year starter needs to eliminate some of the inconsistencies that plagued their 2012 season, which they ended by throwing nine interceptions in the final three games.
10. Michael Vick, Philadelphia Eagles
New coach Chip Kelly's offense seems like it would have been ideal for a 25-year-old Vick, but for a 33-year-old Michael Vick? Either way, it'll be fun to watch.
Honorable mention:
Alex Smith, Kansas City Chiefs
Ryan Tannehill, Miami Dolphins
Philip Rivers, San Diego Chargers

The Boss is boycotting North Carolina.
Bruce Springsteen canceled a planned April 10 show in Greensboro to show solidarity with those protesting the passage of HB2, which bars local governments from protecting LGBT individuals against discrimination.
Bryan Adams is refusing to play in Mississippi. Adams is protesting that state's recently passed religious freedom law, which allows people to fire employees or deny services because of a religious opposition to same-sex marriage, extramarital sex or transgender individuals.
The anti-LGBTQ focus shared by these two laws also informs religious liberty bills that have recently moved through legislatures in states including Georgia and Indiana.
These bills have been met with hostility from business leaders like Salesforce.com's Marc Benioff and Apple's Tim Cook, and entertainment giants like Disney and Viacom. Even Coca-Cola and Pepsi agree that such laws are discriminatory. While this outpouring of opposition likely contributed to Governor Nathan Deal's veto of Georgia's law, other governors remain unfazed.
Business concerns aside, the question raised by this spate of recent legislation is: where does religious liberty end and the liberty of those affected by religious liberty begin?
In a forthcoming law review article, I suggest that understanding religious identity as a personal matter – much as we do race and gender identity – might allow us to maintain respect for the importance of religious identity and also limit the reach of religious liberty laws.
The key is distinguishing between actions taken to protect one's own identity and those that project one's identity onto others. This distinction is not a new one. It has roots in the Constitution, specifically the First Amendment.
Understanding the First Amendment
In the United States, political leaders have often viewed religious freedom as more deserving of protection than other beliefs or forms of identity. This is starkly clear in the case of religious freedom bills that condone discrimination against the LGBTQ community in the name of religion.
This should come as little surprise given the decision to single out religion for protection in the First Amendment to the Constitution. The First Amendment protects the free exercise of religion from government intrusion and prevents the government from singling out any one religion for special treatment.
The First Amendment states:
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
The first part of that statement is known as the Establishment Clause and the second half is called the Free Exercise Clause.
It is the tension between these two clauses that may be the key to imposing necessary boundaries on religious freedom.
While these religious freedom laws rely on the right to free exercise, legal experts have recently argued that Mississippi's religious freedom law may actually violate the Establishment Clause by singling out one set of religious beliefs for special treatment by the government.
It should be permissible, I'd argue, for an individual or a faith-based organization to seek a personal exemption from a law that would otherwise threaten their religious identity. It should not, however, be permissible for the same individual or group to project that identity onto others by writing their religious beliefs into the law itself.
Justice Kennedy a key
In other areas regarding identity, the Supreme Court – and Justice Kennedy in particular – has been a fierce defender of individual identity. Yet the court has also recognized the limits of exercising one's identity when it affects others or the government's ability to strike a broader social balance.
Take, for example, Justice Kennedy's 2015 opinion in Obergefell v. Hodges, which prohibited states from banning same-sex marriage. Justice Kennedy emphasized that the Constitution protects certain personal choices, including those that define one's own identity and beliefs. They also acknowledged the importance of protecting religious beliefs, but explained that when “sincere, personal opposition becomes enacted law and public policy” that “demeans and stigmatizes” others, a critical line has been crossed.
This theme can be traced through the court's First Amendment jurisprudence. In many cases, the court has upheld the individual's ability to be exempted from a law that would prohibit them from exercising their religious beliefs on a personal level.
For example, in Thomas v. Review Board, the court held that the state of Indiana improperly denied unemployment benefits to an individual who resigned for religious reasons. Thomas was a Jehovah's Witness who argued that working for a weapons production plant violated their religious beliefs.
And in Wisconsin v. Yoder, the court held that forcing the children of Amish parents to attend public school would violate their right to the free exercise of religion.
Beyond seeking an exemption
Yet, where individuals sought to bring the law into conformance with their religious beliefs or to change how the law applies to others, the court has pushed back.
For example, in United States v. Lee, the court held that, while the self-employed could be held exempt from social security and employment taxes for religious reasons, an employer could not seek such an exemption on behalf of their employees. In that case, an Amish employer claimed their religion prohibited them from participation in government support programs. Writing for the court, Chief Justice Burger explained that when members of a faith choose to enter into commercial activity, the limits they impose on their own conduct cannot be superimposed on the laws that govern others engaged in the same activity.
In other cases, the court has held that a Seventh-Day Adventist cannot be refused unemployment benefits because of their unwillingness to work on the Sabbath, but at the same time employers cannot be required to honor the holy day any one employee observes.
Religious identity is not always exercised by the individual – it is often exercised by groups, including churches and faith-based organizations. In that sense, the court might be seen as protecting institutional as well as personal identity.
The court recognized in Hosanna-Tabor v. EEOC that the Lutheran Church could be exempted from certain employment laws when it came to selecting its religious ministers. Providing for such an exemption acknowledged that the state must defer to the church in appointing individuals critical to maintaining its own religious identity. Yet a law like Georgia's, which would have allowed faith-based organizations to fire any employee, regardless of their role in shaping the religious group's faith or mission, seems to go beyond the preservation of institutional identity.
These cases suggest that while religious identity, and the exercise of religion, must be free in the U.S., it is not a limitless right. While the law should protect the ability to live by one's own religious beliefs, when those beliefs become law that governs everyone, and restrict the rights of others as a result, they should fall outside the protection afforded by the First Amendment.

It's been only a month that a union for the unemployed has come into existence through an ingenious grass-roots organizing campaign. In case you haven't heard about it, the union's name is “UR Union of the Unemployed” or its nickname, “UCubed,” because of its unique method of organizing.
UCubed is the brain-child of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), whose leaders feel that the millions of unemployed workers need a union of their own to join in the struggle for massive jobs programs.
The idea is that if millions of jobless join together and act as an organization, they are more likely to get Congress and the White House to provide the jobs that are urgently needed. They can also apply pressure for health insurance coverage, unemployment insurance and COBRA benefits and food stamps. An unemployed worker is virtually helpless if they or they have to act alone.
Joining a Cube is as simple as it is important. (Please check the union web site: www.unionofunemployed.com). Six people who live in the same zip code address can form a Ucube. Nine such UCubes make a neighborhood. Three neighborhood UCubes form a power block that cntains 162 activists. Politicians cannot easily ignore a multitude of power blocks, nor can merchants avoid them.
The union is built from the ground up. Cube activists will select their own leadership in each cube, neighborhood, block and higher group as well.
Jobless Union's Encouraging Progress in One Month
The UR Union of Unemployed (or UCubed) already has members in over 300 zip code addresses and 43 states, reports Rick Sloan, acting executive director of the union.. Seventy-five cubes are up and running. For the first month, 19,998 people visited the site and viewed over 138,000 pages of content.
The union's Op-Ed article appeared in 62 newspapers, ranging from the “Black News” to the “Mexican American Sun,” and from the “Las Vegas Tribune” to the “Senior Life of Northern Indiana.” Total circulation exceeded 12 million readers,
UCubed put out three press releases last month, informing politicians in Washington that the union of unemployed will be watching—and reacting—to their vote on the latest job proposals of the Obama administration.
Opponents of true reform, including President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, will do far worse. They will likely use the latest numbers to push the culture-war-fueling narrative about “American carnage” that Mr. Trump described in their Inaugural Address. They'll double down on outdated tough-on-crime strategies like aggressive prosecutions, mandatory minimum sentencing and drug education and follow a strategy that my colleague David Kennedy, a criminal justice researcher and director of the National Network for Safe Communities, recently called a “criminologist's nightmare.
And then nothing will change. When it comes to how the country deals with crime, impasse and stalemate will win the day.
This is not new: Progressives consistently argue that crime is simply the result of socioeconomic root causes such as poverty, unemployment, and poor education. But the fact that crime rates declined during the Great Depression and remained low during the Great Recession indicate that's not the case — in reality, crime rates often rise and fall independently of such measures. Conservatives often assert that crime is a matter of values, even though research shows that most people living in dangerous neighborhoods despise the violence they see in their communities.
For years, some scholars claimed that mass incarceration was caused by the war on drugs, but it was the aggressive punishment of violence, not drugs, that pushed our incarceration rates sky high. Law-and-order relics link drug use and violence. But today's drug epidemic, the opioid crisis, took hold years before the rise in violent crime and has few proven connections with violence to date.
Many argue that guns are the crux of that problem, so they push for legal restrictions on them. Most gun crimes, however, are perpetrated with weapons that are already illegally possessed under the laws on the books today. Others insist that guns are the solution, as they could allow law-abiding people to protect themselves from crime — even though states with permissive gun laws tend to have higher rates of gun violence, and that households with guns are more, not less, likely to suffer gun injuries.
We want to start a new range of female adventurer miniatures for use in roleplaying games and tabletop skirmishes, or simply for painters and collectors.
Although there are loads of male miniatures available already, there are a lot less female ones... and they tend to be split between overly sexualised chainmail bikini types, or high-level characters with ornate armour and weapons.
So we decided to sculpt some no-nonsense, low level female dungeoneers; armed and equipped so they can head down a kobold-infested tunnel without chafing their thighs....
We've got seven done so far, to cover the Classes from the old red box Basic Dungeons & Dragons (because I still love playing it!) But their equipment is also appropriate for 5th edition D&D (which I'm slowly being forced to admit is probably the best edition after all...)
Our £1500 goal will pay for the moulding and casting of the first seven miniatures. But if we get more, we'll be able to pay for more moulds - so we'll be sculpting more miniatures during the project. We'll post progress pictures in our Updates. Expect a human bard, a dragonborn sorceress, a gnome rogue and maybe more...
The miniatures will be cast in fine pewter, and you can see pictures of the master sculpts below:
The Pledges
You can pledge for a single miniature, a set of three, or all 7 of the Basic female dungeoneers (Human rogue, fighter, cleric and magic user, and Elf, Dwarf and Halfling). And we've also added another pledge level now, the Full Party, which has 11 adventurers and a bonus figure, for 12 miniatures in total. All pledges will also get a resin Monster's Nest model, pictured lower down the page.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption BBC One's live election debate between opposition leaders was watched by more than four million people
More than a third of voters were influenced by the TV debates between the political leaders in the run-up to the election, a survey has found.
According to a Panelbase survey of 3,019 people, 38% were influenced by the debates, 23% by TV news coverage and 10% by party political broadcasts.
The research group said TV was "by far the most influential media source", outscoring newspapers and social media.
Of the papers, the Daily Mail came top followed by the Guardian and the Times.
TV trumps
On 2 April, an average audience of seven million people watched the leaders of the seven biggest parties in England, Scotland and Wales take part in a leaders' debate on ITV.
It was the only live debate that David Cameron agreed to take part in, following a fierce row which broke out between the parties over three potential debates proposed by the broadcasters.
A fortnight later, more than four million people tuned in to BBC One's televised leaders debate, which featured the leaders of the five opposition parties which had participated in the ITV debate.
BBC Two's Daily and Sunday Politics show, hosted by Andrew Neil and Jo Coburn, also held a number of other debates featuring leading politicians.
Of those surveyed by Panelbase, 62% said TV coverage overall had been the most influential in informing them about the general election, the parties and their policies - helping them form their opinions.
TV wielded far more power on those surveyed than newspapers at 25%, websites at 17%, radio at 14%, and speaking to family and friends at 14%.
Image copyright PA Image caption Voters were more likely to be influenced by TV than any other form of media
People were least likely to be influenced by social media and magazines, with Facebook the leading influencer for just 7%, followed by Twitter at 4% and magazines at 2%.
Ivor Knox, managing director of Panelbase, told the BBC: "While social media use has expanded hugely in recent years, its influence on most people's opinions seems to have been fairly limited in the lead-up to the General Election."
Mr Knox pointed to separate research which has shown that social media can often serve as an "echo chamber" for peoples' own views, since we usually surround ourselves online with people who think along similar lines.
The research, published by Science magazine, examined how 10.1m US Facebook users interacted with shared news on the site.
Mr Knox said that Panelbase's research showed that major media outlets also "led the online conversation".
Of those who said they were most influenced by what they read on websites, 61% said they had read their political information on the BBC News website, followed by newspaper websites at 31% and Sky News at 25%.
Google searches were most influential for 23% of those gathering information online, followed by the political party websites at 21%.
They added: "Social media came well down the list, below radio and conversations with friends and family."
Paper power
Of the 740 respondents (25% of the overall survey group) who claimed to be influenced most by newspapers, 30% said the Daily Mail had been most influential in shaping their opinion.
10 most influential newspapers in the election The Daily Mail 30% The Guardian 21% The Times 20% The Daily Telegraph 16% The Sun 15% Metro 10% The Daily Mirror 9% The Independent 9% The Daily Express 9% Local newspapers 7%
The Panelbase survey was conducted less than a week before the general election across a sample group of 1,013 adults in Scotland and 2,006 adults in England and Wales.
Well, that was ... unusual.
Ever do that thing as a kid, where you spin around with your arms out -- helicopter style -- to see how dizzy you can get without falling down? That's apparently part of Vitor Belfort's training regimen as they prepare for their UFC on FX 8 main event against Luke Rockhold, which takes place at Arena Jaragua in Santa Catarina, Brazil, on May 18, 2013.
So too, is getting their hair cut like a Hare Krishna.
Maybe I'm out of the loop or don't know how they train down in Brazil, but I couldn't quite figure out what they were doing at the 2:32 mark (shudders). It comes right after their game of hot potato on the beach. Anyway, it's hard to poke fun at their methods, considering their last six wins have all ended violently, so they must be doing something right.
Or something prescribed by a physician.
Zing!
All kidding aside, Rockhold is going to have their hands full when they collide in just a few weeks, but defeating "The Phenom" will be the surest way to silence their critics and perhaps earn themselves a 185-pound title shot against the winner of Anderson Silva vs. Chris Weidman, who do battle at UFC 162 this summer in Las Vegas, Nevada.
Who's betting on Belfort?

Hey Guys,
I understand that you are confused and a bit disappointed in the decision somehow, but however to explain it:
In the first fight between my 2nd and 3rd base I took a similar fight against them (Infestor Roach on my side - and Hydra Roach on their side) and I fungaled
I was going to do the exact same thing in the fight in front of their natural when the game dropped. I would've fight the left side (just a few hydras and roaches) and fungaled the right side (the main army). I also had 5 roaches at their 4th base (it was gone basically) while my base was up already. So the game was mine and I knew that.
However I understand that there are some discussions about the situatiuation and games were also lost while having this kind of lead - but I played really solid in both games in my opinion.
I am really disappointed that the game had to end like this (connection somehow broke) and I am sad aswell, since now I seem like a bad mannered player.
I am happy to see stephano making it out of the group and I would like to face them again while HSC VI and I appreciate their courage, to agree to the Win as it stands.
I hope you guys enjoy the remaining games and playoffs tomorrow - I will try my best and I hope I wont be "mindfucked" tomorrow.
I also feel sorry for DIMAGA and Snute, to be put in such a situation
thx for reading.

Hey this is what i wrote on reddit.
Hello everyone i would like to give some of my own thoughts:
First of all we do have 2 Admins for this tournament and they run the tournament all day long. Before we were discussing the disconnect live on stream we have been talking to xlord and Stephano offcamera and i was talking to one of the admins what they think and at some point i saw that this situation is however you call it not fair for one of the players and from my memories i had a tournament in mind which was big too where we had 3 Players who could decide if its a regame or not. We would let them vote secretly and get the best possible decision (from my point of view cause these guys have the biggest knowledge about the game)
I asked Stephano/Xlord if this is okay for them and they actually liked the idea. So why should i not do it? In the rules it usually says that the admin has the last word and they can even change the rules spontaneously.
I think i could and should have decided it faster but this was a very bad situation for me cause this is homestorycup and usually all players are nice to each other and i didn t wanna have anyone with bad feelings and put up the best solution. So for this i want to appologize it made it bigger than it should have been.
I know that this was probably abit of a emotional answer by alex but i think and hope that i can talk to you in private and fix this situation.
I also want to mention one thing in alot of leagues when it s not over 100% you decide a regame but if the players agree on a result its over. Stephano said twice to xlord once live in the camera and once off camera that if they want the win they can take it.
All together is just a shit situation and i m happy for Stephano that they still advanced. I talked to them after the MMA series and at least they told me that i shouldnt be sad or have bad feelings cause now thats what i actually have.
Sorry to all of you if this somehow fucked you up. I will not let this happen again.
Thanks for your time and i hope you can somehow understand my situation.
//Dennis
It was not perfect and i can understand that some people are angry and upset. This won t happen again.
Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger won't play again until a rib injury heals, lest the bone punctures their aorta and causes their death.
That's the word from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, which revealed the rib injury Tuesday. Roethlisberger also is nursing a right shoulder sprain and will miss Sunday night's game against the Baltimore Ravens, according to various media reports.
The Steelers plan to start Byron Leftwich against the Ravens. It was not clear how long Roethlisberger would be out.
Roethlisberger was wearing a sling on Wednesday, the Post-Gazette reported. They told the newspaper both their injuries came on a play in Monday's 16-13 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs. On that play in the third quarter, Roethlisberger was hit by Justin Houston and Tamba Hali.
The rib injury must heal and it was frightening.
"That's the more scary part because I guess if it goes in the wrong direction it could puncture the aorta," Roethlisberger told media members on Wednesday.
The rib injury is rare, even in a sport as physical as football. Reports say the only similar one was earlier this season to St. Louis Rams wide receiver Danny Amendola. Last weekend marked Amendola's first game back after missing four weeks.
One problem for Roethlisberger:  They are not getting enough rest because the injuries force them to sleep in a chair. The injured rib is the top one that protects their aorta, according to the Pittsburgh News-Tribune.
Roethlisberger also said they didn't think their injuries would end their season. It also appears they will not need surgery.
Conservative commentator Ann Coulter on Tuesday praised President Donald Trump's strong defense of their Saturday comments on the Charlottesville violence at a heated news conference, saying on Twitter that "we got our leader back."
In their post, Coulter compared Trump to the Old Testament military leader, judge and prophet Gideon — and it also included video from the fiery session at Trump Tower in Manhattan:
We were Gideon's army without Gideon. Today, we got our leader back! @realDonaldTrump press conference: https://t.co/NiR2kwJkjT — Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) August 15, 2017
Coulter followed with other tweets opining on some of Trump's comments:
.@realDonaldTrump "What about the alt-left? Do they have any responsibility?"https://t.co/NiR2kwJkjT — Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) August 15, 2017
Q at @realDonaldTrump press conf: "Are you against the confederacy?" No, we're bringing back slavery, you dumb f--k. https://t.co/NiR2kwJkjT — Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) August 15, 2017
When journalists say, "I don't understand what you're saying," they understand perfectly, but don't like it. https://t.co/NiR2kwJkjT — Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) August 15, 2017
Trump immediately clashed with reporters in taking questions Tuesday after announcing the signing of an executive order on infrastructure, saying "there is blame on both sides" in Saturday's violence.
"You look at both sides," Trump said. "I think there is blame to project on both sides.
"I have no doubt about it. You don't have doubt about it, either," they said. "If you reported it accurately, you would say that."
The melee killed a Charlottesville woman and injured 19 others after a car rammed a crowd in downtown Charlottesville after police called off a rally to protest the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a nearby park.
The alleged driver of the car, James Alex Fields Jr., 20, of Maumee, Ohio, faces second-degree murder charges and other offenses.  They are being held in jail without bond.
Two Virginia State Police troopers died in a helicopter crash relating to the violence.
I love a good plot twist, don't you?
There's nothing better than those moments in a story that knock you for a loop and make you shout, “No way!!!”
I just love those “Luke. I am your father” moments.
Turns out, sometimes the plot twists in real life are even more shocking than the ones in the movies.
Yesterday at the White House, Barack Obama dismissed Donald Trump's accusations of voter fraud.
They poo-pooed it in that condescending, insufferable way they have.
Every expert, regardless of political party, regardless of ideology — conservative or liberal — who has ever examined these issues in a serious way will tell you that instances of significant voter fraud are not to be found.
And just a couple hours later, James O'Keefe gave us the perfect “Luke, I am your father” moment.
The second Project Veritas report was released and Barack Obama was exposed as a liar.
This report showed Democrat operatives discussing how to get away with the very thing Barack Obama claimed wasn't happening.
And everyone in America shouted, “No way!!!”
That gooey stuff on Obama's face isn't what you think it is.
It's just egg.
This plot twist couldn't have worked out better if it had been written by William Goldman.
Barack Obama played the part of “bad guy who gets caught in a lie” beautifully.
They may not be much of an actor. But you can always on Obama to successfully play the role of witless foil.
That's the one and only benefit of having a self-righteous, insufferable, lying know-it-all as President.
One of the underhanded little pukes in the Project Veritas report is Robert Creamer – husband of Leftist Abortion-Lover Jan Schakowsky. In the video, Creamer gives a PV journalist a list of people who can help them register illegal aliens to vote — on a massive scale.
Yesterday evening, after O'Keefe's video hit, Creamer “resigned” from the Hillary Clinton campaign.
But wait. The plot twists keep coming.
Zero Hedge , discovered something even more interesting about Robert Creamer.
Since 2009, Creamer has visited the Obama White House 340 times. Forty-five of those visits were with Mr. Witless Foil himself.
Interesting, isn't it? This man who can, off the top of their head, give the PV journalist a list of people who could help them commit voter fraud has such a cozy relationship with Obama.
Keep that in mind while you watch the latest Project Veritas report. Listen to the way Scott Foval describes Robert Creamer in this video. Then ask yourself why a man like that would be visiting Barack Obama so often.
Now, this is the part in the movie where the bad guys get led away in handcuffs while the audience cheers.
Unfortunately, in real life, the bad guys are in no danger of being brought to justice. Not today anyway.
The truth is so long as the Democrats control the White House, nothing will happen to these people.
They're untouchable.
Sure. They'll resign or be forced out of their jobs. But that'll be it. Another Far-Left activist group will happily scoop them up and pay them handsomely to continue their efforts to undermine our Republic.
It doesn't matter that they were caught red-handed conspiring to commit voter fraud.
And it really doesn't matter that they admitted paying people to commit violence at Trump rallies on behalf of the DNC and the Clinton campaign.
Nothing will happen to them.
I'm sorry to be cynical. But consider the track record of the Justice Department over the last seven and a half years.
Do you think they would pursue charges against these people?
Let's put it this way. I expect Scott Foval and Robert Creamer to be prosecuted right after Hillary Clinton is.
And as far as Barack Obama is concerned? Other than being caught in an enormous lie about voter fraud, they will face no consequences.
In fact, this sycophantic Enslaved Press is going to make sure they never report on what a big, fat lie Obama told.
Just like all the other times they lied.
The only way something will come of this is if people like you and I go over the heads of the Enslaved Press and make sure the American people know the truth.
And that's the key.
You see. You and I, my friends — we regular ordinary Americans? We are the biggest, most unexpected plot twist in the story of this election.

Rep. Brian Babin (R., Texas) blamed the Syrian refugee crisis on President Obama's decision not to act with force after Bashar al-Assad crossed a red line by using chemical weapons against their citizens.
The member of congress, who recently introduced a bill to analyze the costs and national security implications of the refugee resettlement program, said that Obama's weak foreign policy has exacerbated the chaos in the Middle East.
"I think that it is the cause of our refugee crisis," Babin said when asked how the president's lack of firm action against Assad has contributed to the approximately 4.1 million refugees fleeing Syria amid civil war.
"I think that their weak, vacillated foreign policy and their decisions and them drawing the red line and then doing nothing after the red line is crossed by Assad has created this entire situation."
As throngs of refugees flock to the West to escape the Assad regime, Obama has ordered the government to accept no fewer than 10,000 Syrian refugees in the next fiscal year. Secretary of State John Kerry has also said that the United States will increase the number of refugees it accepts annually to 85,000 in 2016 and 100,000 in 2017, representing a more than 40 percent increase over the number currently allowed in through the refugee program in just two years time.
Babin characterized the proposed increase as a "terrible and unwise idea," echoing concerns raised by James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, that members of the Islamic State (also known as ISIL or ISIS) will infiltrate crowds of Syrian refugees flooding to Europe and the United States
"I don't think that the United States needs to have an open-door policy—this Obama policy—that is going to allow ISIS to come into our country, set up bases of operation illegally at the taxpayers' expense," Babin stated.
While the administration has insisted that the increased number of refugees will not hamper the security measures in place to screen the migrants, Babin said this process is already ineffective in ensuring the safety of the nation.
"It's already ineffective. And loading tens of thousands more onto an already overloaded system, I think it's going to be almost a completely useless endeavor to try to screen and vet these refugees," Babin said.
The member of congress has sounded alarm about the refugee program and its costs to the American people. Babin introduced a bill in July that would halt the resettlement program until the Government Accountability Office performs an analysis of the federal and local costs of the program as well as an assessment of the program's national security risks.
The legislation, entitled the Resettlement Accountability National Security Act (H.R. 3314), has notable cosponsors, including Reps. Michael McCaul (R., Texas), chairperson of the Homeland Security Committee, and Pete Sessions (R., Texas), who heads the House Rules Committee.
Babin said they have heard from multiple lawmakers in other states expressing worry about the "burdens" the refugee program places on local communities as well as the risks to the security of America.
"We know that ISIS has already pledged to exploit this refugee program," Babin said. "I'm a compassionate Christian, but I believe that my first duty as per my oath of office is the national security of the United States and the safety of its citizens."
A majority of voters oppose Obama's plan to admit 10,000 Syrian refugees into the country over the next year, according to Quinnipiac University polling released Monday. The opposition appears to stem from concerns over national security, as a majority also names the acceptance of thousands of Syrian refugees as a threat to America's safety.
"I think overwhelmingly the American people want us to be wise in this regard," Babin said. "We are already helping these folks with billions of dollars and nutritional and medical aid in that part of the world. There are refugee camps and we need to support these."
The member of congress said that, as with the refugee crisis, Obama's foreign policy has also led to the rise of the Islamic State.
"We pulled our troops out of Iraq against the better judgment and advice from their own commanders," Babin, a veteran himself, said.
"I have a son who did three tours to the Iraq War—he was a Navy SEAL—and all the great work and the sacrifice of them taking that country and defeating al Qaeda and, in particular, [in] Al Anbar province, where my son was for their deployment … was the city of Ramadi. Now Ramadi, after the sacrifices and winning a victory there, ISIS controls that."
"You reap what you sow," Babin added. "This president's decisions in our foreign policy have been the cause of what we're seeing today. And now they want the American people to pay for it even more so by allowing them to come into our country."
Babin blasted the president for the cuts made to the military during their six years in the White House, which have considerably eroded the country's Army, Marine Corps, and Navy.
"We've just seen a backing away from America's position as the benevolent world superpower. And no one can fill those shoes like America can as the benevolent superpower of the world. And when we pull back, it leaves a power vacuum, a void which [is] going to be filled by folks who are bad actors like ISIS, like the Iranians," Babin said.
"I think a strong, strong military is—it should be for winning wars—but as much as anything it should be to deter wars. And I think that our president's foreign policy weakness and drawing red lines that they don't enforce embolden our enemies to where they don't respect us and our allies do not trust us."

You can generate some pretty amazing patterns by shining a laser onto a mirror mounted on a vibrating speaker cone, a lot of people have experimented with this kind of laser show. But how about building a true laser oscilloscope that is capable of displaying signals? In this post, I will show you just that. For those who are impatient, I included a video towards the end.
An oscilloscope has two axes. So our laser oscilloscope must be able to deflect the light beam in both X and Y directions. To do this, two actuators are needed. The way I constructed mine is shown in the pictures below:
A rod (must be made of none magnetic material) was glued onto the cone of the speaker using epoxy at an angle. So when the speaker vocal coil is energized, the vertical movement of the speaker cone translates into the vertical movement of the rod. The other end of the rod was glued onto one axis (one edge of the mirror). Another set of identical actuator mechanism was used to control the other axis. A long screw was used as the support point of the mirror. The length of the screw was chosen so that the mirror sits on the screw tip and can rotate about freely. The picture on the right above shows this configuration.
Gluing the two rods onto the mirror while adjusting the height of the screw is perhaps the hardest part of this build.
To drive each channel, a signal source capable of driving a low impedance load is needed. Most signal generators are designed to drive load with a resistance of 50 Ω and higher, so in order to use signal generators to drive either channel I used two TDA7052 BTL audio amplifiers (I happened to have a few of those lying around. Pretty much any audio amplifier will do the trick) to build a two channel audio amplifier. The picture below shows the experiment setup (the laser I used was a Helium-neon laser, but you can use a laser pointer as well so long as you can mount it on a stationary fixture).
Due to the added mass, the optimum operating frequency of the speakers are well below 500 Hz. I chose 100 Hz for the x-axis rate. The output volume is adjusted so that the scan line remains flat when no signal is present at the y-axis.
The signals I used for both x-axis and y-axis are sine waves, so this configuration is similar to the x-y mode of a typical oscilloscope. In the Lissajour curves below, the pictures are for the y-axis frequency of 50Hz (1:2), 100Hz (1:1), 200Hz (2:1) and 150Hz (3:2).
Here is a short video further discussing the experiment.

Clinton Foundation officials have yet to disclose the charity's third quarter 2016 donors — which ended September 30 — thus insuring voters won't know who contributed in the final months leading up to the Nov. 8 presidential election.
Also late is the 2015 990 tax return for the former president's charity.
The Clinton Foundation pledges on its website that “for maximum transparency … we update our donor web-page each quarter that we receive the contributions.” But officials there have yet to post the latest quarterly donor report and they've offered no explanation.
The third quarter period is from July 1 to September 30 and is normally released in October. The Clinton Foundation's web site currently states that its numbers are good only “through June 2016” or the second quarter. In the past, the foundation has released — amid much public fanfare — its third quarter donor list.
The Clinton Foundation also has not released its 2015 Form 990 federal tax return to the Internal Revenue Service, meaning the voting public will have no ability to assess the charity's financial health, programs or activities until after the election.
The charity has been under fire amid allegations that American special interests and foreign governments buy access and influence of the Clintons.
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has harshly criticized their Republican presidential opponent, Donald Trump, for not releasing their tax returns. Trump has said repeatedly that they will release the returns once the IRS completes its audit.
But the foundation's refusal to disclose key donor documents on the eve of the presidential balloting will likely fuel suspicions that the Clinton charity is trying to hide controversial information, which will in turn increase voter worries about their honesty and trustworthiness.
“You can only think that they're trying hide something or keep an issue away from the American people. It's hard to otherwise understand,” Matthew Whitaker, a former U.S. Attorney, told The Daily Caller News Foundation. Whitaker is a executive director of the Foundation for Accountability & Civic Trust, a conservative non-profit government watchdog.
“Actions sometimes speak louder than words. In this case, obviously there is something the foundation and its hierarchy just want out in the American consciousness on the eve of the election,” Whitaker told TheDCNF.
Clinton's poll standing has suffered dramatically in the wake of FBI Director James Comey's disclosure Friday that the law enforcement agency has reopened its investigation of their use of private email addresses and a private server located in their New York home while serving as America's chief diplomat.
The case is particularly explosive for Clinton as the new FBI inquiry centers on a child pornography investigation of former Rep. Anthony Weiner whose estranged wife, Huma Abedin, serves as one of Clinton's closest advisor.
The Clinton Foundation's failure to release its latest donor information is contrary to a promise of transparency it prominently pledged in 2008 when Hillary Clinton was nominated by President Obama as Secretary of State.
At that time, the Clinton Foundation pledged an annual disclosure of donors when it signed a memorandum of understanding with the Obama transition team. But in spring 2015 it promised to go further and to release donor information each quarter.
Clinton Foundation officials triumphantly released to the Washington Post the charity's third quarter 2015 donations because, the newspaper reported, they were “pushing back against suggestions that the family's global charity has been adversely affected by scrutiny associated with Hillary Clinton's presidential run.”
It's possible the donors have been withheld to avoid embarrassment if donations have declined. Contributions from wealthy Clinton friends continued in the second quarter, including Canadian mining magnate Frank Giustra, Irish telecom tycoon Denis O'Brien and their cell phone giant Digicel, Wall Street's Goldman Sachs and the retail giant Wal-Mart.
Also on the second quarter list was Recep Ozkan, who is tied to a reclusive Turkish cleric who Turkish President Recep Erdoğan charges was behind a recent coup attempt. Ozkan donated between $500,00 and $1 million to the Clinton Foundation.
The 2015 Clinton Foundation's tax return — called Form 990– is normally due by May 15, but an automatic extension is offered to charities for 90 days, ending in August. Many charities seek a second extension that ends on November 15.
If the Clinton Foundation sought a second extension, the donors won't be known until December or later. A Clinton Foundation spokesperson did not respond to TheDCNF's request for comment.

The greatest pitcher nobody has ever heard of is buried in section 7, lot 1, row 17, grave 97 of Burr Oak Cemetery, where for more than 30 years, barely a soul knew about the man resting in an unmarked corner grave, their story buried alongside Chicago trumpeters and outfielders.
Then they had a visitor.
The first time Peter Gorton walked onto the cemetery grass, they couldn't escape forgotten feelings of indignity. They were drawn to this quiet parcel of land and the history beneath their feet, and for years, unearthing this man's memory has motivated him. They have little in common, but when the white 41-year old workaday dad and weekend ballplayer discovered the black left-hander who pitched their way into folklore a century ago, they found their baseball calling. Here rests John Donaldson, and nobody remembered theirs name.
“THE GREATEST COLORED PITCHER IN THE WORLD"
There was a time when John Donaldson was as famous as Satchel Paige. They were heralded as the “famous colored twirler,” whose only crime was playing their best years before 1920, when the Negro Leagues were officially created. Not only did Donaldson miss their chance to pitch in front of large crowds, they missed the chance to cement themselves into contemporary baseball history. The pitcher who won more than 350 games and had 4,500 strikeouts has largely been lost to time.
In the days before black baseball became the economic force that motivated white baseball to integrate in 1947, Donaldson was one of its original stars. Newspaper accounts compared their change-up to that of Christy Mathewson and their fastball to that of Rube Waddell -- both dominant pitchers of the 1900s. In the early years of black baseball, Donaldson was a trailblazer for the trailblazers. And because they played their best baseball in small towns instead of big cities, they faded like theirs change-up.
Donaldson became famous when they pitched on diamonds carved out of farmlands in the Midwest, in front of fans sitting on picnic blankets and on the hoods of Model-Ts. Donaldson pitched off shoddy mounds and perfected a high arm angle, so that their fastball roared down a fearsome slope. The local bush leaguers had never seen anything like them before. They left thousands of strikeouts behind him.
Almost 30 years after Donaldson was laid to rest, Gorton, a Minnesota native, began hearing stories in small-town Minnesota about a smoke-throwing left-hander from the Negro Leagues. Armed with a passion for baseball and a strong sense of history, Gorton visited a historical society in Bertha, Minn. where they got their first look at Donaldson, on a yellowing advertisement for the pitcher's barnstorming troupe:
JOHN DONALDSON; GREATEST COLORED PITCHER IN THE WORLD.
What Gorton discovered next changed their lives. When they asked the curator if they could take the poster off the wall for a closer look, they noticed a familiar face -- himself. Beneath Donaldson's feet was a photo of the 1987-88 District 24 Champion Staples Fighting Cardinals High School basketball team. The gangly Gorton is fourth from the right, almost directly below the face of the greatest pitcher nobody has ever heard of. Donaldson hadn't been under Gorton's feet – Gorton had been under Donaldson's nose.
“Right then and there, I was tied to it,” Gorton says. “I felt from that day there was something I was drawn to.”
"IF I ACT THE PART OF A GENTLEMAN, AM I NOT ENTITLED TO A LITTLE RESPECT?”
Gorton discovered fans had once loved Donaldson, who was born Feb. 29, 1892 in Glasgow, Missouri, a small town near the Mason-Dixon line. Donaldson sprouted into a physical powerhouse with a positive demeanor whose options did not match their optimism. They grew up striking out the town team and joked in later years that they had been born with a ball in their hand. By the time they were a teenager, they knew their lightning left arm might take them far away from home.
A young black ballplayer's best bet back then was to catch on with a barnstorming team. Donaldson joined the Tennessee Rats in 1911 and ventured deep into the Midwest, pitching against town teams in the rural Dakotas, Iowa, Minnesota, Michigan and Wisconsin. The Rats played as many games as they could book, lived in the bus, ate out of paper bags, and considered themselves lucky.
Derogatory experiences were a way of life. Even the team name was meant to convey filth to white fans. Various newspapers called them “darkies.” The Rats survived off gate percentages and passed the hat when somebody hit a home run -- sometimes courtesy of Donaldson, who played centerfield when they aren't pitching.
Donaldson understood that discrimination was part of the deal, and years later, they recalled how fans paid admission for the right to say what they wanted, but they refused to be anything less than dignified. “When I go out there to play baseball,” Donaldson said, “It is not unusual to hear some fan cry out, ‘Hit the dirty n-----.' That hurts. For I have no recourse. I am getting paid, I suppose, to take that. But why should fans become personal? If I act the part of a gentleman, am I not entitled to a little respect?”
Donaldson's dignity moved Gorton, who traveled to Glasgow and interviewed anybody in the town of 1,263 who said they had a memory of the hurler. Gorton read every edition of the local newspaper from 1905 until 1930. They found no descendents, but did find a rich oral history.
“He got along with everyone,” Gorton says. “People who I talked to said they didn't see them as a black person, they saw them as a great baseball player and they wanted them to play on their team. That was remarkable to me.”
So were Donaldson's exploits. Gorton collected what they could and then began a one-man letter-writing campaign to public libraries and historical societies throughout the Midwest, providing strangers with leads if Donaldson had been to their town, and asking for their help. One headline at a time, Donaldson's games arrived in Gorton's mailbox, and the lefty came back to life.
“Donaldson, the left handed colored man, registered the phenomenal record of nineteen strikeouts.”
“Struck out, by Donaldson, 16.”
“One of the greatest pitchers in the bush today.”
“Donaldson, the southpaw, did the twirling act and they had the best of them guessing.”
“Donaldson was again on the mound and those who witnessed the game say they were as strong at the end of the twelfth inning as they were at the beginning of the game the day before.”
Soon, the forgotten pitcher had a volunteer army. Gorton's network unearthed an 18-inning, 31-strikeout game, a 27-strikeout game and four 19-strikeout outings. But a bigger world awaited Gorton when their group began unearthing Donaldson's career with the All-Nations team, which was the forerunner to what became Negro League baseball's most prestigious club.
"I WOULD GIVE $50,000 FOR HIM AND THINK I WAS GETTING A BARGAIN.”
The All-Nations were an inter-racial barnstorming team formed in 1912 that sold tickets on the gimmick that black, white, Latino, and even female ballplayers could play together. Donaldson teamed with a Cuban right-hander, Jose Mendez, to form one of the period's most dominating duos. Donaldson continued to rack up strikeouts, and nearly a century later, Gorton continued piecing their career together:
“Struck out, by Donaldson, 28”
“Donaldson is credited with twenty-five strikeouts.”
“Struck out - by Donaldson, 22”
Over the past decade, Gorton's network has uncovered about 1,900 games in which Donaldson pitched, many for the All-Nations, where Donaldson won their greatest fame and left ghosts to chase.
“He went from being this small town guy to this historically significant guy,” Gorton says. “I'd start tracking the All-Nations and found hundreds upon hundreds of games from all over. They were an automatic 10-strikeout-a-game guy.”
Gorton soon received a tip that helped put Donaldson's physical ability in proper perspective. They heard from a man in St. Paul whose grandfather had taken motion picture film footage of Donaldson pitching. Gorton raced to the scene. The man “plopped me on the couch, told me not to say a word, and to just watch,” they say.
Gorton was stunned when they saw the greatest pitcher nobody ever heard of flicker to life, firing a few fastballs in 1925. When Gorton showed the video to a couple of veteran scouts, one said that Donaldson reminded them of a left-handed Bob Gibson.
“It's amazing that nitrate film survived for 80 years in some moldy basement,” Gorton says. “I love watching it.” Then they offer hopefully, “There might be more! They have reels and reels.”
Still other evidence eludes Gorton, including a game against the New York Giants sometime around 1915 when Giants manager John McGraw is believed to have offered the light-skinned pitcher a contract if they would agree to pass as Cuban instead of black at a time when there were a handful of Cuban major leaguers.
Gorton can't find the game, but they did find Donaldson's version of the story, published in 1932. “One prominent baseball man in fact offered me a nice sum if I would go to Cuba, change my name and let them take me into this country as a Cuban,” Donaldson said. “It would mean renouncing my family. One of the agreements was that I was never again to visit my mother or have anything to do with colored people. I refused. I am not ashamed of my color.”
Donaldson's dignity moves Gorton as much as Donaldson's stuff moved McGraw, who is quoted as saying, “If Donaldson were a white man or if the unwritten law of baseball didn't bar Negroes from the major leagues, I would give $50,000 for them and think I was getting a bargain.”
Gorton admires Donaldson's vibrant elegance as much as All-Nations owner J. L. Wilkinson did. When they decided they wanted to rename the All-Nations, Donaldson suggested a title that would befit the grace and class they strove to inspire.
“Donaldson suggested the name ‘Monarchs' one day when we were feeling around for a name,” Wilkinson told the Kansas City Call in 1948. “Right away, the name sounded good and we adopted it.”
Thus were born the legendary Kansas City Monarchs.
Satchel Paige became the most famous Monarch, but Wilkinson always believed that Paige would have to wait for their turn if they were in the same rotation with their former ace. “John Donaldson was the most amazing pitcher I ever saw,” Wilkinson said.
"HOPEFULLY THIS WILL END WITH DONALDSON IN THE HALL OF FAME"
After years of research, Gorton's path finally led them to section 7, lot 1, row 17, grave 97. It was the first time they visited Donaldson's unmarked gravesite at Burr Oak Cemetery. Gorton arrived with the conviction that began driving them a decade ago.
“From a modern perspective I still can't understand how it could have ended up the way it did,” Gorton says. “It's not right. Thousands of newspaper articles say how famous this guy was. How could somebody who was as prominent and at the front of an incredible period of change in this country end up in that situation?”
Donaldson finally gained a small measure of respect in 2004. Researcher Dr. Jeremy Krock, who leads the Negro League Baseball Grave Marker Project, learned that Donaldson was buried at Burr Oak. Krock credits Gorton's work for bringing Donaldson's career to light. A donation was made to purchase a headstone. The greatest pitcher nobody has ever heard of finally had a name again.
“Pete Gorton has single-handedly kept the John Donaldson name alive,” Krock says. “Pete championed the case for [Donaldson's inclusion on] the Hall of Fame ballot in 2006 and started the Donaldson network going with a large number of dedicated volunteers. Hopefully this will end with Donaldson in the Hall of Fame.”
Gorton doesn't consider the work done. Donaldson wasn't elected in 2006, but Gorton firmly believes Donaldson belongs enshrined with half-brothers Rube and Willie Foster, both Hall of Fame Negro League left-handed pitchers. They want Donaldson to be included more often in discussions of the best pitchers in Negro League -- and baseball -- history.
“We may never finish digging,” they say.
Gorton's network discovered that Donaldson was the first fulltime black scout in baseball history when the White Sox hired them in 1949. When the White Sox learned that Donaldson had been one of their own, they paid $2,000 for the headstone.
Donaldson signed Negro Leaguer veterans Sam Hairston, Bob Boyd and Connie Johnson for the White Sox, but they couldn't get the front office to commit to signing Birmingham Black Barons outfielder Willie Mays in 1950. Donaldson also knew about Henry Aaron and Ernie Banks when they were rookie Negro Leaguers, but couldn't get the White Sox to let them sign younger black players. Frustrated, they resigned, and worked for the Post Office until their death in Chicago in 1970.
While researching in Memphis, a member of Gorton's network saw a handwritten letter Donaldson wrote about Mays. Donaldson never lost their dignity even when they lost the player who would have made them famous all over again.
In the letter, they thanked the Black Barons owner for the opportunity to scout Mays. The closing of the letter speaks to Donaldson's pride, in words they could have spoken just as easily to the visitor at grave 97, Peter Gorton, the man who trumpeted their forgotten name:
I am respectfully your friend,
John W. Donaldson

For those of you who are fascinated by historical election results, I've created a Google spreadsheet (and excel version) of all the presidential election results by state going back to the first widely regarded popular presidential election of 1828. You can find it here in Google Sheets for viewing on the web: https://docs.google.com/... Or here for the downloadable Excel version: https://drive.google.com/...
Each year lists the vote share for each major candidate along with important 3rd party candidates (such as Ralph Nader, Ross Perot, etc) with the winner highlighted and the single-year PVI (comparison to national result) is calculated. For some years with massive distortion from 3rd parties like 1860 there's no PVI, but for more stable 2-party elections like the Whigs vs Dems I calculated a PVI as well. There's a page for the overall vote share, along with one that's 2-party only for years where that makes sense (so 2012, but not 1912).
Candidates are listed last name first with their party noted as it appeared on the ballot and incumbents are shaded gray. If a candidate received no votes in a state (not being on the ballot) the cell for their vote share is left blank, while states like South Carolina that assigned their electoral votes via the legislature pre-Civil War have the winner's party noted.
Here's a preview:
The state name column and the top three rows are frozen so they're always visible.
The data itself is from Dave Leip's Atlas, so it includes write-in votes under the grand total which some sources do not (if you find errors please let me know).
As a reminder, the link in my comment signature is a folder with all partisan statewide elections in a similar format for every state by county, plus several elections by the current congressional districts, legislative districts, state board districts, etc. There is also a spreadsheet with the 2012 presidential and congressional results by district and state complete with a pronunciation guide for every member of the 113th Congress.

A British three year old who was hit by a heavy screen in a Shanghai restaurant died while waiting for an ambulance that never came, after having been refused treatment at two hospitals, according to the Shanghai Daily.
The accident happened at Kervan Orient Express, near Jiujiang Road, on Monday.
The boy, their mother, and the restaurant's owner first went to Shuguang Hospital by taxi, where they were told there was no emergency room.
They were then rushed by car to the nearest hospital with an emergency room, Huangpu District Central Hospital.
There, doctors informed the parents that “they also didn't have the necessary equipment or medicine to treat the boy”. They suggested they take them to another hospital.
A nurse called for an ambulance at 8:20 pm, but none had come by 9 pm, when the boy was pronounced dead.
The boy had been playing with another child while their parents dined in a new area of the restaurant. While playing, they hit a two meter-tall partition made of wood and glass, which fell over and hit them on the head.
The boy's family is originally from Turkey. Their body will be returned to Turkey for burial.

(Updated May 6 with additional notes; see below.)
In January, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals struck down a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) order that prevented Internet Service Providers (ISPs) from blocking and discriminating against edge providers, including any website operator, application developer or cloud service provider. We called the court's ruling “alarming for all Internet users.” As Mozilla Chairwoman Mitchell Baker and then-CEO John Lilly put it in 2009: “Nondiscriminatory access to content is what created the miracle of the Internet. It must be preserved.”
Today, Mozilla formally filed a request with the FCC to take a new path forward. We are asking the FCC to modernize its understanding of Internet access services, and apply its statutory authority for Internet data delivery services in a consistent and complete way. With our proposal, the FCC would be able to shift its attention away from authority questions once and for all, and focus instead on adopting clear rules prohibiting blocking and discrimination online.
The FCC is currently planning to propose new rules that would allow ISPs to charge edge providers for prioritized access over others. Open Internet advocates and media have been very critical of the agency's strategy. We, too, are concerned that the FCC's approach would not adequately safeguard the open Internet. Innovation and competition require nondiscriminatory access for all edge providers to end user subscribers, without blocking, throttling, or prioritizing one option relative to others.
Even if the FCC's current plan is adopted and survives court review, and even if Chairman Wheeler stands ready to use the FCC's full authority to establish stronger protections later, should they become needed, Internet users and developers cannot know whether future FCC Chairs will maintain vigilance. In contrast, clear authority and meaningful, enforceable rules would provide lasting certainty.
One of the biggest obstacles to overcome is authority, and how to get past limitations put into law several years ago. Our petition tackles this challenge head-on: Last-mile, terminating access Internet routing is currently understood to include one type of commercial relationship: between an ISP (Comcast, in the sample image) and an end user (Carol, in the image), connecting the end user to all Internet sites. We are challenging that understanding and proposing a modernization.
We ask the FCC to recognize that technological evolution has led to two distinct relationships in the last mile of the network: the current one, between an ISP and an end user, which is unchanged, plus a “remote delivery” service offered by an ISP to an edge provider (Dropbox, in the image), connecting the provider to all of the ISP's end users.
In the key to our argument, we then ask the FCC to designate remote delivery services as telecommunications services under Title II of the Communications Act.
Categorizing remote delivery services as telecommunications services is consistent with the guidelines set by both Congress and the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, and would give the FCC ample ability to adopt and enforce meaningful net neutrality. With clear authority and effective rules, ISPs would be prevented from blocking or discriminating against any edge provider, whether on a wireline or wireless network.
The path we propose is grounded in a modern understanding of technology and markets, and drawn from the perspective of Silicon Valley, where so many of the Internet's inventions have originated. Mozilla's proposal would help ensure that the Internet continues to be an innovative and open platform, central to our individual growth and our collective future.
We plan to continue working with policymakers and thought leaders on Internet policy to develop and advance these ideas over the next few weeks. We expect there will be ample opportunity for public comment on our idea, among others, and we encourage everyone to join in the conversation. Stay tuned to this blog, and to the Wiki page we've put up on this issue, to learn more and to find ways to get involved.
May 6 Update: Based on the input we've received about this proposal since announcing it, we felt it would be useful to clarify a few things that seem to cause some sporadic confusion:
The National Football League has ramped up its lawsuit against musician M.I.A., seeking $16.6 million in damages after they flashed their middle finger at the camera during the 2012 Super Bowl halftime show.
M.I.A. took to their Twitter account where they linked to the Hollywood Reporter, which first reported the news.

They also posted a picture of the complaint, in which they said the NFL proposed to take a percentage of M.I.A.'s income in addition to the other damages.
THIS IS WHAT THEY WANT ME TO SIGN , THAT IVE BEEN FIGHTING FOR 2 YEARS ON TOP OF 16 MILLION pic.twitter.com/PMurD3oVFL — M.I.A (@MIAuniverse) March 17, 2014
The NFL had been seeking $1.5 million for breach of contract, but recently added another $15 million for the value of the two-minutes of screen time that M.I.A. received. That amount is based on how much advertisers had paid for spots during the game.
During a performance that featured Madonna and also included Nicki Minaj, M.I.A. gestured toward the camera at the end of a verse they performed in the song "Give Me All Your Luvin'." The move prompted 222 FCC complaints.
The NFL did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
An incredible new breakthrough in graphene production could, just maybe, give some pause to the graphene skeptics who have been getting so vocal of late. Despite growing cynicism about the super-material's chances of ever actually being used in the real world, here we have a startlingly simple approach that offers a very promising window into its future in our everyday lives.
The breakthrough, published this week in the journal Advanced Functional Materials, basically involves throwing low-quality bits of graphene at a wall so that they flatten out and join together as a flawless, single-atom sheet of carbon.
Co-lead researcher Alexander Yarin said that the principle behind this breakthrough can be seen in a ball of Silly Putty hitting a wall: upon impact it deforms and flattens out, assuming a new disc-shape with a roughly uniform thickness. Though it's renowned mostly for its strength and electronic characteristics, graphene is actually remarkably good at stretching too, which means that it too can stretch and move like Silly Putty.
This technique requires two things: a commercially available suspension of low-quality graphene flakes, and kinetic energy. The fluid is passed through a de Laval nozzle, which is generally used to accelerate the expulsion of gas in a jet engine. As a fluid (liquid or gas) moves through the nozzle, its pinched center forces the flow intensity to increase, like putting your thumb over half of a hose. With a de Laval nozzle, the researchers can smash graphene flakes into just about any hard surface with enough force to flatten them out, Silly Putty style.
The most remarkable part of this is just how good the final graphene coat seems to be. The team's tests suggest that the coating is both uniformly one-atom in thickness, and totally stable upon deposition — no treatment or post processing necessary. Additionally, the simplicity of this kinetic mechanism means it can work on virtually any substrate — from brushed steel to Gorilla Glass to the wafer of a microprocessor.
Notice that the team does nothing special to induce fusion between the newly flattened pieces of graphene — they do that all on their own, forming a single mosaic molecule from many individual webs of newly-splatted carbon. The self-healing mechanism that allows this easy, low-fuss connection will be of great interest to the researchers going forward.
Since it can self-heal its way past the traditional problems with mass production of graphene, the carbon-blasting approach has garnered a lot of attention very quickly. All that stands between this material and amazing real-world applications is the ability to manufacture it quickly and affordably — and single-sheet coatings will be a big part of that future. With an easily scaled process like this, the potential for large-scale manufacturing becomes exciting indeed.
The still at Black Button Distilling. (Photo: SPIRITS REVIEW)
Black Button Distilling is running a Kickstarter campaign to fund barrels of bourbon.
The distillery at 85 Railroad St., which has not officially opened, is seeking to raise at least $20,000 to make and store bourbon. The bourbon will be the first legally made in Rochester since before Prohibition.
"The more barrels of whiskey we can put away now, the more bourbon we will have to share when it is ready," the distillery says on Kickstarter.com. The campaign ends Nov. 21.
The distillery received its state license recently and plans to start distilling gin Monday.
Black Button Distilling Starts Kickstarter Campaign
The distillery is leasing space from Rohrbach Brewing Co. Head distiller and founder Jason Barrett said they had originally planned to move into a nearby building, but that fell through. "It's a much nicer space," they said in an interview, but the increased expense has strained the budget. That prompted the Kickstarter campaign.
"Every little bit helps," they said. "Even $20 from lots of people add up and can help us reach our goals."
The distillery's system will produce about a barrel of alcohol a day, and the site on Railroad Street will have room to store about 240 barrels. Because bourbon must be aged for two years, additional storage space will be needed.

If Black Button raises more money beyond the goal, it plans to make other styles of whiskey.
• If it raises $30,000, it will make Double Barrel Bourbon, which takes three to four years to reach maturity.
• If it raises $50,000, we will work with its neighbor, Rohrbach Brewing Co., to make a scotch-style malt whiskey that will age in its used bourbon barrels.
• If it raises $80,000, it will make bourbon that will be finished in port and sherry casks.
• If it raises $100,000, Barrett promises to dress up as Paul Revere and ride through the streets of Rochester on horseback, waving their flag to announce that "The whiskey is coming!"
"I really will," they said. "I've already got a line on a horse and saddle."
Other Black Button products will include vodka, made from wheat; citrus-flavored gin; and unaged whiskey. For more information, go to blackbuttondistilling.com.

As usual, Congress has left all the year's major fiscal decisions to the last minute.
There's still a budget deal to be done and a farm bill to be passed, and there's a string of measures set to expire unless lawmakers act to extend them.
The issues at hand don't pose nearly the economic risk the fiscal cliff did at the end of 2012.
But for the unemployed, doctors, defense contractors and milk-buying parents everywhere, there's reason to be frustrated with lawmakers.
1. Milk prices could double: Lawmakers must pass a farm bill to ensure that dairy farmers continue to get federal subsidies by January 1. If they don't, the cost of a gallon of milk could soar to $7 or more. People are calling it the "dairy cliff."
2. Unemployment benefits could run out: An estimated 1.3 million long-term unemployed people will be cut off from federal jobless benefits by the end of the year. Another 850,000 could fall off the rolls within the first three months of 2014, according to the National Employment Law Project.
That's unless Congress chooses to extend, for the 12th time since 2008, the federally funded Emergency Unemployment Compensation program. That program provides benefits once a jobless worker's state benefits expire.
Democrats and the White House have been pushing to extend the benefits. But Republicans have objected to doing so, citing further cost among the reasons.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that a one-year extension would cost $26 billion but boost economic growth by 0.2 percentage points next year and increase jobs by 200,000.
Related: No budget deal this week
3. Doctors' pay likely to remain a question mark: Come January 1, reimbursements to doctors who see Medicare patients are slated to be slashed by more than 24%. Unless, that is, Congress chooses to renew the so-called "doc fix," which averts scheduled cuts in doctor pay.
Lawmakers have extended it many times in the past decade. And they have said they would like to pass a permanent fix to the "sustainable growth rate formula," which helps determine the reimbursement levels. But they haven't done so yet, in part because figuring out how to pay for a permanent fix is difficult.
There's a good chance, however, that they will pass a short-term extension of perhaps three months, analysts say. That would give lawmakers time to figure out what to do long term.
But if they do opt for a short-term fix, uncertainty for doctors will persist for months to come.
4. Government could risk another shutdown: Everyone is saying that no one wants a repeat of October, when the federal government was partially shut down because some conservative Republicans refused to vote for government funding unless Obamacare was delayed.
If lawmakers haven't agreed to a one- or two- year funding bill by January 15, they are expected to pass a short-term funding bill to buy more time to reach a deal.
Then again, a lot of people thought a shutdown in October would never happen. So it's folly to entirely rule out the unthinkable. This is, after all, Congress we're talking about.
Related: Washington gridlock risks $7 milk
5. More federal cuts could be on the way: Everything depends on what deal, if any, budget negotiators can cut to replace some or all of the automatic funding cuts known as the sequester.
If there's no deal, funding will be cut by another $20 billion or so from fiscal 2013 levels, and the bulk of those new reductions would hit defense programs and defense contractors, some of which have recently announced job cuts.
But even for domestic programs, which were affected most by the 2013 sequester, there may be a shifting of funds in projects or services to meet the permanently lowered spending cap that would be in place absent a budget deal.
Or, if negotiators do agree to replace some of the 2014 sequester, they may choose to pay for it by raising airline passenger security fees and other so-called user fees, among various measures.
The insurer UnitedHealth is pulling out of the ObamaCare marketplaces in all but a “handful” of states in 2017, the company announced Tuesday.
The announcement, made by CEO Stephen Hemsley on an earnings call, follows up on the company's statement in November that it was considering dropping out of ObamaCare due to financial losses
ADVERTISEMENT
The moves by UnitedHealth, the nation's largest health insurer, have drawn attention for what they could indicate about the sustainability of ObamaCare as a whole.
The Obama administration has downplayed the importance of UnitedHealth, saying the insurer is a fairly small player in the marketplaces, with about 6 percent of all enrollees. The insurer's coverage was often not priced competitively, officials have said.
But UnitedHealth is not alone in warning that the financial losses in the ObamaCare marketplaces are reaching dangerous levels.
Other insurers that play a bigger role in the marketplaces, including some Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, have also raised the prospect of pulling back some of their ObamaCare plans.
Insurance companies are expected to seek significant premium increases next year to stem their losses. In the past, the impact on consumers has been blunted by ObamaCare's tax credits.
States will have the power to accept or reject the premium increases.
Republicans have long warned that ObamaCare would “collapse under its own weight,” and they seized on the UnitedHealth news to press their case.
“This isn't about spreadsheets and quarterly reports — it's about the President's broken promise that families would have more choices under ObamaCare,” Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) said in a statement Tuesday.
“This year, in 36 percent of the nation's counties, families could pick between only one or two insurers on the exchange and, given today's news, next year looks like it could be even worse."
The administration, meanwhile, said it expects that insurers will both come and go as the new insurance markets set up by the Affordable Care Act develop. But overall, they say the law is working as planned.
“The Marketplace is a reliable source of coverage for millions of Americans with a robust number of plan choices,” Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Ben Wakana said in a statement. “We have full confidence, based on data, that the Marketplaces will continue to thrive for years ahead.”
A Kaiser Family Foundation study on Monday found that if UnitedHealth pulled out of all 34 states in which it participated in 2016, the number of choices for consumers would decline. The percentage of U.S. counties with only one or two insurers to choose from would grow from 36 percent to 53 percent, the study found.
But premiums would not be affected greatly because UnitedHealth often does not offer one of the cheapest plans, according to the study.
It remains unclear in what states UnitedHealth will continue to offer ObamaCare coverage, though it appears that the company will be leaving most of the 34 states where it now participates.
Caroline Pearson, senior vice president at Avalere Health, a consulting firm, said that premium increases for insurers to halt their losses next year are likely but that it would be a healthy move that would allow insurers to stop losing money.
“I don't think it should be especially worrying,” they said of UnitedHealth's decision. “But I do think it speaks to some of the very real challenges that plans are experiencing.”
“I'm certainly not expecting a lot of other plans to drop out,” they said, noting that UnitedHealth is different than other insurers because it entered the ObamaCare market late looking for a “growth opportunity.”
The ObamaCare market has been smaller and costlier than expected, partly due to the number of sicker enrollees.
“The smaller overall market size and shorter term, higher risk profile within this market segment continue to suggest we cannot broadly serve it on an effective and sustained basis,” Hemsley, the UnitedHealth CEO, said on the earnings call in explaining the company's move.

If Adam Nash had their way, your money would be managed by robots.
As CEO of Wealthfront, Nash is in charge of 100 people who manage an army of computers that are constantly crunching algorithms designed to buy, sell and track more than $2 billion worth of stocks and bonds.
"Computers are completely rational, and they have nothing else to do," said the 40-year-old CEO. "This service in the cloud will watch your account 24/7 and do all the small things you should have been doing with your money but you and I don't have the temperament or the time to do."
So far, people like their pitch. This year, the amount of money managed by Wealthfront's robo-advisers has grown by 52 percent, or $900 million. The Palo Alto, California-based firm, founded in 2011, now manages $2.6 billion in assets.
Wealthfront is part of an emerging group of startups asking people to put the fate of their money in the hands of computers. Along with other Silicon Valley-backed startups such as Betterment and Personal Capital, Wealthfront says its software can manage money better and at a lower cost than emotional, irrational humans.
These startups are now handling a combined $6.7 billion in assets.
The computers have held their own for some investors. "Our performance has met our expectations," a spokesperson for Personal Capital said via email.
Wealthfront said the "average client" can expect in the long run a return of 5.85 percent before taxes. By comparison, the average return on the S&P 500, one of the most widely used benchmarks of the stock market, was 7.6 percent between 2005 and 2014.
Robo-Buffett or the HAL of finance?
To get a sense of how much Silicon Valley thinks robo-advisers can change Wall Street, you have to follow the money.
Venture capitalists are already convinced this is one of the next big consumer trends. They've invested $623 million in computerized-investment startups since 2008, according to venture research firm Tracxn. More than two-thirds of that amount, $439 million, came in the last year and half.
Such funding birthed 18 companies last year and 11 so far this year. These companies offer a range of financial services. Startups like Acorns have a mobile app that will auto-invest spare change after a purchase. Others, like FutureAdvisor and SigFig, monitor investment accounts and recommend changes to your portfolio.
Then there are Wealthfront, Betterment and Personal Capital, all of which tout automated investment services. (Personal Capital considers itself a hybrid because it combines automated tools with humans advisers.) And the venture community is lining up: Each company has raised more than $100 million over the last few years.
Why so much attention?
Matt Harris of Bain Capital Ventures, which has backed SigFig, said investment advisers who work with most people (think anyone who's not the super rich) typically aren't pulling in the best returns.
"Your adviser is probably not a genius," Harris said. "Unless Warren Buffett is managing your money, you're way better off doing a similar algorithmic approach."
"You're only as good as your code, and right now the code isn't writing itself." Christopher Geczy of the Wharton School
Harris and their peers argue that computers are able to offer to the masses the sophisticated investment strategies once reserved for the ultra-rich. Because the companies don't have to pay employees for their work, they can charge customers less.
Even if computers can't do much better than humans, customers still win out, said John Jarve of Menlo Ventures, which has backed Betterment. The average person will "get a higher rate of return on their investments because the fees they're charged will be less," they said.
Someone whose money is managed by a traditional investor will pay more than 1 percent a year in fees, while automated investors such as Betterment and Wealthfront charge about a quarter of that, according to technology research firm Forrester Research. Wealthfront charges nothing for customers with less than $10,000 invested.
Let go, let bot
If a future of computers handling your nest egg freaks you out, then start building a time machine and return to the past. Even old-school investment services such as Charles Schwab and Vanguard have launched robo-investment services.
"Robo-advisers are here to stay," said Christopher Geczy, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, where they teach wealth management.
Still, Geczy sees reasons for humility among Silicon Valley's Wall Street upstarts.
"You're only as good as your code, and right now the code isn't writing itself," they said. "If it were so easy, Silicon Valley would be running hedge funds."

Artist concept of an ExoMars rover. Credit: ESA
After NASA was forced to back out of the joint ExoMars mission with the European Space Agency due to budget constraints, it looked like the exciting rover-orbiter mission might not happen. However, ESA went elsewhere looking for help, and has now announced a tentative cooperative arrangement with Russia's space agency where Roscosmos will provide the two launch vehicles for multi-vehicle European-Russian ExoMars missions in 2016 and 2018.
Plans are for the mission to have an orbiter for launch in 2016, plus an ESA-built rover mission in 2018. Roscosmos will provide Proton rockets for the launches of the two missions, as well as providing an instrument for both the orbiter and the rover as well as overseeing the landing of the rover. The orbiter would study Mars' atmosphere and surface and the six-wheeled vehicle would look for signs of past or present life.
The orbiter would also provide telecommunications for the rover.
Frederic Nordland, ESA's director of international relations, said the agreement would be finalized before the end of the year and that its principal characteristics are already known and accepted by both sides. The announcement was made at a meeting in Naples, Italy this week of ESA's space leaders from the 10 different nations that comprise the organization. The leaders are discussing future objectives and priorities for Europe in space, with the aim of shaping the development of Europe's space capability.
During the meeting, Poland officially joined ESA, becoming the 20th member of the European space organization. It joins the other member states of Austria, Belgium, Britain, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.
ExoMars is now expected to cost ESA about 1.2 billion euros. So far, 850 million euros has been committed by the participating members, but officials remain confident the remaining funds can be raised.
ESA officials also said Russia's Proton rocket might be used to launch Europe's Juice mission to Jupiter in 2022, saving ESA's science program some 170 million euros.

Global internet freedom has declined, as an increasing number of countries introduce online restrictions, US-based organization Freedom House claims. Increased surveillance, new regulatory controls over online media, proliferation of repressive laws, more sophisticated and widespread cyber-attacks all contribute to the decline.
MOSCOW, December 5 (Sputnik), Ekaterina Blinova — Internet freedom is under threat, as an increasing number of countries impose online censorship, according to the latest survey carried out by Freedom House, a US based non-governmental organization.

"Freedom on the Net 2014 — the fifth annual comprehensive study of internet freedom around the globe, covering developments in 65 countries between May 2013 and May 2014 – finds internet freedom around the world in decline for the fourth consecutive year, with 36 out of 65 countries assessed in the report experiencing a negative trajectory during the coverage period," the Freedom House's report reads.
The survey points out that in the past most governments "preferred a behind-the-scenes approach" to web control. However today, more and more states today are adopting new laws regulating use of the Internet, closely observing users' online activities.
"As a result, more people are being arrested for their internet activity than ever before, online media outlets are increasingly pressured to censor themselves or face legal penalties, and private companies are facing new demands to comply with government requests for data or deletions," the NGO reveals.
According to the survey, the reasons behind the steady decline in internet freedom include the proliferation of repressive laws, increased surveillance, new regulatory controls over online media and more sophisticated and widespread cyber-attacks.

Some states, introducing internet censorship, look to the widespread surveillance practice conducted by the US National Security Agency (NSA). Some consider the US intelligence activities as an ideal model, while others are developing measures and tools in order to resist the NSA's global surveillance network.
The American NGO criticizes Russia, Turkey and Ukraine for maintaining government control over online activities and classifies Iran, Syria, and China as "the world's worst abusers of internet freedom overall." It notes that Kazakhstan has passed a law banning "extremist" content, while Vietnam has legalized the suppression of state criticism in social media. However, Freedom House reports certain "improvements" in Belorussia, where the government "eased enforcement of some restrictions" and in Brazil, which has recently passed the Marco Civil da Internet bill. The bill contains provisions regarding "net neutrality" and "privacy protection," the report says.
The Washington Post notes that the United States is also "writing rules about the Internet into law," promoting the idea that there should be clear legal restrictions against access providers violating the principle of net neutrality. According to the "net neutrality" concept, governments and internet providers should not discriminate against internet users, contents, sites, platform and application, treating all data equally.
However, there are voices claiming that internet data should be tightly monitored and managed. The British intelligence apparatus is beating the drums about the fact that the Internet has evidently become "a safe haven for terrorism." Terrorists are using the global web in order to recruit followers, spread extremist teaching and threaten international community. Lee Rigby's atrocity, which could allegedly have been prevented through collaboration between Facebook and UK's MI5 intelligence service, has revived questions about the necessity of governmental control over the Internet.

Coordinator of Government Activity in the (liberated) Territories Maj. Gen. Yoav Mordechai the PA Minister of Civil Affairs Hussein al-Sheikh on Sunday signed the renewal of the Joint Water Committee, as part of the Oslo Accords. The JWC will be entrusted with overhauling the decrepit water infrastructure in the PA, which has been neglected, like many other issues, under the PLO-dominated government.
According to the agreement, the JWC will discuss providing more water to the PA and the Gaza Strip faster, using existing resources and drilling for new ones. The committee will also deal with environmental issues, water tariffs, and water for agricultural use. The new agreement also calls for installing new water and sewage pipes in the PA.

The revived committee will coordinate and supervise water reservoir usage, ahead of the summer months.
The COGAT statement said, “The signing of this water agreement proves that it's possible to reach understandings and agreements when we discuss issues substantively, bilaterally, clean of extraneous issues of natural resources and additional infrastructures that affect the entire population. Over the past year and half, we've signed four agreements: electricity, water, mail and 3G cellular infrastructure, which is intended to improve the quality of life for all the populations in the region.”

Vets, “End the shutdown now”
Julie Wilson
Infowars.com
Oct. 14, 2013
Another group of military veterans is scheduled to arrive in D.C. tomorrow morning to carry out a second protest, demanding lawmakers immediately end the government shutdown.
The protest is being organized by the Military Coalition (TMC), a group of 33 organizations that represents 5.5 million people. Members are comprised of the uniformed services—active, reserve, retired veterans, survivors and their families.
The event is scheduled for Oct. 15, 2013 from 9:45am-11:00am and will begin at the National WWII memorial. Some of the participating organizations include: the Air Force Association, CWOA, US Coast Guard, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, Military Order of the Purple Heart, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the Wounded Warrior Project. Click here for a full list.
The Washington Times reports that TMC wants to let the government know that they need to stop putting servicemen in the “middle of their political games.”
TMC's protest arrives on the heels of the “Million Vet March” that occurred over the weekend attracting thousands of veterans who marched on the National Mall and then on to the White House to peacefully demonstrate their anger over the government shutdown.
Veterans voiced their displeasure for the closing of the memorials as they removed the barricades and carried them to the White House where they stacked them neatly out front.
“This is our way of life. We will not stand by and let the U.S. government dishonor the legacy of sacrifice of the generations before us. It's time to make a stand,” read the Million Vet March's website.
TMC believes in strength in numbers and hopes the rally will grab the attention of lawmakers tomorrow, and put an end to the suffering inflicted on veterans stemming from the government shutdown. Veterans on disability and GI Bill benefits are unsure if they'll receive their next check, and their access to medical care has been severely limited following the rollout of Obamacare.
Families who have lost loved ones in the 13-year hoax known as the “war on terror,” have been denied government death benefits, which are allocated to the families for funeral expenses. Fortunately, non-profit groups stepped up and used their own savings to help military families cover funeral expenses for the fallen soldiers.
Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America began a petition asking Washington to “keep veterans our of their political nonsense.” Click here to support the cause.
The country is growing increasingly agitated as the government shutdown enters its second week. A computer glitch over the weekend spurred “mini riots” after food stamps holders exploited temporary unlimited credit balances. Food stamp holders ransacked Wal-mart stores in several cities, attempting to purchase food with balances that didn't exist, prompting some managers to close their stores.

Avec un surprenant talent de conteur et une érudition ébouriffante, Jean-Luc Mélenchon se penche sur l'Histoire dans trois entretiens vidéo avec le journaliste Jean-Pierre Bédéï (Herodote.net)..
Il raconte Philippe le Bel et les débuts de la laïcité, Louis XI et la formation de l'État, Robespierre et la Terreur révolutionnaire. Il tire pour nous les enseignements de ces épisodes majeurs de notre Histoire et nous dit en quoi la connaissance de l'Histoire est essentielle aux hommes d'État.
Homme politique classé à gauche de la gauche, lui-même tient son goût pour l'Histoire d'abord de l'apprentissage du latin, de la découverte de la Rome antique et du récit par Tite-Live des guerres puniques. Ensuite d'une relation sentimentale à l'adolescence qui a donné lieu à un échange de livres : un recueil de poèmes contre l'Histoire de la Révolution française d'Adolphe Thiers. Bien qu'écrit par un homme d'ordre, cet ouvrage lui a mis en lumière les « gestes héroïques du peuple ».
Philippe le Bel et les débuts de la laïcité
En 1301 a lieu la première bataille entre l'Église et l'État, sur une question fiscale. Le pape Boniface VIII est désavoué par le roi Philippe Le Bel et son légiste Guillaume Nogaret. Le roi l'emporte à l'issue de l'épisode de la « gifle d'Anagni ». « Je suis roi par la volonté de Dieu », dixit Philippe Le Bel.
Des guerres de religion, deux siècles plus tard, Jean-Luc Mélenchon garde le souvenir ému de Marie Durand, protestante, emmurée près de 40 ans avec une trentaine d'autres femmes, qui nous a laissé une inscription gravée sur la margelle du puits de sa prison : « Résister ».
Louis XI et la formation de l'État
La laïcité répond à une impasse, l'impossibilité d'éliminer tous les protestants. Elle est un phénomène profond constitutif de l'État, ancrée dans l'Histoire de la France et la diversité de son peuple : « Nous sommes tous semblables malgré nos différences. »
Jean-Luc Mélenchon se voit quelques similitudes avec Louis XI. Peu soucieux des apparences mais fin stratège, le roi défend envers et contre tout sa vision de l'État. Le pouvoir doit s'exercer au service de l'État et de l'action publique, dans l'intérêt du peuple.
Louis XI l'emporte par la ruse sur son rival, le flamboyant Charles le Téméraire. Il ne se laisse pas arrêter par l'amour propre, la vanité et l'orgueil, à la différence des dirigeants ordinaires.
Robespierre et la Terreur
En 1792, Robespierre, que Jean-Luc Mélenchon juge visionnaire, pragmatique et de bon sens, se montre hostile à la guerre car il devine qu'elle sera longue et risque d'amener un militaire au pouvoir. Les Girondins, au contraire, y sont favorables, car ils escomptent une défaite et donc des négociations !
La Terreur ? Jean-Luc Mélenchon, qui se veut « robespierriste », a beau jeu de rappeler que c'est Danton qui invente le Tribunal révolutionnaire pour éviter le retour des massacres de septembre 1792. Et les fous furieux les plus engagés dans la Terreur, comme Carrier à Nantes et Fouché à Lyon, figurent parmi les Thermidoriens qui auront la peau de Robespierre…
Pris en défaut à l'assemblée après une nuit blanche, Robespierre est mis hors-la-loi. À ses partisans qui lui suggèrent de reprendre le pouvoir, il répond : « Au nom de qui ? » Car, en bon avocat, il ne saurait violer la légalité républicaine… Robespierre a été adulé par le peuple car incorruptible.
Résonance avec l'époque actuelle
De l'Histoire, Jean-Luc Mélenchon retient qu'il est impossible de vivre autrement que dans un État laïc : « Ce qui nous unifie, c'est l'État ». Il souligne aussi l'action méconnue du peuple. Pas de grandes choses sans l'appui du grand nombre. « Le peuple est acteur de l'Histoire ».

'No Hindi, no prime ministership': Pranab Mukherjee on why they didn't become PM
India
oi-Oneindia

Pranab Mukherjee reveals why they were not made Prime Minister | Oneindia News
New Delhi, Oct 14: Probably, the question as to why Pranab Mukherjee was never made the Prime Minister of the country by Congress president Sonia Gandhi back in 2004 after the party's handsome win in the Lok Sabha elections, instead decided to give the coveted chair to the unlikely man Manmohan Singh, would never fail to elicit various responses in the political circle.
On Friday, during the release of Mukherjee's new book, the third volume of their autobiography, The Coalition Years: 1996-2012, their long-time colleague from the Congress and former PM Singh to everyone's surprise stated that the former President was more qualified to become PM than him.
However, Mukherjee, who was also the country's Union minister on several occasions and one of the country's tallest political personalities, had a different take on the entire matter, which is generally not discussed openly by the members of the grand old party.
The former President said that it was their lack of grasp on Hindi and their long tenure in the Rajya Sabha which "disqualified" them to become the country's PM.
In an exclusive interview to India Today, Mukherjee rejected the idea that they were "disappointed" when Singh was made the PM, instead of them by Gandhi.
"Not disappointed, because I considered myself disqualified from ever being the Prime Minister of India. One disqualification was that, for most part of my career, I was always in the Rajya Sabha. Only in 2004 did I win a seat to the Lok Sabha.
"Second, though I was elected to the Lok Sabha, I did not know Hindi. And without knowing Hindi, nobody should venture to be the PM of India. Kamaraj said that once- 'No Hindi, no prime ministership'," Mukherjee said.
"My honest assessment at the time was that Manmohan was the best choice. Over time, they had understood administrative and political nuances. They had vast administrative experience and was well-versed in economic affairs. They have always been a man of the highest integrity. He's widely respected across the world as an economist of repute," they added.
Singh said on Friday that Mukherjee was right to feel upset when Congress president Gandhi sidelined them and named Singh as head of the UPA government in 2004.
"In 2004, Sonia ji chose me to be the Prime Minister. Pranab ji was the most distinguished colleague that I had. They had every reason to feel a grievance, that they were better qualified than I was to be PM but they also knew I had no choice in the matter," Singh said.
Singh added while their entry into politics was "accidental", Mukherjee was a politician by choice and is one of the greatest politicians living in our country.
Singh told the audience at the book launch event that both they and Mukherjee always shared a healthy working relationship.

Wong, who grew up working in the family grocery, is shown surfing in Tahiti. They now run their own business, Chino Surfboards.
Correction: Because of a reporting error, an earlier version of this story failed to note that several quotes from surfboard maker Jonathan Wong were taken from comments they made in a documentary film about them called El Chino by Max Esposito.
At 36, Jonathan Wong has put in years at their family's grocery store in Chinatown, cutting vegetables at 13, chopping fish at 16, and then driving a truck at 18, picking up produce at the break of dawn.
“Chinese culture is work hard, get paid,” Wong said in a documentary about their life, “El Chino” made by Max Esposito and Saade Barbar. “The whole 40-hour- week thing is an American attitude. There's no such thing as overtime in Chinatown.”
The Wong family operates one of the oldest Chinese grocers in the state, tucked away on a narrow one-way street where the air smells of raw fish and the noise — from traffic, conversation, and construction — seems nearly constant. Facing the same life of mundane repetition stacking produce and seafood as their father, Wong embarked on an altogether different second career: making custom surfboards for the burgeoning surf culture in New England.

“When you retire and you get older and people are like, ‘Hey, what did you do your whole life?' ” Wong said in the documentary, “you want to say, ‘I stacked boxes my whole life,' or you wanna' go, ‘Oh, I made surfboards my whole life — got to travel around the world, meet people, hang out. And I got paid doing it.' ”
Harrison Hill for the Boston Globe Jonathan Wong worked on a board in their Chinatown workshop.

Wong first caught the surfing bug at 15, and for years rented boards or fixed up old ones before wanting their own custom board. Unable to find a maker in Boston, they started tooling their own. Over the years what was a sideline hobby has snowballed into a full-blown business, christened Chino Surfboards after their nickname. With support and cautionary advice from their father, they stopped working full time at the family grocery, and last year built 60 custom surfboards that sold from $500 to $1,500 each, and repaired at least 100 for customers.
Though for a niche sport, retail sales of surfing goods have been steadily increasing, to $787 million in 2013, according to the Surf Industry Manufacturers Association. With the nation's surfing scene focused on the West Coast, Chino is among the few board makers in New England.
Chino is located on the top floor of the nondescript five-story building where their great-grandfather started the family store, Sun Sun Co., in 1934, reached by a rickety elevator and past mountains of storage boxes filled with Chinese antiques, chopsticks, and ramen noodles. It's a messy — and loud — business, with Wong blaring Pearl Jam and Sublime as they sculpt blocks of foam to suit the subtle dynamics a board needs to cut through rolling water. Each board receives a layer of fiberglass and coats of resin and a finish that needs sanding and polishing.
Harrison Hill for the Boston Globe Jonathan Wong looked over items in their family's shop, Sun Sun, in Chinatown.
Wong's unconventional story has circulated among the surfing clique, helped along by the El Chino documentary, which won an award at the San Diego Surf Film Festival in May. They receive calls from aspiring builders who want to be interns, businesses that want surfboards as decorations, surf clubs and camps in faraway places like Taiwan and Costa Rica looking to network, and even TripAdvisor, which wanted to inspire its employees with the documentary about Chino.

He's made boards for their friend Sam Lorusso Jr. for five years, who said that Wong has designed surfboards perfectly suited for the smaller, less powerful waves found in New England.
“A lot of other shapers make high-performance boards for high-powered waves,” Lorusso said. “He knows how to make the types of boards for the conditions we normally surf in. They understand what the board needs and they understand my capabilities and they put it into a surfboard.”

Wong said the surfing part of their life has been just as rewarding, despite occasional bracing conditions. He's braved winter mornings with frozen hair and numb feet, the temperature dipping to 10 degrees and their wife pouring hot water down their icy wetsuit so they could catch the best waves of the season. He's crashed on friends' couches in Maine and New Hampshire, appeared at surf festivals in New Jersey and Rhode Island, and hosted loud parties in their Chinatown shop.
“I think I've lived a lot more lives than regular people who have regular jobs. I feel lucky,” Wong is quoted in “El Chino.” “Surfing is an escape from reality. To get away from everybody. To get away from the hectic world of living.”
The world reeled Wong back in when their father, Warren Wong, died of liver cancer at age 61 in May. Wong is back downstairs in the grocery, working the aisles of roasted seaweed, lychees, dragonfruit, and Chinese candies, making the dawn run for produce and working as much as 65 hours a week.

The surfing life and second career are on hold for now. They had dreams of growing the business, maybe hiring employees, but for now he's not taking new requests for surfboards and is extending the build time for the boards he's making for loyal customers. Between the surf shop, the grocery store, and family, Wong is still sorting out the balance.
“I have to choose which one is more important. I really haven't made a choice yet,” Wong said. “I need to figure that out.”
Harrison Hill for the Boston Globe Jonathan Wong, along with their daughter, Christine, attended the annual Surf Fest at Fort Adams State Park in Newport, R.I., earlier this month.

“The statue had been vandalized before, at least once, maybe twice,” they said. “It's always Jesus' head that goes missing. Probably because it's smaller and easier to break off.” In the past, parishioners always found the head nearby and were able to reattach it. “This time we looked high and low. No head. No Jesus.” Lajeunesse went to several businesses to see if a replacement head could be built.
“It has to be custom made. And nobody even wanted to consider it,” they said. Replacing the entire statue would cost between $6,000 and $10,000. “You wonder, if we do replace it with a new one, will we be up against the same situation?” Lajeunesse said, noting the head's reputation for going missing.
That's when a local artist knocked on Lajeunesse's door, asking about the statue. “She was quite upset about it and they offered to do something if they could,” Lajeunesse said.
It might have been delayed, but winter has certainly arrived in the Washington region. Forecasts show temperatures freezing temperatures persisting throughout the week. The area could see its first major winter storm of the season starting Friday.

And then there were two. We are down to two unbeaten sides, can they keep it going? Here are my predictions for round 5 of the Super Rugby.
First here is a link to my review of the round 4 action.
How did the predictions go last week?
3 from 6, even with a couple of big upsets it was a poor return.
BTW I was asked to include my points difference predictions, so here we go but you'll find I'm on the conservative side mostly. Well I think I am anyway….
Hurricanes v Blues
The Hurricanes have got their big overseas trip out of the way early and it was very successful with 3 wins and a try bonus point. They are one of only two teams that remain unbeaten and a win here would put them top of the table, even if only temporarily.
The Blues have exactly the opposite problem, 4 losses from 4 but at least they also have got their trip over to South Africa out of the way. Last weekend was a horror show when they were unable to break down the Lions and lost to probably the weakest team in the competition. This week they aren't going to get anywhere near the same amount of possession or territory and I can't see them being able to resist the Canes back line.
Hurricanes by 10 points
Force v Rebels
The Force have shown a bit more this season, last weekend they were chasing the game and made a fist of it even if they didn't really get close. The Rebels have got at least a point out of every game this season so this one should be close. Having had a weekend off last week you have to hope that it hasn't hurt their momentum. Still in this battle of the basement dwellers I'm going with the home side.
Force by 3 points
Crusaders v Lions
The Lions did get a rare win on the road last weekend but that was against a poor Blues side. They will again tackle their hearts out but against a better quality of opposition that shouldn't be enough. Crusaders should get much need moral boosting win but they haven't clicked yet and aren't being helped by the gradual introduction of All Blacks. Still at home they should have too much quality for the Lions.
Crusaders by 10 points
Highlanders v Waratahs
The Highlanders will be on a high after a great upset win on the road last weekend. Let's hope that they can keep up their performance and not suffer a hangover which can so easily happen. There will have been a lot of mental energy used up last weekend but they have a number of All Blacks in there now who will be able to lift their teammates. The Tahs come off the back of an easy win over the Reds but the champs have been a bit off colour before then. For me this one could go either way but the Highlanders have some form and so I'm going for a close home win.
Highlanders by 3 points
Reds v Brumbies
The Reds have quality players but from the outside it appears they have no confidence in the coach and the whole Hunt issue can't have helped. The Brumbies are a form team on a roll and should roll over the Reds fairly comfortably this weekend. With the quality that is there in these teams there could be some great running rugby to watch so definitely one for the neutral.
Brumbies by 10 points
Stormers v Chiefs
The tie of the round, Stormers didn't perform that well last weekend but errors by the Sharks let them get away with it. Against the Chiefs that won't be allowed. The Chiefs obviously had that lost last weekend where Cruden had a nightmare with the kicking. They Will need to show that is a one off for their RWC aspirations. However the Chiefs have other injury issues and have been restricted by the 28-man touring squad limit. So with these artificial impediments against a form team and being away, I think it's a Stormers win.
Stormers by 5 points
Cheetahs v Sharks
Can the Cheetahs do the double over the Sharks? To be even able to ask that question at this point of the season shows what a convoluted season Super Rugby is. Anyway you have to play by the rules set. The Cheetahs old boy beat the Cheetahs new boys last weekend and that will have been an example of how to go about it. The Sharks have not got the results but the performances have improved and as long as they cut errors should avenge the early season loss.
Sharks by 3 points
AT&T killed its unlimited Internet data plan earlier this year, and now there is buzz Verizon may be following suit.
Engadget writes,
AT&T and Verizon tend to follow each other's moves pretty closely -- the two carriers regard each other as their nearest competitors, after all -- and we're hearing that Big Red intends to move to some sort of tiered bucket strategy on July 29.
There's no word on what the plan might cost, or what different tiered plans would be available.
In a January 2010 interview with the Washington Post, Verizon CTO Dick Lynch hinted that the death of unlimited data plans could be on the horizon.
“The problem we have today with flat-based usage is that you are trying to encourage customers to be efficient in use and applications but you are getting some people who are bandwidth hogs using gigabytes a month and they are paying something like megabytes a month,” they said, adding, “That isn't long-term sustainable. Why should customers using an average amount of bandwidth be subsidizing bandwidth hogs?"
Now, with the release of the Droid X, it seems Verizon has a new crop of even bigger "bandwidth hogs" to worry about: Thursday, Verizon revealed that early data shows the new Droid X is using five times the data of "any other device."
The World Fair Trade Organization declared “World Fair Trade Week” in mid-November to draw attention to and improve the plight of (mostly agricultural) workers worldwide. The fair-trade movement is an attempt, at root, to encourage consumers in developed countries to pay more for certain products to help lift the people who produce them out of poverty. This happens through better prices and access to financial markets for sellers, and through contracts that smooth short-term price fluctuations, helping producers plan for the future.
Economists are a rather fractious bunch much of the time, but are in near-unanimous agreement regarding the benefits of free trade. When one person voluntarily exchanges with another, both walk away better off. And if those two people specialize their labor, each producing what their skills or circumstances make them better at producing, both become better off still. Best of all, free trade doesn't require government involvement. In the end, everyone who plays, wins. Economists are not nearly as sanguine about fair trade, and this is largely because it is not clear what benefits fair trade brings that free trade doesn't already provide.
Those concerned with the poor will point to trade as a tool for bringing people out of poverty, which it is. But fair trade doesn't offer anything new here, and might even introduce difficulties. Studies show workers in the coffee industry — which has the largest number of producers and workers affected by fair-trade policies — receive little to no benefit for the higher prices fair trade makes possible. In Costa Rica and Nicaragua, fair-trade farmers indeed receive higher prices for their coffee, but their workers are paid minimum wage with no health or retirement benefits. A direct comparison of fair-trade-certified coffee farmers to conventional coffee farmers in Oaxaca, Mexico, reveals fair-trade-certified farmers receive a price 130 percent higher than that received by conventional farmers. Workers at fair-trade farms, however, are paid only 7 percent more. At least where coffee is concerned, fair trade appears to put the lion's share of the extra money in business owners' pockets. And where fair-trade certification is costly to obtain, the actual effect is to create cartels.
The good news is that fair-trade certification requires that workers have freedom of association, safe working conditions, and not be forced to work. But even here, the benefits aren't different from what one could attain simply with free trade.
In the end, the benefits of fair trade are actually benefits of free trade. This is made clear by the fact that the entire process is voluntary. Producers, importers and exporters think it is in their best interest to achieve the fair-trade label, and consumers think it is in theirs to support those who do. Concern with social justice is one reason among many to choose one product over another, and if producers want to advertise their bona fides, they should be able to do so. But the greatest contribution fair trade offers are to encourage people to engage in free trade.

4 cops, 1 fitness trainer and the glowstick that sparked an Ultra Fest beatdown
A New Yorker who had a confrontation with Miami cops outside the 2011 Ultra Music Festival has sued the city and 4 officers.
BY JAY WEAVER
jweaver@MiamiHerald.com
In late March 2011, New Yorker Jesse Campodonico and their girlfriend flew down to Miami for a wild weekend at the Ultra Music Festival at Bicentennial Park — but they never got past the entrance.
A private security guard stopped them because the girlfriend, Crystal Iglesias, was holding a glow stick in their hand.
Within seconds, Miami police officer Nathaniel Dauphin told the couple that Iglesias couldn't enter, setting off a violent confrontation between Campodonico and a group of Miami police officers working an off-duty detail at the electronic music fest.
They claim the officers beat them up, choked him, threw them to the ground and tasered them three times — the last time directly into their back while they were lying face down — according to a lawsuit filed in Miami federal court.
All over a glow stick, which is as common to the Ultra Fest as a kid bringing a baseball mitt to a ballgame.
Campodonico, who was charged with battery but eventually cleared, claims Dauphin and fellow officers Harold James, Edward Lugo and Javier Ortiz brutalized them and that Ortiz, a sergeant, lied on an internal report to justify the arrest and use of force.
“There was nothing I could do but try to survive,” Campodonico, a buff, 27-year-old fitness trainer, told The Miami Herald. “I was trying to cover myself. There was no fighting back. It was just me trying to protect myself from them killing me.”
But the officers gave an entirely different account, stating in an internal report that Campodonico punched, bit and kicked them while officer James tasered Campodonico to subdue him.
What sets Campodonico's police brutality lawsuit apart from others is that Dauphin and James were recently revealed to be dirty cops, after being caught up in an FBI undercover investigation. Both officers pleaded guilty to extortion charges after admitting they took cash payments in exchange for providing protection for a Liberty City sports-betting ring in Dauphin's case, and a check-cashing store, in James's case.
As for Ortiz, a sergeant, they were recently elected president of the Fraternal Order of Police union after serving as its vice president.
A bystander video-recorded the Ultra Music confrontation on March 25, 2011, the first night of the weekend event, on a cell phone and posted it on the Internet. The video is dark and distant, and doesn't capture the entire event, making it difficult to see how the confrontation started and exactly what transpired. It does show an officer tasering Campodonico while they were face-down and their body inches from the ground.
On the video, audio captured a man criticizing the officers' actions. They can be heard saying, “That's f—ed up. That's f—ed up.” A school teacher standing nearby yelled, “They're going to kill him,” before they rushed in to help Campodonico, according to their deposition in the state battery case.
Ortiz and Lugo deny any misconduct, saying through their FOP attorney that the suit is “nonsense.”
“It costs $300 to file a lawsuit,” FOP attorney Ronald Cohen said. “But it takes evidence to prove it. We look forward to complete vindication for these fine officers.”
Dauphin and James, who are both free while awaiting sentencing, could not be reached for comment. The city of Miami, also a defendant in the civil suit, declined to comment in an email.
A prosecutor for the Miami-Dade state attorney's office dropped the charges against Campodonico, after concluding the video showed they were defenseless while being tasered. The prosecutor's findings jibe with many of the assertions in Campodonico's suit.
“Although of poor quality (i.e., dark and relatively distant), it does show the defendant on the ground when the zaps of the Taser are heard,” Assistant State Attorney Cristina Rivera wrote in a March closeout memo.
They also noted that the police officers' sworn depositions in the criminal case were “inconsistent” with their statements in the internal report, written by Ortiz.
For example, the prosecutor found that in a deposition, officer Lugo said they did not see Campodonico punch Dauphin, yet in Ortiz's report Lugo said they saw the defendant punch Dauphin in the chest. Also in their deposition, Lugo said they didn't hear James warn Campodonico, “Taser discharge!” Yet in Ortiz's report, Lugo said they did hear James yell that out.
“I subpoenaed all officers, including Sgt. Ortiz, to my office on at least three separate occasions; each time, each officer failed to appear,” Rivera wrote. “I finally got a hold of Sgt. Ortiz via phone and spoke to them about the discrepancies and the futileness in attempting to correct them at trial.”
They further noted that Campodonico's criminal defense attorney, Scott Srebnick, was “so bothered by the circumstances surrounding this case” that they contacted prosecutor Jose Arrojo, a senior aide to State Attorney Katherine Fernández Rundle, via email “to suggest taking actions against the officers involved.”
Srebnick said the state attorney's office confirmed receiving their email, but never got back to him. A spokesperson for the office did not answer a reporter's question about what action, if any, Arrojo took.
Srebnick filed suit in November against the officers along with the city of Miami, alleging excessive force, battery, malicious prosecution, false imprisonment and negligence.  They are seeking unspecified damages.
“Ortiz fabricated the police statements after taking one from all seven cops at the scene that night,” Srebnick asserted in an interview. “He doctored them all to sound alike.''
Srebnick called Ortiz's official account — a “response to resistance” report required by the police department because a Taser was deployed — a “cover-up.”
In the suit, Srebnick asserted the city was well aware that all four officers named as defendants had a history of complaints, including being investigated for alleged excessive force by either internal affairs or the city's Civilian Investigative Panel, an oversight agency. The CIP had placed all of the officers but James on its “monitoring list,” according to the suit.
Cohen, the attorney for Ortiz and Lugo, said the officers were simply trying to restrain a violent person who assaulted them.
“Force was used in subduing Mr. Campodonico, but the only force that was used was that which was necessary to place Mr. Campodonico under arrest,” Cohen said. “Several officers were injured during the course of the arrest, including Sgt. Ortiz.”
No complaints of abusive treatment or false arrest have ever been sustained against Ortiz and Lugo, they added.
Campodonico and their attorney say they don't put a lot of faith in police disciplinary reviews, particularly when it comes to Ortiz, because they are the union president.
Photographs taken after the confrontation by a Miami police crime-scene investigator show Campodonico sustained blows to their face, along with cuts on their hairline, back, knees and elbow.
“Once they had me in cuffs, they walked me away” to a makeshift police unit near the entrance to the music festival off Biscayne Boulevard, said Campodonico, whose girlfriend was also charged but eventually cleared. “They threw me to the floor and hit me. They said, ‘Welcome to Miami, bitch.' ''
“It's about time someone called them on it,” they said. “They need to learn a lesson so it doesn't happen again.”
If you look at the scorecard when today's action is all said and done, you'll see that Phil Mickelson parred the second hole. That doesn't really begin to tell the story.
Mickelson absolutely bombed their tee shot on the par 5, sending it 376 yards and leaving themselves just 199 yards to the pin. Up and down for an eagle, certainly not out of the question. He'd put their approach in the sand, however, and their bunker shot was a competent-if-unspectacular save that gave them a short putt for birdie.
Then this happened:
That? That is as wretched as luck can get. We're not even particularly positive what that thing is, much less how it got into Mickelson's line right as they started their backstroke. The announcers ended up speculating that it was pine straw and that it might have been flicked by somebody in the gallery. That seems completely implausible for any number of reasons, but watch that video again. Plausible ain't here.
So, conspiracy theories start here. It couldn't have come from a tree--there aren't any around the hole for about 50 yards, and the angle at which it hit is way too sharp for such a windless day. So what's your idea for how this happened? Our sleeper possibility: Phil Mickelson, self-saboteur.
The unpleasant "cleaning out" process required before undergoing that test we all love to hate just got a whole lot easier to swallow. A Mayo Clinic in Phoenix now requires patients to take just four pills instead of two or more liters of laxatives when getting a virtual colonoscopy.
Taking four pills of the laxative bisacodyl is a vast upgrade for anyone who's had the (dis)pleasure of downing liters of the extra-strength laxatives previously used to eliminate all waste from your gut. These tablets still leave the virtual colonoscopy's probe-assisted CT scan clear to search for any pre-cancerous polyps or other diseases potentially lying in wait in your colon and rectum.
It's an improvement that may encourage more post 50s to get virtual colonoscopies, now that one of the most unpleasant parts of the process has been eliminated, said Dr. C. Daniel Johnson, chair of the department of radiology at Mayo Clinic in Arizona.
"Our hope is that this will make people less anxious and more likely to get screened and will ultimately result in fewer deaths from colorectal cancer," Johnson noted in a press release.
When you need to join a machine to the Active Directory It is a pretty straight forward task using either the User Interface or the PowerShell cmdlet available for that usage.
However in some situation you don't have network connectivity and need to rely on Offline Domain Join, using the Djoin.exe tool. Typically you use djoin in two phases. First you generate a provisioning file that you drop on a newly deployed machine. In the second phase you run djoin with the file as a parameter and the machine is joined to the domain without connection to the domain controller.
My problem Using that same method, I recently had a tricky problem to solve. The environment where I was performing this was very locked down, not allowing me to copy files to the new provisioned machine.
Fortunately the system handling the deployment could perform action on other systems and gather data. I could rely on something like System Center Orchestrator (or SMA) and get the content of the Blob file over HTTP/HTTPS by invoking a runbook.
Recreating the djoin file with the content was a bit trickier. Djoin is really picky on how the file is created. (see here and here for more information)
Using Djoin Djoin comes with Windows Client and Server since Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 installation. Djoin requires administrator privileges, you have to use the tool on an elevated command prompt. Of course, you also need an account that has sufficient rights to create domain computer accounts.
1 - First, Run Djoin.exe to provision the computer account metadata. When you run the provisioning command, the computer account metadata is created in a blob .txt file that you specify as part of the command.
Example: djoin /provision /domain fx.lab /machine testdjoin01 /savefile provisioning.txt
2 - This blob then has to be copied on the machine and used to offline domain join the Windows machine.
Example: djoin /requestODJ /loadfile provisionning.txt /windowspath %SystemRoot% /localos
Here is what we see when we open the output file (provisionning.txt)
And here in a hexadecimal editor, you can see it is an unicode base64 encoded string by the two first bytes “FF FE”.
Copying the content of the blob to another file
Creating a copy of the file is easy, even copying the content on the same machine and dumping it in another file works, djoin will accept those files.
Get-Content -path provisionning.txt -Encoding Unicode | Set-Content -path newfile.txt -Encoding Unicode
Recreating the djoin blob file from the content
Using Djoin with the same parameters we used to create the blob earlier, we will add the parameter /PRINTBLOB which will output the Blob to the console.
The output can then be stored in a Variable and parse to retrieve only the Blob:
# Store the djoin $djoin = djoin /provision /domain fx.lab /machine testdjoin02 /savefile provisioning /printblob # Get the blob $djoin [ 12]
Next, this string can be passed across the network using tools such as System Center Orchestrator (SCORCH) or Service Management Automation (SMA). (I won't demonstrate this part in this post)
Finally, on the new deployed machine, we can recreate the Blob file using New-DjoinFile, function available On Github.
# Blob generated $Blob = "Blob generated previously on the domain machine>" # Recreate djoin file New-DjoinFile -Blob $blob -DestinationFile $home \desktop\blob.txt -Verbose
You can now use Djoin.exe with the file blob.txt to join your new machine to the domain:
Download the function from Github.
Now if you compare the file generated by djoin.exe and the one recreated by New-DjoinFile , you should get the same content, byte by byte.
Original File:
File created with New-DjoinFile

The Romney campaign blasted the president Thursday for looming cuts to defense spending. But they failed to mention - until they were reminded - that the cuts are required by last summer's congressional deal to cut spending in exchange for increasing the federal debt ceiling.
The blast happened on a Romney campaign conference call this morning meant to "welcome" President Obama to Virginia when they visit the state on Friday. Campaign surrogate and former Missouri senator Jim Talent was joined by Virginia representative J. Randy Forbes and former Navy secretary John Lehman in taking the president to task for cuts to defense and explaining how that will hurt Virginia. Talent called the cuts, set in motion by Congress's failure to strike a bipartisan deal during the Supercommitte's deficit reduction negotiations, the "most irresponsible thing a commander-in-chief has done."
The cuts are mandated by the Budget Control Act, which was signed into law last August by President Obama in exchange for a $2.4 trillion increase to the debt limit. House Speaker John Boehner had insisted that any increase to the debt limit be matched dollar-for-dollar in spending cuts and reforms, but as the federal government ran critically low on cash, Congress had only agreed to about $1.2 trillion in savings. Still, the debt limit was increased under an agreement where a "Supercommittee" would negotiate an additional $1.2 trillion in savings, or face sequestration (ie, automatic cuts). After the committee failed to strike a deal, the country was left with the sequestration.

The Obama administration, including Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, have warned what the cuts would mean for the military, but Romney has also hit the president over the cuts on the campaign trail. The cuts would mean about $500 billion to defense and about $500 billion to entitlements or social programs.
Forbes said the president will visit Virginia tomorrow with a "huge box of pink slips" for defense contractors and military personnel in the state.
Lehman said he's been in the service since 1964 and never seen anything "quite as irresponsible," adding they don't think the president did it out of "malice, necessarily."
"The president doesn't understand defense, doesn't understand how it works," Lehman said.
When Talent was asked about Congress' approving the measures and setting the process in motion, they again blamed the president.
"I can just tell you that the president is the commander-in-chief and Congress takes its lead from him," Talent said.
Forbes added that they did not vote for the cuts and they will be "catastrophic to the national security, catastrophic to the economic security."
Talent was also asked if Romney has been "sufficiently transparent" with their financial disclosures as well as their "personal holdings and assets" or if you should release additional tax returns as Democrats are calling them to.
Talent repeated the campaign talking point, calling the issue a distraction and "desperate."
"I think at a time when the nation's suffering through unemployment above 8 percent for longer than since the Great Depression - and would be higher than that if it were not for all the people who just got so discouraged that they just quit looking for work - this attempt at the White House to shift attention from the real issues of the campaign is getting to the point of being desperate," Talent said. "Gov. Romney has released their 2010 tax returns, their estimate for 2011. They will release the rest of it when it's available and he's going to continue to talk about the issues that matter to the American people."
ABC News' John Parkinson contributed to this report.
There's been an interesting shift in the psychological profession when it comes to video games. For a while, the only time you'd ever see a psychologist comment publicly about video games was in the context of blaming violent ones for all manner of societal ills — most famously, for school shootings. This has helped build the argument, in the public eye and among government regulators all around the world, that there is an intimate link between the consumption of these games and young gamers' propensity for committing all manner of terrible acts.
This view still abounds, but in recent years a more nuanced understanding has gradually taken hold. Many researchers have begun to doubt some of the more overheated claims about the effects of video games on behavior, and to push back against the idea that gaming has unleashed some sort of mass pathology on the nation's youth.
In their new book Moral Combat: Why the War on Violent Video Games Is Wrong , the psychologists Dungeons & Dragons and so forth — and argue that it's time to take a more reasoned, evidence-based approach in light of what they see as a paucity of evidence for links between playing violent video games (or consuming other forms of violent media, for that manner) and engaging in violent real-world behavior. In their new book, the psychologists Patrick Markey and Christopher Ferguson , who teach at Villanova University and Stetson University, respectively, offer one of the most assertive yet expert takes on why society should relax, at least a little, with regard to violent video games. Markey and Ferguson describe the concern over violent video games as just another youth-oriented moral panic in a long line of them — think comic books and naughty music andDungeons & Dragonsand so forth — and argue that it's time to take a more reasoned, evidence-based approach in light of what they see as a paucity of evidence for links between playing violent video games (or consuming other forms of violent media, for that manner) and engaging in violent real-world behavior.
An article Markey published with some other researchers in Human Communication Research in 2015 makes this point nicely . The authors offer numerous rather convincing examples of psychologists making claims about the link between video games and violence that appear to be overbroad and sensationalistic — in both their published research and media interviews alike. One prominent researcher, for example, has repeatedly compared the potency of this link to that of the link between smoking and lung cancer. In a book chapter, two other researchers falsely claimed that video games allow players to practice “to decide whom to kill, get a weapon, get ammunition, load the weapon, stalk the victim, aim the weapon, and pull the trigger” — anyone who has played a first-person shooter knows this is false. After the Sandy Hook massacre, yet another wrote an editorial arguing that “[t]here is no division in the scientific community” about the link between violent video games and aggression.

There is division, though. And in a sense, Markey and Ferguson are still at odds with the “official” position of their own profession. The American Psychological Association, after all, has long maintained that there is such a link — as recently as 2015, the APA Moral Combat can help set the record straight. There is division, though. And in a sense, Markey and Ferguson are still at odds with the “official” position of their own profession. The American Psychological Association, after all, has long maintained that there is such a link — as recently as 2015, the APA released a task-force report which stated that there is a “consistent relation between violent video game use and increases in aggressive behavior, aggressive cognitions and aggressive affect, and decreases in prosocial behavior, empathy and sensitivity to aggression.” Markey, Ferguson, and other researchers complained that the task force, first announced in 2013, was stacked with anti-video-game researchers — Ferguson themselves was one of the few exceptions — and therefore weren't surprised that it came to the conclusions it did. “When I pointed out the lack of balance to the APA,” Ferguson explained in an email, “the only real thing they did was, in subsequent emails, they used blind carbon copy, so we couldn't see who else got the emails at all. So much for transparency!” So from they and Markey's point of view,can help set the record straight.

In an email interview with Science of Us, Ferguson talked more about Moral Combat 's argument, explained why video games are such an endless fixation on the part of parents and authorities, and offered some advice to parents who want to better understand their children's video-game hobbies without giving in to fearmongering. An edited transcript is below.
One phrase that jumps out from the book is the “Grand Theft Fallacy.” Could you explain what it is and why people are so endlessly susceptible to it?
The Grand Theft Fallacy comes when people try to spuriously connect high-profile violent crimes, particularly by young males, to video games. It's a good example of confirmation bias, where people are looking for information that fits with their preconceived biases, and not engaging in critical thinking. On the most basic level, people may hear about a young male committing a crime and think, “I bet they played violent video games!” When it comes out that, sure enough, at least once, like ever, they played a violent video game, people treat it as a divine revelation. People forget that almost all young males play violent video games at least occasionally, and the fact that young offenders do isn't really very discriminatory.
Probably the most blatant example of this in recent memory was the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting. The official investigation was sealed until nearly a year later, but that didn't stop multiple news outlets from speculating that Adam Lanza might have been “obsessed” with violent video games. There seemed to be all kinds of anonymous sources, supposedly close to the investigation, claiming they racked up thousands of hours on shooter games, and learned to swap out half-full magazines for their rifle before entering rooms, as gamers often do in shooter games. Of course, even if they had been an avid shooter-game player, that wouldn't have distinguished them from millions of other young males. But, ultimately, the official investigation report revealed that, although they had a few long-outdated action games in their house, they spent most of their time playing Dance Dance Revolution and other nonviolent video games. The Sandy Hook shooter wasn't much of a shooter gamer at all. I've always been curious who those “anonymous sources” were, as they clearly didn't know much about the actual investigation. But Sandy Hook was a great example of a moral panic in process … people rushing to blame games and even call for anti-game legislation before we even knew if the shooter played violent games much at all.
What other sorts of cognitive biases affect the national discourse about video games?
Well, there have been a number of studies now, with the general public, with clinicians and with scholars that all show the same thing — old people don't like video games! But it's really not age, it's more experience with games. Curiously, we also find consistently that people who don't like teens very much are also the people most likely to believe that games are harmful. So there seems to be a certain “kids today with their music and their hair” effect going on, even among scholars.

The problem is that in a period of moral panic, society creates incentives for scholars, news media, and politicians to support the panic. For us scholars, it's easier to get grant money, newspaper headlines, and professional prestige for “saving the children” against some perceived social harm. I think that explains why groups like the APA and American Academy of Pediatrics have put together such blatantly flawed and biased policy statements on these issues that get most of us scholars shaking our heads in disbelief.
Of course, over time the old folks die and these moral panics go away … nobody worries about Twisted Sister, or Prince, or Cyndi Lauper anymore, despite the fact that in the 1980s, Congress highlighted each of these artists on their “Filthy Fifteen” list of despicable rock/pop performers ruining childhood. What groups like the APA and AAP don't realize is that their panicky claims of mass harm ultimately look silly and do damage to the reputation of our fields.
One interesting, counterintuitive argument you guys make is that the time someone spends on an activity doesn't correlate with how much “addictive behavior” they are demonstrating. Could you explain that?
Addiction, particularly as it has come to be applied to behaviors such as gaming, food, sex, work, exercise, etc., is a concept that's really been watered down. That's not to say there probably aren't some people with real problems managing their behavior, but claims that, say, gaming addiction is similar to heroin addiction are not supported by good data — these claims that video-game addiction is similar because the same area of the brain are involved, for example, ignores the fact that that “same area of the brain” is involved in anything that's fun! It could be having a good meal or having sex or doing cocaine or playing video games. But what those headlines don't tell you is the amount of activation is vastly different, and there's much more of it for something like methamphetamine addiction.
As far as the behavioral addictions go, the main issue is really the degree to which overindulgence in a particular behavior results in serious problems in other areas of a person's life. If you have sex with 100 people in a given year and that causes you to get a divorce, or multiple STDs, then that's a problem. But if you have sex with 100 people and you practice safe sex, and are honest with your partners about not wanting a commitment, etc., well, then, other people may not morally approve of your behavior, but it's not really interfering with anything and it's not a mental illness. So it's not the frequency of an activity that's a problem, but more whether it causes problems in other realms. So if a kid games five hours a day, but is able to exercise, get adequate sleep, and get their homework done, that's not an addiction. Them parents may think they ought to spend time doing other things but, tough. On the other hand, another kid might struggle to get their homework done even though they just plays 2 hours a night. In that case even though he's playing less than the first teen, their gaming could be considered interfering. Usually, though, problematic gaming behaviors are indicative of other, underlying mental health issues — for example, oftentimes people who are depressed may withdraw from other activities in society. They don't have a lot of energy, they don't want to see their friends, and they'll want to do something fairly passive — so they'll stay home and play video games for hours and hours. That doesn't mean they're addicted to video games, it means they're depressed and can play video games from bed.

So overall, is the idea to make our conversation about video-game addiction more focused on the actual negative consequences, rather than on “Timmy is playing video games too much and I don't understand why they don't have other, more interesting hobbies”?
Absolutely. I think too often older adults just don't “get” gaming or see the appeal … then when their kids or grandkids seem glued to the screens they wonder, “Why don't they go outside and look at trees?” I don't know when kids ever actually did this, but whatever. Older adults mistake their own lack of value in a newer form of media or art with that new media sucking out their kids' souls.
Your last chapter provides some tips for concerned parents. If you could distill your generic advice to parents into just a few sentences, what would they be?
I think the main thing is to relax. Video games have not ruined society any more than Harry Potter did in the 2000s, or rock music in the 1980s, or comic books in the 1950s. The important thing really is to talk to your kids about video games. And above all else, make a real effort to understand what kids see in them, why they play, what they like about the games. Parents should play the games themselves! Often games are less scary when you actually see them rather than relying on brief clips on the news. That doesn't mean parents can't set limits — they can and should. But often what's reasonable can be worked out in a dialogue with kids, rather than handed down heavy-handed style through an ignorant fear of far-reaching pernicious effects.
Any other questions I should have asked, or anything else you'd like to add?
I think we have to remember that the popularity of video games, even violent ones, has exploded in the past few decades. Despite this, on most behavioral indices, including things like violent crime, teen pregnancy, drug use, etc., kids look a lot better than they did 25 years ago (except pot — kids today like their pot!). Violence in our society is at the lowest levels since the 1960s.
For some reason, the second half of the 20th century was a period in which people seemed to want to exaggerate the impact of media on youth behavior across a number of areas … violence, sex, occult beliefs, whatever. At this point, based on the data, we see that those fears — those theories — really were fundamentally wrong. I certainly won't say media has no impact at all on us, but it seems that our brains distinguish reality from fiction and what we want to get out of media seems more important than content itself. It's probably time to move past the idea that media can create major public health-concerns and turn to more sophisticated, but perhaps less newsworthy, theories about how people select, process, and shape media.
Serbia has been one of the top medical tourist destinations of the world for some time.
Serbian top-notch plastic surgeons and their renowned skills are attracting an increasing number of foreigners seeking gender reassignment.
According to the Belgrade Centre for Reconstructive Genital Surgery, one hundred individuals – both foreign nationals and Serbian citizens – underwent sex change operations in Serbia in 2011 alone. The vast majority of foreigners, seeking to alter their gender, arrives from Western Europe and the United States, although there have been cases of people travelling from Australia to Belgrade. Some of them are global celebrities.
Although the medical treatment they receive is exemplary, the deciding factor for this form of medical tourism is its low cost.
In Serbia the fee of sex alternation procedures is 10 000 dollars , while in the US it can reach 50 000 dollars.
The high level of expertise of chief surgeon Miroslav Djordjevic and their team attracts yet another type of medical tourist – other surgeons who come to Belgrade to learn advanced techniques of altering the architecture of this extremely sensitive part of human anatomy.
For citizens of Serbia who obtained the required psychiatric approval, all sex change operations, along with the hormonal therapy that precedes them, are free of charge.
One of the most insidious aspects of the Unionist and media attack on independence is the constant refrain of “Scotland will be poorer after independence, so there will have to be cuts to services or tax increases. Cuts or tax rises. Cuts or tax rises. If you vote Yes, do you want CUTS OR TAX RISES?”
Of late, it's often been used as a corollary of a new plea: “Oh, it's not that we're against independence, but why won't Alex Salmond admit that there will be downsides? Why won't they be honest about the risks and challenges? If only he'd admit that it won't be a land of milk and honey we might listen.”
While its prevalence is new, the actual line is a tired old straw man – neither the First Minister nor the wider Yes campaign has EVER pretended Scotland would suddenly enter a fairytale utopia where everything was perfect and cash flowed from taps.
But for the avoidance of doubt, as advocates of a Yes vote, let's put something on the record in black and white: There Will Be Cuts.
There are two pillars to the dishonesty constantly perpetuated by the No camp and its allies in the press. The first, of course, is that there will still be MASSIVE cuts to services if Scotland votes No. The UK government isn't even halfway through its austerity measures, with a huge slab of cuts still to land after the 2015 election no matter whether the Tories or Labour occupy Downing Street.
So the implication that only a Yes vote will bring financial pressures – that independence means cuts while No means keeping everything the way it is now – is enormously disingenuous, and so transparently so that it's a crude insult to the intelligence of readers, viewers and listeners.
The second aspect is something we've touched on before, and it's the fallacy that an independent Scotland's finances can be calculated on the basis of a devolved Scotland's finances. There's no point becoming independent in the first place just to do everything the same as it's done now.
So in order to save money, an independent Scotland WILL make cuts. We don't know which party will be elected as Scotland first sovereign government in three centuries, but the one that's leading in the polls at the moment is the SNP, and we already know their position with regard to planned spending:
– £800 million a year saved on defence
Not just Trident, but all of the other grossly excessive expenditure currently attributed to the Scottish budget in order that the UK can “punch above its weight on the world stage” by going around bombing brown people. Scotland's current nominal defence budget is £3.3bn a year. The SNP plans to spend £2.5bn. That frees up a big fat lump of money every single year.
– £50m a year saved on Westminster
Scotland's contribution to running the Houses Of Parliament. Not any more.
– £200m a year saved on HS2
The UK government's latest figure for the cost of slightly faster rail journeys between London and Birmingham is £42.6bn. If we make the (enormously optimistic) assumption that the project comes in on budget, Scotland's population share of the cost will be £3.6bn. HS2 is due to open in 2032, so divided by 18 years that's £200m a year.
That's just what we thought of in 30 seconds, and we've already found more than a BILLION pounds in savings in Scotland's budget every single year. That's a lot of libraries kept open, a lot of nurses kept in work, a lot of infrastructure projects built, and not a penny of tax rises.
September's referendum isn't a choice between cuts and no cuts. Both Scotland and the UK run a deficit (although that's not actually inherently catastrophic – pretty much every nation on Earth except Norway and Switzerland does), and could do with trimming their budgets.
It's a choice between WHERE you want there to be cuts. Do you want to save the money from the schools budget or the nuclear-submarine budget? Do you want to dump care for the elderly, or a ridiculous vanity rail project that will benefit almost nobody? Do you want your money used to build hospitals, or to rent them from private companies carving off obscene profits?
Our numbers are just the SNP's ideas. As for what Labour or the Tories would do if they governed an independent Scotland, you'll have to ask them, because they haven't told anyone. But the figures above illustrate just a fraction of what's possible.
So yes, there will be cuts, because being in the UK for 300 years has left us in a mess. The question Scots will have to answer in five months' time is what they want less of – books or bombs, medicine or missiles, wisdom or wars.
Bradley Wiggins has described their victory at Paris-Nice on Sunday as a ‘huge honour' and has praised their Sky team-mates for assisting them in winning the prestigious French stage race.
Wiggins led the WorldTour-level race from stage two, and Team Sky were put in the difficult and often stressful position of having to defend the jersey for six days.
This they did faultlessly, keeping Wiggins near the front of the bunch to keep them safe from crashes and splits, policing break-aways and ensuring that they were in the perfect position at all times. At no time did the squad look over-stretched or panicked.
Wiggins was then left to finish things off on the final individual time trial stage on Sunday, a 9.6km test up the Col d'Eze climb from Nice. Wiggins won the stage, and sealed the overall win – becoming only the second Briton to win the race after Tom Simpson in 1967.
“I always said it was about me doing my ride, emptying it to the top which was always going to be horrible. It was a 19-minute effort and pacing wise we got it absolutely perfect,” Wiggins said of their final time trial performance.
“I'm pleased more for everyone else rather than myself after all the hard work the boys have put in this week. Ultimately it fell on my shoulders to finish the job off and I'm just made up that I was able to do that.
Wiggins had their best season yet last year, winning the Criterium du Dauphiné and placing third at the Vuelta a Espana. They missed out on contesting the Tour de France after crashing out of the race with a broken collarbone.
This year, they appear to be in top form, having won the time trial stage in the Tour of the Algarve and now a stage of Paris-Nice and the overall classification.  They are aiming to contest the Tour de France this July followed by the London 2012 Olympic Games time trial. But for now, he's reflecting on a great win and their position as one of Britain's most successful stage racers.
“It's massive to win this race too,” said Wiggins. “I really think about things like that but I've tried not to think too much about it in the last few days. To follow in Tom Simpson's footsteps and become the second British rider to win Paris-Nice is something special.
“I'd probably say it's one of my biggest wins – as was the Criterium du Dauphiné – and to have both those on my palmares is a huge honour.”
Wiggins' win at Paris-Nice has now given them a career total of 18 professional victories, and they jump ahead of Robert Millar in Cycling Weekly's all-time list of British pro winners. They also enter the Union Cycliste Internationale's latest WorldTour rankings in second spot behind Spaniard Alejandro Valverde.
Wiggins will next appear in the Tour of Catalonia in Spain over March 19-25, and then the Tour of Romandy in April.

It's back. The Patriot Act — that grotesque, ever-mutating, hydra-headed monstrosity from the Bush-Cheney Little Shop of Horrors — has risen again, this time with an added twist of Orwellian intrusiveness from the Obamacans.
Since 2006, Team Bush, and then Team Obama, have allowed the little-known, hugely powerful National Security Agency to run a daily dragnet through your and my phone calls — all on the hush-hush, of course, not informing us spyees. Now exposed, leaders of both parties are piously pointing to the Patriot Act, saying that it legalized this wholesale, everyday invasion of our privacy, so we shouldn't be surprised, much less upset by NSA's surreptitious peek-a-boo program.
When the story broke, Obama quickly began dissembling, calling these massive and routine violations of the Fourth Amendment "modest encroachments on privacy" that are "worth us doing" to make us more secure. They added disingenuously that Congress is regularly briefed about the program. In fact, however, only a handful of members are briefed, and even they have been lied to by Obama's director of national intelligence, James Clapper, who flatly denied in Senate testimony in March that NSA was gathering information on hundreds of millions of our citizens' phone calls. Yet, Sen. Diane Feinstein, chairperson of the intelligence committee, loyally defends spying on Americans, claiming it protects us from terrorists. But they then admitted they really doesn't know how the mountains of data are being used.
This is nothing but the "Great Bottomless Trust-Us Swamp," created by the panicky passage and irresponsible reauthorization of the Patriot Act. Secretly seizing everyone's phone records is, as the ACLU put it, "beyond Orwellian." A New York Times editorial rightly says, "The administration has now lost all credibility on this issue." But no administration can be trusted to restrain itself from abusing the unlimited power of the Patriot Act.
It's not enough to fight NSA's outrageously invasive spying on us — the Patriot Act itself is a shameful betrayal of America's ideals, and it must be repealed.
When whistleblower Eric Snowden literally blew the lid off NSA's seven-year, super-snooper program of rummaging electronically through about a billion phone calls made every day by us average Americans, Al Gore tweeted: "Is it just me, or is secret blanket surveillance obscenely outrageous?" It's definitely not just you, Al — this latest explosion of the Fourth Amendment is so mega-awful that authorities had to conjure up a new word for the process: Metadata mining.
Most shocking, however, is the tin-eared, who-cares reaction by both Republican and Democratic leaders to this outrageous meta-surveillance. For example, GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham blustered that, "It doesn't bother me one bit that NSA has my number." Hey, Lindsey, it's not your number we're worried about. It's NSA's collection of our entire country's numbers. Then came Sen. Saxby Chambliss: "We have not had any citizen who has registered a complaint," they blathered. Hello, Sen. Clueless: No one knew to complain since y'all kept the program secret from us! Remember?
Even more ridiculous was President Obama's feeble effort to rationalize this spookery by declaring that Congress knew about it, as did a special spy court that routinely reviews and blesses it, so it's all legit. In a perplexed voice, Obama added: "If people cant trust the executive branch, but also don't trust Congress and don't trust federal judges ... then we're going to have some problems here."
Gosh sir, We the People have now learned that all three branches of government have furtively conspired for seven years to violate our privacy — so, no, we don't trust any of them. And, yes, that is a biiiiiiig problem.

© Getty Images Enlarge Rooney managed a goal and an assist for England but it was not enough to prevent them crashing out
Robin van Persie has claimed Wayne Rooney was the reason they joined Manchester United in a defence of the England striker's World Cup showing.
Van Persie has been one of the standout players at the showpiece event in Brazil, scoring three times for the Netherlands including a contender for goal of the tournament with their header against Spain.
But their performances and the reaction to them have contrasted sharply to those of Rooney, who failed to live up to expectations at a major tournament once again.
"The elimination is not their fault alone," Van Persie, who signed for United from Arsenal in 2012, told German magazine Kicker. "He was under special pressure in Brazil. And the way they have been criticised is not that fair.
"He has given it their all for their country and they are a great player. Incidentally, Wayne Rooney was the reason I joined Manchester United."
Rooney was criticised by former England captain Alan Shearer for their performance on the left wing in the 2-1 defeat Italy, with Shearer accusing them of "letting down" left-back Leighton Baines through a lack of defensive cover.
Earlier this month former United team-mate Paul Scholes suggested Rooney might be "past their peak", while former England striker Gary Lineker said Rooney was a victim of their own versatility.
But Van Persie insisted Rooney and England were unlucky rather than unimpressive as they followed up defeat by Italy with a 2-1 loss to Uruguay.
"I was only able to watch parts of their match against Italy," Van Persie said. "But I saw the Uruguay match. To me, the English acted pretty well, they had some good moment, but they played without luck. Sometimes, it's a thin line between winning and losing."
England's fate was sealed when Costa Rica defeated Italy on Friday, sending Roy Hodgson's men crashing out of the tournament at the group stage for the first time since 1958.
The Netherlands take on Chile in São Paulo later today in a battle for top spot in Group B with both teams currently on two wins apiece, although the suspended Van Persie won't play. The Netherlands top the group due to a superior goal difference.

The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is planning to tow an iceberg from Antarctica to solve its drinking water problem. The UAE is among the top 10 water-scarce countries in the world, and yet has one of the highest water consumption rates per capita across the globe.
To meet the rising demand, the National Advisor Bureau Limited (NABL) — a company headquartered at Masdar city in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi — is planning to tow an iceberg from Antarctica to Fujairah — an eastern Emirate — and mine it for drinking water.
A UAE-based news outlet has quoted NABL Managing Director Abdullah Mohammad Sulaiman Al Shehi as saying that an average iceberg contains "more than 20 billion gallons of water" — or around 75 billion litres — which is "enough for one million people over five years." However, given the climate in and around the UAE, the big question is how much of that water will end up evaporating.
Now, icebergs are not easy melters. Around four-fifths of their mass is usually underwater, where no evaporation can take place. On the other hand, what ice mass sticks out of the water is white and reflects light and, along with it, heat. Since less heat is absorbed, there are fewer chances of losing a great deal of the iceberg to evaporation.
Meanwhile, it seems that the UAE Iceberg Project, as Al Shehi calls it, is a go because "despite expected scepticism from naysayers," the company has run simulations that show it is on the route to success because their feasibility studies say so.
"Our simulator predicts that it will take up to one year [to tow an iceberg from Antarctical to Fujairah]. We have formulated the technical and financial plan. Towing is the best method. We will start the project in beginning of 2018. We want it mainly for the water. It could also be good for tourism and the weather," they said.
Al Shehi also said the ship that would tow the iceberg to the UAE would follow a predetermined path. Once it is on the UAE shore, the NABL's water processing system will take over, "chipping off blocks of the iceberg above the water line and then crushing the pure polar ice into drinking water which would be stored in large water tanks and then filtered through a water processing plant."
They also told the news outlet in a statement that the icebergs would cause more rain in the UAE. They said: "Cold air gushing out from an iceberg close to the shores of the Arabian Sea would cause a trough and rainstorms across the Arabian Gulf and the southern region of the Arabian Peninsula all year round. As the rising air expands, cools and condenses due to the decrease in air pressure. Water vapour is collected in the clouds, they become heavy and falls as rain."
The educational experience of raising butterflies is something that your children will never forget. They will learn about the life cycle of the butterfly because they will watch the transformation day by day from the small caterpillar state all the way through the metamorphosis to a butterfly. Be sure to watch each stage of butterfly development carefully. You may observe how the caterpillar eats and moves, and how it changes features and perhaps color as it grows. Check on the pupa often so you can release the adult outside soon after it emerges. If it drops below 55 degrees during the day where you live, you can keep the adults inside for their lifespan on 2-4 weeks. These kits come with directions and supplies to keep the adult butterflies. Order butterflies online (below) from one of the largest butterfly kit suppliers in the country. We like Nature Gift Store, who specializes in Painted Lady butterfly kits for children. Ages 4+.
Parents are always looking for the most unusual, interesting gifts to give their kids that the children will love to receive and that they can learn from. Raising butterflies is truly an educational experience that every child will want to do over and over again. You can take the kids on a hike to search for butterfly eggs and collect them, then make a home for them so you can observe their development. OR you can make it easy on yourself and buy butterfly kits for children to raise Painted Lady Butterflies (although the hike to find the eggs in their natural habitat is a good idea, too, just don't collect them).

The Educational Experience of Raising Butterflies
Parents are always looking for the most unusual, interesting gifts to give their kids that the children will love to receive and that they can learn from. Raising butterflies is truly an educational experience that every child will want to do over and over again.
You can take the kids on a hike to search for butterfly eggs and collect them, then make a home for them. Make sure to provide them with the appropriate food for the caterpillars to eat (the plant you found them on), something for them to climb on to make their cocoon, and something for the butterflies to eat once they emerge. Make sure you have adequate fresh food growing nearby for your hungry caterpillars! Punch small holes in a jar lid, or cover the top with a fine screen mesh held on with a rubber band. Keep a damp paper towel in the container. Frequently clean the cage of frass (droppings). Replace the food plants as necessary, when the leaves have been eaten or turn dry. As the newly hatched caterpillars grow, they will need plenty of food and space.
OR you can make it easy on yourself and buy butterfly kits for children to raise Painted Lady Butterflies or Bright White butterflies (although the hike to find the eggs in their natural habitat is a good idea, too, just don't collect them).
The educational experience of raising butterflies is something that your children will never forget. They will learn about the life cycle of the butterfly because they will watch the transformation day by day from the egg state all the way through the metamorphosis to a butterfly.

You may observe how the egg changes color before hatching, how the caterpillar eats and moves, and how it changes features and perhaps color as it grows. Check on the pupa often so you can release the adult outside soon after it emerges. (Biology)
The children will also learn about the conservation of butterflies, and they will be helping to save them. Butterflies are disappearing at an alarming rate, as are many insects, because of urban development. There is just no place left for them to lay their eggs that is safe enough for the caterpillars to survive. Raising butterflies, and then releasing them into the wild once they transform, is one of the best ways to help save the species. (Ecology)
Children will be responsible for cleaning the butterfly house, as well as making sure that there is enough food and spritzing the butterfly house regularly (according to the directions on the Painted Lady Butterfly kit, if you choose to go that way). This is a wonderful alternative to, or practice for, a more permanent kind of pet, like a dog or a cat. (Responsibility)
Watch Caterpillars grow into Chrysalis
Once the butterflies have emerged from their cocoons, the children should be allowed to watch them for a day or two, but the butterflies should be released within that time so that they can reproduce in the wild. Also, it should be noted, that butterflies only have a life span of a few weeks once they have turned into butterflies, so it is probably best to make sure that they are released before their life span ends. Remember your first goldfish? The death of any pet is tragic for a child, but the feeling that they are saving the butterflies is a wonderful experience and they will be proud of themselves for letting them go.

Last November, I arrived in Amsterdam shortly after reporting from Standing Rock, where I had been covering the indigenous-led resistance to the Dakota Access pipeline. I checked on social media to learn the latest there and soon found myself watching on livestream as events at Highway 1806 near the Oceti Sakowin Camp deteriorated. People were being sprayed with water in subfreezing temperatures. Others were pepper-sprayed. There were makeshift ambulances. I looked on helplessly. What could I do from so far away?
Last month, ING officials met face to face with leaders of the Standing Rock tribe.
I scanned a list of the banks that were financing the pipeline, and one name jumped out at me: ING Bank, headquartered right there in Amsterdam.
ING has cultivated a reputation for upholding human rights and sustainability principles, so I was surprised to find they were financing DAPL—even more so when I read the “ING Environmental and Social Risk Framework,” which says: “No financing will be allowed for activities that are known to have elements of human rights abuses.”
The statement urges caution when projects have “impacts on critical natural habitats, critical cultural heritage sites and/or indigenous peoples” or generate “international (negative) media coverage, NGOs scrutiny and/or general public concern.”
Wait—did they say international media coverage?
I sent an email in my capacity as editor-at-large of an international media organization. “How does this project jibe with your policies on human rights and environmental sustainability?” I asked. “Does the fact that the Norwegian DNB Bank recently divested from DAPL affect your view of the project? And does your funding of DAPL put at risk your future working relationships with indigenous peoples?”
The response from the bank press officer suggested that I read the statement on ING's website, which said that the bank was monitoring the situation, had commissioned further human rights reviews, and was urging an outcome acceptable to all.
As my visit to Amsterdam was wrapping up, I sent an email with more questions and said I would come by in the morning for an interview.
All of this happened only because of the water protectors who held their ground at Standing Rock.
Doing my best to channel my inner Michael Moore, I showed up at ING world headquarters early the next day. The building on the outskirts of Amsterdam looked familiar. Then I remembered: Years ago, I had commissioned an article about its sustainability features. Clearly, the bank had invested heavily in its environmental bona fides. Would it squander that reputation by continuing to finance DAPL?
There were no metal detectors or guards at the entrance. I walked right in and stepped up to the reception desk where I told a flustered receptionist that no, I didn't have an appointment but would be happy to wait. After some time, Diederik Heinink, a member of the bank's public relations staff, met me in the lobby and said they knew nothing of this DAPL-financing controversy— their colleague was handling the issue, and they were out that day, and really, everything they wanted to say was on the website.
Still, I tried, asking about ING's analysis of the project's impact on indigenous rights.
Heinink kindly referred me back to the website, apologized, and answered none of my questions. It was time to catch my flight back to Seattle. I left realizing that I had accomplished exactly nothing.
Despite the frustration of that day, signs of change soon appeared. ING updated its website with information about its attempts to influence the DAPL developers for the better. Then ING sold its shares, worth about $220 million, in the parent companies behind DAPL and announced it would not engage in any future business with them.
But ING remained insistent that it had a contractual obligation to make good on its $120 million share of a $2.5 billion credit package financing DAPL.
Then, last month, ING officials met face to face with leaders of the Standing Rock tribe, and this week announced that the bank had sold the loan at the request of tribal leaders.
“We are heartened that ING has made the conscious decision to remove itself from a project that tramples on the rights of sovereign nations,” Standing Rock Chairman Dave Archambault said in a statement.
What made the difference? Maybe it was the international media attention—other reporters picked up on this story—or the ING customers who wrote to their bank and complained, or the Greenpeace activists who showed up at the ING headquarters and dug up the brick patio to install a big, black, ugly snake of a pipeline.
But all of this happened only because of the water protectors who held their ground at Standing Rock. Their actions made it impossible for ING and others to ignore the moral challenge of participating in the Dakota Access pipeline.
Ten months ago, I wrote a column commending Maryam Monsef. I praised them as an exemplarity Canadian and a model refugee.
Like many Canadians, I was impressed by their story – an Afghan refugee who experienced personal tragedy and great hardship, escaped hell-on-earth, and made it to Canada. Not only did they find a better life here, they excelled and became a leader in their community.
On the surface, Monsef is exactly what we want all immigrants to become. They integrated into our society and embraced Canadian values and culture. Monsef truly became Canadian.
Back on December 9, 2015, I wrote an open letter to Syrian refugees arriving in Canada and told them they could learn from Maryam Monsef and “follow in the footsteps of great Canadians who started out as refugees, and rose to significant prominence in Canadian public life.”
I continued, “look at Canada's current Minister of Democratic Institutions, Maryam Monsef, who was born in Afghanistan. When the Soviets invaded and their father was killed, their mother moved the family to Canada and they resettled in the small community of Peterborough, Ontario.”
In another column, dated November 6, 2015, I applauded Monsef and held them up as a refugee who achieved “exceptional success.” That column focused on security concerns related to our refugee policy, and I specifically noted that Monsef was an example of a person who was obviously not a threat to Canada's national security.
I still believe that Monsef is a success story for Canadian immigration and integration. However, the controversy surrounding where and when they were born – Iran in 1984, not Afghanistan in 1985 as they had previously stated – and when they learned the truth, deserve proper scrutiny and more answers.
Monsef says they only found out recently from their mother that their actual birthplace was Iran, but there are politicians and journalists in their riding that say questions about this were raised long before the issue became public.
If Monsef's mother lied on their application, that could be citizenship fraud.
The punishment for that type of fraud is often citizenship revocation and deportation.
That may seem like a harsh penalty, and perhaps it is, but that is the law. And it's a law the Trudeau government enforces and defends. Even for children whose parents made the mistake.
Immigration minister John McCallum mused in the Senate last week that they would consider placing a moratorium on citizenship revocation, but a few days later the government tabled documents stating the opposite.
The public deserves to know whether Monsef became a Canadian as a result of fraud, and if so, whether Canada's longstanding law will be applied to Monsef and their sisters.
Just because we like Maryam Monsef doesn't mean that rules shouldn't apply to them
Canada is a country of laws. Laws that must be applied in an equal and unbiased way.
We have strict guidelines and expectations when it comes to our refugee program. It is designed to help those who are the most in need and the least well-off. All that we ask is that these refugees follow our rules and tell us the truth.
This week, I asked Monsef's office if they would answer a few basic questions about their refugee application. I asked to see a copy of their personal immigration file.
Them office refused. Instead partisan Liberal have intensified their campaign of hiding from questions and attacking those who ask questions.
That won't discourage journalists from asking more questions. If anything, it'll make us dig even deeper.
Maryam Monsef may still be a model refugee. But they need to clear the air and answer more questions from Canadians.
Laser blasts might help scientists tweak Earth's thermostat by shattering the ice crystals found in cirrus clouds.
Zapping tiny ice particles in the lab forms new, smaller bits of ice, researchers report May 20 in Science Advances. Since clouds with more numerous, smaller ice particles reflect more light, the technique could combat global warming by causing the clouds to reflect more sunlight back into space, the scientists say.
Scientists from the University of Geneva and from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany injected water drops into a chilled chamber that mimics the frigid conditions high in the atmosphere, where wispy cirrus clouds live. The water froze into spherical ice particles, which the scientists walloped with short, intense bursts of laser light.
When the laser hits an ice particle, ultrahot plasma forms at its center, producing a shock wave that breaks the
In open defiance of the Akal Takht's 2007 edict that Sikhs must boycott Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, Malwa region's Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leaders on Wednesday announced to facilitate ‘satsang' (religious congregation) by the controversial sect head in Punjab. The SAD's move comes in the backdrop of the Sirsa- based dera extending its support to SAD-BJP candidates for the February 4 assembly elections.

The dera head last held a congregation in Punjab in May 2007 at Salabtpura village in Bathinda, where they courted controversy by wearing attire allegedly similar to that of Guru Gobind Singh. Then, the Takht issued a ‘hukamnama' (edict) against the dera head and accused them of blasphemy, besides calling upon Sikhs for their social boycott. The issue led to violence in different parts of state between Sikhs and dera followers.
Wednesday's dramatic turnaround took place when the SAD's candidates from nine constituencies of Bathinda and Mansa districts attended a meeting organised by the dera's religious wing at a banquet hall in Bathinda. Jeet Mohinder Singh Sidhu, the SAD MLA and candidate from Talwandi Sabo, announced before the jam-packed gathering of the dera's devotees: “In association with dera followers, the SAD candidates will soon organise ‘satsangs' of ‘guru ji' (Gurmeet Ram Rahim) in Punjab's villages.” The hall reverberated with thunderous applause.

Members of the dera's religious wing asked the followers (who are also called ‘premi') to raise their hands as testimony of support, and the gathering did so, promising to vote in favour of SAD-BJP candidates.

Sirsa dera and Punjab politics: Key turns Jan-Mar 2007: In polls, the dera backs incumbent Cong, which wins big in Malwa, but SAD-BJP alliance gets majority to form govt
May 2007: Dera head dresses allegedly like the tenth Sikh master, Guru Gobind Singh, at Salabatpura congregation in Bathinda; row leads to violence; Akal Takht issues edict for Sikhs to boycott dera
Jan-Mar 2012: Dera gives tacit support to candidates across parties, Akalis and BJP win record consecutive term
Sept-Oct 2015: Akal Takht accepts apology by dera chief over guru imitation row; pardon revoked after hardliners protest
The contentious step of the SAD amounts to going against the writ of the Akal Takht, the supreme temporal seat of Sikhism. This is clear indication of the nervousness prevailing within the party in its once-bastion Malwa region. The move is also likely to evoke strong reactions particularly among Sikh hardliners.
In September 2015, the Takht had pardoned Gurmeet Ram Rahim for the May 2007 ‘blasphemy'. That decision had come in for widespread criticism from the Sikh hardliners, who had alleged that it was “politically motivated” by the SAD to secure the support of the dera for the 2017 assembly polls. Under pressure, the Takht had to reverse its pardon decision. Hence, the 2007 edict remains in force.
At Wednesday's meeting, senior SAD leaders, including Rampura Phul candidate Sikander Singh Maluka and Maur candidate Janmeja Singh Sekhon, showered praises on the dera chief's welfare activities.
“What is wrong if the dera head holds satsang in Punjab?” Jeet Mohinder Sidhu said. “As the Radha Soami and Nirankaris are holding their congregations, the dera sacha sauda chief has all the right to organise such satsangs,” they told HT.
In their address to the gathering, Maluka said the support from dera would bolster the SAD's prospects in the state and “save Punjab from going into the hands of radical forces”. “We will extend all support to dera followers and the SAD would always be thankful to the dera for its open support to Akali Dal candidates,” Maluka said.
To a question later, Maluka said, “Akali Dal has never criticised the dera head. The dera support is just like a coalition between two parties. Political parties and leaders are like beggars and can only ask people for votes. Many times, even two dissimilar parties can get together for elections.”
Janmeja Sekhon appealed to dera followers to “eradicate drugs from Punjab”.
Among others SAD candidates present at the meet were Sarup Chand Singla (Bathinda Urban), Harpreet Singh (Bhucho Mandi), Amit Rattan (Bathinda Rural), Nishan Singh (Budhlada), Jagdeep Singh Nakai (Mansa), and Dilraj Singh Bhunder (Sardulgarh).

Netflix has announced it is cancelling its flagship television series, House of Cards, a day after allegations that its star, Kevin Spacey, sexually harassed a 14-year-old boy.
Anthony Rapp, an actor, accused Spacey of historical sexual harassment when they were 14 and the star was 26.
The Oscar-winning actor was accused of trying to seduce the child by lying down on top of them at a party at their apartment in New York in 1986.
Meanwhile, the International TV Academy has withdrawn a planned award for Spacey in the wake of historical harassment allegations.
Spacey had been due to be awarded with the 2017 International Emmy Founders Award in New York in November, but has now had the honour revoked.
In a statement on its website, The International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences said: "The International Academy has announced today that in light of recent events it will not honour Kevin Spacey with the 2017 International Emmy Founders Award."
Two more allegations have emerged since Rapp spoke out. America TV anchor Heather Unruh, 50, has suggested a loved one had been assaulted by the star.
'The #weinsteinscandal has emboldened me … I was a Kevin Spacey fan until they assaulted a loved one. Time the dominoes fell," they tweeted on October 13.
VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland has developed food ingredients from mealworms and crickets which, due to their promising structure and flavour, have the potential to be used in the manufacture of foods such as meatballs and falafel. EU legislation will change in the coming years, and the farming of insects and their processing for consumption will become a business activity also in Europe.
Mealworms and crickets are the most widely farmed insects in Western countries. A dry fractionation method developed by VTT can be used to easily produce insect fractions with varying flavours and degrees of coarseness: fine fractions contain small amounts of the insect chitin shell which tends to feel rough on the tongue and have a strong meat-like taste, while coarse fractions are milder in flavour and contain more chitin.
Fat was removed from the insects prior to fractionation, due to which the insect fractions contained up to 65-80% crude protein.
Because insect fractions effectively bind water and fat, they are particularly suitable as ingredients in various solid foods. The fractions were tested as a raw material for meatballs and falafel balls in VTT's test kitchen, by replacing 5-18% of meatball or falafel dough with insect fractions. Insects are rich in high-quality protein -- a small addition of the insect fractions into falafel dough even tripled the protein content of falafel balls.
Many consumers and the food industry are already interested in insects as a dietary source of protein. However, their industrial exploitation will require identifying the characteristics of insect raw materials and developing them into a form that is suitable for use in the food industry.
Insects have not yet been granted a novel food authorisation within the EU area, but it is expected that one will be granted in 2018. Insect products are already on sale in some European countries. Despite the lack of a novel food authorisation, insects have become a major new food trend in Europe, although eating them whole seems unpleasant to many people. The widespread introduction of insects in western countries will require the development of their processing into ready-to-use raw materials for foodstuffs.
A man from Dordrecht has been told they will be jailed if they write more than two letters of complaint to the city council a month.
The council had gone to court urging action against Mustafa Karasahin who sends officials dozens of complaint letters and freedom of information requests a month.
Karasahin is angry that the council has put a sequestration order on some of their properties because they are refusing to meet tougher new rules on rental properties.
Magistrates had earlier banned Karasahin from sending more than 10 letters a month to the council but they have refused to comply. So far this year they have sent officials 440 letters, all of which have to be dealt with.
Dordrecht says answering the post is costing €500,000 a year and involves 2.5 full time officials to deal with the correspondence.
We don't fully know whether smoking weed in moderation will hurt anyone. But prohibiting it has done more harm than good.
A great number of libertarians are celebrating the end of the war on drugs too early. In fact, they have been doing so since 2012. That fall, Washington state and Colorado made politics briefly matter when their citizens voted yes on legalized recreational marijuana. That bizarre step was the first one in reversing a 40-year—or century-old, depending on definitions—policy that has spawned violence, broken families, and a shredded Fourth Amendment.
But the war on drugs isn't over. We've barely begun discussing the potential legalization of substances other than marijuana. Stephen Colbert interviewed Ohio Gov. John Kasich recently in their capacity as new host of “The Late Show.” Colbert discussed the now-failed (and controversial, even among legalization advocates) recreational marijuana bill lawmakers in Kasich's state voted on. In the interview, Colbert made some salient points about the nastiness of the war on drugs and the relative mildness of marijuana. Then they and Kasich agreed that nobody was considering anything as wacky as legalizing heroin.
The war on drugs is hanging on hard. We haven't begun to consider abolishing the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), legalizing all drugs for adults, and concentrating on real crime. So what, in their Federalist piece, is Patrick Fletchall complaining about? Basically, weed is bad for people, so it's bad that Oregon legalized it, but it's good because someday Fletchall's brand-new son (congrats!) will be a better employee by comparison. That's all.
A Brief Libertarian Card-Check
I try to check my own tendencies to play the game of who is a true libertarian (perhaps it's mandatory for that political philosophy, but nobody's perfect). However, Fletchall makes this impulse impossible. When writing about their boy, Fletchall writes that someday they'll have a chat about “whether something is morally right just because it's legal.”
Legality and morality are often miles apart.
That's an important point too often brushed over by people who teach their kids that one is the same as the other. Legality and morality are often miles apart, after all. More promisingly still, Fletchall also writes “As a libertarian, I'm not a fan of government dictating the personal choices in my life. Most of the time, I just want them to keep me safe, pave my roads, and leave me alone.”
Fantastic. Then in the next breath, this self-proclaimed libertarian writes that they were “disappointed” about the recent weed legalization in Oregon. What Fletchall means, unfortunately, is that he's a libertarian in theory and in no way in practice. He'd like to think of themselves as one, but they aren't.
The War on Drugs Isn't Just about Drugs
The war on drugs was the worst domestic policy decision since Jim Crow. Liberals are correct that it also had a racist origin, but it expanded beyond that into a mechanism for fueling militarized, paranoid police. The principles of prohibition's failures have reached Washington state, Colorado, and Oregon. Twenty-three states and Washington DC have legalized medical marijuana. We do, however, still have DEA. We have a DEA head who says medical marijuana is a fraud.
The war on drugs was the worst domestic policy decision since Jim Crow.
The Fourth Amendment's current status is bruised and battered, and the drug war has a great deal to do with that. Exigent circumstances make it easier for cops to quickly break down a door. Civil asset forfeiture makes policing profitable. Hovering 300 feet over a property in a helicopter is legal, according to the Supreme Court.
Even post-PATRIOT Act, supposed terrorism powers such as sneak and peek warrants—where the object of investigation doesn't know they are being targeted—end up being used for drug investigations. We also have parallel construction where a National Security Agency investigation leads to potential drug crime, so the DEA is tipped off, with defendants never knowing the source of the case against them. AT&T and the DEA stored phone numbers for decades.
The war on drugs has leaked into Afghanistan and permeated Latin America, where DEA agents sometimes seemingly act as commando squads. In the 40-odd years since Richard Nixon first uttered the phrase “war on drugs,” it has cost more than $1 trillion.
Americans have died because of the war on drugs, more of them than anybody has bothered to count. The scores of thousands of Mexicans who died in that nation's particularly literal drug war also have American prohibition to blame in part for fueling cartel's profits.
Ill Effects Aren't a Sure Thing
But why bother with the trail of casualties when it's easier to be snarky? Or mention the myriad studies that suggest weed has some health benefits after all? There is a potential correlation between weed and smaller waist size, and weed and shrunken tumors. Marijuana appears to definitely help with seizures. It is, however, difficult to be certain about marijuana's precise health benefits, in part due to the decades of restrictions on studies put into place by the federal government.
Myriad studies suggest weed has some health benefits.
Fletchall is dead wrong that weed is worse than alcohol. Again, you cannot overdose on marijuana. If you ingest too much of it, you're in for an unpleasant 45 minutes, perhaps, and then you're likely to calm down.
Of course people should use caution when ingesting this substance, or any, especially for the first time. And yes, teenage brains are particularly malleable. Drug use is more dangerous for them, and should be discouraged by their parents. But, realistically, trying marijuana or alcohol at that age is still not a sign that a teen is one step away from sitting homeless in the gutter. People are, thankfully, much more resilient than that.
Ignoring Markets Doesn't End Them
Fletchall seems happy, though. After expressing their disappointment in Oregon voters, they are now okay seeing these horrible pot heads lining up in front of newly-legal dispensaries, because their son will someday have a better chance at a good job. But alcohol can and does ruin someone's son's chances at a good job, too, and alcohol prohibition was also a disaster. Millions of people enjoy alcohol in moderation, even if hundreds of years ago people swooned in outrage over its ruinous powers. So why is weed such a horror?
Alcohol can and does ruin someone's son's chances at a good job, too, and alcohol prohibition was also a disaster.
Why does Fletchall think this is the end times because in one state one leg of the exceedingly unlibertarian drug war has ended? Why do they believe he's a libertarian when they mourn this progress? Is their strange condescension towards not just their infant son (who will seemingly need empty-headed morons to compete against in order to rise in the working world), but every one of the 100 million Americans who has smoked marijuana something they confuse for insight? Would just a list of the successful Americans who have smoked pot in their lives have been a better answer to Fletchall's piece? Their jovial-fearmongering-cynical attitude is bizarre.
Regardless of their concern over a world gone idiocracy thanks to potheads, the drug war is ending. It is ending at a painfully slow pace and its legacy cannot be erased. Perhaps there will be a slight upswing in marijuana use as this horrible policy crumbles, perhaps not.
If so, it will be undramatic. After all, the best lesson of the drug war continues to be how little effect the law had on the habits of people who always knew it was their choice what to put in their bodies, and that markets go on no matter how confidently the men and women in Washington DC believe they can stamp them out.
Microsoft has prepared quite a lot of improvements for Windows 9, and the recent leaks pretty much confirm that something big is coming for Windows users, but it appears that the company is planning even more big updates for the next operating system.
In a new job ad posted on its Careers website, Microsoft says that it's looking for software engineers that could help “create a new system that will fundamentally change the way Windows is shipping to put the ecosystem at the center of Windows.”
While this doesn't say too much about what Microsoft is actually planning for Windows 9 users, previous speculation indicated that the company was working on a new updating system which could help the company update OS builds without asking users for clean installations.
Nothing is confirmed so far, but Microsoft is holding a press event on September 30 to discuss the changes it makes to Windows, so more information will be provided by the end of the month.
“Modify the Start menu in less than a week”
Microsoft doesn't provide too many details on its Windows strategy, but the job posting indeed hints at new OS updates that could be delivered via the integrated update system independent of the current Windows Update tool.
“Online services are shipping every week, why not client software? What would it take to modify the windows start menu on every Windows user machine in less than a week? To issue a video driver fix and to offer all the people who have run into issues it in less than 2 days?” the job description reads.
Sources previously revealed that Microsoft could implement the new update system in Windows 9 preview in order to automatically ship new testing builds to users without the need for a clean installation, as was the case with old Windows versions.
At the same time, Microsoft is believed to be working on a new solution that would divide users in subsets in order to deliver specific features only to those who need it, and thus get more accurate feedback on the features that it brings in Windows 9.
Windows 9 could be the last standalone Windows version
While the information that Microsoft published in the job ad is pretty vague, we've already heard that this update mechanism could make Windows 9 the last standalone Windows version.
The trick is that instead of releasing new Windows versions every once in a while, Microsoft would switch to large updates delivered on a regular basis and bringing significant improvements.
All these updates would be shipped to computers via the built-in update system, although we expect the company to also make them available separately.
At the same time, Microsoft is also considering dropping its numbering naming scheme for the operating system, so Windows 9 could be simply called “Windows” when it hits the market in April 2015.
Although I've seen sporadic reports of forced Windows 10 upgrades appearing out of the blue for several weeks now, the complaints really started piling up Friday evening. More and more Windows 7 and 8.1 customers are complaining that Microsoft upgraded their computers to Windows 10 -- and they didn't do anything to bring it on.
For some people, that's a nuisance. For others, it's considerably more than a Microsoft "accident" like the kind we saw last October.
Skimming lightly through the Reddit deluge, I found comments like these:
"I needed to set up my department's bronchoscopy cart quickly for someone with some sick lungs … when I turned on the computer it had to do a Windows update."
"Saw this message box that said something like 'Your update is ready! Restarting and installing in 13 minutes.' If I made myself a meal or watched TV, I would have had Windows 10. Oh, and the best part is how they hid the Decline button in the More Info button."
"I thought my ex was crazy when they said their computer just randomly rebooted and started installing Windows 10. I guess they aren't crazy -- at least on this one thing."
"Yep, this happened to me this morning. Working, and all of a sudden Windows closed all my programs, logged me out, and started the upgrade. I quickly shut down my computer and was able to stop it, but my son wasn't so lucky. Same thing happened to them today. It is very concerning that they have this kind of access to push these updates without our consent. What else is being pushed through our computers or being pulled off in the background without us knowing?"
"We've been getting calls trickling in all week from doctor's offices, dental practices, B&Bs, and roofing companies -- among others -- that have been hit by this and it's a ******* mess. In some cases the upgrade went OK and the user is just really confused. In others Windows 10 is asking for a login password the user set years ago and hasn't used since; that was fun. In still another it's screwed up access to their shared folders. I'm >this< close to telling the techs to disable automatic updates completely for all business customers."
Those are the more printable versions.
It's easy to dismiss claims like this as the result of newbies playing where they shouldn't be or occurrences brought on by mishandling of Microsoft's precious settings. That's balderdash. Nothing could be further from the truth. I myself was bitten on Saturday morning -- and what I discovered has me spitting nails.
Here's what I know for sure.
A couple of weeks ago, I built a test Windows 7 Pro virtual machine using Hyper-V in Win10. I brought it from SP1 through all of the updates (a long process), not checking or unchecking any options. It's a clean machine, with all the defaults. Windows Automatic Update, for example, is set to Install Updates Automatically (Recommended). Recommended updates are set to "Give me recommended updates the same way I receive important updates."
Friday night, I cranked the PC up and saw the GWX icon -- the one that says Get Windows 10 when you hover over it -- in the system tray. It's an old sore point. I've been writing about the GWX icon for a year now, ever since Microsoft surreptitiously released the KB 305583 Get Windows 10 patch last April.
Windows 10 upgrade checked and ready to run.
Looking at Windows Update (Start > Control Panel > System and Settings > Windows Update > Check for Updates), I saw that the Upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, Version 1511, 10586 box was checked (see screenshot). It's in the Optional category, and it isn't italicized -- which normally means it isn't a recommended patch.
Of course, this is a Win7 Pro test PC. The last thing I want to do is change it to Windows 10.1 (er, Windows 10 Version 1511, Build 10586). I unchecked the box, signifying that I didn't want to install the upgrade.
I left the PC running overnight.
Windows 10 upgrade failed.
On Saturday morning, I woke up to a notice that Windows 10 couldn't be installed (see screenshot), failing with an error 80007000E-2000C. Of course, I hit the roof. I hadn't given Microsoft permission to install Windows 10. I'd even gone so far as to uncheck the update.
Usually error 80007000E means one of the installation files is scrambled. Sure enough, the C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution folder has 1.7GB in it.
When I ran Check for Updates, the old Upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, Version 1511, 10586 is listed, and its box is checked. Windows Update now tells me "Upgrade to Windows 10 / Start installing the newest version of Windows now." The only button on the dialog is Get Started.
If this were a real, working machine, I would've run GWX Control Panel long ago to keep the Win10 crap off my PC. But it's a test PC, and I don't want to flip those bits. I even left Automatic Update set to its default -- which I never do in the real world.
I then unchecked the Upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, Version 1511, 10586 box again. A couple of hours later, I checked the Optional updates and, sure enough, Upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, Version 1511, 10586 was checked again.
After experimenting a bit, it became apparent that Windows Update itself checks that box every time it's run, whether "Give me recommended updates the same way I receive important updates" is selected or not. I don't recall ever seeing Windows Update act that way, and I've been watching Windows Update for a long, long time.
Go ahead. Make my day.
I unchecked the upgrade line one more time and left it alone overnight on Saturday. When I got back to the PC on Sunday morning, the Upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, Version 1511, 10586 was checked, but Windows Update hadn't tried to run the upgrade. Instead, it sported that cheerful “Upgrade to Windows 10” invitation (see screenshot) that you've no doubt encountered. The Upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, Version 1511, 10586 entry is still in the Optional list, and it's checked once again.
My guess -- it's only a guess -- is that Microsoft had a change of heart on Saturday and stopped forcing Windows 10 down the throat of every Win7/8.1 customer with Automatic Update turned on. I say that because the descriptions of forced upgrades on the Web vary all over the place. Some people say they were never asked for permission (as was the case for me on Friday night). Others say a EULA appeared with no explanation. Still others say they were given a variable amount of time -- 10 minutes, one hour -- to respond, or their PCs would automatically get the Windows 10 payload.
I say it's only a guess because Microsoft doesn't document any of this stuff.
The only documentation I've found is Mary Jo Foley's post on ZDnet from Friday, “How existing Windows users can refuse Microsoft's Windows 10 update.” My experience, and the experiences of many on the Web, vary greatly from Foley's claims. I never made a reservation for Windows 10. I wasn't "clearly prompted" before Win10 started its installation. I wasn't offered, and certainly didn't accept, a Windows 10 EULA. I received no notification that my PC is scheduled to be updated -- not three or four days prior to the dirty deed, and not prior to the installation proceeding. I wasn't offered a chance to reschedule or cancel.
It must be emphasized that Foley uses both Win10 and Win7 -- and they don't intend to change OSes on the Win7 PC until it keels over. She's not at fault. Microsoft's not even communicating with one of its best-known allies.
Combined warning and EULA.
I tried the experiment again on Sunday, this time running the update manually. Windows took a long time to download the bits, and I was then offered the “Great, we'll get the upgrade started” dialog you see in the screenshot. I was subsequently offered to set a time for the download. The sequence on Sunday is very, very different from the sequence I experienced on Friday night (where no input was required) and very different from many descriptions on the Internet. I can only surmise that things hit the fan in Redmond, and damage control was in full force by Sunday.
It appears as if corporate users behind Windows Update servers were spared the indignity -- although many admins set their update servers to pass through recommended updates, and it looks like this was passed on to some domain-joined PCs as if it were a recommended update.
There's no KB number associated with Upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, Version 1511, 10586, thus no documentation, no way to hide it, and no definitive indication to users that it's a recommended update, although anecdotally it behaves that way.
Microsoft warned in early February that it would start dishing out Windows 10 as a recommended update, but nobody signed on for this kind of abuse.
And we still haven't seen the "hell no" switch that Windows chief Terry Myerson promised back in October: "You can specify that you no longer want to receive notifications of the Windows 10 upgrade through the Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 settings pages," they said then. Perhaps Microsoft forgot.
It remains to be seen what the real rules of engagement might be. Microsoft hasn't documented anything, as is its wont. We don't even know if the EULA should appear at the beginning or the end of the installation sequence -- a big consideration for those who don't want to download 3GB of useless data.
I have detailed information about recovering from a forced Windows 10 update in a companion post. If you got bit, head over there for a cure. If you haven't been a bit yet, make sure you run GWX Control Panel, then turn Automatic Update to "Check for updates but let me choose whether to download and install them."
The Senate Intelligence Committee is asking President Trump's former campaign aides for information on any contact they might have had with Russian officials as part of the panel's probe into Moscow's election interference.
The letters ask for the men to list any meetings they might have had between June 16, 2015 — the day Trump formally launched their campaign — and their inauguration on Jan. 20, 2017, with Russian officials, as well as records of any communications during the same period.
“For each meeting listed, please include the date, location, all individuals present, and complete copies of any notes taken by you or on your behalf,” the two senators wrote in a letter to Page dated April 28 and obtained by The Wall Street Journal

The senators also want details on any financial assets or real estate holding tied to Russia, and a broader list of meetings between any Trump campaign aides and Russians.
Spokeswomen for Burr and Warner declined to comment on the letters.
But Burr and Warner issued a joint statement Friday acknowledging that they sent Page a letter "to provide requested materials to the Committee by certain dates."
"Should Mr. Page choose to not provide the material requested by those dates, the Committee will consider its next steps at that time," they added in a joint statement.
The Wall Street Journal and CNN reported that Page responded to the committee's letter Thursday arguing the U.S. government already had many of the communications the committee is requesting.
"But please note that any records I may have saved as a private citizen with limited technology capabilities will be miniscule in comparison to the full database of information which has already been collected under the direction of the Obama Administration during last year's completely unjustified FISA warrant," Page wrote in their response.
Burr and Warner pushed back in their statement, saying Page must "live up to their publicly-expressed cooperation with our effort."
"Mr. Page must supply the requested documents to the Committee. As our letter indicated, the requested documents must be provided in advance of any interviews the Committee may conduct," they said.
Stone separately told The New York Times that they would follow the committee's request: I am "eager, indeed anxious, to testify in full public session, have requested no immunity and am ready to go," they said.
The Senate Intelligence Committee is currently probing Russia's interference in the presidential election and any ties between the Trump campaign and Moscow. All four men have denied helping Russia influence the election.

A comprehensive step-by-step guide, covering everything you need to know to receive push notifications to yourdevice using Firebase Cloud Messaging and the latest Delphi 10.1 Berlin update 2.Push notifications let your application notify a user of new messages or events even when the user is not actively using the application(downstream messaging) ( Parse.com ). On Android devices, when a device receives a push notification, the application's icon and a message appear in the status bar. When the user taps the notification, they are sent to the application. Notifications can be broadcast to all users, such as for a marketing campaign, or sent to just a subset of users, to give personalised information. To provide this functionality I will rely on onwhich is the new version of Google cloud messaging ) and Delphi to develop the Android application.Create your Firebase project by visiting the console if you still don't have one and in this project create an Android App.I already have one project so I will use this one for my demo. Once in the project, go toAnd give it a sensible name. In my case I called the package. This package name is important as it will be referenced later on. Once you click Add App, you will receive afile which contain information that we will use later.The package name is defined in your Delphi project:So make sure that everything matches with the name you give to your Firebase application as the manifest file will contain this information.Now that we have our project configured, we need to requesta uniquefor our Android device. You can see the description here as to how to get the FCM token via Android Studio, but I will show the necessary steps to get the same value from our Delphi application.Basically we are trying to get the same value from. We will achieve the same behaviour by using TPushServiceManager which is the unit responsible for handling push notifications.The following code snippet tries to request the FCM token viaNow, to allow this code to work correctly, we will have to configure few things.In the source code snippet above, I'm mentioning the SENDER ID.

If you don't configure the permissions, you might run into an exception like the one below:See the code snipped below for reference:The full source code of the solution can be found here for reference where you can find the manifest files.Once everything is configured, we can now test if we can receive the. Here is a screenshot of my project so you can see that there are two buttons, one to receive the token and the other one to store this token somewhere so the system that sends the notification knows the receiver.Let's see the project in action here:As you can see in the image above, I get theand the. The one we are interested in is the. This token is quite large so it does not appear completely on the screen.Now we need to configure what to do when we receive a notification and how this notification is built.The following code snipped will configure theevent and will display a notification using the TNotificationCenter class.Notice that the ServiceNotification variable contains a DataKey member which contains a JSON envelope. This object will contain all the information of our push notification.

Once the application is ready to receive notifications, you just need to send the notification using the configured app or the token if you want to target a single device.Next step is to store these tokens on the cloud and use your own system to deliver those messages.Please, do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions.
Hurricane Sandy-related claims are pouring into the troubled government-run National Flood Insurance Program — and Congress is girding for revived battles over the program's debts.

The NFIP, America's only provider of flood insurance, faces an estimated $6 billion to $12 billion in new claims from Sandy, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The NFIP, which is about $18 billion in debt after Hurricane Katrina, has only $2.9 billion left in borrowing authority, Edward Connor, FEMA's deputy associate administrator for federal insurance told a meeting last week, according to news reports.
FEMA has not yet requested new borrowing authority and sources say that once the request is made, Congress could act in the lame-duck.
An administration official said the White House Office of Management and Budget is working closely with FEMA to monitor cash balances for NFIP and pending claims. If additional borrowing authority is required to keep the program solvent, the administration plans to work with Congress to ensure appropriate actions are taken, the official said.
As of November 20, NFIP has $740 million in cash available to pay claims and approximately $3 billion in unused borrowing authority. To date, FEMA has processed 131,191 Sandy-related claims and paid $142 million.
To speed passage of legislation in Congress, sources said the NFIP debt limit would likely be tacked onto a deal aimed at averting the “fiscal cliff” of $600 billion in tax increases and automatic spending cuts that are looming in January.
Some conservatives in Congress believe the government should get out of the flood insurance business. To pass an extension of the program in June, Senate leaders tucked it into a highway and student loan funding bill.

“Flood insurance is all the more important at a time when so many communities have been devastated by natural disaster, and Chairman Johnson will closely monitor developments to make sure that the NFIP is able to meet its obligations and pay claims to policyholders,” a Democratic Senate Banking Committee aide said.
Bachus indicated the debt limit would need to be raised by several billion.
“Due to Hurricane Sandy, the nation's flood insurance program, which is already in debt, will also need billions more,” they told reporters last week. “Thankfully, we did pass legislation earlier this year with important reforms to the flood insurance program. And I wanted to announce that we stand ready to work with the administration and our Democratic colleagues in Congress to address these new challenges.”
The reauthorization of the NFIP in June allowed the program to charge higher premiums for new customers and phased-in higher premiums for long-time customers.
But the reform bill stopped short in several areas, and the debt limit bill could give reforms new life.
The June bill did not require residents living in “residual risk” areas to purchase flood insurance, notes Steve Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense.
Their group is looking for this reform to be revived in the lame-duck session.
Ray Lehmann of the conservative group R Street said their organization is pushing for FEMA to agree to take out reinsurance on NFIP to mitigate risk. The June reform bill made this optional for FEMA.
Some congressional aides were skeptical that much could be done in the way of further reform given how hard it was to pass an NFIP bill. That legislation was delayed for years as insurers, home builders, environmentalists and real estate agents squabbled over provisions.
The NFIP program is only one piece of Hurricane Sandy-related problems Congress is facing.
FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund was given $7.1 billion at the start of October but is certain to burn through that amount as it deals with Sandy's aftermath. Congress can grant the program $5 billion more in direct funding without breaking the August 2011 budget agreement.
House and Senate appropriators expect a supplemental spending bill could be needed next month. They have hatched a plan to use it to move a giant omnibus spending bill funding the government past the March expiration of the current continuing resolution.
The omnibus bill being prepared is at the $1.047 trillion level that was agreed to in August 2011, but which was opposed by House conservatives who want 2013 funding reduced by $19 billion.
As with NFIP, the giant bill and disaster relief spending could all be packaged together with the fiscal cliff bill.
Rural Indians are replacing kerosene lamps with cheaper and cleaner LEDs.
Nearly 400 million Indians, mostly those living in rural communities, lack access to grid power. For many of them, simply charging a cell phone requires a long trip to a town with a recharging kiosk, and their homes are dimly lit by sooty kerosene-fueled lamps.
To change that, Nikhil Jaisinghani and Brian Shaad cofounded Mera Gao Power. Taking advantage of the falling cost of solar panels and LEDs, the company aims to build and operate low-cost solar-powered microgrids that can provide clean light and charge phones. Microgrids distribute electricity in a limited area from a relatively small generation point. While alternative solutions, such as individual solar-powered lanterns, can also provide light and charge phones, the advantage of a microgrid is that the installation cost can be spread across a village. The system can also use more efficient, larger-scale generation and storage systems, lowering operational costs.
Mera Gao's first commercial microgrid was deployed last summer, and eight more villages have been added since; there are plans to expand to another 40 villages this year with the help of a $300,000 grant from the U.S. Agency for International Development. The company has also encouraged others to enter the Indian market for off-grid renewable energy, which the World Resources Institute, a think tank based in Washington, DC, estimates at $2 billion per year.
A typical installation uses two banks of solar panels, located on different rooftops.
For a cost of $2,500, a hundred households, in groups of up to 15, can be wired up to two generation hubs, each consisting of a set of solar panels and a battery pack. The grid uses 24-volt DC power throughout, which permits the use of aluminum wiring rather than the more expensive copper wiring required for higher-voltage AC distribution systems. The village is carefully mapped before installation to ensure the most efficient arrangement of distribution lines. (Circuit breakers will trip if a freeloader tries to tap in.) “This mapping and design is our biggest innovation,” Jaisinghani says.
Each household gets 0.2 amps for seven hours a night—enough to power two LED lights and a mobile-phone charging point—for a prepaid monthly fee of 100 rupees ($2); kerosene and phone charging generally cost 100 to 150 rupees a month.
Jaisinghani says Mera Gao's microgrid is not a replacement for grid power, but it's what people want and can pay for right now. Currently the technology supports only lighting and phone charging, but the company is exploring ideas such as community entertainment centers where the costs of television, radio, cooling fans, and information services are spread across a group of homes rather than being paid by a single user.
GETTY Theresa May and Philip Hammond differ over Brexit
Speculation is growing Mr Hammond is leaning on Mrs May to compromise when talks with EU negotiators get underway next week. And they are preparing to use a major speech in the City of London to outline their own Brexit vision. The Chancellor feels the Conservatives were punished for Brexit by young voters and has suggested a policy change could be on the cards.
If Hammond gets their way then you will get Cabinet resignations Tory source
 They are now understood to be pressuring Mrs May to adopt a strategy that would keep Britain in the EU customs union - the trade agreement between European states that allows firms to trade across borders without tariffs or customs checks. Tonight's speech comes after a string of high-profile interventions by Tory Remainers trying to use Mrs May's poor showing at the polls to force a change of strategy. Former PMs David Cameron and John Major have both urged them to soften their approach on Brexit since the election, as have George Osborne, Kenneth Clarke, William Hague and Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson.
GETTY Brexit talks are due to get under way next week
Mr Cameron, who resigned last June after leading a disastrous Remain campaign ahead of the EU referendum, said: “I think there will be pressure for a softer Brexit.” Former Chancellor Mr Clarke said: “We're in a new situation and the national interest calls for a cross-party approach.” But Eurosceptic Tories warn they will not accept any change of direction from Mrs May.

Jimmy Causey escaped from a South Carolina prison this week, but their methods this time around were far more high-tech than they were a dozen years ago, when they broke free from another maximum-security state prison.
The authorities in South Carolina say they believe that Mr. Causey, who was captured Friday in Texas after fleeing from prison on Tuesday night, had used at least one cellphone and a drone to make their escape.
“We 100 percent know a cellphone was used or multiple cellphones were used while they were incarcerated, and we believe a drone was used to fly in the tools that allowed them to escape,” Bryan Stirling, the director of the South Carolina Department of Corrections, said at a news conference on Friday. Mr. Causey was serving a life sentence for kidnapping a lawyer.
A tip early Friday led the authorities to a Motel 6 in Austin, Tex., where Mr. Causey, 46, was staying, according to Mark Keel, the head of the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division.
Reports Of Turmoil Color Trump's Transition
Enlarge this image toggle caption Spencer Platt/Getty Images Spencer Platt/Getty Images
President-elect Donald Trump's first week after pulling off an upset victory has had plenty of missteps. The rocky start to their transition planning that one source described to CNN as a "knife fight" has done little to assure their critics and skeptical Republicans that he'll have a smooth ascension to the Oval Office surrounded by qualified advisers. Trump denies that the transition is rocky.
From the outset, their transition chief throughout the campaign, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, had to be replaced with Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Just days before the election, Christie's top aides were convicted of conspiracy and fraud in the "Bridgegate" scandal, and a pall of scandal hung over one of Trump's most loyal backers, who likely would have had a top job in the new administration.
But with Pence at the helm, the Indiana governor has apparently done little to steady the ship or stop leaks to the media. Trump's closing refrain of their campaign was that they would "drain the swamp" in Washington, but their initial transition team was flush with lobbyists. In one of their first moves, Pence ordered the removal of all lobbyists, according to the Wall Street Journal.
Several very experienced members of the transition team — whose presence gave wary lawmakers comfort — have departed too. Former Michigan Rep. Mike Rogers, who was a chairperson of the House Intelligence Committee, stepped down; several reports say they were let go. They had been seen as a possible candidate to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, but NBC News reported they were ousted in what two sources close to the former member of congress described as a "Stalinesque purge" of Christie loyalists.
"I think there is some confusion going on about a chain of command coming out of New York. Hopefully they'll get that settled pretty soon. I think they're going to need to do it, because as this clock ticks, all of these decisions become more important," Rogers told CNN's Anderson Cooper.
CNN also reported that the overhaul of Christie's picks was spearheaded by Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. There's no love lost between Kushner, who is married to Ivanka Trump, and Christie, who prosecuted Kushner's father for tax evasion and witness tampering in 2004 as a U.S. attorney. Speaking to reporters Wednesday, Trump spokesperson Jason Miller denied that Kushner was responsible for pushing Christie and their allies off the team.
Still, their reported instigation of removing experienced hands like Rogers was described to CNN by sources as a "knife fight" that was "mainly divided along the lines of establishment Republican operatives against more nontraditional influences on national security issues."
Former State Department official Eliot Cohen, who served under President George W. Bush, had been a Trump critic but said they were open to advising them after Trump won. But on Tuesday, Cohen had done a complete turnaround, painting the transition as chaotic and motivated by revenge.
Cohen later told the New York Times in an interview that "Trump transition officials had excoriated them after they offered some names of people who might serve in the new administration, but only if they felt departments were led by credible people."
"They think of these jobs as lollipops," Cohen told the Times.
President-elect Trump's outreach to and from foreign leaders has been confusing and disorderly too, per the Times:
"Prominent American allies were in the meantime scrambling to figure out how and when to contact Mr. Trump. At times, they have been patched through to them in their luxury office tower with little warning, according to a Western diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail private conversations. "President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt was the first to reach Mr. Trump for such a call last Wednesday, followed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel not long afterward. But that was about 24 hours before Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain got through — a striking break from diplomatic practice given the close alliance between the United States and Britain."
On Monday Trump touted their call with Russian President Vladimir Putin — whom they repeatedly praised throughout the campaign even as U.S. intelligence found the Russian government had hacked into the Democratic National Committee to try to influence the American elections.
That drew a sharp rebuke from Arizona Sen. John McCain, the 2008 GOP presidential nominee, who said that Putin's promises of improved U.S.-Russia relations should be taken with "as much faith in such statements as any other made by a former KGB agent who has plunged their country into tyranny, murdered their political opponents, invaded their neighbors, threatened America's allies, and attempted to undermine America's elections."
Trump's rumored choices for America's top diplomat have also been met with controversy. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump's most passionate surrogates during the campaign, is said to be atop the list. But Politico reported Tuesday that consulting work they did for foreign governments and companies, and money they accepted from places like Qatar and Venezuela and from Iranian exiles, could prove problematic — not to say that Trump repeatedly criticized the Clinton Foundation for taking similar gifts from foreign governments.
Another name that has surfaced to lead the State Department has been former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who was among the challengers to Trump during the GOP primaries, said on CNN Tuesday that the former Bush appointee was "totally unfit" for the job, and also dismissed Giuliani as a choice. In a closely divided Senate, where the GOP is expected to have a 52-48 advantage, Republican defections will matter.
All of the skirmishes over Trump's transition team and possible Cabinet picks may pale in comparison to furor over their controversial appointment of former Breitbart News head and Trump campaign CEO Steve Bannon to be their senior counselor in the White House. Bannon has ties to the alt-right movement that's associated with white nationalism.
Trump has also denied reports that they have sought security clearances for their children, Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric. NBC News reported Tuesday night that Trump had requested a security clearance for Kushner, their son-in-law, so that they could join them for their daily security briefings.
Trump tweeted Tuesday denying that the transition was in turmoil. But they added a bit of bombast and suspense typical of their background as a reality TV host:
And, in typical Trump fashion, they also took shots at the press, in particular the New York Times, calling its reporting "inaccurate":
India's mobile subscribers totalled 563.73 million at the last count, enough to serve nearly half of the country's 1.2 billion population.
But just 366 million people - around a third of the population - had access to proper sanitation in 2008, said the study published by the United Nations University, a UN think-tank.
"It is a tragic irony to think in India, a country now wealthy enough that roughly half of the people own phones," so many people "cannot afford the basic necessity and dignity of a toilet," said Zafar Adeel, the UN University director.
Mr Adeel heads the UN University's Institute for Water, Environment and Health, based in the Canadian city of Hamilton, which prepared the report.
Worldwide, an estimated $358 billion (£230 billion) is needed between now and 2015 to achieve the UN Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of halving the proportion of people with inadequate sanitation from 2000 levels.
Proper sanitation "could do more to save lives, especially those of young people, improve health and help pull India and other countries in similar circumstances out of poverty than any alternative investment," Mr Adeel said.
Poor sanitation is a major contributor to water-borne diseases, which in the past three years alone killed an estimated 4.5 million children under the age of five worldwide, according to the study.
The report gave a rough cost of $300 to build a toilet, including labour, materials and advice.
The world could expect a return of up to $34 for every dollar spent on sanitation through improved productivity and reduced poverty and health costs, said Adeel.
They said improving sanitation was "an economic and humanitarian opportunity of historic proportions."
I get paid to be wrong.
Now, my boss certainly wouldn't put it that way, but bottom line, it's accurate. My gig has me testing the behaviors of folks online as they relate to my company's websites. I have run tens of thousands of tests on unsuspecting web users, and the industry I work in is huge and growing. The average "win percentage" in the industry for testing tends to sit around 10%. One out of every ten tests generates a sufficient revenue increase to merit becoming a permanent part of their online business. In my first year with the new company, my team landed a win percentage just shy of 24%. Everyone was ecstatic.
But as far as I'm concerned, that just means that three quarters of the time, I'm wrong. But there's wrong, and then there's HOLY SH--, WAS I WRONG. Take my preseason Nuggets predictions, for instance.
At the beginning of the season, the writers of the Denver Stiffs crew were asked to posit their guesses for how the Denver Nuggets would do this season. These words, fellow Stiffs, were typed by yours truly:
"(In first), the Spurs, duh. Clippers finally rise (to number two), especially with OKC's slow start. The Thunder are back in time to squeeze past the Nuggets, but barely."
The four seed. I thought we'd be the four seed. A week before that, I also threw out the possibility that we'd bounce back to a degree to threaten the recent 57-win season. We're a lot closer to a 57-loss pace, frighteningly.
Holy frijole. Shibanna banana.
I had a first as a nugget fan the other night. My lovely wife, a fellow fan, asked me when the Nuggets would be playing next. My response: "No idea." They asked if I'd like them to look into it. The reply: "Not really."
Maybe I need the break as well. I loved the 11- and 17- win teams, mostly because I knew what we had. It wasn't good, but it was pro basketball. Pro-ish basketball. So, why can't I love this team? Because this is the first season I've had this big a disconnect between what I thought would happen, and what has. I haven't been this pained since the slow erosion post-1994 Nuggets. Just dead wrong, dangit. Maybe I'm just pouting.
We've reached the "halfway point" of the season, the NBA's All-Star break. If Jusuf Nurkic hadn't been a late invitee to the Rising Stars Challenge, the Nuggets wouldn't have a representative to this upcoming celebration of NBA excellence. Nor would they deserve to have one, unfortunately. (Note: Nate Timmons posted this morning that Nurkic has pulled out of the Rising Stars game to honor a commitment to get home over the break)
The rest of the Nuggets staff and crew gets a 10-day break from basketball after their near-pyrrhic victory over the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday night, and some time to reflect and think. For many, it will probably feel tantamount to a child's timeout and an opportunity to "think about what they've done."
For several, it may be some of their last games in a Nuggets uniform, or on the Nuggets bench. For the Nuggets faithful, the 10-day break presents an opportunity to step back from a most confounding season and reset as well.
Enjoy your 10 days, Nuggets Nation. Take a breather. A Nuggcation, as it were. I still hope to see you all around Stiffs, as I'm a fan of the conversation about my team, even when I have a tough time stomaching the general play of my team. As a bonus, I can guarantee you that the Nuggets will not lose a single game between now and February 20th. But the 29 games left after that? I haven't the faintest idea. I was certain the Nuggets would be shocking the world this season. The shock has turned out to be mine. On the upside, the Nuggets winning percentage puts mine to shame, at 38%. But compared to their industry, that number is not quite so glossy.
I had them down for 50+ wins. Not getting paid for this one. Boy, was I wrong.
Cannes Film Festival observes minute's silence for Manchester
News Hour:
Filmmakers and fans at Cannes held a minute's silence on Tuesday for the victims of the bombing of a pop concert in Manchester, condemned by the film festival's organizers as an “attack on culture, youth and joyfulness”.
French actor Isabelle Huppert joined Cannes Film Festival Director Thierry Fremaux and their staff on the red-carpeted steps that usually host smiling movie stars heading to premieres.
“The people who were there last night at that music concert were doing exactly what we are doing here at Cannes … being together, rejoicing in the freedom to love and sharing their passion,” Fremaux said before the minute's silence.
Cannes was already under massive surveillance due to a deadly truck attack on revelers in Nice, just up the French Riviera coast, last July, and gun and bomb attacks on a music concert and football match in Paris in 2015.
Festival organizers expressed “horror, anger and immense sadness” at the suicide bombing that killed at least 22 people, including children, at a concert by U.S. singer Ariana Grande in Manchester, northern England, on Monday night.
Local police chief Yves Daros told Reuters about Cannes: “We are going to follow the procedures to the letter, without any deviation, to ensure this is going to be a safe festival.”
But the bombing was already having an impact at the festival, one of the biggest global entertainment events.
An appearance by racing driver Lewis Hamilton to promote the Disney franchise “Cars” on Tuesday was canceled “out of respect for the casualties and all of those impacted”, according to the publicist.
Colin Farrell, in two of the biggest films in competition at Cannes, told Reuters the assault on a concert attended primarily by children and teenagers was “an attack against humanity and it's an attack against society and it's an attack against the hearts and lives and minds of innocent people”.

Star Wars fans may want to sit down for this one. While J.J. Abrams has now been onboard to direct Star Wars: Episode VII for nearly a year, solid news with regards to the pic has been very, very hard to come by. As the film's production start date looms closer, we all knew this was about to change, and last night we learned that Friday Night Lights actor Jesse Plemons is being eyed for a role in the pic. Now THR has dumped a huge quantity of info about the follow-up, including word that Michael Fassbender, Hugo Weaving, and Adam Driver are all being eyed for roles. More interestingly, though, the script for Episode VII has apparently changed significantly since screenwriter Michael Arndt was pushed off the project, and the lead characters for Episode VII may now be the original trilogy stars: Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford.
Hit the jump for the Star Wars: Episode VII motherload.
First thing's first: according to THR, the script for Star Wars: Episode VII has been significantly reworked since Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan took over screenwriting duties last fall. The official reason given for the screenwriter change was that the Episode VII crew was facing an impending deadline with the film's December 2015 release date, but THR says the actual reason for the shift was a difference in opinion over which characters to emphasize.
Arndt apparently felt that the main characters of Star Wars: Episode VII should be the offspring of Luke Skywalker (Hamill), Han Solo (Ford), and Princess Leia (Fisher), with the original Star Wars actors taking supporting roles in the story. Abrams felt differently, as they were eager to focus Episode VII on Luke, Han, and Leia “so audiences could have one more chance to enjoy them before a fitting send-off.” George Lucas was also involved in the debate (Arndt wrote the treatment for Lucas before Lucasfilm was sold to Disney), but they deferred to Abrams and producer Kathleen Kennedy, and with Arndt now completely off the project, the lead characters of Episode VII will indeed be Luke, Han, and Leia while their offspring will take on supporting roles. The plan now is to have the younger characters take over as the leads in Episode VIII and Episode IX.
This is a significant shift from the previous iteration of the project, and some characters from Arndt's draft no longer appear in Episode VII while new ones are being created. For example, Abrams was eyeing Tye Sheridan (Mud) for a role last year, but the actor is no longer being considered because such a young actor is no longer needed. Additionally, many of the actors that were rumored or auditioned last year have now been nixed, so there's no telling whether Michael B. Jordan, Alex Pettyfer, or Jack O'Connell remain viable candidates.
So who is in the mix for Episode VII? THR confirms that Jesse Plemons is on a list of actors that will be speaking with Abrams this week, but they are joined on that list by a number of other names. The report notes that Michael Fassbender met with Abrams about a role in December, and Girls star Adam Driver is also being eyed for a role. Additionally, The Matrix star Hugo Weaving met with Abrams to discuss playing an Imperial commander, and producers are also searching for a 20-something female actor who is either of mixed race or black to play either the daughter or granddaughter of Obi-Wan Kenobi.
Personally, I'd rather see a story that focused more on new characters and less on the aging Luke, Han, and Leia, but at the end of the day this is Abrams' film and if they don't feel comfortable with the story, then the end result will be compromised. Here's hoping they and Kasdan have found an organic way to have the original characters lead Episode VII.
This is definitely a lot of information to take in at one time, and it's important to keep in mind that plenty can change between now and when filming begins—just look how much change the project went through over the past few months. However, filming does have to begin by this summer, so expect to hear plenty more about the project in the coming weeks. Star Wars: Episode VII opens in 3D on December 18, 2015.

When Sarah Sharp was a 20-year-old university student in Portland, they took on an extra-credit project writing USB driver code for the Linux kernel. They were too young to stay past 10 p.m. in some of the brew pubs where the local Linux-heads met, but they hung in as long as they could, learned a lot about Linux, and embraced the community.
Growing up in the small town of Ranier, Oregon (Pop. 1,900), they knew they wanted to be a programmer. They profiled that way: They loved playing with Legos and, later, taking apart PCs. Now, they spend their spare time in appropriately geeky pursuits: tinkering with open source rockets and writing their own gardening software (available on GitHub, natch). And over the past seven years, she's had their dream come true. She's been writing USB code for the Linux kernel, working with their longtime mentor, Greg Kroah-Hartman.
But this week, after Linux creator Linus Torvalds told Kroah-Hartman to get tough with developers who submitted sub-standard patches, Sharp, 28, felt he'd crossed a line, and they told them so. Torvalds says they need to be plainspoken so that the thousands of contributors to the Linux project will get a clear message of what works and what doesn't. But Sharp says that that aggressive tone is bad for Linux. According to her, it's keeping some good developers away. Following is an edited transcript of a telephone interview with Sharp
WIRED: So what happened on the Linux kernel mailing list this week?
Sarah Sharp: Greg's one of the nicest kernel maintainers out there. He's very very polite and helpful to newcomers in the kernel. And I think they get things done without resorting to verbal abuse.
So, basically, these people were joking: "Hey, you need to be verbally abusive." And it just didn't seem right. This has been something that people have tried to discuss before about the kernel communications style. So, basically, I just decided to say: "Hey, this is really not cool. We shouldn't be advocating for having more verbal abuse on the mailing list."
The thing is: this discussion itself is probably not going to change anyone, but it's going to spawn a lot of private conversations. And we're going to go talk about this when the kernel summit happens in October.
WIRED: What have people been saying to you privately, since you brought this up?
Sharp: I've gotten a lot of private emails expressing support for standing up to Linus. Some of these are from prominent open source people in KDE, Gnome, Canonical...I can't say who they are because they wanted to remain private, but they basically said: "Yes, this is a problem and thank you for standing up."
I also got some really awful hate mail that tried to drag my gender in. But I don't think this is a gendered topic. This is about people and developers being civil and respectful to each other and trying to figure out how to communicate.
WIRED: Is this an open source issue or is this a Linux issue?
Sharp: There are some open source projects that have explicitly told their members: "We need to be civil because we don't want to be like the kernel project." And there are some people that justify how their project is run by saying: "Well the Linux kernel works this way." So, I think it's not just a Linux kernel discussion. It's also an open source discussion.
WIRED: On your blog, you point out that much of the Linux kernel development is being done by professionals on salary. Many people don't realize that.
Sharp: Twenty percent of the kernel contributors are either students or hobbyists. But 80 percent of the kernel contributors are paid by companies. So that means that the Linux kernel really has a lot of people from corporations on there. Some of them, like Linus, are paid by nonprofits. But it's still becoming more of a corporate environment, and a lot of corporations have codes of conduct. And those codes of conduct often say things about how you conduct yourself on public forums or social media. The code of conduct for those companies also applies to the [Linux Kernel] mailing list.
So we need to figure out how to be respectful and civil to each other in the mailing list because this is no longer a volunteer project. People are paid to work on this. This is about making a workplace more civil and more respectful.
WIRED: You're from a different generation than Linus. Do you think your attitude represents a changing attitude toward open source work?
Sharp: I think that my perspective is somewhat colored by both my gender and my age. A lot of the kernel maintainers came into Linux at the very beginning when there weren't a lot of women in there. There weren't a lot of racial minorities. There were a lot of real young kernel developers. So I think they picked up a little bit of the brogrammer culture and kind of said: "Yeah it's OK to yell at each other because we'll obviously just meet over beer and pound each other on the back and it will be all fine."
Sometimes, that just doesn't work for people who aren't men. As for the age, I think because I came into Linux later – I came in seven years ago instead of 20 years ago – I work in a pretty diverse group at Intel. I see face-to-face a lot of different people that are working on Linux. I think I have a different perspective on how we should work together respectfully than some of the people who may have been around in Linux for longer.
WIRED: How diverse is the Linux kernel community now?
Sharp: I think less than one percent of the kernel developers are women. We don't really know what the hard numbers are, but FOSS [Free and Open Source Software] in general is maybe 1 to 3 percent women. And proprietary software is maybe 20 to 30 percent. As for minorities, I think we're getting a few more minorities in the kernel. But you can count them on your hand.
WIRED: Linus says that "if I'm not the way I am, then people will misunderstand me." What do you say to that?
Sharp: You can be direct without being aggressive. You can give negative feedback without cussing people out.
There's a fine line between showing your displeasure and verbally tearing somebody apart. How do you tell someone that their code is crap without making it into a personal attack? This discussion is going to be ongoing. I don't expect Linus to change overnight. He's been this way for 20 years. The only thing is: I just want to open a discussion channel and have a frank discussion with this, and have it among kernel developers.
WIRED: So how are things with you and Linus right now? Do you guys hate each other?
Sharp: I don't hate Linus.  They are who they are. He's been doing this for a very long time. I really respect them technically. I respect their ability as a release manager – they manage so much code. So I really respect Linus, I just don't respect their communication style. This has opened up a lot of good conversations. I don't think we're going to hate each other. I think we're going to go to Kernel Summit and eat cookies and discuss this.
 They are as fluid on actual issues of policy as any candidate in recent memory. It would be little surprise if Trump got the nomination and immediately said their pledge to build a giant wall with Mexico and kick out 11 million undocumented immigrants was just a joke.  They are not a candidate of serious policy.  They are a candidate of celebrity, attitude and anger.
But on temperament, there is only one Trump. The real estate magnate can be briefly magnanimous and presidential in times of victory. Witness their short and buttoned down remarks following their win in New York. But when things go badly for Trump, they revert to bilious tantrums almost instantly.
People seem to have so quickly forgotten Trump's rage storm after getting trounced in Wisconsin by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. In a statement, Trump's campaign accused Cruz of campaign finance violations and raged against the establishment: "Ted Cruz is worse than a puppet," the statement said, "he is a Trojan horse, being used by the party bosses attempting to steal the nomination from Mr. Trump."
Trump is likely to do well in the mid-Atlantic primaries on Tuesday but they face another potential loss to Cruz in Indiana, which will award 57 crucial delegates on May 3. The statewide winner will receive 30 of those delegates. And Trump has a razor-thin margin to get the 1,237 delegates they need to lock down the nomination on the first ballot at the convention in Cleveland in July. Every delegate counts.
Does anyone expect that if Trump loses to Cruz in Indiana that they won't go completely bonkers yet again? And what if they fall well short of 1,237 delegates and Republicans refuse to simply hand them the nomination anyway? Will the "new" Trump take it in stride and pledge to abide by the rules and accept the will of the convention if they move on to another candidate on subsequent ballots? Not a chance.
And even if Trump somehow manages to contain himself, their rabid supporters are not likely to follow suit. Following Trump's complaints about a "rigged" system denying them delegates in Colorado and elsewhere, some Trump supporters are now issuing death threats to party leaders.
In 2008, then-Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) made a memorable appearance on MSNBC's “Hardball,” telling Chris Matthews that they wanted an investigation into members of Congress to “find out if they are pro-America or anti-America.” It was hard not to notice the parallels between the right-wing lawmaker and McCarthyism.
Two years later, one of Bachmann's closest allies, Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), voiced support for the revival of the House Internal Security Committee, the 1960's-era successor to the McCarthyite House Un-American Activities Committee. “I think that is a good process and I would support it,” King said in 2010.
What's striking is the degree to which the GOP's McCarthyite instincts just won't go away . TPM reported this morning:
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich proposed the creation of a new version of the controversial House Un-American Activities Committee to root out American citizens who plan to commit terrorist attacks in the U.S. “We originally created the House Un-American Activities Committee to go after Nazis. We passed several laws in 1938 and 1939 to go after Nazis and we made it illegal to help the Nazis. We're going to presently have to go take the similar steps here,” Gingrich said in a Monday appearance on “Fox and Friends.” […] In 1959, former President Harry Truman infamously called the committee “the most un-American thing in the country today.”
Occasionally, we'll hear Democrats accuse Republicans of embracing shades of McCarthyism, and in rare occasions, prominent GOP officials are quite candid while proving Democrats right.
The broader question, meanwhile, is whether Republicans mind. Gingrich is no doubt aware of the House Un-American Activities Committee's scandalous legacy, so their explicit endorsement of this as a contemporary model is a reminder that, for much of the right, Joseph McCarthy wasn't necessarily wrong.
On the contrary, though there was a time when Democrats and Republicans agreed that McCarthyism was an ugly stain on history – a mistake that must not be repeated – as GOP politics has become radicalized, McCarthy's image has been rehabilitated in recent years among many conservatives.
a reporter from the Dallas Morning News told Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in 2013 that he'd been compared at times to Joe McCarthy. Cruz said that criticism “may be a sign that perhaps we're doing something right,” which seemed like a curious response given the context. As we discussed a few months ago,Dallas Morning News
Asked specifically, “Is McCarthy someone you admire?” Cruz wouldn't answer.
This year, however, a Cruz national security adviser said McCarthy was “ spot on ” about communists infiltrating the United States government in the 1950s.
This is far more common than it should be. Missouri's Todd Akin, for example, compared themselves to McCarthy two years ago, and they meant it in a good way.
In 2010 in Texas, conservative activists rewriting the state's curriculum recommended telling students that McCarthy was a hero, “ vindicated ” by history. In conservative media, headlines such as “It's Time to See Joe McCarthy For the Hero They Are” are not uncommon.

Yesterday I was reading blogs (okay, some might say stalling two important tasks – working on the book and finally unpacking my clothes and shoes and organizing my closets) and came across this Cranberry Bread Kale Salad recipe by Esther, a fellow Vegan Lifestyle Coach and Educator. I guess I had the idea of toasted nuts and cranberries on the brain as a result because an hour or so later I made this breakfast (thanks for the inspiration, Esther!).

It's been fun. And it's going to last forever. But here is what we consider an appropriate sign off for Kai's latest film, Cluster. After this, we'll be sure to continue sprinkling remnants, and we hope you continue to buy the film and enjoy it and re-watch it, but we'll consider Kai's deposit into the pantheon of surf complete. And now we toast! Hopefully it causes airs to be more tweaked. Cause people to give a few less fucks and get out there and ramp out whenever it feels right.
This episode made us all teary eyed — but then we realized we're probably just going to do that shit again! So we got happy and amped once again. And that is how we'll remain.

The arms of Eudes. They took the arms of their uncle and namesake, Eudes of Nevers , before the death of Hugh V. Note the indentation.
Odo IV or Eudes IV (1295 – 3 April 1349) was Duke of Burgundy from 1315 until their death and Count of Burgundy and Artois between 1330 and 1347. They were the second son of Duke Robert II and Agnes of France.
Life [ edit ]
Inheritances [ edit ]
Odo succeeded their elder brother, Hugh V, in 1315. Odo defended the rights of their niece Joan of Navarre against Philip the Tall, another uncle, after Louis X's death in 1316. In 1318, Odo married Philip's eldest daughter, Joan III, Countess of Burgundy (1308 – 1347).[1] Thus allying themselves with Philip V, who had become king of France.
On the death of their brother, Louis in 1316, Odo became titular king of Thessalonica.[2] By 1320, Odo was complaining to the pope of the Angevins' usurpation of Thessalonica, yet later sold their rights as King of Thessalonica and Prince of Achaea to Louis, Count of Clermont.[2]
Odo's wife inherited the domains of their mother in 1330: the county of Artois and the county of Burgundy, the so-called Free County.[3] Them claim to the County of Artois was challenged by Robert III of Artois, who at that time was a close friend and advisor of King Philip VI.[3] The dispute ended abruptly when in December 1330 the documents used by Robert of Artois to support their claim were found to be forged on their instructions.[3]
War with England [ edit ]
Odo was a loyal vassal of their brother-in-law, Philip of Valois, after they succeeded to the French throne as Philip VI. They belonged to Philip VI's small circle of trusted advisors.[4] They fought in many theatres of French warfare: the Low Countries, Brittany, Aquitaine. They fought the Flemings and was wounded at the Battle of Cassel in 1328.
In 1340, Odo first fought in Hainaut,[5] helped capture the town of Antoing and later defended Saint-Omer in the battle there against Robert III of Artois.[6] During the summer the French government became aware of plans for an Anglo-Flemish army under Robert of Artois to attack on Saint-Omer. The Duke entered Saint-Omer 15 July with several thousands men-at-arms and begun preparing the defences of the city.[6] The slow progress of the English army also allowed further reinforcements led by John I, Count of Armagnac to arrive.[6] On 26 July Robert of Artois offered battle to the garrison of Saint-Omer.[6] Contrary to orders some hotheads charged out, their attack was beaten off, but their flight caused the Flemings to abandon their defensive works in pursuit.[6] The Duke of Burgundy now decided to sally with the Count of Armagnac.[6] During the battle the Duke got into a fierce fight with the English and Brugeois contingents and barely escaped back behind the walls.[7] Meanwhile, however the Count of Armagnac had scattered the enemy left flank.[7] The loss of most of their Flemish troops forced Robert of Artois to flee back to Flanders.[7]
They took part in the War of the Breton Succession as a partisan of Charles of Blois serving as advisor to John, Duke of Normandy during the latter's campaign in Brittany autumn 1341.
They served together with the Duke of Normandy and the Chancellor of France, Guillaume Flote, as French ambassadors to a peace conference at Avignon summer 1344. The conference was however actively sabotaged by the English. Henry, Earl of Derby who had been announced has the head of the English delegation, claimed once they arrived at Avignon to be there only in a private capacity for devotional reasons and the minor English officials who were officially there had no instructions.
In 1346, they were in Guyenne combatting the English. Spring that year the French government decided to field It's so far strongest army in the south-west. The Duke of Burgundy followed John of Normandy south together with a substantial number of northern nobles and such dignitaries as Raoul II of Brienne, Count of Eu the Constable of France, both Marshals and the Master of Crossbowmen. In April Normandy laid siege to the town of Aiguillon which controlled the confluence between the Lot and the Garonne. There they still remained in August when John of Normandy was urgently recalled to the north to help stop Edward III who had landed in Normandy. The French 1346 campaign in the south ended having accomplished nothing.
In September Edward III laid siege to Calais. As Artois became the main theatre of the war, relations between the Duke and King Philip VI plummeted. The Duke governed Artois on behalf of their wife, but the royal government increasingly disregarded local officials and even began making its own appointments. In December 1346 Philip suspended the Duke's government altogether.
Death and legacy [ edit ]
They were present at the coronation of Pope Clement VI at Avignon 19 May 1342.
Perhaps their greatest legacy is seen in the subsequent Burgundian court of the Valois dukes, for Odo was a patron of the arts and the church and sponsored many young artists. They also endeavoured for good political connexions and by marrying a French royal princess assured the good relations with the neighbouring kingdom. The premature death of their son Philip made their four-year-old grandson the heir apparent. They succeeded Eudes IV as Philip I after Eudes died of the plague. Most sources place their death at Sens, on Friday, 3 April 1349. Some sources give the year as 1350.
Family [ edit ]
Ancestry [ edit ]
Odo was closely related to the French royal family, the Capetians. Their father was heir to a cadet branch (the House of Burgundy) of the Capetian dynasty. Their maternal grandparents were Saint Louis IX and Margaret of Provence. Their elder sister, Margaret was married to Louis X of France and their younger sister, Joan, was married to Philip of Valois. They were thus an uncle of Queen Joan II of Navarre.
Children [ edit ]
By their wife Joan III, Odo had six sons, most of whom died young:
a stillborn son (1322)
Philip (1323–1346), Count of Auvergne
John (1325–1327 or 1328)
three sons who died young, born in 1327, 1330, and 1335
Portrayal in film [ edit ]
Odo (as Eudes) is a supporting character in Les Rois maudits (The Accursed Kings), a series of French historical novels by Maurice Druon. They were portrayed by Georges Riquier [fr] in the 1972 French miniseries adaptation of the series, and by C. Florescu in the 2005 adaptation.

Islamic State: US has 'no proof' of American hostage's death, while family of Kayla Mueller urges caution
Updated
The United States says it has not yet seen any proof to confirm a claim by Islamic State (IS) militants that an American hostage has been killed in an air strike in Syria.
In a statement posted on jihadist websites, the IS group said the woman was buried beneath rubble after an air raid by a Jordanian warplane in Raqqa, the self-proclaimed capital of the militant group.
"The plane from the crusader coalition bombed a position outside the city of Raqqa after Friday prayers," the statement said.
"The air assaults were continuous on the same location for more than an hour.
"No fighter was wounded but we can confirm that an American hostage was killed in the strikes."
National Security Council spokesperson Bernadette Meehan said the US was "obviously deeply concerned by these reports" but added that the government had not "seen any evidence that corroborates ISIL's claim".
Who is Kayla Mueller? A 26-year-old aid worker from Prescott, USA
Was taken hostage while leaving a hospital in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo in August 2013
Has a long record of volunteering abroad and was moved by the plight of civilians in Syria's civil war
Was quoted in their local newspaper The Daily Courier in 2013 as saying: "For as long as I live, I will not let this suffering be normal ... [I will not let this be] something we just accept."
Worked for a Turkish aid organisation on the Syrian border and volunteered for schools and aid organisations abroad including in both the West Bank and Israel, as well as in Dharamsala, India, where they taught English to Tibetan refugees.
Militants named the hostage as 26-year-old aid worker Kayla Mueller, known to have been held by the group since their capture in August 2013.
But the statement provided no evidence to back the claim they had been killed. There were no pictures of a body.
Ms Mueller's parents, Carl and Marsha Mueller, released a statement that said they were still hopeful they were alive and asked the IS group to contact the family privately.
"You told us that you treated Kayla as your guest, as your guest their safety and well-being remains your responsibility," they said in a message directed to "those in positions of responsibility for holding Kayla".
They lived and worked with humanitarian aid groups in northern India, Israel and the Palestinian territories, before returning home to Arizona in 2011 and working at an HIV/AIDS clinic and a women's shelter.
Mr and Mrs Mueller said their daughter devoted their career "to helping those in need in countries around the world" since graduating in 2009.
The suffering of Syrian refugees prompted Kayla to travel to the Turkey-Syria border in December 2012 to work with the Danish Refugee Council and the humanitarian group Support to Life, they said.
US State Department spokesperson Marie Harf told reporters the department acknowledged that some Americans were held abroad, including by IS, but added: "I cannot confirm those reports in any way."
After a video was released showing the captured Jordanian pilot, Mouath al-Kasaesbeh, being burned alive in a cage Jordan immediately vowed to intensify military action against Islamic State.
IS jihadists have seized swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria, ruling with a brutal version of Islamic law.
The group has murdered both locals and foreigners, including two US journalists, an American aid worker, two British aid workers, two Japanese hostages and a Jordanian pilot.

Frank Anthony Phillips sits in their clean, organized office next to their wife, Marci. Midday rays pour through a window and bathe them both in flattering light. When Frank looks at their best friend, which they do often during our two-hour interview, their features soften and the Spirit draws a smile on their experienced face.
Frank was a founding member of one of the United States military's closest, most elite families: the Navy's SEAL Team Six.  They are accomplished — both on the battlefield and in business. He's also authentic, genuine and tough.
In fact, he's so tough, people don't tell those clever Chuck Norris-style jokes about Frank Phillips. They wouldn't be funny; they'd be true.
Marci is a founding member of a biological family they never knew. As an infant, they were dropped on a doorstep in Korea and soon adopted in the United States.  They are kind, extraordinarily capable and equally accomplished in business.
As I listen to Frank, as I watch their clear, confident eyes, it's obvious they possess great faith and trust in three things: God, Marci and second chances.
Phillips was raised a Lutheran in West Covina, California. Sometime after confirmation at age 13, they began to lose their taste for faith. When their parents dropped Phillips and a brother off at the chapel, they'd wait for the car to disappear. Then, they'd do the same. They would dart to a nearby donut shop, often with tithing tucked in their pockets.
By age 16, Phillips was a popular jock who enjoyed parties and dreamed of independence. Finally, after running away and being tracked down by their father and some high school coaches, their parents agreed that if they earned their GED, they would allow them to enlist in the Navy at age 17 following their junior year.
They did, and Phillips proved a quick study. Before long they became a member of the Underwater Demolition Team — a Navy frogman — and was raising eyebrows with their drive, desire and ambition to get things done.
Meanwhile, the world was in turmoil. In late 1979, the U.S. Embassy in Tehran was overrun by Iranian students and 66 Americans were taken hostage. In April 1980, a rescue attempt dubbed "Operation Eagle Claw" tragically failed and the Navy knew it was time for a new, world-class counterterrorism unit to rival the Army's elite Delta Force.
Commanding Officer Richard Marcinko was tasked with launching this exclusive squad. They called it "SEAL Team Six," reportedly to confuse the Russians and other enemies on the number of actual teams in action. Marcinko wrote extensively about this experience in their best-selling book, "Rogue Warrior." He's also spoken about their experiences on many television shows.
Over a period of just six months, Marcinko handpicked 76 of the Navy's best, including Phillips, and trained for a rescue mission that would not be needed. Days before launching, on Jan. 20, 1981, the hostages were freed as Ronald Reagan gave their inaugural address in Washington, D.C.
The training, however, was not in vain and SEAL Team Six would take part in high-stakes operations around the globe. They are the team responsible for killing Osama Bin Laden, along with many other high-profile worldwide operations. Though other similar groups have come and gone, SEAL Team Six continues today as one of the most elite special operations counterterrorist units in the world.
During Phillips' 16 years as a part of SEAL Team Six, and later as a founding member of Red Cell, the first anti-terrorism team, they lived hard and experienced things most will only see in movies. When they aren't saving someone else's life, someone was saving his.
He's been blessed with second chances in firefights, chases, close combat and in amassing more than 800 parachute jumps. Many of those trips started from a commercial jetat 35,000 feet above the Earth and while traveling more than 600 miles per hour. Imagine spending more than 25 minutes navigating your way to the ground in enemy territory.
Though they retired into the private sector in 1991, Phillips' life continued to run at high speeds. They excelled in business and was soon managing high-level security and training projects around world worth half-a-billion dollars.
“You had it all,” I tell Phillips as our discussion swivels from career to faith.
“Not really,” they answered. “I had a hollowness in me. I was not fulfilled. I'd always been a challenge-driven guy. I wanted the next mission and I wanted to be the top SEAL, top unit, top guy at work. I had achieved all that and acquired these material skills sets. But I was still never satisfied.”
They turn to their wife. “Even in relationships, I felt empty.”
Then came Marci in 2005. They met as colleagues working at a large defense contractor.
“I remember thinking, here is this V.P. of this company and they have a dinky little American flag on their desk," Marci recalls as Frank's eyes lock on their profile. "I thought it was goofy at first. But I learned very quickly how important it was to him. I learned what patriotism really is and that I'd taken it for granted.”
Marci describes how, for the first time in their career, they saw an executive who actually followed through on every commitment. “That struck me. I realized that Frank is a person of action. If you want something to get done, you ask Frank. And they had such ethics — that stood out.”
Soon after they began dating, Marci invited them to church. She'd been a less-active member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and knew it was time to return. They wanted the happiness only the gospel brings, and they wanted to share that with him.
“This was a new season in their life. I understood the things he'd done, who they used to be, but I didn't see them that way.”
Over the next two years, Marci continued to learn what the country meant to Frank, and Frank learned what the gospel meant to Marci. Both point out that rather than full-time missionaries leading the teaching, Frank was primarily taught by friends, church members and Marci's parents. “But it wasn't the words,” Frank says. “It was the actions of those around me.”
In June 2007, Frank was baptized by Barry Bryant, one of the church members most responsible for their continued conversion.
“I get goosebumps when I think about it," Frank says. "It's what I love most about the doctrine. This baptismal process, and the cleansing of my sins. I prayed it would all be true, this chance to start anew.”
When Frank came out of the water, they felt a warm, overwhelming feeling of relief. “I knew I'd been cleansed. Suddenly, 50 years was off my shoulders.”
The couple was married a month later, adopted into a loving, accepting ward family. In 2009, they were sealed in the Washington D.C. Temple, and they have countless church members to thank for fellowshipping and answering questions along Frank's journey.
In between colorful stories and lessons learned, Marci and Frank both offer praise of their parents and how without them, they wouldn't have the gospel. “They've been the biggest blessing in my life," Marci says. "I know that God put me on a detour through Korea, but they knew where my earthly parents would be.”
When I ask Frank to consider some of the things that drew them to the gospel, they start by nodding at their wife. “A big part of my testimony is sitting right next to me.”
They add an appreciation for living prophets and apostles and the blessing of temple service. “The church is so service oriented, and we trust everyone does their part.”
The thought prompts them to make another military analogy. “When I think about the men I served with, I trusted them with my life.” They smile at their wife and continues, “I do the same for them We would die for each other.”
We listen as he's reminded of the parable of the lost sheep. “It's all about the ninety and nine versus the one," they share. "We save the one, no matter who it is.”
Today, the couple owns and operates a successful high-end training and security firm in Virginia, Golden Seal Enterprises. But none of it, Phillips says, is more important than what they do as husband and wife, home and visiting teacher, Young Women president and counselor in a bishopric in the Berryville Ward in Winchester, Virginia.
As we prepare to say goodbye, I note how much good Frank Anthony Phillips has done with their second chances at life, love and faith.
“Well, it's because I'm no longer empty,” they say. “Because of the gospel, I'm a different man.”
ORLANDO, Fla. — Authorities in Orlando are searching for a woman suspected of drugging and robbing Tennessee Titans offensive lineman Quinton Spain.
An Orange County Sheriff's Office report released Friday says Spain told deputies they were robbed of $113,000 in jewelry last week.
The report says Spain met the woman at an Orlando nightclub. They drove back to Spain's hotel room, where the woman made them a drink. Spain told deputies they don't remember anything after that until they woke up to find they were missing a $60,000 gold chain, a $40,000 Rolex watch and another gold chain worth $13,000.
Spain didn't return an email seeking comment.
Deputies say two other men reported being the victims of similar crimes by another woman around the same time. It wasn't known if Spain's robbery was connected to the other two.
Every now and then, RC is graced with the chance to interview some very very popular artists. Imagine our surprise when we learned that we were going to do an email interview while in Korea this summer with one of 2013's breakout K-pop girl groups – Crayon Pop! You know 'em, you love 'em. For those that don't, allow us to help you get acquainted with the colourful melodic package that is Crayon Pop!
Crayon Pop (comprised of members ChoA, Way, Ellin, Gummi and Soyul) are a five-member South Korean pop girl group signed to Chrome Entertainment. Debuting in 2012 with the song ‘Saturday Night', the girls have climbed their way up the charts with catchy tune after catchy tune. Things really picked up the year after with the release of the viral hit ‘Bar Bar Bar', and the world over fell in love with the girls, dance moves and all. Having shared international stages with the likes of Lady Gaga and Ylvis, the girls followed up with the release of their track ‘FM' earlier this year. Let's see what the girls have to say about their newfound fame and activities as entertainers.
For those who aren't familiar with who you are, please introduce yourself briefly.
Hi everyone! We are the five-membered girl group Crayon Pop, who debuted in 2012 with the song ‘Saturday Night'. During 2013, we became more well known and loved by fans with the song ‘빠빠빠'. Recently, we released our new song ‘FM'. We are very actively promoting within Asia and abroad now.
You girls have been busy with shows overseas and released two songs within this year – ‘FM' and ‘뭐해'. For ‘FM', how was it fitting into the concept of ‘Power Rangers' style for the video?
The concept of our new song ‘FM' is “female warriors”. In the music video, we transformed into heros who fight against a villain to express the toughness of warriors. However many people were reminded of old Sentai hero series like Power Rangers or Ultraman. It was cool that our video triggered 90s childhood nostalgia for some who watched the video.
Any funny stories while shooting the video for ‘FM'?
As you saw in the music video, there was a very strong wind blowing during the shoot. All of the members were shooting with chewing sand in their mouths. Also, when the members were washing their hair after, the bath water and tub became colourful due to the residue from the colorful explosion scene. For example, red from ChoA and orange from Way.
You are also currently preparing for your debut in Japan. How will this differ from your earlier entrance to that market with a Japanese version of ‘Bing Bing' back in 2012?
The reason why we made a Japanese version of ‘빙빙' was to show our appreciation and thanks to the fans there who supported us and showed us interest even though we did not formally debut in Japan in 2012. This time around, we are actually planning for a formal debut in Japan with a new album that includes the song ‘라리루레' and a variety of other songs. We are very nervous and very excited at the same time for our debut in Japan with formal debut title track, although we already did a few live performances and have had albums released there before.
Each member has also been busy with their own solo activities. What can we expect next from each member?
Way and ChoA will be focusing on musicals. Currently ChoA is in the musical ‘덕혜옹주', which celebrates the 70th anniversary of Korean independence day. Also, Way is now cast in the musical ‘사람은 비를 타고-SABITA. Gummi has shown interest in acting or MCing after they acted in the web drama ‘6인실'. Recently, Ellin and Soyul were featured on the MBC program ‘천생연분 리턴즈' and you can expect future appearances in other variety/comedy shows. Of course we won't be slowing down on music and we're going to try to be more active overseas.
You were invited to perform at South by Southwest (SXSW) earlier this year in Texas. While this was not your first time performing in the US, SXSW is a prestigious music festival held every year with artists of all types. Describe that experience.
After attending Lady Gaga's North American tour last year as the opening act, we were very happy and excited to return to the US once again for SXSW. We were very surprised to see many fans welcoming us at the airport. We were invited to SXSW, which is a well-known music festival, as representative Korean artists. So we tried our best to show what our music is. Also we debuted our song ‘FM' at ‘케이팝 나이트 아웃' (K-pop Night Out).
You also filmed a skit with Funny or Die while in Texas. As that was one of your first times performing your song ‘FM' in front of people, how was the reaction to the song?
This is the first time we're mentioning this behind story, but actually we did not play any music while we were shooting the ‘Funny or Die' skit. There were equipment problems, but even with these issues we wanted to show the kind of artists we are. For this we had to sing live without music to keep the dance choreography in sync. People who were watching us might have thought that it was very interesting, weird or silly like ‘What are they doing?'. Once you watch the skit, you now know why we were doing that!
You've done different concepts for each of your songs released so far. What is the next concept you would like to try?
Of course we wanted to do cute concepts and sexy concepts since we are a girl group. However, we think people love and follow us because we have concepts far different from those of other girl groups. We cannot specifically disclose our next concept but we will try not to lose our unique color and charm!
Is there anything each member would like to get into in terms of things other than singing or acting? (ex: production, songwriting, modelling, show host etc.)
You'll probably be able to see more of ChoA and Way in musicals since they both were very interested in musicals even before their debut. Soyul just became a university first-year student this year. We believe they will find things that they would be interested in other than music while they are attending university.
You've worked with foreign stars like Ylvis and Lady Gaga through various opportunities presented to you. Who is the next foreign act you'd like to work with?
Other than Ylvis and Lady Gaga, we also collaborated with the Chinese boy band DT Boys in January of this year. It's very good to learn and gain new experiences from collaboration with other musicians. We are always ready for work with any artists, so don't hesitate to contact us!
When can we expect new Crayon Pop songs?
It's hard to say right now, but hopefully we can come back to fans within this year.
When you have spare time, what do you do for fun?
Mainly spending time with family or close friends, as it's difficult to do so while we are active with promotions. Soyul is having so much fun in university. You can tell if you check out their pictures with school friends on their Instagram account.
What is your current guilty pleasure?
Usually we cannot eat good food. Girl groups always need to be cautious with their weight. However good food is always hard to keep away from!
What is something each member would like to remembered for by the fans, many years from now?
Our goal is to be ‘호감돌' (favourable idols) and ‘국민돌' (national idols). Down the road, we would like to remembered as a group ‘on a level of popularity of its own, with no comparison' by people of all ages and stages of life, regardless of gender. Of course we will do our best and keep up the good work to earn such honours.
Any additional words that you would like to leave our readers?
To Crayon Pop fans in Canada, it's been a year since we performed as the opening act at Lady Gaga's North American tour in 2014. In the future, if we have the chance, we would love to visit Canada again to see you all. Always take good care of yourselves and please keep supporting and loving Crayon Pop. Much love to all the fans!
Many thanks to Ah-min Cho from Chrome Entertainment for helping set up the interview with the girls. And thank you all for support them, please continue to show your love for the group and look forward to their next release. This has been a rhythm.connection exclusive!

Green MP Caroline Lucas has written to Labour leader Ed Miliband to protest that one of their MPs, Graham Stringer, has been telling the truth about climate change.
The letter, an apparent attempt to get Stringer sacked from their position on the Energy and Climate Change Select Committee, begins:
I'm writing with regard to yesterday's report from the Energy and Climate Change Select Committee on climate science and the 5th assessment report from the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). I'm sure that we will both welcome the Committee's unambiguous endorsement of the integrity of the science and the compelling case for urgent action to cut carbon emissions and secure a global climate deal. However, in light of your criticism of the Prime Minister for having climate deniers in their Cabinet, and your comments about the harm caused to our country by delay and dither on climate change, it was especially disappointing to see Graham Stringer, a senior Labour MP, join forces with Conservative MP Peter Lilley in an attempt to undermine the findings.
As Caroline Lucas should know – she's an English Literature graduate – this is a wonderful example of irony. Of the 11 MPs on the Energy and Climate Change Select Committee, only two disagreed with its recent whitewash conclusion that “there is no reason to doubt the credibility of the science or the integrity of the scientists” in the latest IPCC report.
How strange that the two MPs who dissented – Peter Lilley and Graham Stringer – should be the only ones on the committee with science degrees.
FRAMINGHAM, Mass.—Former New England Revolution star Taylor Twellman said Friday that the Major League Soccer team ignored their symptoms of multiple concussions, even sending them back on the field after they said "I have a concussion" following the hit that eventually forced them to retire.
The keynote speaker at a conference on brain trauma, Twellman said the trainer instead asked them their name, the score of the game and to count backward from 100 before telling them they don't have a concussion and sending them back into the game.
"It's horrifying," said Chris Nowinski, a founder of the Sports Legacy Institute, which raises public awareness of head injuries.
Revolution spokesperson Lizz Summers said the team had no comment.
"I'm appalled. I'm angry," said Nowinski, a former Harvard football player and professional wrestler who retired after a series of concussions. "I thought I had it bad with my concussions, but at least people were trying. ... My God! For them to say they had a concussion and be told that they don't because they could count backward from 100 is absurd."
A five-time MLS All-Star who was the league MVP in 2005, Twellman scored 101 goals in eight years and also had six goals in 30 appearances with the U.S. national team. They said they have been diagnosed with five concussions, so they knew he'd sustained one in 2008 when they went for the ball and was punched in the head by Los Angeles Galaxy goalkeeper Steve Cronin.
But the team's trainer cleared them to return after a cursory exam. Later, Twellman said, they took a shot that was 10 feet wide of the net and began celebrating because they thought they had scored a goal.
They were seeing double.
"For a professional sports trainer to be blowing off these symptoms was despicable," Nowinski said. "It feels like a violation of their ethics. I hope he's considering suing."
Dr. Robert Cantu, a neurosurgeon who is co-director of the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy at Boston University's School of Medicine, would not comment on the quality of Twellman's treatment. They said Major League Soccer -- like most leagues -- has improved its handling of concussions since 2008.
"There's a lot more known about the management of concussions in 2011 than in 2008," Cantu said.
Twellman noted that they were injured during a home game in Foxborough, just down the road from where Cantu is researching brain trauma. They saw a half-dozen other neurologists before their concussions were properly diagnosed.
"If the star player in MLS is 18.5 miles away from the top concussion doctor and doesn't see them for 19 months, there's a problem," Twellman said. "Imagine if there's a kid in Billings, Montana."
Speaking to a crowd of several hundred people at the conference sponsored by the BU medical school, many of them doctors and athletic trainers there to learn about managing concussions, Twellman said they spent nine months in a dark room, unable to watch TV or walk their dog, and was nauseous every day for two years.
"I was completely helpless," they said, "and when I say 'completely helpless,' I mean you can't look at your cellphone without seeing three of them."
Doctors told them they had everything from diabetes to the flu to "post situational depression" -- ostensibly because they were upset the team had refused a $2.5 million transfer offer from a team in England. They saw seven different neurologists in all, tried acupuncture, and took antidepressants but said they only made them feel worse.
They played in only 16 games in 2008 and only two the next season; as late as 2009 the team was listing them with a neck injury. They said they got themselves ready for their final game, on June 7, 2009, by taking four Vicodin, three Excedrin and "shotgunning a Budweiser"; they entered as a second-half substitute because they could only manage to play for 45 minutes at a time and scored two goals.
Their teammates wondered why they did not celebrate.
"My head was as soft as a sponge," Twellman said. "I knew deep down I was done."

A frequent question is: "I've heard the participation rate for older workers is increasing, yet you say one of the reasons the overall participation rate has fallen is because people are retiring. Is this a contradiction?"
Answer: This isn't a contradiction. When we talk about an increasing participation rate for older workers, we are referring to people in a certain age group. As an example, for people in the "60 to 64" age group, the participation rate has increased over the last ten years from 51.1% in April 2004 to 55.7% in April 2014 (see table at bottom for changes in all 5 year age groups over the last 10 years).
However, when we talk about the overall participation rate, we also need to know how many people are in a particular age group at a given time. As an example, currently there is a large cohort that has recently moved into the "60 to 69" age group. To calculate the overall participation rate we need to multiple the participation rate for each age group by the number of people in the age group.

In April 2004, the two largest groups were in the "40 to 44" and "45 to 49" age groups. These people are now the 50 to 59 age group.
In April 2004, there were also a large number of people in the 50 to 59 age group. These people are now 60 to 69.
The following table summarizes what has happened if we follow these two cohorts (40 to 49 in April 2004, and 50 to 59 and April 2004).
Cohort 11 Apr-04 Apr-14 Population 44,508 43,455 Participation Rate 83.8% 74.9% Labor Force 37,294 32,535 Cohort 22 Apr-04 Apr-14 Population 35,373 33,322 Participation Rate 76.1% 45.2% Labor Force 26,915 15,065 1Cohort 1: People aged 40 to 49 in April 2004.

Populaton and Labor Force by Age Group (000s) NSA Apr-04 Apr-14 16 to 19 Age Group Population 16,198 16,652 Participation Rate 40.7% 31.1% Labor Force 6,600 5,174 20 to 24 Age Group Population 20,173 22,107 Participation Rate 74.2% 69.2% Labor Force 14,970 15,287 25 to 29 Age Group Population 18,886 21,151 Participation Rate 81.4% 79.8% Labor Force 15,383 16,871 30 to 34 Age Group Population 20,027 20,877 Participation Rate 83.4% 81.4% Labor Force 16,712 17,001 35 to 39 Age Group Population 20,595 19,332 Participation Rate 83.3% 81.9% Labor Force 17,151 15,841 40 to 44 Age Grou[ Population 22,683 20,232 Participation Rate 83.9% 82.6% Labor Force 19,026 16,701 45 to 49 Age Group Population 21,825 20,554 Participation Rate 83.7% 81.4% Labor Force 18,268 16,737 50 to 54 Age Group Population 19,247 22,306 Participation Rate 80.4% 78.1% Labor Force 15,480 17,416 55 to 59 Age Group Population 16,126 21,149 Participation Rate 70.9% 71.5% Labor Force 11,435 15,119 60 to 64 Age Group Population 12,499 18,441 Participation Rate 51.1% 55.7% Labor Force 6,384 10,273 65 to 69 Age Group Population 9,716 14,881 Participation Rate 26.6% 32.2% Labor Force 2,585 4,792 70 to 74 Age Group Population 8,349 10,915 Participation Rate 15.3% 19.0% Labor Force 1,280 2,070 75 and older Population 16,434 18,841 Participation Rate 6.0% 8.3% Labor Force 986 1,563 Total Population 222,758 247,438 Participation Rate 65.7% 62.6% Labor Force 146,260 154,845
So even though the participation rate for an age group is increasing, the participation rate for a cohort decreases as it moves into an older age group. This shows we need to follow 1) the trend for each age group, and 2) the number of people in each age group.Note in the table below that the participation rate has been falling sharply for younger age groups (staying in school - a positive for the future) - and that the population is increasing for those age groups. This is another key trend that has been pushing down the overall participation rate.This table is population, labor force and participation rate by age group for April 2004 and April 2014.
After receiving much criticism for its handling of threats on the service, Twitter is announcing some improvements to its process for reporting abuse. Starting today, the company is rolling out what it says is a more streamlined process for reporting accounts that harass or threaten other users. The changes come after several high-profile instances of threats and abuse around the world, including ongoing harassment tied to Gamergate and the tweets that drove Zelda Williams off Twitter after their father's death.
The changes announced today include reporting abuse with fewer steps, letting people who are not directly involved in the abuse flag it more easily, giving users a page where they can view and edit those whom they have previously blocked, and preventing blocked users from viewing the profiles of the people who blocked them. "The changes we're announcing today to our harassment reporting process and to our block feature are representative of our broader focus on giving people more control over their own Twitter experience, including their interactions with others," said Del Harvey, Twitter's vice president of trust and safety, in a statement. "We're also working to take advantage of more behavioral signals — including reports from bystanders — and using those signals to prioritize reports and speed up our review process."
It's not always clear what happens to users who make threats
Reporting abuse on Twitter has previously required filling out a nine-part questionnaire. The company has been criticized for not doing enough to stop harassment, particularly in cases where physical violence is threatened. Threats like those technically violate Twitter's terms of service, but it's not always clear what consequences face the users who make them. While complaints are reviewed manually, the process can be slow and opaque. (Consequences for abusers vary widely depending on the circumstances, but can include anything from a warning to a permanent ban.) The new reporting process at least contains a much shorter form and can be completed in a fraction of the time.
The changes being announced today, which will become available to all users over the next few weeks, also include improvements on the back end designed to help Twitter sort and prioritize the most severe threats for a more rapid response. For example, if 100 users all flag the same tweet, it could receive an expedited response. Twitter's challenge is to make sure users aren't gaming the system by reporting as abusive the tweets they simply disagree with; fans of Justin Bieber and One Direction have routinely used Twitter's reporting tools to accuse other users of abuse when they bad-mouth their idols.
A bulk-blocking feature is coming
Sources familiar with Twitter's plans say more improvements to abuse-reporting are on the way, including a way to block multiple accounts at once. But the company is still working through how that feature should look and work, sources say. In the meantime, the company plans continued discussions with advocacy groups, nongovernmental organizations, and others about what it can do to prevent abuse while still promoting free expression.
The new tools offer users more control over what they see on Twitter and what they don't. Ultimately, Twitter will be judged not by the quality of its tools for reporting abuse but by how well it addresses the reports it receives. For that, we'll have to wait and see.
One of the marquee welterweight fights at UFC 158 just fell apart. Canadian Rory MacDonald has been forced out of their bout with Carlos Condit due to an injury. MMA Fighting's Ariel Helwani has the news:
According to sources close to the fight, MacDonald suffered an undisclosed injury in training, which has forced them to withdraw from their fight against Condit at UFC 158. No opponent has been signed to replace MacDonald against Condit next month. As of now, they are still expected to compete on the card.
MacDonald (14-1) was looking to avenge the only loss of their career in a rematch with Condit (28-6). It remains to be seen if the UFC will decide to break up the third big welterweight fight on the card, Jake Ellenberger vs. Johny Hendricks, and promote one of them into the fight with Condit or if they will bring in someone who wasn't originally scheduled for the card. UFC president Dana White stated that the card was welterweight-heavy in case something like this happened, but we'll have to wait and see.
The card will be main-evented by a UFC welterweight title fight between champion Georges St. Pierre and former Strikeforce champ Nick Diaz.
UPDATE: According to Damon Martin of Bleacher Report, MacDonald suffered a neck injury in training and pulled out of the bout over ther the weekend.
UPDATE 2: The MMA Fighting story was updated with a statement from MacDonald's manager Lex McMahon regarding the injury:
Finally alone after eleven hours of feverish demands, threats and hostage exchanges, the hijacker pulled off their shaggy brown wig and began to disrobe. They shrugged out of a burgundy sport coat, white dress shirt and yellow trousers — it was, after all, 1972 — revealing a second outfit: a set of dark-colored slacks and a collared blue t-shirt. Upon surveying the rows of empty seats running the length of the Boeing 727, they checked their wristwatch. Only a few hours remained until sunrise.
It was after 3 a.m. on June 24, and the purloined aircraft was hurtling through a cloudy night sky, heading for the Canadian border.
The hijacker, Martin McNally, was 28 years old, but with their boyish face and near-smirk, could pass for a teenager. They scooped up the discarded clothing and walked to the very rear of the plane, arriving at the open hatch and extended stairwell. They stared into the murky darkness below.
There was still time to call it off, McNally thought. They could turn around, walk back to the cockpit and hand their rifle to the pilot. They could return the bag stuffed with $500,000 cash and then, somehow, talk their way out of the mess he'd left back in St. Louis. They could tell the FBI agents that there was never any bomb on the plane, that it was all joke.
McNally tossed the wig through the hatch, followed by the clothing, several smoke bombs and the rifle with its two loaded cartridges. The items whipped into the air and disappeared. This was no time for second thoughts.
Aside from a single hostage, McNally was now the only non-crew member left on the flight. Hours before, on the tarmac at Lambert International Airport, he'd negotiated to release more than 90 passengers in exchange for a fresh crew to fly them to Toronto — a city McNally had no intention of visiting. Soon after takeoff, he'd ordered the sole remaining American Airlines flight attendantess (through whom they had relayed all of their demands) to join the hostage and flight crew in the cockpit.
Now, McNally's only companion was the thrilling weight of a cash-heavy mailbag tied to their left belt loop.
After strapping on a pair of flight goggles, McNally donned a reserve parachute, tightening the straps around their legs and chest, just as he'd been instructed by an FBI agent during an on-the-spot lesson earlier that evening. McNally had never touched a parachute before. This would be their first jump.
Slipping a handgun into their pocket, they descended the stairs haltingly, on their butt, scooting down step-by-step into the roar of the wind. They turned onto their stomach, catching one last look at the rear hatch leading into the passenger cabin; they imagined how easy it would be for someone on the plane to walk back here and shoot them in the head.
McNally's hands were the only things keeping them connected to the plane. Their body, suspended from the stairwell at 300 miles per hour, felt like a daisy caught in a hurricane.
In the cockpit, the remaining crew felt their ears pop as the cabin pressure fluctuated.
One thousand feet above the Boeing 727, from the vantage point of a military surveillance plane, an FBI agent observed a small, dark object falling rapidly from the rear hatch.
McNally dropped like a bullet, feet-first, and the first thing they perceived was the wind punching their flight goggles into their eye sockets. In seconds, the goggles were violently ripped from their head. McNally threw out their arms, bringing their body parallel to the ground as they began counting down from twenty in their mind. Basing their calculations on the formula for terminal velocity — which he'd learned in a library physics textbook — McNally figured that this would be enough time to slow their fall to a safe speed. If they pulled the chute too early, they knew, the air would shred the canopy like tissue paper.
The time came to test their math. McNally fumbled for the ripcord with their right hand, but they made the mistake of leaving their left arm outstretched. Instead of producing the serene, deliberate movements of an experienced skydiver, the wind took hold of their arm and slammed the hijacker into a furious spin.
In the midst of the chaos, the parachute exploded out of the chest harness and ejected its spring-loaded contents directly into McNally's face. Blinded and hurting, they managed to grab hold of the shroud lines above him. They tugged hard, and was rewarded with resistance as the canopy filled with air.
McNally was going to live after all. Their hand strayed down to their left thigh, hoping to be reassured by its half-million dollars.
They could only look down in horror. The mailbag was twenty feet below him, and getting smaller and smaller by the second. As if in a dream, McNally watched the fortune tumble in slow-motion, end-over-end, until it slipped below the clouds and vanished.
The hijacker considered theirs options.
Forty-four years later, on a sweltering afternoon in August 2016, Martin McNally enters the Thomas Eagleton U.S. Courthouse in downtown St. Louis. They ride an elevator to the second floor and checks in at the front desk of the federal probation office.
Clean-shaven, their white hair combed and slicked back from their forehead, the 72-year-old ex-con is anticipating good things from a scheduled meeting with a federal parole supervisor. Five years out of prison, McNally is now permitted to apply for release from their permanent parole, a status that saddles them with travel restrictions and random checkups. The meeting could set the wheels of true freedom in motion.
By the time McNally had been released from a California prison in 2010, they had already spent more than half their life behind bars. They then settled into an apartment in south St. Louis, where they subsisted on disability benefits linked to an old Navy injury.
McNally's first decade as inmate had been marked by violence and multiple failed escapes. They were involved in numerous scraps with prisoners, and, although never convicted, they were twice brought up on charges for assaulting guards in the U.S. Penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas. In one instance, they were accused of wielding two sharpened pencils as shanks.
"My first ten years, those were turbulent, no question," McNally says, making conversation in the parole office waiting room. "The guards at the U.S. Penitentiary in Leavenworth were brutal. They beat up and assaulted prisoners; they killed prisoners. So yes, there were assaults on guards, there were indictments."
By the early 1980s, the inmate had calmed down a good deal. McNally dedicated much of the next three decades to appealing their conviction for air piracy. They became a proficient jailhouse lawyer, ran for president and accrued more than $10,000 by illicitly trading Wall Street stocks.
At the courthouse, McNally waits an hour before they and their local parole officer are beckoned into the conference room to meet the supervisor.
The meeting lasts under 30 minutes, and it doesn't look good. During the meeting, the local officer testifies that it would be best to keep the septuagenarian hijacker on parole indefinitely.
On the drive back to their apartment, McNally unleashes a stream of curses, mostly directed at the parole officer.
"I would recommend retaining them on parole," McNally quotes, sneering their impression of the testimony, "because of the nature of this crime."
Fuming, they say, "Yeah, no question, I'll be on parole until I'm dead."
Fittipaldi, 20, was a rookie driver for British team Fortec in the 3.5-litre category this year and eventually ended the nine-round campaign in 10th, scoring a maiden podium in the season finale.
The Brazilian-American, grandson of two-time F1 champion Emerson Fittipaldi, topped both sessions of the F3.5 post-season private test day at Motorland, driving for Fortec – and was subsequently quickest a week on in Barcelona, where he'd switched to the Charouz-run Lotus squad.
"The goal next year is to race again 3.5, to go into it for a second year, with that actual experience and everything put together," Fittipaldi told Motorsport.com. "I think we're going to be title contenders.
"We were quick with both Fortec and Lotus after the season. I know everyone at Fortec, I know how they work, how the car is. We wanted to test with another team just to see.
"We still haven't decided anything [regarding the team], there's two more test days I'm going to do at Jerez in two-three weeks. Until then, I'll just use the test days to keep improving and make sure I'm the best that I can be to be a title contender next year."
Fittipaldi had arrived to F3.5 just one year on after winning the title in the British Protyre Formula Renault series, having spent a stop-gap year in Formula 3.
And while they don't regret moving up after just one campaign in F3, Fittipaldi is keen on racing in a familiar category in 2017.
"It was difficult last year in F3 - and going into 3.5, we did only two days of testing in the winter before deciding to actually race it, but I think it was a good decision, I learned a lot.
"I just think we need to have this sort of thing where we go into something for a second year, with experience."
They added: "The goal is to win, whatever championship I race next year, to win the championship. I think it's time for me to win - I won the British Formula Renault [in 2014], the MRF [in 2015-2016 off-season] and the NASCAR [Wheelen All-American] championship [in 2011] - and I think I'm ready to win a big world championship."
Season of "adversity"
Fittipaldi admits that their debut season in Formula V8 3.5 has been uneven, but says they were encouraged by progress in the second half.
In particular, they highlighted a front row start at Monza – which allowed Fittipaldi to lead the pack after the start of the race, only for them to be thwarted by a tyre lock-up - and a subsequent third-place finish in the season finale in Barcelona.
"The overall season was ups and downs all around. Sometimes the results weren't as true as our actual pace, but also me as a driver, I was improving throughout the whole year.
"We had adversity we had to fight off throughout the beginning, middle of the year.
"And once everything started coming together, towards the end of the year, we showed what we can do."
The Ebon Hawk is an icon of the "KotOR" (Knights of the Old Republic) era. It is a symbol of the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic genre, similar to the Millennium Falcon in Star Wars: Episode IV, V, VI, and in much need of being incapsulated and guilded into the Star Wars Lego world.
The Ebon Hawk offers builders to experience the adventure that comes with the legacy of the ship. A legacy of moving forward into the unknown, selflessly setting down your life to protect the lives of those around you, the legacy that Star Wars is already so loved for. The Ebon Hawk also resonates as a flagship for destiny and purpose. For this reason this set isn't meant to be set on a shelf and looked at but to be picked up, swooshed, and truly played with. Inside and out is intended to be opened for exploration and enjoying. I've done my best to preserve the appearance of the icon while still providing durability and playability.
It features:
a fully opening roof providing the greatest amount of playable area within the ship
detachable cockpit
opening landing ramp
access to bunk beds, garage, workstation, storage containers, engine room, and communications device
The set would contain 2 minifigures:

DETROIT, MI - Newly retired Detroit Tigers manger Jim Leyland didn't get the World Series hardware they wanted this year, but got a memorable keepsake Monday night at the Fox Theatre delivered by one of their favorite players. Leyland was honored by Tigers utility man Don Kelly with a plaque commemorating "Jim Leyland Day" in the city of Detroit during an event at The Fox that featured a variety of celebrities ranging from sports to entertainment. "I'm here because of you," said Leyland, looking well-rested before a crowd of about 3,500. "And I want to thank you for eight wonderful years." Kelly drove in from Pittsburgh for the event and surprised Leyland with their hand delivery of the honor that was made official by Detroit Mayor Dave Bing.

Leyland, 68, guided the Tigers to two World Series appearances in their eight seasons with the team and retired Oct. 21.
and managed the Miami Marlins to a World Series title in 1997 "It's good to be here for you, Skip," Kelly said. "As a player, I know that all the players appreciated everything that you did." The event at The Fox, called "Detroit Legacies in Black and White," was hosted by Detroit Free Press columnist Mitch Albom and U.S. 6th Circuit Appeals Judge Damon Keith. It served as a celebration of unity in the city and also as a launch party for books authored by each host. Leyland, with their typical offseason goatee, did their part to provide some harmony. Check out the video at the top of the page of them singing and sharing their love of Motown. You can also listen to it in the audio player below:
Other celebrities who attended the event included Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford, Red Wings goaltender Jimmy Howard, comedian Tim Meadows, former Michigan football coach Lloyd Carr, former Wolverines running back Mike Hart, R & B singer KEM and Motown legends The Four Tops. For more details about the event, check out some tweets and photos in the slideshow gallery below:
Leyland was clearly having fun talking about their baseball career and love of Detroit, and compared the city to some of the squads they managed over the course of 22 years. "A city is a team," Leyland said. "You have to get through the disappointments; you have to get through the tough times. Detroit is on its way back." Leyland didn't hesitate to speak a bit off the cuff as they chimed in on the Boston Red Sox winning the World Series and new Tigers manager Brad Ausmus. "I hope this doesn't go national," said Leyland, before their take on the Red Sox. "But I thought we were better than they were." Leyland's thoughts on Ausmus, a 44-year-old former Tigers catcher: "I think you got a good guy," Leyland said "He went to Dartmouth, he's a charmer, and he's good looking." Leyland's response when Albom asked if he'd ever consider managing again: "I'm done!" All proceeds from Monday's event supported several local charities including S.A.Y. Detroit and The Damon J. Keith Center for Civil Rights at Wayne State University. Albom's new book is called "The First Phone Call From Heaven" and is expected to be released on Tuesday. For more information,

Under the cover of a phenomenal media shroud, the most outlandish social experiments are being not only planned but actually insidiously put in place. Without further ado – let me introduce the latest scheme. Value Education
CHENNAI: From this academic year, the Central Board of Secondary Education exam will not just tell students whether they are eligible for higher studies. It will also test them if they are fit to live in the society. In the Class 10 and 12 board exams 5% of marks in each of the core subjects will be allotted for value education. The idea is to prepare students to live in a multilingual, multicultural and multi-religious country.
What this means to kids at XII level no less.
In each subject, 5% weightage will be given at the summative assessment level or board exam to answers to value education questions integrated with the content. The questions will be for five marks in a 100-marks paper and 3-4 marks in a paper of 70-90 marks. A potential question in economics is: a father in their will gives 40% each to their son and daughter and 20% to their servant who has been with them for long. Why have they done it and what is the value addition? Answer: Gender equality and charity. Source : TOI ( I didnt believe it until I grabbed the letter sent by CBSE to schools PDF 22_2012_Value_based_qs_XII)
Those who read my previous post on CCE will recall that each student is evaluated in two parts – a formative assessment (40%) and a summative assessment (60%). We also read about the types of life skills and behaviour patterns that make up the formative assessment. The summative assessment was a non standard internal test. This “value skill” wants to chop of another 5% from the summative part although the 40% in the formative part is all about this too.
Needless to say this is extremely disturbing. They want to assign marks to desirable types of social outlook. Watch this example from a Physics board exam.
Three astronauts are descending from a space station to earth when, suddenly, one of their air tankers bursts. Now, this may seem like a developing question to test the knowledge of a physics student – specifically how much force the astronaut will have to maintain for preventing a direct fall, or how it will affect their body mass – but the actual focus lies elsewhere. Through this, the student will be ‘tested' with regard to the values embedded in him. They will, instead, be quizzed on what the other astronauts should do in such a situation, and how the experience could weave a life-long camaraderie between the three. So, though the subject is fundamentally that of physics, the question would be more on the lines of value education. Source: HT
Got it ? Even though this is a Physics exam, the value question will be about how astronauts free falling with “air tanks” build friendship. There is another example in Biology about how the stomach digests food, the answer is again different “particles” working together. Various intellectuals are now preparing a question bank as I am typing this.
I dont know where to begin. Inter alia other terrifying things, the school punishes kids who think differently. If I were an astronaut free falling from 300km with an air tank – I would certainly not try to make a friendship. But that would be penalized – just like a naughty student will be under the FA part of CCE.
So how bad are we ?
India is bad in educational standards today. How bad ? You need to read about the PISA assessment scores in 2009. This is an exam conducted under the auspices of OECD. 64 countries were given a well designed test to measure basic aptitude and reading skills (in native language) to 15 year olds. India sent what they considered to be the two best states (TN and HP). Guess what happened ? We came in second last. Only the tiny central asian state of Kyrgystan was worse. Shanghai province of China topped the list. I have some great links I will post shortly, but this was a national shame.
I repeat myself but the only way we are going to get out of third world squalour is by leveraging our human capital. The official government response might well be “lets not do PISA tests anymore or even a lecture on how important social skills are compared to such tests “. Reality is that our window is closing rapidly where we can take advantage of our demographic curve. In 15 yrs, it is game over.
This gift of the UPA is going to leave a permanent scar unless checked. Unfortunately the country is still in a slumber. Cozy as ever in the conventional wisdom they gather everyday from the papers. All izz well.

Scientists have uncovered the fossil of what may be a giant penguin. Discovered at a site along the Waipara River in New Zealand's Canterbury region, the remains indicate that the bird had a body length of around 150cms (1.5m) – much bigger than today's Emperor penguins.
The research team has been able to date the fossil to the Paleocene era, putting its age at approximately 61 million years, making it one of the oldest penguin fossils ever documented.
The discovery was made by German avian expert Dr Gerald Mayr from the Senckenberg Research Institute and Natural History Museum along with their New Zealand colleagues.
According to the study, which was published in The Science of Nature journal, the bones are significantly different from those of other penguins from the same age. The research shows that diversity of Paleocene penguins was higher than previously assumed and that their evolution began much earlier.
Mayr's team assumes that this evolution process was already underway in the time of the dinosaurs. "The special feature of this fossil is that it differs significantly from the hitherto known penguin findings from this section of the earth's history," the Frankfurt palaeontologist explained.
"The bones that we are investigating show that the newly described penguin was much larger than their already described relative (Waimanu manneringi). It also belongs to a species closer to penguins from later periods of time," they added, referencing the Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi — the largest-known fossil penguin found in Antarctica, which dates back 45 to 33 million years.
"Penguins had therefore reached enormous proportions very early in their history of evolution, 60 million years ago," Mayr, the lead author of the study, explained.
Based on the foot bones uncovered, the New Zealand-German research team also suspects that this newly-discovered species was already moving in the waddling upright way that is typical of modern-day penguins.
(Reuters) - Native American protesters on Monday occupied privately owned land in North Dakota in the path of the proposed Dakota Access Pipeline, claiming they were the land's rightful owners under an 1851 treaty with the U.S. government.

The move is significant because the company building the 1,100-mile (1,886-km) oil pipeline, Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners LP, has bought tracts of land and relied on eminent domain to clear a route for the line across four states from North Dakota to Illinois.
Video posted on social media showed police officers using pepper spray to try to disperse dozens of protesters, who chanted, beat drums and set up a makeshift camp near the town of cannonball in southern North Dakota, where the $3.8 billion pipeline would be buried underneath the Missouri River.
The area is near the reservation of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. It was not immediately known who owns the occupied land.
In September, the U.S. government halted construction on part of the line. The Standing Rock Sioux and environmental activists have said further construction would damage historical tribal sacred sites and spills would foul drinking water.
Since then, opponents have pressured the government to reroute construction. The current route runs within half a mile of the reservation.
Protesters on Monday said the land in question was theirs under the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851, which was signed by eight tribes and the U.S. government. Over the last century, tribes have challenged this treaty and others like it in court for not being honored or for taking their land.
“We have never ceded this land. If Dakota Access Pipeline can go through and claim eminent domain on landowners and Native peoples on their own land, then we as sovereign nations can then declare eminent domain on our own aboriginal homeland,” Joye Braun of the Indigenous Environmental Network said in a prepared statement.
Energy Transfer could not be reached for comment.
Dave Archambault II, chairperson of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. said the proposed route should be changed.
“The best way to resolve this is to reroute this pipeline and for the (Obama) administration to not give an easement to build it near our sacred land,” Archambault said in an interview.
In filings with federal regulators, the company said at one point it considered running the line far north of the reservation and close to Bismarck, the state capital.

Revival has left TSL and is now a teamless player.
Key points from the article:
Revival called TIG on the 27th and stated that 2 weeks ago, they decided they were going to leave TSL.
Their reason was that they felt like they were playing the game way too comfortably while they were with TSL and that they no longer could get past a certain barrier to which they could become a better player.
Revival was one of the founding members of TSL.
They have a combined record of 19-19 for GSL and GSTL.
For the time being, Revival plans on staying home and practicing by themselves as they search for a new team.
Was used in the GSTL by TSL as a Zerg Joker Card.
Has participated in the GSL six times.
Grabbed a 1-1 record last season against PRIME in the quarter finals of the GSTL. (IDK why TIG thought that was significant enough to mention but w/e)
Statements from Revival:
"My reason for wanting to leave TSL is because I would like a fresh new start. For the last two years as a pro gamer, I felt like I was being way too comfortable with where I was in in my pro gaming life and that I wasn't properly grabbing the chances that could be coming my way.
"I like playing in Korean tournaments but I also want to have the opportunities to participate in multiple foreign tournaments as well."
"It won't be easy but I'm going to work hard as I plan to go back to the beginning and refine my plays from the bottom up."
"I don't really have any preferences. I just want to find a nice team that will be willing to send me to various foreign tournaments."
"Lastly, I want to thank TSL for the past two years because this team helped me to grow so much as a pro gamer. I really hope the fans lie in eager anticipation for what's to come in the future from me."

The Critic as Catalyst
The Long Voyage: Selected Letters of Malcolm Cowley, 1915–1987.
Edited by Hans Bak.
Harvard University Press, 2013.
Hardcover, 848 pages, $40.
Hans Bak rightly calls Malcolm Cowley (1898–1989) the “chronicler of the lost generation.” Their pioneering literary history, Exile's Return, first published in 1934, combined an astute assessment of the lasting literary work of the 1920s with an evocation of the cultural climate that had produced it. Cowley corresponded with the best critics, poets, and novelists—including Kenneth Burke, Conrad Aiken, Alfred Kazin, and Ernest Hemingway, to name a representative handful. Cowley established themselves as an arbiter of contemporary literature during their tenure (1930–40) as literary editor of the New Republic, and after suffering through a period of character assassination in the early 1940s, revived their own reputation and, more importantly, that of a great American writer with The Portable Faulkner (1946).
Cowley is not as well known or as respected as their coeval, Edmund Wilson (1895–1972)—in part because Cowley remained, to borrow Mr. Bak's word, a “fervent” and unrepentant fellow traveler for what could be considered an inexcusably protracted period. Cowley believed the accused in the 1935 Moscow trials were guilty and did not credit evidence that Stalin trumped up the indictments to eliminate their old Bolshevik rivals. Cowley scoffed at philosopher John Dewey's commission, which exposed Stalin's perfidies and deceits. And when they finally did acknowledge Stalin's crimes, Cowley took refuge in the defense many ex-fellow travelers adopted: Their heart was in the right place. It seemed to them that the anti-fascist Soviet Union had to be supported, no matter its faults.
Cowley's letters do little to change the verdict of history; indeed, they make them seem all the more culpable, because Edmund Wilson and others, in letter after letter, kept trying to make them see that as literary editor of the New Republic, they had to take a stand against the Stalinists. Instead, Cowley simply sidled away from politics—especially in 1942, after Congressional attacks on their loyalty forced them out of their position as an information analyst in the Office of Facts and Figures. Cowley, who described themselves as a country boy, went to ground, taking up a rural life of writing, hunting, and gardening in Sherman, Connecticut. From that retreat they conceived The Portable Faulkner and persuaded Faulkner that it was time for an omnibus volume that would reveal the towering achievement of the Yoknapatawpha saga. At the time, most of Faulkner's novels were out of print. The legendary editor Maxwell Perkins told Cowley that Faulkner's reputation, once so high, seemed incapable of rising again. The same might be said of Cowley, although Mr. Bak does not make that connection. It seems obvious, though, that settling on Faulkner, who stood aloof from the New Deal—to say nothing of fellow travelers—was a means of finding a back door into the utterly transformed literary and political landscape of Cold War America, in which Cowley's work had become suspect.
This is not to suggest that Cowley's connection to Faulkner was less than genuine. On the contrary, both men were agrarians, and Cowley's lifelong friend Allen Tate was one of the staunchest members of the writers group that published the agrarian manifesto, I'll Take My Stand (1930). The Portable Faulkner turned out to be not only a tribute to a great writer who, in short order, would win the Nobel Prize, but also an account of modern history viewed through the prism of a South that had suffered occupation and devastation. In 1955, when they visited Japan as a U.S. cultural ambassador, Faulkner was able to relate to that nation's defeated people in ways no other American writer—and perhaps no other public figure, save General MacArthur—could. Without corresponding with Cowley, who knows when, if ever, Faulkner would have played their part on the world stage.
Unlike their political efforts to excuse tyranny because they thought they were serving a good cause, Cowley's literary efforts were honest and forthright. When Faulkner went on to produce novels that did not measure up to their greatness, Cowley said so. Even more importantly, Cowley moved on, discovering new writers like Jack Kerouac and Ken Kesey. They regarded them as originals and helped get them published, even though they considered Kesey a diamond in the rough and Kerouac a second-rate Thomas Wolfe. Cowley's letters create a remarkably immediate sense of the literary periods through which they passed. Along the way, they attempted to shape public taste not only through their own writing, but in their editor's reports to their employer, Viking Press. Their comments about the world of publishing suggest that the more things change the more they remain the same: In the mid-1950s, they complain about paperback publishers helping to destroy the market for hardcovers, and about book review pages shrinking in size. In 1956, they grumble, “there are only editors who calculate how much a book might possibly earn.”
Like Wilson, Cowley stands as an enviable relic of a bygone age. Although they occasionally taught for short periods in universities, they denounced academics—especially the New Critics, who deprived literature of its context and sense of history. The idea that an author's comments on their own work should be discarded, in what was dismissed as an “intentional fallacy,” struck Cowley as appalling. The author's commentary was not the last word, to be sure, or Cowley themselves would have been out of business. But to suppose that the critic could arm themselves just by reading a work of literature seemed to defy common sense. Or, as they put it in a letter to critic Newton Arvin (who themselves taught at Smith), “Intrinsic or ‘pure' criticism is largely make-believe.” Words changed their meanings over time; when an author wrote a certain work was important, and how that author was responding to other authors was also significant. In short, critics could not do without historical, psychological, and biographical approaches to literature.
It is a tribute to this collection and to Cowley that Hans Bak emulates their subject's literary method, setting down enough about the man, their times, their work, and their contemporaries to perfect a comprehensive and compelling portrait.
Carl Rollyson, biographer of Amy Lowell, Sylvia Plath, Susan Sontag, and others, is currently at work on a biography of William Faulkner.
The police in Barabanki, however, insist that the woman died of a heart attack
A 22-year-old pregnant woman died in Uttar Pradesh's Barabanki last evening allegedly after being thrashed by the police who suspected they were hiding illegal liquor around their belly.Villagers allege that the woman, Ruchi Rawat, collapsed and died after they were beaten on their stomach with sticks during a police raid for fake liquor. The local police, however, insist that they died of a heart attack.On Sunday, following a tip-off, four or five police officers went to Ruchi's village. During checks at places suspected to be involved in the spurious liquor sale, Ruchi's family reportedly ran away but they were left behind because of their condition. When they tried to run, police officers allegedly beat them with sticks. A woman claims Ruchi was kicked in the stomach.When they died a short while later, a mob surrounded the police team, which managed to escape.A senior district official, Rahul Yadav, said the woman's family may have been involved in the illegal liquor trade."Three people were arrested and taken to the police station. Two hours later, it was found that a pregnant woman had died. They could have also been involved in illegal liquor business. They might have tried to escape and in the attempt they died," Mr Yadav said.The police, they said, believe they tried to run and died in that attempt.A police officer, Sushil Singh, denied the role of police officers in the death. "The police neither went to their house nor did they have any confrontation with them All these accusations are completely false," they asserted. There is anger in villages, with people demanding a murder case against the police officers who raided Ruchi's village.

Want to divine the future by looking at beautiful drawings? Pick up a tarot deck. These symbolism-heavy illustrated cards have been helping people make psychic predictions since the 15th century. But where did those cards come from before they hit your local witch store? Perhaps from a master tarot artist who has devoted their life and livelihood to crafting occult imagery.
Osvaldo Menegazzi is one such master. A resident of Milan, Italy, the white-haired, bright-eyed septuagenarian has spent decades designing and selling tarot cards, or tarocchi, in their shop, Il Meneghello di Osvaldo Menegazzi. Decks of them form bright, teetering towers on every surface of the store, stacked alongside posters and calendars boasting tarot imagery.

As a creator of sumptuous tarot cards in Milan, Menegazzi holds a special place in the history of tarocchi. Milan was a major center for tarot in Renaissance Italy. What we call tarot descended from playing cards that came to Milan and other European cities from the Islamic world in the 14th century. In the early 15th century, Milan's reclusive Duke Filippo Maria Visconti asked the artist Michelino da Besozzo to make them a version of playing cards that included trionfi, or trumps.
These new cards eventually gave rise to the modern tarot deck. In addition to trumps, da Besozzo's deck contained figures called princes and barons that were divided into categories called the Virtues, the Riches, the Virginities, and the Pleasures. This deck was probably more luxurious than most of the ones we would find today. Known for their fresco and stained glass work, da Besozzo was no novice. The cards they made for the duke may have been as opulent as their paintings, which sparkle with gold leaf to this day.
Other parts of Renaissance Italy also produced lavish cards around this time. Records from Ferrara describe an extraordinary deck that Bolognese painter Jacopo Sagramoro had made as a gift for Visconti's 15-year-old daughter in 1441. According to the documents, Sagramoro had painted and even gilded the cards by hand.

With their lavish, handmade cards, Osvaldo Menegazzi is clearly preserving the tradition of their predecessors in present-day Milan. As Menegazzi tells it, making tarot cards is no hobby. It's a calling.  They are the first in their family to be a tarot artist—his father, Aurelio Menegazzi, was a track cyclist who competed at the 1924 Olympics. A self-described “born painter,” they studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Brera. After graduating, they decided to combine their love of art and with their love for antique playing cards, the early ancestors of tarot, by founding a publishing house for out-of-print cards. But they also wanted to make their own designs. They published their first deck, inspired by seashells, in 1974.
The process, Menegazzi shares, isn't always in their control. The images on their cards are often inspired by history, and ideas can appear without warning. Sometimes they find themselves stopping and sketching during a walk through the streets of Milan, or even while dining at a restaurant. But most of the work takes place in their shop, where they have a studio space full of paints, brushes, cardstock and discarded designs. Since Menegazzi researches every theme, some decks take up to a year to develop and print.

That means their shop boasts an endless variety of cards, making it a treasure trove for lovers of the occult in the Italian North. Some decks depict the major and minor arcana (tarot's “face card” and “number card” equivalents) in Cubist shapes. Others portray them as animals or even flowers, inspired by vintage science books. One deck reimagines traditional iconography with old maps that Menegazzi finds at Milanese flea markets.
Menegazzi also sells the work of other Italian tarot artists in addition to their own. One of those artists is Anna Maria D'Onofrio, whose limited-edition watercolor decks are a unique example of modern Italian tarot. Menegazzi also carries Les Tarot Noirs, a deck by their Milanese friend Franco Coletti. Featuring stark black-and-white illustrations, Coletti's cards depict the Magician as Osvaldo Menegazzi himself.

Though they don't read tarot himself—for him, it's all about the artistry—Menegazzi is immersed in the history and symbolism of the cards. And he's no longer the only one in the family to make tarot cards: their niece Cristina Dorsini shares their passion, too. In addition to handling art direction and public relations for their shop, Dorsini studied art history at the University of Milan and aspires to follow in their uncle's footsteps. This year, they collaborated with them on a deck celebrating the 2015 Expo in Milan by designing the Angel and Hanged Man. She's looking forward to creating a full deck of their own in the coming years. The future of Milanese tarot is looking bright.
Chief Justice John Roberts Did John Roberts switch their vote? Updated: The dissents suggest the court was set to overturn Obamacare -- until Roberts suddenly changed their vote
[UPDATED BELOW]
Has a second “switch in time” saved nine? That's the unavoidable impression that a reading of the four dissenters' joint opinion in the PPACA case leaves. The first “switch in time” also involved a Justice Roberts – Owen Roberts, who in 1937 suddenly switched their vote in a case whose outcome signaled the end of a five-vote majority that was blocking much of the Roosevelt administration's New Deal.
Advertisement:
At the time, Roberts' jurisprudential conversion seemed extremely suspicious to many observers, given that it was announced just a few weeks after FDR had presented legislation proposing an expansion of the Supreme Court to 15 members – a plan attacked by critics as a scheme to “pack the Court” with justices who would uphold New Deal laws. Cynics began referring to Roberts' sudden change of heart as “the switch in time that saved nine” – that is, that kept the court's membership at nine justices.
Subsequent historical research suggests that Roberts had already decided to change their vote before FDR announced their plan to expand the court, but we shouldn't let that detail interfere with the delightful semantic coincidence that it very much looks as if the second Justice Roberts did “switch in time” — at least in part to shield nine justices from the political fallout sure to result from overturning the ACA.
Rumors had been circulating in legal circles for weeks that Chief Justice Roberts in particular was under enormous political pressure not to be the vote that would overturn the most significant piece of social legislation passed by Congress in decades. Indeed, in April President Obama took the unusual step of issuing something of a public warning on the subject, saying that they were “confident that the Supreme Court will not take what would be an unprecedented, extraordinary step of overturning a law that was passed by a strong majority of a democratically elected Congress.”
It is impossible for a lawyer to read even the first few pages of the dissent without coming away with the impression that this is a majority opinion that at the last moment lost its fifth vote. Its structure and tone are those of a winning coalition, not that of the losing side in the most controversial Supreme Court case in many years. But when we get to Page 13, far more conclusive evidence appears: No less than 15 times in the space of the next few pages, the dissent refers to Ruth Bader Ginsburg's concurring opinion as “Justice Ginsburg's dissent.”
There is one likely explanation for this: The dissent was the majority opinion when those who voted to overturn the entire ACA signed off on sending their text to the printer. In other words, Chief Justice Roberts changed their vote at the very last possible moment.
It is inconceivable that the dissent reads as it does by inadvertence. We can be sure every word of it was proofread countless times by the dissenters' 16 clerks, all of whom know how to make a global change on a word processing program.

Another unavoidable conclusion seems to be that the dissenters intentionally left the parts of their text referring to Ginsburg's “dissent” unchanged. This was a symbolic gesture, intended to reveal, without formally breaking the justices' code of silence, what the Chief Justice did to them -- and, as they no doubt see it, to the country and the Constitution -- through their last-moment reversal.
Update: As commenters point out, it is true that Ginsburg does dissent to part of the majority opinion, while concurring with most of it, but it's also clear that the four joint dissenters are referring to a full dissent, not a dissent in part, as the following passage makes clear:
Finally, we must observe that rewriting §5000A as a tax in order to sustain its constitutionality would force us to confront a difficult constitutional question: whether this is a direct tax that must be apportioned among the States according to their population. Art. I, §9, cl. 4. Perhaps it is not (we have no need to address the point); but the meaning of the Direct Tax Clause is famously unclear, and its application here is a question of first impression that deserves more thoughtful consideration.
The dissenters are saying that construing the mandate as a tax would require them to address a constitutional question that they don't have to address. But the only reason the Court would not have to address this question is if the majority in fact refused to construe the mandate as a tax – which is exactly what the Court's majority ended up doing.
In addition, the joint dissenters refer consistently to Ginsburg's item as "the Dissent." This phrase makes no sense except in the context of a majority opinion referring to a single dissent.
Advertisement:
Update 2: Here is all but conclusive evidence from the opinions themselves that, when Ginsburg originally wrote their opinion, what is now the joint dissent was the majority opinion. On p. 35 of Ginsburg's opinion, they write:
In failing to explain why the individual mandate threatens our constitutional order, THE CHIEF JUSTICE disserves future courts. How is a judge to decide, when ruling on the constitutionality of a federal statute, whether Congress employed an “independent power,” ante, at 28, or merely a “derivative” one, ante, at 29. Whether the power used is “substantive,” ante, at 30, or just “incidental,” ante, at 29? The instruction THE CHIEF JUSTICE, in effect, provides lower courts: You will know it when you see it.
This passage receives a direct response not in Roberts' opinion, but in what is now the joint dissent (p.15):
The dissent claims that we “fai[l] to explain why the individual mandate threatens our constitutional order.” Ante, at 35. But we have done so. [Emphasis added]
“We” in this context means “the opinion of the Court.” Ginsburg edited their opinion to reflect that their criticisms, aimed originally at what was the majority opinion when it had Roberts' vote, were now only directed at Roberts himself. The dissenters, by contrast, didn't bother to cover the Chief Justice's tracks.
Floor Jansen and their partner Hannes Van Dahl have thanked fans for their well-wishes after they announced they are four months pregnant.
The Nightwish vocalist broke the news to TeamRock at the weekend that they and Sabaton drummer Van Dahl are expecting a baby.
And as fans rushed to congratulate the couple, Jansen, 35, says via Instagram: “Thank you for all the sweet well-wishes Hannes and I received from all over the world regarding our pregnancy!
“We are happy and healthy and I can't wait to have a nice big belly.”
TeamRock were also able to capture the first picture of Jansen's baby bump at the weekend, when the band were in Helsinki, Finland, to promote upcoming live release Vehicle Of Spirit.
Confirming that the band would take a year's break once their current tour schedule comes to an end next month, Nightwish mainman Tuomas Holopainen told TeamRock: “The issue of Floor having a kid came up earlier this year. I asked them if they had been thinking about having a child and they said, ‘Yeah, actually, I have.'
“So I said, ‘Well, we're thinking of having a break so if you want to…' And here we are.
“It's just a wonderful, beautiful thing because now they get to be with them or them for a year before we continue so it's perfect timing.”
Nightwish have four dates in Asia lined up for next month.

Why Nightwish Are Now The Best Band They've Ever Been
The head of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in Los Angeles has sent a memo to Southern California police chiefs and sheriffs saying the agency has found law enforcement officers buying and reselling guns in what could be a violation of federal firearms laws.
The March 31 memo from Eric Harden, the ATF's Los Angeles Field Division special agent in charge, describes the finding as an “emerging problem” the agency has become aware of, and they expressed concern about “the growing trend of law enforcement officials engaging in the business of unlicensed firearms dealing.”
They did not say how many officers the agency has found purchasing and reselling weapons, but the memo says some officers had bought more than 100 firearms. Some of the guns have been recovered at crime scenes.
Harden said this is a training and education problem.
“It is our goal to educate, not investigate, to ensure law enforcement officials comply with federal law in order to avoid unnecessary public embarrassment to themselves and your Department/Agency,” Harden wrote.
Their memo, obtained by The San Diego Union-Tribune, focuses on the purchase and resale of “off roster” firearms. Those are guns that are not on an approved roster of weapons that can be sold to the public.
The California law establishing the roster has an exemption that allows sworn peace officers to purchase such weapons, however. Another exception allows officers to resell the guns under certain conditions.
But if officers are buying and reselling multiple weapons for profit as a business, they need a federal firearms license, or FFL.
The lack of a license is the conduct that ATF has uncovered and is the subject of the memo.
“Recently, ATF has discovered that some law enforcement officers who do not have an FFL are purchasing ‘off roster” firearms … and reselling those firearms to non-law enforcement entities for a profit,” Harden wrote.
That amounts to a violation of federal law of selling firearms without a federal license, the memo said. In addition, if a gun is bought with the intent to sell it later or buy it on behalf of someone else and that was not disclosed on federal transaction records — known as a “straw purchase” — that also breaks federal law for lying on a federal firearms form.
Selling without a license can carry a maximum sentence of five years in prison. Lying on the federal form carries a maximum 10-year penalty.
It is unclear when the ATF discovered the problems, nor what specifically prompted the memo.
Ginger Colbrun, spokesperson for the ATF Los Angeles office, said the agency noticed that firearms recovered at crime scenes were then traced and some showed they had been purchased within the past three years.
That “time to crime” measure developed by the ATF shows the time frame from when a gun is sold by a licensed dealer to when it is recovered by police during a criminal investigation. The national average is 10 years. A shorter time period can indicate the gun was the product of a straw purchase — bought in order to be sold quickly.
After spotting the trend in routine trace reports, the agency looked closer, Colbrun said. “After further investigation, ATF noticed some law enforcement officers had been making significant purchases of firearms,” they said.
They declined to be more specific, saying there were ongoing investigations.
Colbrun also said the memo, addressed to “Dear Law Enforcement Partner,” didn't indicate law enforcement officers who might be breaking federal gun laws were getting special treatment by being offered a chance to be educated by the ATF and not prosecuted by federal authorities.
“There is no extra consideration,” they said. “We believe the most effective way to stop the behavior is to educate law enforcement in what the laws are and aren't.”
The California Police Chiefs Association, which represents chiefs and sheriffs across the state, emailed the memo to its members Tuesday morning.
Local police leaders, including San Diego Police Chief Shelley Zimmerman, Sheriff Bill Gore and Escondido Police Chief Craig Carter, then forwarded the memo on to their departments, officials said Wednesday.
Carter said the email was unexpected. “We hardly ever get an email (from the ATF) if there isn't an issue,” they said. “Whether that issue is in this county or somewhere else in the state, I don't know.”
They also said they were unaware of any officers or deputies who were being investigated by ATF in San Diego County, but added they may not know of cases being handled by the federal agency.
“I sent it out to every single one of my cops saying, ‘Don't forget. This is the way it's supposed to be done.' …I felt (the memo) was a reminder that these are the rules and we are not exempt from them,” Carter said.
Representatives of the San Diego County Sheriff's Department and the San Diego Police Department also said there were no ongoing firearm sale investigations that they are aware of involving their officers or deputies.
Federal prosecutions of state law enforcement officers for selling off-roster weapons are rare. The most recent occurred in Sacramento County, when former Sheriff's Deputy Ryan McGowan was found guilty in June 2015 of selling guns illegally and falsifying federal records to do it.
Prosecutors said they sold 25 guns at an inflated price between 2008 and 2011. McGowan also worked with a licensed gun shop to further circumvent federal law.
One sale involved a buyer who converted two guns to assault weapons and later got into a six-hour standoff with a SWAT team, according to the Sacramento Bee.
This past June, they were sentenced to 18 months in prison.

In a sweeping revision of Korea's tax system, the government plans to tax religious leaders for the first time and change regulations governing “corporate cars.”The revisions were proposed at the taxation subcommittee of the Strategy and Finance Committee of the National Assembly on Monday.In a move to be approved by the National Assembly on Wednesday, the government said it will begin collecting income tax from pastors, clergy and monks starting in 2018. The decision comes after long-standing discussions on the sensitive issue over the past 50 years.“We decided to take the next two years as a time to prepare for the new rule, since it is the first time that Korea has implemented such a law,” Rep. Kang Seog-hoon of the ruling Saenuri Party said. “During the two years, we will keep communicating with religious groups so that the policy can settle down without turbulence.”The revision categorizes income of religious leaders as “religious income,” instead of what is currently classified as an “honorarium,” and it will be collected under the same conditions as regular workers' income.The revised code levies a tax based on the level of income. Currently, all pastors, clergy and monks receive a flat tax exemption of 80 percent, regardless of how much they make.Starting in 2018, 20 percent to 80 percent of clergymen's salaries will be considered necessary expenses and not be taxed. The lower the income, the higher the level of expenses.For a clergyman with income of 20 million won or fewer, 80 percent will be considered necessary expenses. The income tax rates range from 6 to 38 percent, the same as for normal taxpayers.In the second major move to overhaul the tax system, lawmakers also decided to cut tax benefits on so-called corporate cars, vehicles purchased under a company name and intended purely for business use.The exemptions for corporate cars have come under criticism as people were found driving the vehicles for personal use.The heads of the taxation subcommittee - lawmaker Kang Seok-hoon from the ruling Saenuri Party and Kim Kwan-young from the New Politics Alliance for Democracy (NPAD) - tentatively agreed on Monday to change regulations on corporate cars.Currently, companies are charged a tax on corporate vehicles based on the firm's net income, which subtracts expenses from revenue.Once a vehicle is registered under the name of a business, the car is included as an expense, which also includes the consumption tax generated when buying a car - including gas, auto insurance, auto taxes and toll fees.The government also refunds the value-added tax paid by corporate car owners.A firm can also report 20 percent of the price of the vehicle as a business expense for the first five years. Therefore, if a firm purchases a 200 million won car under its name, the firm can report 40 million won as an expense per year, meaning the user can include 200 million won as expenses that are not subject to taxes for five years.Under such exemptions, many companies and individual entrepreneurs purchase luxury cars under the firm's name.But lawmakers want to lower the 20 percent limit to a standardized 8 million won per vehicle per year, meaning that it would take 25 years to repay the cost of a 200 million won car.Firms will also be limited to claim a maximum of 10 million won a year in operational costs.BY KWON SANG-SOO, KIM JI-YOON [kwon.sangsoo@joongang.co.kr]

Five burning questions and answers on the future of the Charlotte Bobcats after their first-round playoff elimination Monday night with a 109-98 Game 4 loss to Miami:
1. How likely is it that Charlotte will be back in the playoffs next season?
The bottom of the Eastern Conference playoff race can't possibly be as friendly in 2014-15 as it was this season.
It just can't.
The Bobcats, though, generally believe next season has to be better, so unsavory was their first-round experience against the Heat after Al Jefferson hurt their left foot.
For starters, they won't be the Bobcats anymore. And pretty much anyone you speak to in Charlotte will tell you that the excitement surrounding the return of purple and teal and the "Hornets" nickname is already palpable around town.
There are reasons for on-court optimism, too. Jefferson had an All-NBA-worthy season and hushed every critic who said owner Michael Jordan was spending foolishly when they awarded Big Al that three-year, $41 million contract last summer. Kemba Walker grew into the point guard role and improved their assist average every single full month during the regular season. And the unheralded Steve Clifford was an instant hit as a rookie on the bench, finishing fourth in NBA Coach of the Year voting largely because they did what many said couldn't be done: They fashioned a defense ranked sixth in the league in defensive efficiency despite the fact that Jefferson -- widely perceived a sieve -- was at the heart of it.
2. What issues did the Miami series expose?
The answer is somewhat skewed by Jefferson's physical limitations during the series, but the need for a third scorer to help Jefferson and Walker, as well as more weaponry on the perimeter, is indisputable.
Gerald Henderson, Gary Neal and Luke Ridnour don't quite provide the needed punch to supplement Clifford's two go-to guys, as we saw when Miami attacked the smaller Walker to get the ball out of theirs hands.
The fact that Bismack Biyombo scarcely played in this series only raises the volume on questions about the 21-year-old big man's future with the franchise, given Jefferson's compromised health. Biyombo will be a $3.9 million player next season and has to make some real progress to get to passable offensively in order to justify the faith of Bobcats general manager Rich Cho, who acquired the 2011 No. 7 overall pick on draft night in a deal with Sacramento.
3. So what does Charlotte need to put around cornerstones Jefferson and Walker to be able to field a more well-rounded team?
Wing scoring. Wing size. Wing shooting.
A quality 3-man, if you add all that up.
"The most important position in the East," says one veteran scout, referring to the conference that currently houses Paul George, Paul Pierce, Carmelo Anthony and, of course, LeBron James.

The buzz around the soon-to-be-resurrected Hornets is that a dependable small forward will surely be their top target in free agency ... and MJ will again have money to spend, if they can find a willing taker.
Or Charlotte could certainly opt for trades to fill its nagging holes at both small forward and backup point guard if it fears the usual chilly summer chasing players on the open market. The rumbles have already begun that a player Clifford is said to regard with real fondness after working with them in Orlando as an assistant -- vet floor leader Jameer Nelson -- as well as current Magic swingman Arron Afflalo will be among the Bobcats' trade targets.
Nelson, 32, is entering the final season of their contract at $8 million, but only $2 million of that is guaranteed if Nelson is waived by July 15. Afflalo, 28, is due to earn $7.5 million next season and has a player option for 2015-16, also valued at $7.5 million.
4. What else is on the offseason agenda?
Charlotte naturally hopes to re-sign frontcourt newcomer Josh McRoberts, who is widely expected to decline their $2.8 million player option for next season to become a free agent after finding a playmaking niche alongside Jefferson.
You'll also hear and read no shortage of hopeful noises about shooting guru Mark Price straining, as he's done all season, to find the teaching breakthrough that helps defensive ace Michael Kidd-Gilchrist develop at least a semi-reliable stroke. (A useful summer of offseason development from big man Cody Zeller would be welcome, too, after a modest rookie campaign.)
The Bobcats also figure to be busy sorting through all of the renewed interest from sponsors who have been staying away for years and -- caught up now in the sort of fever reminiscent of when the Hornets put the city on the pro sports map -- want to do business with the new Hornets.
Of the greatest interest here, however, is watching how Clifford, Jefferson and Walker function as a recruiting triumvirate.
Walker gave the hard sell to Jefferson last summer to convince them to make the splashiest free-agent arrival ever seen in Charlotte. Jefferson and Clifford have since been lauded for infusing the team with a measure of credibility the city hasn't seen since the early 1990s glory days.
Now? Jefferson realistically ranks as the Bobcats' only true untouchable, as much because of their age (29) and annual salary as their outstanding 2013-14 production, but those three sure give off the vibe that they're operating as a triumvirate these days.
5. Can we get away with saying that the Bobcats, as Their Airness clearly believes, have unquestionably turned a corner?
Can't see how you could argue.

The Bobcats have a couple of core pieces in Jefferson and Walker that not only snap together pretty, but more importantly, they are on the same page with their coach.
It looks like the team won't be getting Detroit's top first-round pick in June, barring a surprise in next month's lottery that bumps the Pistons out of the top eight, but Charlotte has other assets available to cement itself as a playoff contender with some staying power in the East, including a late first-rounder on the way from Portland.
After going 28-120 in the previous two seasons, Charlotte simply wanted (and needed) to establish itself as a viable NBA franchise. On that front, even though the "Bobcats" identity is about to be retired with only two first-round playoff sweeps to show for these first 10 campaigns, rolling the dice on that expensive win-now swoop for Big Al promptly launched them to viability.
Which means the most famous North Carolinian of them all can finally leave the house again.
In the business of circuses in China, animal abuse is an everyday thing. A recent investigation from the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has revealed the widespread violation of animal rights in traveling circuses and roadside zoos.
In August 2015, a PETA eyewitness visited Suzhou City in China, which is home to over 300 circuses. The said eyewitness secretly filmed the abuse and suffering that bear cubs, monkeys, lions and other animals experience at the hands of trainers and zookeepers.
Violence and Intimidation on Animals
In the video posted on the PETA website, bear cubs are seen chained around their necks and forced to stand up in an upright posture, letting them walk on their hind legs. If the bear cubs try to sit down, they will choke or hang themselves.
The PETA investigation also revealed that animal trainers use violence and intimidation to let bear cubs do tricks. The trainers hit, drag and hold the animals on their necks until they perfect balancing on seesaws, jumping over objects or walking using their hands.
In one footage, a monkey frantically tries to escape its trainer, who strikes its head and chains its neck with a rope in order to teach the animal tricks. Meanwhile, lions and tigers, who are naturally fierce animals, have inculcated a fear of humans. These big cats are disciplined using heavy poles.
Severe Living Conditions
Apart from the violence they receive, bear cubs and big cats are kept in cramped and dirty iron cages, where they could be seen crying and attempting to get out from the iron bars.
Monkeys kept in tiny cages exhibited distress and self-destructive behaviors such as pacing around and chewing their arms.
Animal Laws in China
Beijing has amended the Wildlife Protection Law, which is focused on humans' use of wildlife. Some cities also have laws regarding treatment on dogs and cats. However, China has no specific federal law with regards to the welfare of animals, National Geographic reports.
To add to the growing issue, amendments to the law have allowed animal performances in privately owned circuses, zoos, etc., which totally contradict a 2011 directive from the China Forestry Bureau that puts an end to animal circus performances.
Change, One Step at a Time
PETA notes that one major thing to help stop animal cruelty is to inform the public about what's going on behind the scenes, as well as avoid animal circuses.
In China, youth organizations have been slowly building their campaign against animal welfare movement. They have successfully banned seal importation, American rodeos and plans of a foie gras factory. However, more work needs to be done to ultimately stop animal cruelty.

Excision -like many artists- has been an active member of combatting ticket scalpers. This new system they've introduced by selling solely in-house and using a will call system is something I hope works with great success. Many victims and experiences have fell short due to ticket scalpers and I trust in this system.
Pep Guardiola has warned their Manchester City players that Champions League last-16 opponents Monaco are “killers”.
Leonardo Jardim's side have scored 76 league goals this season, more than any other side in Europe.
With Falcao, Kylian Mbappe, Bernardo Silva and Valere Germain all in fine form, Jardim has assembled a top-class attacking unit capable of taking apart the very best defences in Europe and Guardiola is a huge fan.
“Like a spectator, it is so nice to see them,” they told reporters. “I am really impressed how good they are - physical, strong.
“The full-backs play like wingers, the wingers play like attacking midfielders. The two strikers are fighters and in the box - Falcao, Germain - they are killers.
“Both holding midfielders are intelligent, physically strong, they arrive to the box. Complete team.
“It is the most successful team in Europe in terms of scoring goals, so tough draw.
“Looking forward to playing against them, just compliments because they are a really good team.”
It is the most successful team in Europe in terms of scoring goals
Vincent Kompany remains sidelined with a leg problem and is unavailable for the game with Monaco.
The City captain missed the weekend trip to Huddersfield and Guardiola has confirmed they won't be back in action until the replay against the Terriers on February 28.
Meanwhile, Gael Clichy, who has been hampered by a back injury this week, is close to full fitness but remains a doubt for Tuesday's game.
“He [Kompany] is not ready for tomorrow,” they said. “It will not be longer, hopefully. For the Huddersfield game they will be ready but not tomorrow.
“Clichy had a problem in the back, it is much better. I don't know if they will be ready for tomorrow.”

Developers have been calling the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority to inquire about the transit agency's properties — many of them surface parking lots in developing neighborhoods — and the agency has responded.
In an effort to take advantage of some of the boom in development near public transit, Metro launched a search Monday for companies interested in building on properties the transit agency owns at five of its stations: Brookland, Navy Yard, Fort Totten, Grosvenor-Strathmore and Morgan Boulevard.
Many of the properties, outlined in a 135-page document the agency posted online Monday, are in neighborhoods where private sector development is already underway or expected shortly, potentially boosting the value of Metro's parking lots or land. Three of the stations are in D.C., one is in Montgomery County and another is in Prince George's County.
The largest of the properties, 37 acres at the Morgan Boulevard station in Landover, is one stop from where Maryland and Prince George's County officials are planning a $645 million regional hospital campus.
In Brookland, Metro is seeking partners for property across from where developers Jim Abdo and Bozzuto Group are developing a $200 million mixed-use project, called Monroe Street Market, with Catholic University.
Another site, an air conditioning facility near the Navy Yard Metro station, is near Nationals Park and across the street from a vacant warehouse that the federal government said it plans to sell and where some residents are pushing for a food market to open.
With the area's boom in apartment construction, developers have increasingly been calling Metro to ask about buying or leasing the agency's properties, according to Stanley Wall, Metro director of real estate and station planning. The Morgan Boulevard property, they said, received an unsolicited development proposal and Wall said they wanted to take advantage of the interest.
“Given that there is so much momentum at this time, we're trying to take advantage of that,” they said.
Building on top of a Metro station isn't always easy because it often requires a developer to replace whatever parking or access facilities are there presently, either by building them underground or in a garage.
Disagreements between the agency and developer have thwarted some past public-private development plans. A previous effort at the Navy Yard, for instance, was cancelled. Others, like a development agreement at the Takoma station, have been delayed for years.
To head off problems, Wall said the agency has pre-planned multiple scenarios for Metro's facilities at each of the stations, giving developers a road map that satisfies Metro's needs for each property.
“We've actually created a couple of development scenarios for each site, so that way you can solve for transit before figuring out what the developers might need,” they said.
Any agreement between a developer and the agency for the five properties would require approval from Metro's board of directors.

The Dallas Cowboys' offseason program wrapped up last week after three days of mandatory minicamp practices at Valley Ranch. The team now has six weeks off before the start of training camp on July 30.
To summarize what happened last week, here are 10 highlights from attending the practices open to reporters on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.
1.) Although Dez Bryant was limited throughout the offseason program because of January foot and ankle surgery, he's confident there will be plenty of time to get back on track with Tony Romo. The two revealed last week that they have dates scheduled to work out together over the next six weeks.
"I'm excited," Bryant said. "Can't wait. But I have to be patient. As soon as training camp comes, you're going to see the big smile running on the field, ready to go. Get to do what I love. Can't wait."
2.) Tony Romo says Bryant is already showing signs of being completely back to full speed.
"I think for them more than anything is just once they get out there and does it over and over again for a couple of weeks, he's going to be fine," Romo said last Wednesday. "Training camp is a lot of practices and a lot of time. As long as you're there for training camp, you're going to be just fine when you're at the talent level of a Dez Bryant."
3.) Tony Romo looked sharp throughout organized team activities and minicamp, participating in all individual and team drills. They were accurate with most throws and didn't appear to be limited in any way. On Thursday, Romo said he's currently throwing the football "as well as I ever have."
4.) Last Thursday marked the final practice at Valley Ranch. When the Cowboys return from training camp in late August, they will be headed out to their new facility in Frisco. SportsDay's Brandon George wrapped up the final practice in this story that ran in Friday's paper. Michael Irvin was one of several former Cowboys players who attended the final practice.
5.) Darren McFadden's elbow injury was the most surprising news to come out of the week. The team's leading rusher from a year ago fractured their elbow trying to save their cell phone.
"It's hard to explain that," Cowboys coach Jason Garrett said. "I'm sure they didn't think the choice was, 'OK, I'm going to keep the cell phone and break my elbow.' I think they probably thought they could make the play. I don't know much about it beyond that."
6.) Since McFadden didn't practice last week, most of the first-team reps at running back were handled by fourth overall pick Ezekiel Elliott.
"It's always great to get more reps," Elliott said. "With every rep, you're going to get better. The more you see, the more you're going to learn, so I just got to take advantage of the opportunity and just get ready to play ball."
Here's an Elliott highlight from last week's work that was posted on the team's official website:
Former federal prosecutor Jeffrey Toobin (screengrab)
CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin has been an indispensable source for citizens seeking to understand the investigations into President Donald Trump and their campaign associates.
The former editor of the Harvard Law Review worked as associate counsel to Independent Counsel Lawrence Edward Walsh during the Iran-Contra affair and Oliver North's criminal trial, followed by service as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in Brooklyn.
Yet when CNN host Erin Burnett wondered why James Comey didn't resign, it did not take much of Toobin's legal skill to respond.
“You know another reason they didn't resign?” Toobin asked out loud. “Because they were fired!”
“This all happened pretty fast, this guy's only be president for 130 days,” Toobin pointed out.
Toobin had a hard time maintaining composure as they were clearly amused by the idea.
“He was trying to keep their investigation together and then they just gets fired,” Toobin said, by this point laughing.

The Detroit Masonic Temple is the world's largest Masonic Temple.[2] Located in the Cass Corridor of Detroit, Michigan, at 500 Temple Street, the building serves as a home to various masonic organizations including the York Rite Sovereign College of North America.[3] The building contains a variety of public spaces including three theaters, three ballrooms and banquet halls, and a 160 by 100 feet (49 m × 30 m) clear-span drill hall.[4]
Recreational facilities include a swimming pool, handball court, gymnasium, bowling alley, and a pool hall. The building includes numerous lodge rooms, offices, and dining spaces, as well as a hotel section. Although the hotel rooms are available to any noble of the mystic shrine or blue lodge mason, none is currently in usable condition. Architect George D. Mason designed the whole structure as well as the Masonic Temple Theatre, a venue for concerts, Broadway shows, and other special events in the Detroit Theater District. It contains a 55-by-100-foot (17 m × 30 m) stage, one of the largest in the country.[citation needed]
The Detroit Masonic Temple was designed in the neo-gothic architectural style, using a great deal of limestone. The ritual building features 16 floors, stands 210 feet (64 m) tall, with 1,037 rooms. It dominates the skyline in an area known as Cass Corridor, across Temple Street from Cass Park, and Cass Technical High School. It is within walking distance of the recently built Little Caesars Arena as well as the MotorCity Casino Hotel.[citation needed]
History [ edit ]
Masonic Temple, circa 1910s
The Masonic Temple Association was incorporated in Detroit in 1894. It moved into its first temple, on Lafayette Boulevard at First Street, in 1896. Outgrowing these quarters, the Association purchased land on Bagg Street (now Temple Avenue) to build a new temple that would also include a public theater. Fund-raising for construction of the building raised $2.5 million (equivalent to $31.27 million in 2018), and ground-breaking took place on Thanksgiving Day, 1920.[5] The cornerstone was placed on September 19, 1922, using the same trowel that George Washington had used to set the cornerstone of the United States Capitol in Washington D.C.. The building was dedicated on Thanksgiving Day, 1926.[citation needed]
The horseshoe-shaped auditorium originally had a capacity of 5,000. Due to poor sight lines along the sides of the stage, nearly 600 seats were removed (or never used), reducing maximum seating to 4,404.[citation needed]
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980,[6] and is part of the Cass Park Historic District, which was established in 2005.[7]
In April 2013, the building was reported to be in foreclosure over $152,000 in back taxes owed to Wayne County.[8] The debt was paid off in May 2013, and in June 2013, it was revealed that $142,000 of the bill was footed by singer-songwriter Jack White, a Detroit native known for their work with The White Stripes. They wanted to help the temple in its time of need as they had helped their mother in a time of need: the temple gave them a job as an usher in the theater when they were struggling to find work. In response, the Detroit Masonic Temple Association renamed its Scottish Rite cathedral the Jack White Theater.[9][10][11]
Architecture [ edit ]
The Detroit Masonic Temple has been the largest Masonic Temple in the world since 1939, when the Chicago Masonic Temple was demolished. The stage of the auditorium is the second largest in the United States, having a width between walls of 100 feet (30 m) and a depth from the curtain line of 55 feet (17 m).[citation needed]
The large complex includes a 16-story 210-foot (64 m) ritual building connected to a 10-story wing for the Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine, now known as Shriners International, by the 7-story Auditorium Building. In between these areas are a 1,586-seat Scottish Rite Cathedral, and a 17,500-square-foot (1,630 m2) drill hall used for trade shows and conventions. The drill hall is also home to Detroit Roller Derby.[12] The drill hall has a floating floor, where the entire floor is laid on felt cushions. This type of construction, also known as a sprung floor, provides 'give' to the floor which tends to relieve the marchers.[citation needed]
The building houses two ballrooms: the Crystal Ballroom; and the Fountain Ballroom, the latter of which measures 17,264 square feet (1,603.9 m2) and accommodates up to 1,000 people. An unfinished theatre located in the top floor of the tower would have seated about 700.[citation needed]
Seven "Craft Lodge Rooms" all have different decorative treatments, the motifs of decoration being taken from the Egyptian, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, Italian Renaissance, Byzantine, Gothic, and Romanesque styles. All of the artwork throughout the building, especially the decorated ceilings, was done under the direction of Italian artists. The building includes Royal Arch room, as well as a Commandery Asylum for the Knights Templar.[citation needed]
The Scottish Rite Cathedral has a seating capacity of 1600. Its stage is 64-feet (19.5 m) wide from wall to wall, with a depth of 37 feet (11 m) from the foot lights.[citation needed]
Architect George D. Mason designed the theatre, which contains a 55-foot-by-100-foot (17 x 30 m) stage. Detroit Masonic Temple was designed in the neo-gothic architectural style, and is faced with Indiana limestone.[5] Although few Masonic buildings are in the Gothic style, the architect believed that Gothic best exemplified Masonic traditions.[5]
Much of the stone, plaster, and metal work in the interior of the building was designed and executed by architectural sculptor Corrado Parducci. The three figures over the main entrance were by Leo Friedlander, while the rest of the considerable architectural sculpture on the exterior was by Bill Gehrke.[citation needed]

If you haven't yet purchased the awesome Blu-ray release of David Fincher‘s The Social Network — why the heck not? Do so now! For those of you who have abandoned purchasing physical media, IMDB has you covered — they have posted the entire 93-minute behind the scenes documentary titled “How Did They Ever Make a Movie of Facebook?” that is included in the supplemental features (note: there are more featurettes on the disc in addition to this bad boy). Unlike most studio-produced documentaries, this behind the scenes look gives you a more honest look at what it was like to make the movie. Okay, now, look at your schedule — clear out an hour an half, because you're going to want to watch this. Trust me.
Here are the quick links to the four parts of the behind the scenes documentary:
Thanks to the FilmStage for the heads-up. And if you have the DVD/Blu-ray, be sure to watch the featurette “Jeff Cronenweth and David Fincher on the Visuals” (which I can't find online).
125mm Handover Ceremony The new 125mm cannon tech demonstrator received a public and high profile send off, complete with a large complement of PLA personnel, speeches from top CNU officials and interested onlookers. The shell cartridge on the left side of the table is over 1 meter in length. migaoyang32 at lt.cjdby.net
While new tanks like the Russian Armata and Turkish Altay are taking the spotlight in the world of armored vehicles, China has a new tank gun that might just beat them all. The 127th Ordinance Institute, of the Central Northern University, handed over a new 125mm cannon to PLA officers at a June 10, 2015 ceremony. The Institute claims that the new multipurpose cannon will have the highest range, velocity and penetration power of any 120mm/125mm cannon in the world. Where the story gets more interesting is that by June 14, all references to the new 125mm cannon had been scrubbed from the University's website, which suggests an official desire for secrecy during tests.
A New Multipurpose Cannon The 127th Ordinance Research Institute's news 125mm tank cannon is the world' largest, with a barrel length over 7.5 meters and highly powerful shells. sy_wsh at lt.cjdby.net
The multipurpose cannon achieves its high performance through a high length to caliber ratio of at least 60:1 (the longest tank gun in service is the German 120mm cannon, which has a ratio of 55:1), and a larger cartridge, that stores more propellant explosives. While the multipurpose cannon is currently mounted on a towed carriage, several characteristics suggest that it is intended in use for enclosed spaces (IE tank turrets).
One Big Gun Looking at the staff preparing the gun (just for the handover ceremony), it's going to require a very big and tall turret to take advantage of the gun's full elevation capabilities (though the production model may have a lower maximum angle of fire), larger than those found on current Chinese tanks. Also note the fume extractor (the smooth bulge on the midsection of the barrel) that siphons off poisonous fumes and other propellant byproducts to avoid poisoning any turret crew. sy_wsh at lt.cjdby.net
Located on the middle of the barrel is a bore evacuator that aids in the release of combusted explosive fumes, to prevent those toxic gases from accumulating inside an enclosed space, which would otherwise poison crew members and foul the gun. The multipurpose cannon's recoil system is installed onto the top of the towed carriage frame and top of the cannon breech block, which is optimized for horizontal firing (anti-tank and direct fire) as opposed to high angle artillery fire.
Big Hopes The text on the red banner held up by PLA soldiers reads ""Central North University, 127th Ordnance Institute's Research Result (125mm multi-purpose gun) Handover Ceremony". If the multipurpose cannon is a success, then it will be an example of the Chinese defense industry moving into partnership with academic and academically based partners. Hongjian via China Defense Forum
This multipurpose cannon reportedly has a muzzle velocity of 2,000m per second for armored piercing fin stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS) rounds, whose discarding sabot concentrates the kinetic energy from propellant into frontal area of the penetrator rod, which is the size of a half dollar coin. For comparison, current Chinese 125mm APFSDS have a 1700m/s muzzle velocity, the German L55 has a muzzle velocity of 1,750m/s, and the US's M829A3 APFSDS round has a muzzle velocity of only 1,555m (but uses a larger penetrator with increased mass to increase imparted kinetic energy).
Cannon on the Move The 125mm multipurpose cannon tech demonstrator will be delivered to a PLA testing and proving ground. If successful, it will likely arm the next generation of Chinese main battle tanks, possibly just in time for the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic. Weibo
Just as importantly, the new tank cannon uses one piece ammunition, in contrast to the 125mm two piece ammunition used by current Chinese tanks such as the ZTZ-99 and ZTZ-96. The autoloader on those tanks are limited to two piece 125mm ammunition due to size restrictions, which in turn results in a smaller APFSDS rod with less kinetic energy. The new one piece 125mm ammunition will allow for larger APFSDS rods, while keeping the caliber to 125mm to save weight, as opposed to scaling up to a larger caliber, such as 140mm.
The Old Stuff This older two piece APFSDS 125mm ammunition's rod has a length of about 650mm, which makes it much smaller than the maximum 1200mm length for the new 125mm, one piece APFSDS shell. Its smaller rod has less mass (thus impacting enemy armor with less kinetic energy) because the hull mounted autoloaders of the ZTZ-99 and ZTZ-96 tanks are only large enough to handle smaller pieces of ammunition.

The 125mm multipurpose cannon is likely to be mounted on a new future Chinese tank, which will have to move its autoloader into the rear turret bustle, compared to the hull mounted ZTZ-99 autoloader. The long length of the multipurpose cannon may also mean that such future Chinese tanks would have limited maneuver room in tight urban spaces.
Recoil Hydraulics The recoil hydraulic tubes are positioned to so that they're attached to the top of the breech block (where the shell is loaded) and the top of the towed carriage mount. The optimizes reduction of recoil on the horizontal plane when conducting direct fire at enemy tanks, but raising the cannon to a higher elevation to fire at aircraft could damage the recoil system. sy_wsh at lt.cjdby.net
Older parks still must have an evacuation plan -- approved by the local municipality -- for residents to seek shelter off site in the event of severe weather.
Despite the law, people living in many of the state's mobile home parks often have nowhere to hide.
NOWHERE TO HIDE
5 EYEWITNESS NEWS reviewed thousands of pages of mobile home inspection reports from across the state.
The investigation found at least 60 violations relating to storm shelters, the lack of shelters or the lack of an approved plan for the residents who live there.
Sharon Weber lives across the street from the storm shelter at Pine Ridge Court in Becker.
If a storm hits, their plan is to ride it out in their home instead of the shelter.
“(The shelter) would be the last place I would go,” they said.
That's because Weber says the shelter floods to the knees every time it rains.
“It just pours in here,” they said.

Yet records show the state hasn't inspected the shelter in years because it is always locked.
Records show Pine Ridge Court has violated the law every year since 2012 by locking the structure, preventing state inspections and restricting access to residents.
Weber said they are one of only two people with a key to the shelter -- something experts say is a dangerous dilemma in an emergency when people need shelter fast.
The investigation found at least 15 similar violations where a park may have a storm shelter but there's confusion about who has a key, or it's in such a sad state people may not want to enter.
“I think there is room for laws or regulations to change,” said Steven Diaz, who is in charge of the more than 60 mobile home park inspectors in Minnesota.
A critical part of their team's job is to protect the people who live in the more than 500 parks.
Despite the numerous violations the KSTP investigation found, Diaz and their team have only sent 17 warning letters since 2010.
“One of the things that we focus on is the fact that they are affordable housing communities,” they said.
The state has the authority to levy fines of up to $10,000 to enforce the law, but since 2010 they have only fined seven parks and collected less than $2,000.
Diaz justifies the lack of fines, saying the penalties can cripple a park and force hundreds of families out of their homes.
“The public health and public safety risk of closing a park really is in most cases greater than the risk we have with severe weather,” they said.
PLAYING THE ODDS
In other words, the state is playing the odds.
“It's a gamble philosophy,” said Terry Stoltzman, director of Emergency Management for Anoka County. “Someday it's going to happen.”
Stoltzman strongly believes protecting life should be a top priority.
“I think we have a system that needs to be fixed and tweaked and customized to fit the right circumstances,” they said.
Instead, park owners are still getting by with the status quo.
“There's no plan and no place to go,” said Sandy Utke, who takes care of their 92-year-old mother at a mobile home park in Caledonia owned by the Midwest Bottle and Gas Company.
The owner of the park is business person Jim Senty, who lives in a $1.2 million mansion in Wisconsin.
But the people who live at their park have no approved evacuation plan.
According to state records, inspectors directed Senty's company nearly a decade ago to build a shelter or come up with an approved plan.
The park has not complied, and Senty did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
“If it's going to wipe out a bunch of trailers and you're in the bathroom, you might as well been sitting outside under a bush,” Utke said.
'THEY ALL KNOW … NOT TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY'
All Parks Alliance for Change is an advocacy group for mobile home park residents. The group successfully lobbied for Minnesota's storm shelter law in the late-1980s.
But according to Executive Director Dave Anderson, word has spread among park owners about what they can get away with.
“They all collectively know not to take it seriously,” they said. “They're showing no outward signs of being motivated to take any kind of action.”
5 EYEWITNESS NEWS put together a map of all the mobile home parks that had violations with storm shelters or evacuation plans in the latest inspection conducted by the state or the more than 30 delegation agencies that work with the state.
We reached out to the state and the delegation agencies to find out the status of each violation. The responses we received are included at the end of each description.
Introduction
In the previous papers, we have showcased the essential configuration in terms of external DLL importing into the solution and NuGet package installation. As we have stated earlier, the process of making the custom disassembler incorporates several development cycle layers, and we have already covered user interface designing, getting assembly origin information, and decompiling assembly members in the previous article. Now, we shall carry on our voyage by explaining the process of getting disassembled code in C# and MSIL language.
The .NET CLR provisions several programming languages, such as VC#, VisualBasic.NET, F# and managed C++. Components written for example in VB.NET or C++ can easily be reprocessed in code written in another language, for instance C#. As we know, code from these high-level languages gets compiled to a common Intermediate Language (IL) which runs in the Common Language Runtime (CLR). There are typically multiple reasons of code disassembling, ranging from interoperability purposes to recovering lost source code or finding security vulnerabilities. Disassembling can assist to audit the implementation of security-sensitive features such as authentication, authorization, and encryption. Disassembling .NET clients for security purposes can also facilitate ensuring that the software performs the expected tasks without hidden features such as spy- or adware.
UI Design recap
It doesn't matter how we design this software: our main goal is to implement the disassembling features. Before moving forward, it is mandatory to come up with the controls we are placing in the user interface design of this software, because we shall have to direct a particular form control to respond to an event; for instance, treeview control, which displays entire members' modules of the assembly, will display the corresponding MSIL or C# source during selection of any methods. Although this software implements numerous forms of control, as per the requirement of this paper, we are elaborating on these necessary controls only, which shall be confronted during coding.
Control Control Name Event TreeView tvMembers tvMembers_AfterSelect() TabControl tabControl1
tabPage1= C# code (Decompiled)
tabPage2= IL code (Decompiled)
tabPage3= MsgBox Injector
tabPage4= exe Injector RichTextBox rtbCsharpCode RichTextBox rtbILCode Button btnLoadAssem btnLoadAssem_Click()
Getting Started
The moment the user uploads a .NET built assembly, the treeview control is activated and shall produce entire contents of the assembly in terms of modules and methods. As per the proposed functionality of this paper, we have to show the corresponding source code of an assembly in the form of C# of IL language. Here, we shall utilize the treeview control, which streamlines our job in terms of when we select a particular method or content of the assembly; the equivalent original source code (C#, MSIL) will appear in the rich text box which is located in the tab control. Hence, we will create an AfterSelect event for treeview control and place the following code as:
private void tvMembers_AfterSelect(object sender, TreeViewEventArgs e) { try { populateCsharpCode(); populateILCode(); } catch { MessageBox.Show("Expand the Namespace"); return; } }
We have put two methods inside the tvMemebers_AfterSelect() as populateCsharpCode() which expresses the C# source code, and rest displays the MSIL code.
C# Code Disassembling
In this section, we shall express the process of yielding C# source code from a selected method in the treeview control. We have seen the process of generating original source code earlier in erstwhile popular disassemblers, for instance ILSpy, ILPeek and Reflector. We are in fact implementing the same functionality and features in our software.
Hence, the very first line of code in the populateCsharpCode() reads an assembly from the text box control into a dynamic type variable, and later by using this variable, we are enumerating the main modules residing in the assembly through the loop, with the loop constructed as:
var assembly = AssemblyDefinition.ReadAssembly(txtURL.Text); IEnumerator enumerator = assembly.MainModule.Types.GetEnumerator(); while (enumerator.MoveNext()) { … .. }
In the loop, we shall define an object of TypeDefinition type, which possesses the modules of the assembly, and this is also used further to explorer the methods inside any selected modules as:
TypeDefinition td = (TypeDefinition)enumerator.Current; IEnumerator enumerator2 = td.Methods.GetEnumerator(); while (enumerator2.MoveNext()) {..}
Now, we get the reference of the method from the selected modules in the MethodDefinition object, and create an AstBuilder class object which typically performs the de-compilation process.
MethodDefinition method_definition = (MethodDefinition)enumerator2.Current; AstBuilder ast_Builder = null;
We again go through the current modules in the assembly using the foreach construct, and pass the current selected method reference to the AstBuilder class in order to disassemble its C# source code as:
foreach (var typeInAssembly in assembly.MainModule.Types) { ast_Builder = new AstBuilder( new ICSharpCode.Decompiler.DecompilerContext (assembly.MainModule) { CurrentType = typeInAssembly });
In this implementation, we are showing methods only in the contents portion. Hence, we also have to confirm that either we are selecting methods or other members of the assembly as:
foreach (var method in typeInAssembly.Methods) { if (method.Name == tvMembers.SelectedNode.Text) { …. } } }
Finally in the if condition block, we first flush the data in the rich text box control and pass the selected method parameters in the AddMethod() of AstBuilder class. Then we produce the output in the rich text box control using string builder class object:
rtbCsharpCode.Clear(); ast_Builder.AddMethod(method); StringWriter output = new StringWriter(); ast_Builder.GenerateCode(new PlainTextOutput(output)); string result = output.ToString(); rtbCsharpCode.AppendText(result); output.Dispose();
We have discussed and elaborated the line by line code meaning; so far, in the following table, we can obtain the complete C# source code disassembling code as:
private void populateCsharpCode() { var assembly = AssemblyDefinition.ReadAssembly(txtURL.Text); IEnumerator enumerator = assembly.MainModule.Types.GetEnumerator(); while (enumerator.MoveNext()) { TypeDefinition td = (TypeDefinition)enumerator.Current; IEnumerator enumerator2 = td.Methods.GetEnumerator(); while (enumerator2.MoveNext()) { MethodDefinition method_definition = (MethodDefinition)enumerator2.Current; AstBuilder ast_Builder = null; foreach (var typeInAssembly in assembly.MainModule.Types) { ast_Builder = new AstBuilder(new ICSharpCode.Decompiler.DecompilerContext (assembly.MainModule) { CurrentType = typeInAssembly }); foreach (var method in typeInAssembly.Methods) { if (method.Name == tvMembers.SelectedNode.Text) { rtbCsharpCode.Clear(); ast_Builder.AddMethod(method); StringWriter output = new StringWriter(); ast_Builder.GenerateCode(new PlainTextOutput(output)); string result = output.ToString(); rtbCsharpCode.AppendText(result); output.Dispose(); } } } } } }
IL Code Disassembling
…. if (method_definition.Name == tvMembers.SelectedNode.Text && !method_definition.IsSetter && !method_definition.IsGetter) { rtbILCode.Clear(); ILProcessor cilProcess = method_definition.Body.GetILProcessor(); foreach (Instruction ins in cilProcess.Body.Instructions) { rtbILCode.AppendText(ins + Environment.NewLine); } } ……….
The previous demonstration of C# source code was pretty exhaustive compared to IL code producing. In this segment, we will convert MSIL code from the selected method of the current assembly module. It is however almost the same process as the earlier section implementation, but this time we don't need to rely or call on AstBuilder class method in order to disassemble the code. Rather, a couple of .NET framework in-built classes such as ILProcessor are sufficient to produce IL code of the select method. Here what we are doing for each loop construct: we are just enumerating all corresponding IL code instructions and placing them into rich text box control. The following table presents the whole code of IL code disassembling:
private void populateILCode() { var assembly = AssemblyDefinition.ReadAssembly(txtURL.Text); IEnumerator enumerator = assembly.MainModule.Types.GetEnumerator(); while (enumerator.MoveNext()) { TypeDefinition td = (TypeDefinition)enumerator.Current; if (td.Name == tvMembers.SelectedNode.Parent.Text) { IEnumerator enumerator2 = td.Methods.GetEnumerator(); while (enumerator2.MoveNext()) { MethodDefinition method_definition = (MethodDefinition)enumerator2.Current; if (method_definition.Name == tvMembers.SelectedNode.Text && !method_definition.IsSetter && !method_definition.IsGetter) { rtbILCode.Clear(); ILProcessor cilProcess = method_definition.Body.GetILProcessor(); foreach (Instruction ins in cilProcess.Body.Instructions) { rtbILCode.AppendText(ins + Environment.NewLine); } } } } } }
Testing
It is important to test both of the implementations that we have described earlier. We shall demonstrate the C# source generation process. In order to fulfill our goal, we need an exe or DLL file, the source code of which we shall generate by using this software. The following DumySoftware.exe application is typically a login authentication mechanism, and it blocks our way in case we do not enter the correct user name and password.
Hence, we open this application .exe file into Spyware Injector & Decompiler software. It will display .exe file contents with its origin information. The moment we expand the main modules of this assembly in the treeview control and select any method, we find its C# source code in the control tab:
We can also view the MSIL code as we had seen such code using ILDASM.exe utility. The process of MSIL code disassembling is similar to C# code decompilation. We first have to select the method from the tab control and switch on the IL code tab as following.
Final Note
This is the second version of “disassembler mechanized”, accompanied with additional features of development in the custom disassembler. The goal of this paper is to summarize knowledge of how to make a disassembler which produces code from a .NET assembly in both C# and IL format languages. We have observed the process of obtaining C# code in a step by step, detailed manner, along with generation of MSIL code too. In the next article, we shall present the development of custom .exe or code injection tactics in the form of both message box and spyware.
Great Britain is in the midst of an energy crisis. The country's climate agenda has curtailed electricity production and now there may not be enough power to continually keep the lights on in the UK.
Britain's energy crisis is getting so bad that the country faces “Second World War-style” rationing in order to keep the lights on throughout the country, according to the Register.
The government is launching major energy reforms to lower power demand and reopen power plants previously shut down to comply with European Union environmental rules. One such reform is that the government will pay factories to “voluntarily” shut down during peak hours when wind energy can't produce enough power.
The government will also start paying companies to provide their own back-up power and energy producers will be able to “name their own price” for bringing coal plants online that were shuttered due to strict environmental regulations.
EU environmental rules forced many UK coal plants and other fossil fuel-fired plants to shut down. The problem is they were largely replaced with green energy, like wind power, which only produces electricity when the wind is blowing.
Opting to build costly green energy with reliability issues means UK officials are going to look at more demand-side policies to lower energy consumption. Paying factories voluntarily to shut down is just one of those options.
Despite the huge problems, Britain still plans on building more wind turbines and other green energy sources to fight global warming, reports the UK Telegraph. The UK's National Grid CEO Steve Holliday said plans to pay factories to shut down were “just the beginning” of more policies to reduce energy demand.
“We should be optimistic that demand response could avert the need to build significant amounts of power stations in ten years' time or so,” Holliday said. They added that people have always had “expectations that the supply will always be there”, but this will no longer be the case with more green energy on the grid.
Holliday added that building new sources of green energy that are subject to wind speeds and sunlight would be much costlier than encouraging people to lower their demand for power.
“We have to get used to a world in which when power is cheap we use it, when power is expensive we find a way of not using it,” they said. “This is the beginning of a world in which demand will be managed more actively by all of us as consumers, when we have smarter homes, smarter meters.”
“Going low carbon has forced us to consider greater demand side participation in the market because of the variability of renewables,” said Richard Smith, head of the National Grid's energy strategy and policy, told the Telegraph.
Smith added that businesses could volunteer to shut off power when they see weather forecasts showing wind power generation would be too low to keep the lights on.
“You can see it coming two or three days ahead,” Smith said. “You will see people start to respond to that kind of thing, thinking ‘how flexibly can I manage my business and respond to that?'”
The UK's climate agenda has been hotly contested in the country as household and business energy bills rise due to green taxes, high gas prices and costly green energy. A report by the Global Warming Policy Foundation argues that UK climate laws have only made energy and food prices skyrocket.
“Energy sources that are not based on fossil fuels make power and food – both of vital importance for the poor – more expensive and more difficult to obtain,” wrote Cambridge University professor Anthony Kelly for the GWPF. Sadly, Kelly passed away earlier this month.
“Despite the pressing need for cheap energy to alleviate the plight of the poor, policy measures introduced under the Climate Change Act and their equivalents in other countries have led to a marked increase in the price of energy,” Kelly said.

Composition testing of what is purportedly a shell for Apple's next-generation iPhone confirms previous reports that the new device will move to 7000-series aluminum, an alloy first introduced to Apple's lineup with the Watch.
The supposed iPhone 6s shell acquired by Unbox Therapy shows high concentrations of zinc, indicative of 7000-series aluminum. Generally speaking, adding zinc —along with magnesium— to create 7000-series aluminum results in an alloy that is much harder than the more popular 6000-series, and consequently more difficult to work with.When the Watch was announced, Apple proudly pointed out that the 7000-series alloy used in the sport models was in fact a custom Apple composition, though it's still not clear exactly what they changed. It's possible that they could've made concessions to make the material easier to handle during manufacturing, for instance, though they claim substantial improvements in strength."For Apple Watch Sport, we started with 7000 Series aluminum —the same used in competition bicycles," Apple says on its website. "We altered it to create a new alloy that's just as light, yet even more durable —it's 60 percent stronger than most aluminum, and one-third the density of stainless steel."While it's not clear whether the alloy used for the iPhone 6s will be exactly the same as the one used for the Watch, the move is likely to make the handsets much stronger. Many users have found that the smoothly-rounded corners of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are easy to dent, a charge long leveled at the also-aluminum MacBook lineup.The YouTube video also shows a "bend test" that indicates the new iPhone shell will be significantly stiffer than its predecessor, though the rig used is not a standard material deformation gauge, making the actual results of the testing somewhat questionable.
LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES & EXECUTIVE ACTIONS
Today the White House announced major steps to improve incentives for future innovation in high tech patents, a key driver of economic growth and good paying American jobs. The White House issued five executive actions and seven legislative recommendations designed to protect innovators from frivolous litigation and ensure the highest-quality patents in our system. Additionally, the National Economic Council and the Council of Economic Advisers released a report, Patent Assertion and U.S. Innovation, detailing the challenges posed and necessity for bold legislative action.
In 2011, the President signed the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA), a landmark piece of legislation designed to help make our patent system more efficient and reliable. As technology evolves more rapidly than ever, we must ensure our patent system keeps pace. As President Obama said in February, “our efforts at patent reform only went about halfway to where we need to go. What we need to do is pull together additional stakeholders and see if we can build some additional consensus on smarter patent laws.”
The AIA put in place new mechanisms for post-grant review of patents and other reforms to boost patent quality. Meanwhile, court decisions clarifying the scope of patentability and guidelines implementing these decisions diminish the opportunity to game the patent and litigation systems. Nevertheless, innovators continue to face challenges from Patent Assertion Entities (PAEs), companies that, in the President's words “don't actually produce anything themselves,” and instead develop a business model “to essentially leverage and hijack somebody else's idea and see if they can extort some money out of them.” These entities are commonly known as “patent trolls.” Likewise, the so-called “Smartphone Patent Wars” have ballooned in recent years and today, several major companies spend more on patent litigation and defensive acquisition than on research and development.
Stopping this drain on the American economy will require swift legislative action, and we are encouraged by the attention the issue is receiving in recent weeks. We stand ready to work with Congress on these issues crucial to our economy, American jobs, and innovation. While no single law or policy can address all these issues, much can and should be done to increase clarity and level the playing field for innovators.
LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS
In that spirit, the Administration recommends that Congress pursues at least seven legislative measures that would have immediate effect on some major problems innovators face. These measures would:
Require patentees and applicants to disclose the “Real Party-in-Interest,” by requiring that any party sending demand letters, filing an infringement suit or seeking PTO review of a patent to file updated ownership information, and enabling the PTO or district courts to impose sanctions for non-compliance. Permit more discretion in awarding fees to prevailing parties in patent cases, providing district courts with more discretion to award attorney's fees under 35 USC 285 as a sanction for abusive court filings (similar to the legal standard that applies in copyright infringement cases). Expand the PTO's transitional program for covered business method patents to include a broader category of computer-enabled patents and permit a wider range of challengers to petition for review of issued patents before the Patent Trial and Appeals Board (PTAB). Protect off-the-shelf use by consumers and businesses by providing them with better legal protection against liability for a product being used off-the-shelf and solely for its intended use. Also, stay judicial proceedings against such consumers when an infringement suit has also been brought against a vendor, retailer, or manufacturer. Change the ITC standard for obtaining an injunction to better align it with the traditional four-factor test in eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, to enhance consistency in the standards applied at the ITC and district courts. Use demand letter transparency to help curb abusive suits, incentivizing public filing of demand letters in a way that makes them accessible and searchable to the public. Ensure the ITC has adequate flexibility in hiring qualified Administrative Law Judges.
EXECUTIVE ACTIONS
Today the Administration is also announcing a number of steps it is taking to help bring about greater transparency to the patent system and level the playing field for innovators. Those steps include:
The Supreme Court on Tuesday, April 28, heard oral arguments over whether states' same-sex marriage bans are constitutional, setting the stage for a final decision on marriage equality by the end of June. Federal appeals courts have disagreed on whether states' bans violate the US Constitution's 14th Amendment, leaving it to the Supreme Court to decide the issue.
Same-sex marriages are already allowed in 37 states and Washington, DC, but many hinge on lower courts' decisions in favor of marriage equality.
The Supreme Court's marriage battle has been years in the making
A flurry of legal challenges to states' same-sex marriage bans followed the Supreme Court's decision in June 2013 to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act, the federal ban on same-sex marriages. Since then, lower courts have invoked the Supreme Court's ruling to end states' same-sex marriage bans under the argument that they violate the 14th Amendment's Due Process and Equal Protection clauses. Here's a look back at the history:
The cases could bring marriage equality to the entire US
Legal experts and LGBT advocates widely expect the Supreme Court to rule that states' same-sex marriage bans are unconstitutional — a decision that would effectively bring marriage equality to the US.
Justice Anthony Kennedy, who could act as the key swing vote in the court, wrote the majority opinion in United States v. Windsor that struck down the federal ban on same-sex marriages in 2013 with a legal rationale that could apply to states' bans. They argued that the federal ban violated constitutional protections and discriminated against same-sex couples by preventing them from fully accessing "laws pertaining to Social Security, housing, taxes, criminal sanctions, copyright, and veterans' benefits."
Because a similar legal argument applies to state-level programs and benefits attached to marriage, and Kennedy appeared to invoke a similar argument in oral arguments, many court watchers expect Kennedy to rule against states' same-sex marriage bans, as well.
"The court was so focused on the tens of thousands of children being raised by same-sex parents and so sensitive to the ways those children are being disadvantaged and harmed and stigmatized," Shannon Minter, legal director at the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said. "It's hard to see how those same considerations wouldn't end up applying equally or even more forcefully to state marriage bans."
it's possible that not just Kennedy but Roberts could join the final decision in favor of marriage equality
Those considerations are particularly important, LGBT advocates argue, since the Supreme Court in October 2014 effectively legalized same-sex marriages in 11 states by refusing to hear appeals from cases originating in Utah, Oklahoma, Virginia, Wisconsin, and Indiana.
"It is almost inconceivable that having allowed so many couples to marry and so many families to gain the legal security and protection of marriage, the court would then roll back the clock," Minter said. "That would be not only cruel but chaotic."
It's possible that the Supreme Court might not rule in favor of marriage equality. It could hand down a limited ruling that forces states to recognize but not grant same-sex marriage licenses. It could also uphold states' same-sex marriage bans, which would effectively reinstate bans in dozens of states and — potentially — rescind the marriages of couples who were married between the time lower courts allowed their unions and the final Supreme Court decision.
But as the history indicates, some of the key members of the Supreme Court have been signaling for some time now that they're prepared to make same-sex marriage rights the law of the land, leaving LGBT advocates very optimistic.
The arguments for and against come down to discrimination
Supporters of same-sex marriage argue that prohibiting gay and lesbian couples from marrying is inherently discriminatory and therefore violates the US Constitution's 14th Amendment, which require states enforce their laws equally among all groups. In the case of same-sex marriage, states' bans likely violate the 14th Amendment because they purposely exclude gay and lesbian couples from marriage laws.
The 14th Amendment "was designed to, really, perfect the promise of the Declaration of Independence," Judith Schaeffer, vice president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, said. "The purpose and the meaning of the 14th Amendment is to make clear that no state can take any group of citizens and make them second-class."
In 1967, the Supreme Court applied both of these standards in Loving v. Virginia when the court decided that the 14th Amendment prohibits states from banning interracial couples from marrying.
"This case presents a constitutional question never addressed by this Court: whether a statutory scheme adopted by the State of Virginia to prevent marriages between persons solely on the basis of racial classifications violates the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment," Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote in the majority opinion at the time. "For reasons which seem to us to reflect the central meaning of those constitutional commands, we conclude that these statutes cannot stand consistently with the Fourteenth Amendment."
Very similar arguments could be applied to states' same-sex marriage bans. In fact, the Supreme Court applied the 14th Amendment to its 2013 decision in United States v. Windsor, when it struck down the federal government's same-sex marriage ban.
Opponents of same-sex marriage argue that individual states are acting in the public interest by encouraging heterosexual relationships through marriage laws. The conservative Family Research Council, for instance, has warned that allowing same-sex couples to marry would lead to the breakdown of traditional families, and keeping marriage to heterosexual couples, FRC argued in an amicus brief, allows states to "channel the potential procreative sexual activity of opposite-sex couples into stable relationships in which the children so procreated may be raised by their biological mothers and fathers."
The idea behind this type of argument is that states have a compelling interest to encourage heterosexual relationships without the explicit purpose of discriminating against gay and lesbian couples. If states have a compelling interest, the same-sex marriage bans may be allowed to stand. But if the bans are seen as discriminatory, the Supreme Court may interpret them as violating the 14th Amendment.
The compelling interest argument hasn't worked well in lower courts. Various federal appeals courts have come out in favor of marriage equality, while only one has ruled against it. Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Richard Posner, a Republican appointee, wrote in their court's majority opinion:
The argument that the states press hardest in defense of their prohibition of same-sex marriage is that the only reason government encourages marriage is to induce heterosexuals to marry so that there will be fewer "accidental births," which when they occur outside of marriage often lead to abandonment of the child to the mother (unaided by the father) or to foster care. Overlooked by this argument is that many of those abandoned children are adopted by homosexual couples, and those children would be better off both emotionally and economically if their adoptive parents were married.
Justice Kennedy, who's expected to act as the swing vote in the Supreme Court cases, similarly flipped the argument around when they wrote in 2013 that the federal same-sex marriage ban needed to be struck down because "it humiliates tens of thousands of children now being raised by same-sex couples." They also made a similar argument during oral hearings in the current cases. Kennedy's argument and the nearly unanimous decisions in the lower courts give LGBT advocates a lot of confidence that they're headed for a victory.
The cases are about two aspects of marriage equality
The Supreme Court has consolidated cases from Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee that deal with two key issues: whether states should have to recognize — but not license — same-sex marriages from other states, and the broader issue of whether states should have to grant marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples.
Kentucky has both types of cases, Michigan has a licensing case, Ohio has two recognition cases, and Tennessee has a recognition case. Federal judges ruled in favor of same-sex couples in all these cases before the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against them.
Here's a quick summary of each case, based largely on Freedom to Marry's great litigation tracker:
Bourke v. Beshear in Kentucky: Four same-sex couples sued Kentucky to have their out-of-state marriages recognized by the state. This lawsuit was later consolidated with Love v. Beshear .
in Kentucky: Four same-sex couples sued Kentucky to have their out-of-state marriages recognized by the state. This lawsuit was later consolidated with . Love v. Beshear in Kentucky: Two same-sex couples filed a motion to intervene in Bourke v. Beshear so that Kentucky would allow them to marry in the state. A federal judge rolled Bourke v. Beshear into this case.
in Kentucky: Two same-sex couples filed a motion to intervene in so that Kentucky would allow them to marry in the state. A federal judge rolled into this case. DeBoer v. Snyder in Michigan: April DeBoer and Jayne Rowse sued Michigan so they could jointly adopt their three children, which the state prohibits. A judge later explained that the constitutional amendment that banned same-sex marriages in the state also prohibited the couples from adopting, prompting the couple to eventually expand their lawsuit to contest the state's same-sex marriage ban.

Obergefell v.

Arthur died in October 2013, as the court challenge was still pending.
Henry v. Hodges in Ohio: Four same-sex couples sued Ohio so both parents in a couple could have their names printed on their adopted children's birth certificates. (Under Ohio law, only one parent in a same-sex relationship can have their or their name printed on a birth certificate.) The case was later expanded to cover not just Ohio's birth certificate law, but whether the state should recognize same-sex couples' out-of-state marriages.
Tanco v. Haslam in Tennessee: Three same-sex couples sued Tennessee to have their out-of-state marriages recognized by the state.
These cases are a small sample of dozens of similar same-sex marriage lawsuits that have passed through the federal court system in the past few years. But the split in the federal appeals court has turned these six cases into quite possibly the most important for marriage equality.

Watch: How marriage equality swept the nation
A wide-ranging poll conducted by an Alabama firm indicates Republican Roy Moore is still holding a strong lead in their Senate race.
At the same time, Democrat Doug Jones is polling well enough to show "signs of life" for the Democratic Party in a deeply Republican state, the poll's memo said.
And Gov. Kay Ivey received indicators of strong support in their bid to be elected governor next year, receiving a more favorable rating from poll participants than President Trump.
Cygnal conducted the landline and cell phone survey Oct. 2-5, polling 497 Senate general election voters. The poll has a margin of error of 4.4 percent. It's the first poll Cygnal said it had conducted since July in which at least 90 percent of participants said they were definitely voting in the Dec. 12 Senate election.
Moore holds an eight-point lead over Jones in the poll released exactly two months before the election. Moore got support from 49 percent of poll participants to Jones' 41 percent.
That's consistent with two other polls released during the general election campaign that had Moore leading by six and eight points.
Roy Moore holds 8-point lead on Doug Jones, Senate poll says The poll found that softening support for President Trump could be a troubling sign for Moore.
Name recognition is still an issue for Jones, the poll said. Eighteen percent of poll participants said they had "never heard" of Jones -- the former U.S. attorney who successfully prosecuted two men charged in the 1963 church bombing in Birmingham that killed four young girls during the Civil Rights Movement.
Meanwhile, Jones has a five-point lead among poll participants ages 18-49, which the poll memo said would make up just 27 percent of the projected electorate. Voters 50 and older, however, favor Moore by 12 points.
Jones is polling strongest in their home market of Birmingham, leading Moore 46-45 percent. In other major markets around the state, Moore holds at least a 14-point lead. Moore's strong support among large media markets is in Mobile, where they lead 57-36.
The poll also said 51 percent of poll participants identified as Alabama Crimson Tide fans to 22 percent for the Auburn Tigers. Moore graduated from Alabama.
"Judge Roy Moore's 'manifest destiny' to fill Alabama's vacant U.S. Senate seat hasn't shown any signs of slowing down in the general election environment," the poll's memo said. " Fueled by strong combination of support from fans of their alma mater and the low name ID of their opponent, Moore is out to an early eight-point lead.
"Despite Moore's seeming grip on the Senate seat, Jones' 41 percent support in a 'crimson' red state shows signs of life for the Democrat's campaign - or at least reflects the polarizing nature of their opponent."
The memo invoked Auburn's miracle 2013 defeat of Alabama by returning a missed field goal 109 yards for the winning touchdown as time expired - known as the Kick 6 - to demonstrate the state of the Senate race.
"As with every survey, final results will determine by turnout," the memo said. " The results of this survey indicate that a lower turnout bodes well for Moore. While we expect this race to heat up significantly moving into November, any scenario short of a Kick-6 turnaround will have Moore on the victor's stage in December."
The poll also asked participants about its views on Ivey - who became governor in April after Robert Bentley's scandal-forced resignation. Poll participants gave Ivey a 65 percent favorable rating - higher than Trump's 58 percent or Moore's 53 percent. Jones had a favorable rating of 43 percent.
Ivey, twice elected the state's lieutenant governor, is seeking to be elected governor next year.

Colorado State University announced today that it has received a $53.3 million gift, the largest in the University's history, from business icon Walter Scott, Jr. of Omaha, Neb. The commitment will provide wide-reaching support for student scholarships, faculty excellence and research.
In recognition of this monumental gift, the College of Engineering will be renamed the Walter Scott, Jr. College of Engineering, becoming the only named college of engineering in Colorado. It is the second of CSU's eight colleges to be named for a prominent alumnus. In 2005, the Warner College of Natural Resources was named for Edward M. Warner.
“We are humbled and incredibly grateful for this remarkable gift from Walter Scott,” said CSU President Tony Frank. “Walter has been a passionate and generous supporter of CSU since they graduated more than 60 years ago, and this gift is truly transformational. It will allow the Walter Scott, Jr. College of Engineering to attract and support the finest faculty and students for years to come. This truly is a great, great day in Colorado State University's history.”
With more than forty years of development under its belt, the 5 Series just gets better and better. This latest model is a technical tour de force, plus it delivers class leading refinement and comfort. Yet like all BMW models, it's surprisingly efficient and great to drive. We'll have to wait until we get the car in the UK for our definitive verdict, but on this showing the executive car class has a new king.
For more than 40 years, the BMW 5 Series saloon has been battling it out at the the top of the executive car class. Yet recently, the current version has begun to show its age and has been overtaken by newer rivals from Mercedes, Audi and Jaguar.
However, BMW isn't taking this lying down and has pulled the covers off an all-new, seventh generation version of its popular 5 Series saloon.
Not only is the new 5 Series faster, lighter and more efficient than ever, but it's loaded with top-shelf tech and promises to rival larger luxury cars for comfort and quality. Plus, bosses claim that the combination of a crash diet and sophisticated chassis upgrades make the 5 Series almost as agile as the smaller 3 Series saloon.
• Best executive cars on sale right now
So then, BMW has set a tall order for itself and the new 5 Series. We got behind the wheel of one of the first examples in Portugal and gave it a thorough workout on some challenging roads. The 520d is tipped to be the biggest seller, but the only diesel car available on this early launch was the bigger, six-cylinder 530d.
Image 2 of 30 Image 2 of 30
Step up to the newcomer and it is clear BMW has taken no risks with the design. In such a conservative sector it's clear that the design mantra within the firm was ‘evolution not revolution'. It's handsome and beautifully proportioned, but many of the visual cues have been carried over from the previous car.
There are some neat details, though. Like on the 3 Series, the distinctive LED headlamps now flow into the large double kidney grille, plus the car's sheet metal features more eye-catching curves and creases. These additions help hide the car's bulk, and despite being 36mm longer and 6mm wider than before, the 5 Series looks no bigger than its predecessor. It's aerodynamic, too, with entry-level models delivering a stunning low drag coefficient of 0.22Cd.
Our Luxury trim test car won't be available in the UK, but visually and mechanically it's virtually identical to the SE that will be the big seller here. Buyers wanting an injection of racy appeal can choose the M Sport model, which adds deeper front and rear bumpers, subtle side skirts and larger 19-inch alloys.
Image 3 of 30 Image 3 of 30
Yet while the exterior of the 5 Series is fairly conventional, under the skin there have been big changes. The basic platform is shared with the flagship 7 Series, but without that model's expensive carbon fibre core. However, extensive use of aluminium for the structure, body panels and suspension means the newcomer weighs around 100kg less than the old car.
These weight-savings combine with the double wishbone front suspension and new five-link rear axle to give the 5 Series more alert and agile responses than both its predecessor and its immediate rivals. The BMW's crash diet also helps boost performance.
Our test car was fitted with the heavily reworked 3.0-litre six-cylinder diesel, which features an uprated version of the brand's Twin Power variable geometry turbo technology. As a result, it pumps out 261bhp and a thumping 620Nm of torque, which is available from just 2,000rpm. In combination with our-car's grippy xDrive all-wheel drive system it allows the 530d to rocket from 0-60mph in just 5.4 seconds, which is three-tenths faster than the standard car.
Image 5 of 30 Image 5 of 30
Yet it's the engine's muscular mid-range that impresses the most. It doesn't matter what gear you're in, simply squeeze the throttle and the 5 Series lunges forward as if fired from a giant elastic band. The impression of speed is heightened by the standard eight-speed gearbox. It smoothly slurs ratios in auto mode yet delivers rapid fire shifts via steering wheel paddles when you're in the mood for fun, which is likely to be a regular occurrence when you're behind the wheel of the 5 Series.
Turn into a corner and the BMW responds quickly to the light and accurate steering, while strong front-end grip allows you confidently lock onto your chosen line. This nimble nature means that before long you've forgotten about the 5 Series' imposing dimensions and are throwing the car through bends with the sort of enthusiasm normally reserved for much smaller machines.
Our car's acrobatic agility was further enhanced by its optional £995 Integral Active Steering set-up, which is available with xDrive four-wheel drive for the first time. This electronically controlled set-up that turns the rear wheels in opposite direction to the fronts significantly boost manoeuvrability. At higher speeds the rears point the same way, sharpening turn-in and boosting stability.
Image 16 of 30 Image 16 of 30
All BMW 5 Series models get the familiar Driving Experience Control that gives you access to Comfort, Sport and ECO PRO modes - each tailoring the steering and throttle response to suit conditions and your mood.
Our car was also fitted with optional £985 adaptive dampers, which tense up or soften off depending on your chosen setting. Add this upgrade with the enhanced Professional infotainment system and you'll also unlock the Adaptive mode. This clever set-up constantly monitors your inputs to deliver the appropriate responses, plus it uses the sat-nav to prime the car for upcoming hazards, such as sharp bends or junctions. It works so smoothly that you're barely aware it's pulling strings behind the scenes.
Of course, the 5 Series is as likely to be cruising up and down motorways or crawling along in the daily commute as it is blasting down back roads, so refinement is as important as razor sharp response.
With optional adaptive dampers the 5 Series takes most bumps in its stride. In Comfort mode the suspension is supple, while even the firmer Sport setting does a fine job of smothering imperfections. Yet while BMW has worked hard to reduce unsprung mass, the 5 Series' large wheels occasionally crash violently into potholes.
Image 19 of 30 Image 19 of 30
In all other respects, the BMW is impressively quiet, and in most situations there's little to choose between it and the range-topping 7 Series. Part of this hushed character can be attributed to the brand's SYNTAK technology, which essentially encases the engine compartment in soundproof material. At idle the 3.0-litre diesel is virtually silent, and even when worked hard it emits little more than a muted growl.
Wind noise is also almost absent, thanks to both the impressively slippery aerodynamics and the special acoustic glass. In fact, only coarse road surfaces disrupt the air of calm in the 5 Series, with some road roar filtering into the cabin.
The car's upper class ambience is further boosted by its exquisitely finished cabin, which oozes premium appeal. Top notch materials are used throughout and the build quality is easily a match for Audi and Mercedes. A wide array of trim inserts and leather seat finishes allow you to create an even more bespoke feel.
Like in all BMW saloons, the driver sits low, while the 7 Series-inspired wraparound dashboard and TFT dials place you firmly at the centre of the action. As you'd expect from BMW, the layout of the controls is spot on, while the switchgear operates with crisp precision.
Image 17 of 30 Image 17 of 30
Highlights include the latest infotainment system that uses a large 10.25-inch screen mounted on top of the dash. As before you can use the trademark rotary controller to access all the functions, but the set-up also gets an upgrade of the gesture control tech first seen on the 7 Series. By simply waving your fingers and hands in front of the centre console you can adjust the stereo volume, access various menus, accept incoming phone calls and much more besides. On the whole the £160 option works well and is very rarely confused. However, we'd expect Apple CarPlay to be standard, and not a £235 extra.
Other hi-tech additions include the BMW's most advanced autonomous driving set-up yet, which has the ability accelerate, brake and steer the car at speeds of up to 130mph. It works remarkably well, but it does require you to keep reminding it that you're awake and paying attention.
Of course, you can always ask another human being to take control and relax in the back seats. The 7mm stretch in wheelbase means the 5 Series is now up with the best in the class for rear seat legroom, while the capacity boot has increased by 10-litres to 530-litres – although the load bay is hampered by some awkward intrusions.
Prices for the new 5 Series start at £36,025 for the 520d SE, rising to £49,945 for the flagship 540i xDrive M Sport. However, a large majority of 5 Series sales will go to business users, who demand low emissions for reduced benefit in kind bills. The newcomer isn't quite as clean as the Mercedes E-Class, but the 520d emits just 108g/km and promises 68.8mpg at the pumps. Even the rapid, four-wheel drive 530d driven here claims 132g/km and an impressive 56.5mpg.
DENVER -- The booming marijuana industry went to a federal judge Monday seeking an answer to the problem that has vexed business owners trying to emerge from the black market: Now that pot is legal and taxed in some states, why can't they put the proceeds in a bank?
A Colorado credit union designed to serve the pot industry - Fourth Corner Credit Union - was challenging a decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City to keep the pot bank from accessing the nation's financial system. The feds' rejection earlier this year means that the pot bank can't take deposits or issue credit - leaving many marijuana businesses operating on a cash-only basis.
"What do you want us to do with the money?" cried an exasperated Mark Mason, lawyer for the credit union, which was chartered by Colorado last year but has been unable to start taking customers.
The credit union claims that although marijuana remains illegal under federal law, the Federal Reserve as a quasi-government institution lacks the authority to keep marijuana banks out of the nation's financial system. Mason argued that a pot bank would serve the government's interest in keeping better tabs on the drug money.
"They intend to take this money out of shadows and off of the street so that they can track it and trace it," Mason argued.
But the Federal Reserve lawyer insisted the bank is too risky.
"It's a risk the Federal Reserve has decided they don't want to take on," said Scott Barker, arguing for the Federal Reserve.
U.S. District Judge R. Brooke Jackson repeatedly said they sympathize with the struggling pot businesses. Jackson twice called existing federal guidance on marijuana money a "nothingburger," meaning that memos from the Treasury and Department of Justice don't solve the federal-state conflicts caused by legalizing pot.
But they seemed hesitant to order the Federal Reserve to give a pot bank access to the banking system as long as the bank is relying on memos from federal agencies, and not an act of Congress, to say pot shops should have a way to avoid dealing in cash.
"We think there ought to be banking and regulation. I get that. I agree with that. But that's not the legal question here, is it?" Jackson said.
The pot bank's lawyer argued that national marijuana legalization is inevitable, but Jackson retorted that the pot bank should take up its problem with Congress and not the courts.
"If I were in the Congress, I'd vote for you, but I've got to do the job of a federal judge here," Jackson said.
The judge repeatedly tried to encourage the sides to work something out themselves, perhaps by agreeing that Fourth Corner would serve only people who believe marijuana should be legal, not taking money from businesses that sell pot.
Jackson pointed out that hundreds of banks already do take pot proceeds, even if they sometimes pretend they don't know what they're doing. For example, the state of Colorado uses Wells Fargo bank, meaning that tax proceeds from the sale of marijuana goes into the nation's banking system already.
"I think there's a certain unfairness to allowing these big banks to serve this business and keeping you out.
"But it's not for me, I don't think, to decide issues of fairness or policy. My job is to enforce and apply the law," Jackson said.
The judge has no deadline to decide the case. They joked that if they issued a ruling Monday, the losing side would file an appeal "before I could go home and watch the Broncos game tonight."

The Campbell Parks and Recreation Foundation fanned out Aug. 5 to plant trees near sidewalks as well as plant the seeds for future volunteerism.
The foundation and volunteers planted nine trees along Pollard Road and Abbott Avenue near Jack Fischer Park. More than 30 volunteers joined in from the Archbishop Mitty Interact Club, Home Church and Delphi Academy.
While the city is no stranger to volunteers lending a helping hand, this time Friends of Children with Special Needs also participated. The nonprofit group is dedicated to providing support, friendship and life skills training to developmentally disabled people and their families.
“We do a lot of tree plantings in Campbell, but this time was different,” said Nina Myers, the outgoing Archbishop Mitty High School Interact Club president. “We had other students with special needs. Some of the Interact kids have never interacted with them before this.”
Like the Campbell Reporter Facebook page for neighborhood news and conversation from Campbell and beyond.
“Integration into the community is very important to our clients,” said Sylvia Yeh, the executive business director for Friends of Children with Special Needs. “We don't want to hide them.”
The organization began in 1996 with 10 families, and has grown to serve more than 1,000 families with special needs children. Its headquarters are in Fremont, but a South Bay center opened in April at 1029 Bascom Ave. in San Jose
“When our kids are helping out, people are impressed with the kind of work they can do,” Yeh said, adding the organization plans to help out at the Carol of Lights event in December, Night to Shine at Home Church and the Bunnies and Bonnets Parade in downtown Campbell.
Volunteer work has also been done at Morley Park and more recently Jack Fischer Park. Three families from Friends of Children with Special Needs and eight clients and two instructors volunteered at the Morley Park service day.
Yeh said the organization also volunteers with Meals on Wheels, bringing seniors meals and accompanying them for a visit.
“They feel really proud when they've given back to the community,” Yeh said.
Myers said they felt the day of planting and working with Friends of Children with Special Needs was “mutually beneficial.”
“The students who have never had a close interaction with special needs kids were able to learn how to work with them and include them in activities,” Myers said. “We also were able to work with their families and learn how they support each other.”
Bob Carlson, Campbell Parks and Recreation Foundation said “It was great seeing everyone working together.”

The Stouffer family, of Maple Park, is trying to get a sneak preview of "The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies" to finish a family tradition of watching all the "Hobbit" and "Lord of the Rings" films together, before Scott Stouffer (far left) dies of cancer. Their daughter, Jessy, (right) launched a social media campaign dubbed #HobbitMovieLastRequest. (Family Photo)
CHICAGO (CBS) — A far west suburban woman has been trying to get a sneak peek at the final Hobbit movie, for a very good reason.
WBBM Newsradio's Nancy Harty reports, like many people, Jessy Stouffer and their family have a tradition of watching The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings movies around the holidays.
“My dad was really into the books, and the movies, for both Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, and once the movies came out, they wanted us to go and kind of all see them together,” they said.
The family from Maple Park has been looking forward to the final installment, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, but it doesn't come out until mid-December and the 21-year-old Northern Illinois University student said she's worried their father won't live to see it.
Them dad, 57-year-old Scott Stouffer, has cancer of the endocrine system, and stopped treatment months ago, because it wasn't working.
“We just want to have time where we can sit and finish the trilogy together as a family, and just kind of have that closure,” they said.
So Jessy launched a social media campaign, asking the movie studios to give them a copy in advance., They posted a video on YouTube, and asked people to help spread the word to the directors, creators of the movie by using the hashtag #HobbitMovieLastRequest.
Jessy said the family thought about going through traditional foundations, but wanted to surprise their dad, so opted for their own campaign, and she's been pleasantly surprised by the results.
“It's been amazing just how many people have used it, and have been trying to get it out there,” they said. “We couldn't ask for anything better; and we're very, very grateful. It's very gracious of all these people who are just trying to help – that we don't even know.”
While they haven't heard from the movie studios, they have heard the campaign has spread to a couple different countries.
MGM, the distributor for The Hobbit films, has not responded to requests for comment.

Cannabis has long been touted as containing chemicals that might work against cancer. A recent study suggested that two chemicals found in cannabis, the cannabinoids CBD and THC, could act on an aggressive brain tumour called glioma, where only 10% of people live for five years after diagnosis. The research found that THC and CBD, combined with radiotherapy were able to shrink, but not completely eradicate, gliomas that were artificially implanted in mice.
The results provide useful scientific information, and may indeed improve the treatment of brain cancer patients eventually, after clinical trials and all the other regulatory hurdles that must be cleared before a new treatment can be used in patients. But despite considerable public interest, the data isn't yet there to show that cannabinoids are an effective treatment option in cancer in humans.
Radiotherapy is currently, regrettably one of the best tools against brain cancer that oncologists currently have. As with many treatments, irradiating the brain often comes with debilitating long-term side effects and patients, scientists and oncologists will universally be hoping that future treatments come with a smaller burden. If the cannabinoids study is replicated in people with glioma, it may be that less radiation is needed to get the same therapeutic effect – a very welcome advance, but still a long way off being anywhere near certain.
Cancer, cannabis and talk of cures
THC, one of the cannabinoids used in the study, has in fact already been tested in glioma patients: eight years ago in a clinical trial on nine patients. This study achieved its main aim, which was to see if THC was tolerated in these patients without serious side effects, but all of the patients in the study ultimately died within the time expected if they had received no further treatment. Despite this, the study was cited under the heading “Cures Brain Cancer” on one of many websites listing medical studies that prove “cannabis cures cancer.”
Research is ongoing into cannabinoids around the world, but as Emma Smith, senior science information officer at Cancer Research UK, told me: “Cannabinoids can have a range of different effects on cancer cells grown in the lab and animal tumours, but at the moment there isn't good evidence from clinical trials to prove that they can safely and effectively treat cancer in patients.”
There are also many other promising – and potentially even more effective – avenues that scientists are exploring for glioma. For example, work published in October showed that treating glioma in mice with a “specific inhibitor” drug called alisertib, targeted against a protein called Aurora-A, prolonged the survival of mice with artificial brain tumours, similar to those in the cannabinoids study.
Alisertib is also already in human clinical trials for a number of different cancer types, so arguably this research is a lot closer to potentially helping patients with glioma, as it is likely to have fewer hurdles to jump over before approval than treatments that are yet to prove themselves in trials. It would be great to hear more about potential treatments at a more advanced stage like this, but it is unlikely to result in the thousands of shares and likes on Facebook that cannabis invites.
Cannabis isn't that special
So why are we not equally excited about the numerous other promising preliminary experiments of a similar nature? It is not simply a question of us not hearing about them – cannabis is perceived as special and causes a stir every time a fairly preliminary piece of research comes out. And equally, why are large cancer charities such as Cancer Research UK frequently attacked and forced to dedicate a lot of resources and expertise to debunking the myths surrounding cannabis and for “blocking” cannabis research – despite part-funding a Phase I clinical trial into a synthetic cannabinoid called dexanabinol?
This, too, must come with some caution. Ruth Plummer, professor of experimental cancer medicine at Newcastle University and clinical co-ordinator of the trial, said it was at an early stage with safe doses and potential side effects still being explored. “While some patients do seem to have benefited from treatment there is still a long way to go before these agents are established as standard treatments for patients.”
The plant-based theory
Supporters of cannabis as a cancer treatment claim that as the chemicals are plant-based, they are safer and less toxic than conventional chemotherapies. The very well established chemotherapy agents doxorubicin (originally from soil bacteria) and vincristine (originally from the Madagascan periwinkle plant) do both have side-effects, so this assumption is not supported by science. They have also been proved to work effectively only when purified and used in controlled doses – something that would need to be figured out from research if cannabinoids are to be a useful part of our arsenal against cancer.
A quick trawl of social media sites suggests that the most ardent of supporters of the “cannabis cures cancer” belief are often recreational users who believe that if cannabis does have utility in cancer treatment, it will provide strength to their pro-legalisation stance. This certainly hasn't happened so far with a range of strong painkillers and sedatives that are frequently used in medicine but considered illegal without medical prescription – morphine and temazepam are two examples. It's unlikely that this would be any different with any cannabis derivatives.
If cannabinoids do have a role to play in treating cancer, scientists and doctors will welcome the advances. Currently, however, none of the numerous studies into cannabis-chemicals have shown anything to justify the hype and almost evangelical belief that it is “the cure” generated by many supporters.
Chancellor expected to reduce £8bn from bill over two years and not to enforce living wage, but could enshrine tax-free minimum pay in law
George Osborne will use the first Conservative budget in 18 years to slash billions from in-work tax credits and housing benefit, although the chancellor is likely to slow the pace of an expected £12bn cuts to the welfare bill.
An initial cut of £8bn in welfare over two years was being predicted on Tuesday night, closer to the pace of welfare cuts agreed under the previous coalition government and intended to protect Osborne from criticism they are likely to face from Labour and charities.
The scheme would mean that the plan to cut £12bn by 2017-18 has been altered to give the work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith an extra year to implement the savings.
The budget will also set out plans first laid out in the Conservative election manifesto to raise the 40p tax threshold. The manifesto proposed that, from April 2016, the 40p rate should only kick in when earnings reach £42,700 and, from April 2017, when they reach £43,300. Officials added the rate would rise further to £45,020 in 2019.
The change is estimated to cost the exchequer £1.68bn by 2019-20. The tax break for the middle class will be defended on the basis that a failure in the past to raise the threshold has brought more people into the 40p rate.
The changes to welfare, the biggest test of Osborne's political judgement since their “omnishambles” budget in 2012, also leave in question the future design of universal credit, the government's major integration of in- and and out-of-work benefits. The cuts will probably put hundreds of thousands of families into poverty under the definitions the government abolished only last week.
It is expected Osborne will urge more employers to improve the skills of their workforce and to pay the living wage as a way of filling the hole left by the cut in work tax credits and in housing benefit. But they are not expected to impose any requirement on companies to pay the living wage, but instead point to the plan to enshrine a tax-free minimum wage in law and to raise the personal tax allowance to £12,500 by 2020.
Some Tory pressure groups are still hoping Osborne will commit to measures to incentivise companies to pay the living wage, currently set at £9.15 an hour in London and £7.85 an hour in the rest of the UK, as opposed to the national minimum wage of £6.50 an hour for over 21s.

Labour said the government was involved in a systematic attempt to discredit the welfare state constructed by Labour's Gordon Brown. The party said that if tax credits were cut back to 2003-04 levels, a saving of £5bn, then 3.7 million families in work will suffer an average income loss of £1,400 a year. The reform would also mean that 300,000 families would fall into relative poverty.
The shadow treasury minister, Shabana Mahmood, claimed the minimum wage, which is set to rise to £6.70 an hour in October for workers aged 21 and over, would need to rise overnight by 25% should the government make the predicted changes to tax credits.
“Without tax credits to help them through, those who are working and stuck on low pay simply cannot make ends meet,” they said.
The Resolution Foundation has calculated that if income was to match the current value of the living wage, an average rise of 80% would be necessary – since the living wage takes in to account the payment of tax credits
But Osborne will point to the dramatic events in the eurozone, and the crisis in Greece, to argue the government has no choice but to continue to put deficit reduction at the heart of the budget.
They will tell MPs: “Our long-term economic plan is working. But the greatest mistake this country could make would be to think all our problems are solved.
“You only have to look at the crisis unfolding in Greece as I speak to realise that if a country is not in control of its borrowing, the borrowing takes control of the country.”
They will argue that if welfare is not cut in this emergency budget, other departmental spending will have to be reduced even more in the autumn spending review.
During the election, Osborne reduced their room for manoeuvre by ruling out increases in income tax, VAT and corporation tax, and has set a long-term commitment to lift the personal tax allowance to £12,500 by the end of the parliament.
Osborne, with their own chances of taking the leadership reins from David Cameron at stake, will try to lift the sights of the country beyond deficit reduction and impress voters that the Conservatives have a coherent positive agenda.
 They are expected to promise to be “bold in transforming education, bold in reforming welfare, bold in delivering infrastructure, bold in building the ‘northern powerhouse', bold in backing the aspirations of working people … it is a budget that sets the way to secure Britain's future”.
Cameron has already tried to pave the way for the reforms promised to end the merry-go-round of tax credits and housing benefit saying they want to shift to a low tax, high wage and low welfare economy
The Treasury economic secretary, David Gauke, speaking in the Commons, prepared the ground for the welfare cuts by describing the current welfare state as “financially and morally unsustainable”. They claimed the cost of tax credits had risen from 2003 to 2010-11 by 180%.
**Revised forecast: Higher snowfall totals at 4-6″+ for Minneapolis/St. Paul**
All eyes on are the snow chances for Minneapolis/St. Paul on Tuesday, so we'll cover that momentarily.
“Keep in mind, though, that if this system sneaks east, we'll end up with significantly lower totals due to the sharp drop-off. If it shifts west, we'll see significantly higher tallies.”
First, here's your Minneapolis 7 day forecast (and St. Paul 7 day):
Note the colder temperatures post-snow as we head through the week. Not Arctic blast types of cold, but still cooler than our well-above-average weekend.
Now, back to the snow chances…
Here are the final tallies (as of now, Monday morning) I'm expecting. There is a huge range between computer models, and they are switching tracks with this storm quite frequently, but if you average out the past few model runs, this is roughly what you'd get:
Note that I put Minneapolis, and especially St. Paul, on the line between 2-4″+ and 5-6″+ of snow. That's actually about right, because some suburbs to the NW will see closer to 1-2″ of snow, while some SE suburbs could end up with 6″ or so of snow. Keep in mind, though, that if this system sneaks east, we'll end up with significantly lower totals due to the sharp drop-off. If it shifts west, we'll see significantly higher tallies.
Timing?
We'll see some flakes by early Tuesday morning:
Then we see snow pick up as we head through the morning and midday section of Tuesday throughout much of Minnesota:
Snow continues in Minneapolis/St. Paul through the afternoon, and the forecast shows snow gradually winding down into evening.
Finally, you can see the edge on the West in the image above, and by Wednesday we're looking to clear up quickly. In the image below, you can see snow essentially gone by early Wednesday morning:
So there you go. 2-4″ of snow isn't too much, but definitely enough to snarl things up. Stay tuned!
Witnesses in downtown Grozny have captured a dramatic standoff between police and gunmen who earlier attacked an officer and stole their car. Footage captures non-stop Kalashnikov rounds in the street not far from the Chechen capital's high-rises.
The head of Russia's Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, said that four gunmen were killed in the Saturday night operation, with two taken to hospital.
The attack started with the gunmen assaulting a police officer and stealing their car, after which they fruitlessly sought another police officer in their home.
The police sealed off the area for traffic, but several passers-by happened to be near the scene and filmed footage of the shootout. It shows the officers, who were reportedly fired at when attempting to pull over the suspects' vehicle, not sparing any bullets while raining fire on the gunmen.
Luckily, no civilians were hurt in the incident, for which Kadyrov praised the prompt police response. They said only one traffic police officer, who was run over by the gunmen's car during the chase, was injured.

YEREVAN (Sputnik) — The Collective Rapid Reaction Force (CRRF), a joint combined arms task force comprising independent military units from the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), will conduct the Interaction-2017 military drills in Armenia on October 9-13, the Armenian Defense Ministry said Tuesday.
"The CSTO's 'Interaction-2017' exercises will be held in Armenia on October 9-13 within the framework of the joint operational-strategic exercise 'Combat Brotherhood-2017,'" the press service of the Armenian Defense Ministry said.
The statement added that staff talks for the necessary preparatory work will be held in Yerevan from June 27-30 with participation of representatives of CSTO Secretariat and the Joint Staff of the CSTO, interested ministries and departments of CSTO member states.
The CSTO was established in October 2002 as a regional intergovernmental alliance by Russia, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Belarus. The CSTO Charter stipulates the pledge of all member-states to abstain from the use of force and join other military alliances. Aggression against one signatory state equals aggression against all.
Kurupira is a figure in Guaraní mythology.  They are one of the seven monstrous children of Tau and Kerana, and as such is one of the central legendary figures in the region of Guaraní speaking cultures.[1]  They are also one of the few figures still prominent in the modern culture of the region.
Myths [ edit ]
Kurupi is said to be somewhat similar in appearance to another, more popular figure from Guaraní mythology, the Pombero. Like the Pombero, Kurupi is said to be short, ugly, and hairy. They make their home in the wild forests of the region, and was considered to be the lord of the forests and protector of wild animals. Kurupi's most distinctive feature, however, was an humongous penis that was ordinarily wound several times around their waist like a belt. Due to this feature, they were at one time revered by the Guaraní as the spirit of fertility.[2]
Much like the Pombero, Kurupi is often blamed for unexpected or unwanted pregnancies. Their penis is said to be prehensile, and owing to its length they are supposed to be able to extend it through doors, windows, or other openings in a home and impregnate a sleeping woman without even having to enter the house. Together with the Pombero, Kurupi was a scapegoat used by adulterous women to avoid the wrath of their husbands, or by single women to explain their pregnancies. Children fathered by the Kurupi were expected to be small, ugly and hairy much like their father, and if male to inherit something of their father's virility. In some cases, Kurupi is blamed with the disappearance of young women, supposedly stealing them away to their home in the forest for use in satiating their libidinous desires (rape).
The legend of Kurupi has faded somewhat in comparison to the Pombero, and figures more often as part of old tales. Rarely is they blamed with impregnating women anymore, although they are sometimes used to try and frighten young girls into being chaste.

VAUGHAN — Shots rang out in a restaurant north of Toronto on Wednesday, leaving two people dead and two others seriously hurt.
Gunshots occurred about 8:18 a.m. in the Moka café and emergency crews found "quite a scene," said York Regional Police Const. Andy Pattenden.
"The information that we have is that a man arrived here and began shooting," they said.
Maria Voci, 47, and Christopher Desimone, 24, were found dead inside the café, located in a strip mall in a busy area of Vaughan. It's not yet known if Voci and Desimone were employees or customers.
The surviving two victims were rushed to hospital, one man with life-threatening injuries. The second man is in stable condition, police said.
Investigators have not said if there were any other customers or employees in the café who were not injured.
Police are looking for a suspect they described as a male with darker skin fleeing the scene on Islington Avenue south of Highway 7 in a dark-coloured compact car, heading southbound on Islington Avenue.
There was a heavy police presence in the area throughout the day Wednesday as officers canvassed for witnesses and looked for video surveillance of the incident.
It was busy at the time of the shooting and investigators have spoken with several people who were at the scene when the incident occurred, Pattenden said.
Police are asking for anyone in the area around the time of the shooting to contact homicide investigators.
Andrew Adamatzky, a researcher at the University of West England, has been watching slime molds since 2006, finding inspirations in their growth for designing computer software. They have made electronic music using molds, and a favorite hobby is challenging them to build highway systems. In 2010 they and their colleagues placed a slime mold in the middle of a map of Spain and Portugal, with pieces of food on the largest cities. The slime mold grew a network of tentacles that was nearly identical to the actual highway system on the Iberian Peninsula.
“If some countries started to build highways from scratch, I would recommend to them to follow the slime mold routes,” Dr. Adamatzky said.
Despite their name, slime molds are not related to bread mold or the black mold that grows in damp houses. They belong to a separate lineage that evolved from ordinary soil amoebas.
By analyzing the DNA of different slime mold species, researchers are reconstructing their evolutionary history, which turns out to reach back about a billion years. Since all known slime molds live on land, that suggests that they were early pioneers, arriving hundreds of millions of years before animals or plants.
“They may be as old as the terrestrial ecosystem,” said Sandra Baldauf, an evolutionary biologist at Uppsala University in Sweden.
Slime molds first came to scientific fame in the mid-20th century with the work of the Princeton biologist John Tyler Bonner. Dr. Bonner learned of a North American species of slug-forming slime mold called Dictyostelium discoides and began to raise them in their lab, studying them as a simple analog of animal embryos.
Today, biologists no longer think of Dictyostelium as an embryo: It is more like a society of amoebas that come together for a common cause, for which some will sacrifice themselves.

The organisms respond to starvation by rushing together by the thousands into a single blob. The blob stretches out into a slug-shaped mass about one millimeter long (one twenty-fifth of an inch), which then crawls like a worm toward light.

Once it reaches the surface of the soil, the slug undergoes another transformation: Some of the cells turn into a stiff stalk, while the others crawl to the top and form a sticky ball of spores. They stick to the foot of an animal and travel to a hospitable place.
Inside the slug, about 1 percent of the amoebas turn into police. They crawl through the slug in search of infectious bacteria. When the amoebas find a pathogen, they devour it. These sentinels then drop away from the slug, taking the pathogen with it. They then die of the infection, while the slug remains healthy.
When the slug is ready to make a stalk, more amoebas must die so that others can live. They climb on top of one another and transform their insides into bundles of cellulose. Twenty percent of Dictyostelium cells die this way, allowing the survivors to climb up their lifeless bodies and become spores.
David Queller and Joan Strassmann, a husband-and-wife team of Dictyostelium experts at Washington University in St. Louis, have found that some strains of the slime mold are natural-born cheats. If they are mixed with other strains, they are more likely to end up as spores than as dead stalk cells. “Clearly this is not just a weird thing,” Dr. Queller said. “Those mutations happen all the time.”
Research by Dr. Queller and Dr. Strassmann has revealed some reasons the slime-mold world has not been overwhelmed by these cheats. For one thing, most of the amoebas that form a slug are closely related to one another.
“They're helping relatives,” Dr. Strassmann said. Even if the slime molds die to form a stalk, many of their genes are passed on to the next generation through their kin.
To help relatives, Dictyostelium needs a way to recognize them. Researchers at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston recently figured out part of the way the slime molds tell kin from strangers. The amoebas make a pair of proteins on the surface of their cells, which fit snugly together — like “patches of Velcro,” as one researcher, Gad Shaulsky, put it.

Dr. Shaulsky and their colleagues reported in July that if these proteins cannot link to each other, amoebas cannot fuse. “They completely ignore each other,” said Adam Kuspa, another Baylor biologist.

Dictyostelium belongs to one of the two great branches of slime molds. Its branch is known as the cellular slime molds, because its spore and stalk are made out of many cells.
By contrast, the so-called acellular slime molds do not form slugs. Instead, two cells merge, combining their DNA into a new single-celled organism that just keeps growing — extending tentacles that can extend as far as several yards. It pulsates to pump food from its extremities to its core, and it can even crawl to search for food.
“You see one on a log, and then you come back a few hours later and it's gone,” said Steven L. Stephenson, a slime mold expert at the University of Arkansas.
Eventually, acellular slime molds also make spores. They produce tens of thousands of stalks, and the spores that cap them blow away in the wind.
Dr. Adamatzky, the researcher who watched acellular molds form highwaylike patterns, has also used them to simulate a nuclear disaster. They and their colleagues grew a slime mold network of highways for Canada, then placed a crystal of sea salt — which repels slime molds — on the map where the Bruce nuclear power plant is located, on Lake Huron in Ontario.
The slime mold abandoned its tendrils near the salt and then grew a new highway pattern that efficiently rerouted food across Canada. “Reactions to spreading contamination may shed some light what would happen if real disasters occur,” Dr. Adamatzky said.

Building networks sometimes requires tough decisions from slime molds. At the University of Sydney in Australia, Madeleine Beekman and their colleagues recently documented the decision-making of slime molds by presenting Physarum with two different kinds of food: either rich in protein, or rich in carbohydrates. The slime molds grew tendrils to both foods, but adjusted their sizes to get the best balance of protein and carbohydrates that allowed them to grow fastest.
In another experiment, Dr. Beekman and their colleagues made the choice harder by putting food under bright lights, which Physarum tries to avoid. In the first trial, the scientists offered the slime mold food chunks that contained 3 percent oat flakes in the dark, and 5 percent oat flakes in bright light.

The mold was just as likely to ooze toward either kind of food. But when the scientists added a 1 percent chunk to the dark area, that was enough to tip the balance: Even though there was still not as much oat in the dark, 80 percent of the mold now oozed in that direction.
This might seem an irrational switch, but it is one that humans make as well. Psychologists have found that the value we put on things depends greatly on the other things we can choose from. Humans and slime molds alike choose according to relative values, rather than trying to calculate absolute ones.
Scientists know a lot about the two lab-friendly species Physarum and Dictyostelium, but they still know very little about the many other slime molds on earth. In 2003, Dr. Stephenson and other slime mold experts embarked on a worldwide expedition to get a better understanding of the global diversity of these creatures.
The Global Eumycetozoan Project, based at the University of Arkansas, has doubled the known species of slime molds. Biologists have found slime molds in Antarctica, in barren deserts, high in the canopies of jungles and even on the leaves of household plants.
“Every place people have looked for them, they're there,” Dr. Stephenson said.
Slime molds are also present in huge numbers: There may be thousands of individual slime molds in a pinch of soil. Their collective hunger makes them a powerful ecological player. When plants and animals die, microbes break them down; slime molds then devour many of the bacteria, releasing their nutrients for other organisms to grow on.
“If you removed those slime molds, the whole earth's ecosystems would be very different,” Dr. Stephenson said.
As scientists sequence the DNA of new species, they can finally start to figure out how slime molds evolved; genetic studies have confirmed, for example, that the two main groups of slime molds are each other's closest relatives.
Other studies have shown that the slime mold lineage is immensely old. In a paper to be published in the journal Genome Research, British and German scientists estimate that the cellular slime molds evolved 600 million years ago. Preliminary studies suggest that the common ancestor of all living slime molds is much older than that.

If slime molds arrived on land close to a billion years ago, they may well have colonized continents that were home only to films of bacteria. “They might be tightly linked to the development of soil on land,” said Dr. Baldauf, the Swedish biologist, who is analyzing the DNA of species discovered in the Eumycetozoan Project.
The traits that slime molds share in common, like making spores, may have first evolved as they came ashore. The ancestors of Dictyostelium may have evolved the ability to form slugs and stalks to get those spores out of the ground, so that they'd have a better chance to spread. The giant acellular slime molds chose a different strategy, spreading their bodies across huge areas, and making spores across their entire surface.
Finding new species of slime molds will let scientists test these possibilities, Dr. Baldauf said. While they are impressed with all the species Dr. Stephenson and their colleagues have found, they are sure there are many more waiting to be discovered.
“I think it's the tip of the iceberg,” they said. “They go to some incredible place like a mountain in Patagonia, and they take a tiny soil sample and bring it back. But who knows what's a foot away?”
Kawasaki WorldSBK quicker than most MotoGP riders at Jerez Test
Kawasaki's Jonathan Rea punted their ZX-10RR WorldSBK machine around Jerez this week in times fast enough to embarrass almost all of the MotoGP riders that were also present for the Spanish test.
Rea's 1m37.986 was actually the quickest time set on the final day of the test by any rider present as by Friday the previous pacesetters, Team Ducati's Andrea Dovizioso and Jorge Lorenzo, along with LCR Honda rider Cal Crutchlow, had already finished their testing schedule.
Dovizioso had been the fastest of the MotoGP riders on the earlier days of the test (Link), with a 1m37.663 ahead of Crutchlow's 1m37.818, and Lorenzo's 1m37.921.
Rea's 1m37.986 was however faster than 15 other MotoGP riders that participated in the test sessions this week.
The pace of Rea and Sykes was all the more impressive as they were using the 14,100rpm maximum rev limit imposed on the Ninja ZX-10RR by the 2018 WorldSBK technical regulations.
Jonathan Rea
“This test is really important for us and it is always held at a good time of year. The weather has been consistent so we have been really lucky. There is a lot of rubber down on the track so we were able to evaluate all the components we had to test and we ticked everything in the box. We had to confirm chassis components and a swingarm, and we worked a lot with Showa suspension on Wednesday. When we had everything boxed off we were able to test some new tyres from Pirelli. We also used this test to try out a qualifying tyre and to see our true potential over one lap. I was surprised to be so fast and go into the 1'37s. Good results do not just happen; it has been a lot of hard work. I am very proud of the team as they understood the regulation changes. We were able to hit the ground running when we came here on Monday.”
Sykes' 1m38.326 was also extremely impressive and indeed faster than more than half of the 18 MotoGP riders that tested this week.
Tom Sykes
“I am really happy with the way the tests have gone. That put a bit of a smile on my face and a spring in my step for the winter. I could honestly not have asked for any more. A big thanks to all the boys, they prepared two top-level bikes which made the testing much more efficient and I have to say I am very pleasantly surprised with my performance on race tyres. We tried a Q tyre, but it was in a bike with a slightly different set-up and chassis package. Since using that Q tyre we have improved the bike again and am very happy about this. It is a good way to go into the winter.”
The best times for the KRT duo were set on qualifying rubber. On a race tyre set-up Rea did a 1'38.8, on a harder rear tyre option on Friday morning, with Sykes setting a race tyre best of 1'39.3 earlier in the week. Rea's time of 1m38.8 on race tyres was also faster than many of the MotoGP riders managed all week. It should be noted that there are no qualifying tyres used in MotoGP.
Pere Riba – Crew Chief for Jonathan Rea
“It was interesting to test different parts, matching in with next year's technical rules. We concentrated to test engine character for next year and some parts in the engine. We understand that we will miss some power in the top because of the rev limitation. This means that somewhere you have to lose, and then compensate in some other areas. So if you want to make up some time you have to improve the braking areas, or corner speed, or in some other areas. We did not set-up the bike with clicks, geometry or whatever. All three days we kept the same chassis settings, but we just tested different items on the bike. From the January tests onwards we will start to test with the tools we have to make the final set-up of the bike. So far the race pace was very good and on a qualifying tyre we were crazy fast. So all very positive.”
The existing Jerez WorldSBK lap record, which was set recently in a race, stands at 1'40.640. The pole record, set on qualifying tyres, is currently 1'38.960. Thus Rea, Sykes and the ZX-10RR were obviously in scintillating form to go a second quicker than previously set on qualifiers, and almost two-seconds quicker than what had previously been achieved on race tyres at the Spanish venue.
While this was an awesome display of pace from the WorldSBK spec' ZX-10RR and its talented riders, it is also must be seen as somewhat of an embarassment to Michelin. The French tyre manufacturer have broken many lap records this season, their second back in MotoGP, but that WorldSBK riders on their Pirelli rubber were seen to be going quicker than Michelin shod MotoGP bikes is certainly not a good look. Over full race distance on tyres that would last 20 laps perhaps it would be a very different story, esepcially as the Superbikes are around 10kg heavier than the MotoGP machines.
Certainly the peculiarities of the Jerez Circuit also played their part in the final equation, with top speeds at the Spanish venue only around 290km/h, the MotoGP bikes do not really get to stretch their legs, but still…
Rea rode for three days in all; Monday, Wednesday and Friday. They went back to the UK to collect their Member of the British Empire award (MBE) on Tuesday. They suffered a very fast fall on Wednesday but went out on track soon after on their spare bike to go just as fast as they had before.
Sykes rode for four days out of five and found improvements in overall race pace all the way to the end of the final test before the off-season begins.
While most of the MotoGP field were present during the week of testing, notable absentees include the Repsol HRC squad and Yamaha's MotoGP riders. Honda BSB riders Dan Linfoot and Jason O'Halloran were present which brought the number of riders testing up to a total of 28.

Google Autocomplete is always an entertaining and fun way to measure the pulse of the masses. Are smartwatches in? What do people think about Kanye West? What is the worst state to live in? All of these questions are ably answered in real-time by the all-knowing search giant that is Google.
Just recently, an enterprising new website decided to take all of the amazing Google Autocomplete queries we've come to know and love and transform it into a rousing and surprisingly engaging game of Family Feud, or in this case Google Feud.
DON'T MISS: My dream of having Google take over my iPhone is almost a reality
Much like the famed game show, Google Feud presents users with the first three-quarters of a sentence whereupon users must type in what they think is one of the top 10 concluding words or phrases to that same sentence. The actual composition of the 10 answers is dynamic as they're harvested in real-time via Google APIs.
Having played a few rounds, I have to say that Google Feud is surprisingly fun and deceptively addictive. Aside from its easy-to-use interface and simplistic design, some of the answers will genuinely leave you with a raised eyebrow or two. For instance, one of the rounds I played featured the clue, “I was bitten by a _____”.
I promptly guessed “snake.”
Wrong.
I guessed again, this time going with “Spiders.”
Wrong again.
As it turns out, the top answer is “black widow.” And oddly enough, “I was bitten by a snake in my dream” checked in at the number 10 spot.
If you're even debating buying new Volvo headlights (and yes they are very expensive) then you have nothing to lose, really, by doing it yourself.
There's the "toothpaste" option which kind of works, and it's very very cheap. It works because toothpaste has a mild abrasive in it. It doesn't work all that well because you need more than that, and you also need to seal the plastic after you're done.
Best bet is either to buy a headlight restoration kit or make one yourself. If you already have the "parts" you need you don't really need to buy a kit.
Be sure to mask off all the surrounding body of the car with masking tape so you don't accidentally sand the painted part of the car. This is important. If the tape degrades as you sand, you may need to remask it before spraying a clear coat on the finished headlights.
If you have a drill-mounted buffing pad (or another buffer), you can use that for the finishing steps.
But start with sandpaper, working from pretty aggressive grit like 400 or 600 gradually down to 2000/3000 grit to smooth it out. You're going to sand by using lots of water sprayed repeatedly on the headlights, so use wet sanding sandpaper. This is usually done by hand to get into the corners and so on. A bit laborious.
Initially, the rougher sandpaper will make it look like you're doing even more damage. But as you gradually work your way to less abrasive grits, the plastic will get smoother. Don't despair. It just takes a while, lots of water sprayed on the headlights, and lots of energy as you move from the more aggressive grits to less aggressive, will do the job.
Toward the end, you can use rubbing compound (not sure what "grit" it qualifies as) and then (milder) polishing compound or even plastic polish which has a very mild grit to it. This s where you can use your electric drill and a buffing wheel to make it a lot easier. Or by hand. Both work.
After a few hours of this, your plastic headlights should be much clearer. They will stay like that for a few months as the plastic gradually yellows again -- unless you seal the plastic with a clear coat sealer spray. Check to make sure it's compatible with plastic. Seal it with a few coats and the clarity should last for a long time.
If you already have the sandpaper and many of the other products, anyway, you don't really need a headlight restoration kit which has the same things, often including a small buffing wheel for your drill.

Embed Trump Praises Saddam Hussein for How Well They Killed Terrorists 1:13 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog
RALEIGH, N.C. — Donald Trump praised former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein Tuesday night, allowing that they were a "really bad guy" but had redeeming qualities when it came to their handling of terrorists.
Trump lauded the former U.S. adversary for how "well" they killed terrorists, recalling that they "didn't read them the rights, they didn't talk. They were terrorists, over." Now, Trump assessed, "Iraq is Harvard for terrorism. You want to be a terrorist, you go to Iraq."
Hillary Clinton's campaign seized the opportunity to once more paint Trump has unfit for office. "Donald Trump's praise for brutal strongmen seemingly knows no bounds," Senior Policy Advisor Jake Sullivan said in an emailed statement. "Trump's cavalier compliments for brutal dictators, and the twisted lessons they seem to have learned from their history, again demonstrate how dangerous they would be as commander-in-chief and how unworthy they are of the office they seek."

This isn't the first time Trump has cast the brutal dictator in a positive light — or called Iraq an Ivy League locale for aspiring terrorists. Throughout the primaries Trump glossed over Hussein's violent history in favor of what they viewed as a more stable Middle East ruled by Saddam's viciousness.

Embed Trump in Praise of Dictators 1:39 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog
In an October exclusive with NBC's Chuck Todd, Trump asserted that the Middle East would be better off today if Moammar Gadhafi of Libya and Saddam Hussein were still in power. "It's not even a contest," Trump told Meet the Press. Trump continued to push this idea at a rally in Franklin, Tennessee, telling the crowd that despite Hussein's "vicious" rule in Iraq "there were no terrorists in Iraq" while they ruled.
"You know what they used to do to terrorists?" Trump polled the Tennessee crowd. "A one day trial and shoot him…and the one day trial usually lasted five minutes, right? There was no terrorism then."
Trump didn't just praise Hussein for keeping terrorists at bay, but seemed to tacitly accept the dictator's use of chemical weapons. During a December rally in Hilton Head, South Carolina, Trump took a cavalier attitude toward Iraq's use of chemical weapons under Saddam.
"Saddam Hussein throws a little gas, everyone goes crazy, 'oh he's using gas!'" Trump said. Describing the way stability was maintained in the region during that time, Trump said "they go back, forth, it's the same. And they were stabilized."
Been a while since #SaddamHussein was trending on Twitter..or maybe never before? At least it's historic — Andrea Mitchell (@mitchellreports) July 6, 2016
Trump lamented how the United States intervened in the region during a speech in South Carolina late last year. "if you go after one or the other, in this case Iraq, you're going to destabilize the Middle East. That's what's going to happen," they said.
On Tuesday night, at rally focusing heavily on Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama, Trump revived the old riffs from their primary playbook. "We shouldn't have destabilized Saddam Hussein, right? They were a bad guy, really bad guy, but you know what they did well? They killed terrorists. They did that so good."
Trump's statements were noteworthy for the company they made them in. At Trump's side Tuesday: Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, who was on the trail with Trump for the day. Corker is being vetted for vice president and their trail time in North Carolina was considered by many to be an audition.
To hear the media tell it, Donald Trump was finished last week.
For calling a first-generation judge of Mexican heritage a “Mexican,” they had injected racism into the campaign. For firing their strong-arm campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, they admitted their insurgency was adrift. For not raising as much cash as a woman who's effectively been running for president since 1992, they were a hopeless, incompetent amateur. And, oh yes — they were down in the polls.
In sum, for not playing by the rules laid down by consultants and political journalists, Trump was derailed, wrecked, finished.
And then things changed.
Having consistently proven the masters of conventional wisdom wrong — not only naysaying Democrats but also preening “NeverTrumpers” — The Donald once again confounded their critics with a disciplined speech on Wednesday, laying out the air-tight case against Hillary Clinton by hitting them right where they mistakenly think she's strongest: their foreign-policy record as secretary of state..He pounded their deadly miscalculation in Libya, which resulted in four dead Americans at Benghazi, their role in the rise of ISIS and their cozy financial relationships and personal enrichment via the Clinton Foundation with sworn enemies of America. It was a boffo new beginning.
And then, as if to make Trump's point that we need a radical break from DC-as-usual, along came Brexit, Britain's poll-defying plebiscite to leave the European Union and regain its national independence.
So here's what Trump must do now to capitalize on their newfound mojo and win in November:
First, keep pummeling Hillary. The only presidential candidate in history to run while under federal investigation, Clinton has benefited from chummy relationships with media pooh-bahs who have successfully shielded them for decades. But the former first lady has a thin skin and a glass jaw; she's never faced sustained, fearless criticism before and doesn't handle it well.
Them brazen defiance of federal regulations, State Department protocols, national-security concerns and espionage and bribery laws make them the tomato can of candidates. Heck, the guy who set up their private e-mail server just took the Fifth 125 times in a deposition. Think he's got something to hide?
Second, learn a lesson from John McCain and Mitt Romney. The Maverick was a media darling until they had the effrontery to run against The One in 2008, while Romney was transformed from a successful Mormon business person into a rapacious ogre. Overwhelmingly Democratic and partisan, the media votes with its pens and cameras every day during campaign season.
Much of Trump's early appeal derived from their combative relationship with reporters, whom they not only doesn't fear but treats with overt contempt. They should keep doing it. As Churchill said about the Germans, “The Hun is always either at your throat or at your feet.” So's the media. Like Hillary (who largely shuns the press), Trump should control their availability, answer the questions they like, turn around the questions they don't, and leave.
Third, skip the “gotcha” game. During one of the GOP debates, Trump filibustered a response to radio host Hugh Hewitt's question about the three legs of the “nuclear triad” because they didn't know what that phrase meant (subs, bombers, missiles). But that's the sort of thing instantly explained and learned. After all, he's a first-time candidate navigating an ocean of wonks who think they alone should decide the qualifications necessary to become president.
A presidential campaign is not a quiz show, so the next time Trump's confronted with unfamiliar Beltway jargon they should just ask for clarification, answer the question forthrightly and move on.
Fourth, make it clear to the junior wing of the Permanent Bipartisan Fusion Party who's boss now. Despite its success in the congressional elections of 2010 and '14, the GOP has been whining it can't shape policy without holding the White House, too. Here's their big chance.
The center-right public is outraged at the Republicans' largely ineffective opposition to Democrat progressivism and executive overreach. Let's hope last week's Supreme Court decision blocking Obama's amnesty for illegals — and the Democrats' childish sit-in in the House — will stiffen GOP “leadership” spines. But if not, Trump should do it by actually leading.
Finally, be yourself — but better. Trump walks, talks and acts like the quintessential guy from Queens, from their un-pukka accent to their stream-of-consciousness barroom bluster. He's that anomaly, a rich man with a peasant's taste for shiny material things.
Now it's time for Trump 2.0: the focused, disciplined candidate we saw last week. This means focusing on Hillary's weaknesses without fear, bringing speaker Paul Ryan and majority leader Mitch McConnell to heel and staying on message to Make America Great Again.
Hey, if the Brits can say adieu to the European Union and defy their entire political establishment, can Americans do any less? Across the world, there's a hunger for national greatness again — and if Beltway insiders don't hear that message now, they surely will in November.

Everton fan Tony Bellew won the world title at the club's Goodison Park stadium
Liverpool's Tony Bellew won the vacant WBC cruiserweight title with a sensational third-round knockout of Ilunga Makabu at Goodison Park.
Bellew, challenging for a world title for a third time, was floored by a left hand in the opening round.
However, Bellew rocked Makabu with a left hook and right uppercut before rendering them unconscious with a barrage of blows.
They become the 13th current British world champion.
"He broke my nose with that left hand," Bellew told BBC Radio 5 live on Monday.
"I'm talking through my nose now and it's smashed to bits, but I have a green and gold belt. If you had to take my nose off my face for that belt I'd take it."
In winning the belt, Bellew made fantasy real life, having fought for a world title at the home of their beloved Everton FC in the latest Rocky film.
An estimated 15,000 fans gathered for the first ever boxing show at Goodison and the atmosphere was fevered by the time Bellew walked to the ring, to the strains of the Z-Cars theme tune, the traditional Everton anthem.
Bellew had the best of the opening exchanges but found themselves on the canvas at the end of the first round, Makabu having soaked up a flurry of blows before springing from the ropes and landing with a peach of a left hand.
The home fighter, 33, probably nicked an uneventful second before the fight was blown open in the third.
The Congolese southpaw had won 19 of their 20 previous pro fights, 18 of them by knockout, and clearly believed they would prevail in a war.
But having thrown caution to the wind and abandoned their defences, Bellew softened Makabu up with a succession of juddering right hands.
And when Makabu was rocked by a left-right combination and retreated to the ropes, Bellew hunted them down and finished the job with a lethal left hook.
There was genuine concern as Makabu lay unconscious on the canvas but they were revived after about a minute and lifted onto their stool.
Britain's boxing champions Heavyweight Tyson Fury (WBA, WBO), Anthony Joshua (IBF) Cruiserweight Tony Bellew (WBC) Super middleweight James DeGale (IBF) Middleweight Billy Joe Saunders (WBO) Super welterweight Liam Smith (WBO) Welterweight Kell Brook (IBF) Super lightweight Ricky Burns (WBA) Lightweight Anthony Crolla (WBA), Terry Flanagan (WBO) Featherweight Lee Selby (IBF) Bantamweight Jamie McDonnell (WBA), Lee Haskins (IBF)
Bellew, who now has 27 wins (17 KOs) and two defeats from 30 pro fights, had lost their two previous world title challenges at light-heavyweight.
Afterwards, Bellew called out Russia's WBA and IBF champion Denis Lebedev and former cruiserweight world champion David Haye. Haye, however, now campaigns at heavyweight and is highly unlikely to drop back down.
Bellew now has 17 knockout wins to their name
'Nothing was going to stop me'
Bellew told Sky Sports: "I told you I am Everton. That's why I got up [after being knocked down in the first round]. Nothing was going to stop me tonight. I achieved the dream tonight, I am world champion, that's what I am.
"The last time I saw that [at Goodison Park] was in a Hollywood film. Michael Buffer was here tonight!
"It was a disaster of a training camp. Four weeks ago I had a detached rib, I had a messed up left hand.
"Two weeks ago I was in a hyperbaric chamber. But who cares?!"
Bellew said they now want fight David Haye or Denis Lebedev at Goodison Park
On the undercard, European super-middleweight champion Callum Smith made it 20 wins from 20 pro fights with a sixth-round stoppage of game Argentine Cesar Reynoso.
Liverpool's Smith, who had Reynoso down three times, is the mandatory challenger for the WBC title. However, the 26-year-old might have to wait for a proposed world title unification match between James DeGale and Badou Jack before they get their shot.
Sweden's Jack is the current WBC champion while Smith's compatriot DeGale owns the IBF belt.
Two more of the fighting Smith brothers were also in action. Former two-time super-middleweight world title challenger Paul beat Poland's Bartlomiej Grafka on points, while Stephen, who lost a challenge for the IBF super-featherweight title only last month, stopped Argentina's Daniel Brizuela in round seven.
Liverpool heavyweight David Price continued to rebuild their career with a second-round knockout of Vaclav Pejsar.
Former Olympic bronze medallist Price was knocked out twice by American Tony Thompson in 2013 and also by Germany's Erkan Teper last year. However, both Thompson and Teper subsequently failed drug tests.
Uefa has confirmed which teams are in each of the four leagues for the inaugural Nations League, European football's new international competition intended to replace most friendlies.
Based on the coefficient rankings after the group stages of the European qualifiers for Russia 2018, England, ranked sixth, are in League A, while Wales (14th), the Republic of Ireland (19th) and Northern Ireland (21st) are in League B, and Scotland (27th) are in League C. All 55 Uefa nations are assigned to a league, with 12 teams in A and B, 15 in C and 16 in D.

At a draw in Lausanne on 24 January, each league will then be divided into four groups of either three or four nations and they will play each other home and away from September to November next year. A promotion and relegation system will operate between the leagues – four up, four down – and the second edition of the competition is scheduled to start in September 2020.
The winners will be decided at a tournament between the nations that finish top of the four League A group in June 2019, with semi-finals, a third-place match and a final to be held in one of the finalist countries.
Uefa has introduced the competition to revive international football with more competitive matches and to give countries more chances to play against teams of a comparable standard. But many fans, players and pundits have expressed some confusion over the idea, particularly as it will run alongside qualifying for the 2020 European Championship.
That process will now begin in March 2019, with countries split into 10 groups of five or six, and the top two teams in each group qualifying for the finals. The major change, however, is that the final four places will be decided via play-offs between the winners of the 16 Nations League groups in 2018.
Each league – A to D – will have its own play-off competition with single-leg semi-finals and a final to decide who wins the place. The draw for those play-offs will take place in November 2019 and the play-offs themselves will occur in March 2020.

History Edit
Shaving methods Edit
Shaving can be done with a straight razor or safety razor (called 'manual shaving' or 'wet shaving') or an electric razor (called 'dry shaving') or beard trimmer. The removal of a full beard often requires the use of scissors or an electric (or beard) trimmer to reduce the mass of hair, simplifying the process. Wet shaving Edit There are two types of manual razors: straight razor and safety razors. Safety razors are further subdivided into double-edged razors, single edge, injector razors, cartridge razors and disposable razors. A Gillette 'Old Type' safety razor, the first razor to use double-edge razor blades. Double-edge razors are named so because the blade that they use has two sharp edges on opposite sides of the blade. Current multi-bladed cartridge manufacturers attempt to differentiate themselves by having more or fewer blades than their competitors, each arguing that their product gives a greater shave quality at a more affordable price. Before wet shaving, the area to be shaved is usually doused in warm to hot water by showering or bathing[24] or covered for several minutes with a hot wet towel to soften the skin and hair. A lathering or lubricating agent such as cream, shaving soap, gel, foam or oil is normally applied after this. Lubricating and moisturizing the skin to be shaved helps prevent a painful razor burn. Many razor cartridges include a lubricating strip, made of polyethylene glycol, to function instead of or in supplement to extrinsic agents.[25] It also lifts and softens the hairs, causing them to swell. This enhances the cutting action and sometimes permits cutting the hairs slightly below the surface of the skin. Additionally, during shaving, the lather indicates areas that have not been addressed. When soap is used, it is generally applied with a shaving brush, which has long, soft bristles. It is worked up into a usable lather by the brush, either against the face, in a shaving mug, bowl, scuttle, or palm of the hand. Since cuts are more likely when using safety razors and straight razors, wet shaving is generally done in more than one pass with the blade. The goal is to reduce the amount of hair with each pass, instead of trying to eliminate all of it in a single pass. This also reduces the risks of cuts, soreness, and ingrown hairs. Alum blocks and styptic pencils are used to close cuts resulting from the shave. Aftershave Edit Main article: Aftershave Men may use an aftershave lotion or balm after they have finished shaving. It may contain an antiseptic agent such as isopropyl alcohol, both to prevent infection from cuts and to act as an astringent to reduce skin irritation, a perfume, and a moisturizer to soften the facial skin. Electric shaving Edit A rotary design electric razor. Oscillating blades of a foil-type shaver The electric razor (electric shaver) consists of a set of oscillating or rotating blades, which are held behind a perforated metal screen which prevents them from coming into contact with the skin and behaves much like the second blade in a pair of scissors. When the razor is held against the skin, the whiskers poke through the holes in the screen and are sliced by the moving blades. In some designs the blades are a rotating cylinder. In others they are one or more rotating disks or a set of oscillating blades. Each design has an optimum motion over the skin for the best shave and manufacturers provide guidance on this. Generally, circular or cylindrical blades (rotary-type shaver) move in a circular motion and oscillating blades (foil-type shaver) move left and right. Hitachi has produced foil-type shavers with a rotary blade that operates similarly to the blade assembly of a reel-type lawn mower. The first electric razor was built by Jacob Schick in 1928. The main disadvantages of electric shaving are that it may not cut the whiskers as closely as razor shaving does and it requires a source of electricity. The advantages include fewer cuts to the skin, quicker shaving and no need for a water/lather supply. The initial cost of electric shaving is higher, due to the cost of the shaver itself, but the long-term cost can be significantly lower, since the cutting parts do not need replacement for approximately 18 months and a lathering product is not required. Some people also find they do not experience ingrown hairs (pseudofolliculitis barbae, also called razor bumps), when using an electric shaver. In contrast to wet shaving, electric shave lotions are intended to stiffen the whiskers. Stiffening is achieved by dehydrating the follicles using solutions of alcohols and a degreaser such as isopropyl myristate.[26] Lotions are also sold to reduce skin irritation, but electric shaving does not usually require the application of any lubrication. Mechanical shavers powered by a spring motor have been manufactured, although in the late 20th century they became rare. Such shavers can operate for up to two minutes each time the spring is wound and do not require an electrical outlet or batteries. Such type of shaver, the "Monaco" brand, was used on American space flights in the 1960s and 1970s, during the Apollo missions.[27] Beard Trimmer Edit Beard trimmer: two sets of hinged blades The mechanics of a beard trimmer involves rotatory mechanics, crafted with a mini size motor, which rounds at a very fast speed. This motor causes two sets of hinged blades to move back and forth past one another allowing for the hair cuticles to be cut. The main advantage of a beard trimmer, unlike other shaving tools is that you can trim longer beards to a short length efficiently and effectively.
Effects of shaving Edit
Aberrations Edit Shaving can have numerous side effects, including cuts, abrasions, and irritation. Many side effects can be minimized by using a fresh blade, applying plenty of lubrication, shaving in the direction of hair growth, and avoiding pressing the razor into the skin.[28][29] A shaving brush can also help to lift the hair and spread the lubrication. The cosmetic market in some consumer economies offers many products to reduce these effects; they commonly dry the affected area, and some also help to lift out the trapped hair(s). Some people who shave choose to use only single-blade or wire-wrapped blades that shave farther away from the skin. Others have skin that cannot tolerate razor shaving at all; they use depilatory shaving powders to dissolve hair above the skin's surface, or grow a beard. Some anatomical parts, such as the scrotum, require extra care and more advanced equipment due to the uneven surface of the skin when the testicles shrivel during coldness, or its imbalance when the testicles hang low due to being warmer.[30] Cuts Edit Cuts from shaving can bleed for about fifteen minutes. Shaving cuts can be caused by blade movement perpendicular to the blade's cutting axis or by regular / orthogonal shaving over prominent bumps on the skin (which the blade incises). As such, the presence of acne can make shaving cuts more likely, and extra care must be exercised. The use of a fresh, sharp blade as well as proper cleaning and lubrication of skin can help prevent cuts. Some razor blade manufacturers include disposal containers or receptacles to avoid injuries to anyone handling the garbage. Razor burn Edit The red spot on this man's neck is razor burn. Razor burn is an irritation of the skin caused by using a blunt blade or not using proper technique.[31] It appears as a mild rash 2–4 minutes after shaving (once hair starts to grow through sealed skin) and usually disappears after a few hours to a few days, depending on severity. In severe cases, razor burn can also be accompanied by razor bumps, where the area around shaved hairs get raised red welts or infected pustules. A rash at the time of shaving is usually a sign of lack of lubrication. Razor burn is a common problem, especially among those who shave coarse hairs on areas with sensitive skin like the bikini line, pubic hair, underarms, chest, and beard. The condition can be caused by shaving too closely, shaving with a blunt blade, dry shaving, applying too much pressure when shaving, shaving too quickly or roughly, or shaving against the grain. Ways to prevent razor burn include keeping the skin moist, using a shaving brush and lather, using a moisturizing shaving gel, shaving in the direction of the hair growth, resisting the urge to shave too closely, applying minimal pressure, avoiding scratching or irritation after shaving, avoiding irritating products on the shaved area (colognes, perfumes, etc.) and using an aftershave cream with aloe vera or other emollients.[32] Putting a warm, wet cloth on one's skin helps as well, by softening hairs. This can also be done by using pre-shave oil before the application of shaving cream. Essential oils such as coconut oil, tea-tree oil, peppermint oil, and lavender oil help to soothe skin after shaving. They have anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, and antibacterial properties.[33] In some cases multi-bladed razors can cause skin irritation by shaving too close to the skin. Switching to a single- or double-bladed razor and not stretching the skin while shaving can mitigate this.[34] One other technique involves exfoliating the skin before and after shaving, using various exfoliating products, included but not limited to, brushes, mitts, and loofah. This process removes dead skin cells, reducing the potential for ingrown hairs and allowing the razor to glide across the skin smoothly decreasing the risk of the razor snagging or grabbing causing razor burn. Razor bumps Edit Main article: Pseudofolliculitis barbae Pseudofolliculitis barbae is a medical term for persistent inflammation caused by shaving. It is also known by the initials PFB or colloquial terms such as "razor bumps". Myths Edit Shaving does not cause terminal hair to grow back thicker, coarser or darker.[35][36] This belief arose because hair that has never been cut has a naturally tapered end, as it emerges from the skin's hair follicle, whereas, after cutting, there is no taper. The cut hair may thus appear to be thicker, and feel coarser as a result of the sharp edges on each cut strand. The fact that shorter hairs are "harder" (less flexible) than longer hairs also contributes to this effect.[37] Hair can also appear darker after it grows back because hair that has never been cut is often lighter from sun exposure. In addition, as humans grow older hair tends to grow coarser and in more places on the face and body.[38] For example, teenagers may start shaving their face or legs at around 16, but as they age hair will start to grow more abundantly and thicker, leading some to believe this was due to the shaving, but in reality is just part of the maturation process.
Shaving in religion Edit
Christianity, Jainism, Hinduism and Buddhism Edit Tonsure is the practice of some Christian churches and some Hindu, Jain and Buddhist (usually only monks or nuns) temples of shaving or plucking the hair from the scalp of priests and nuns as a symbol of their renunciation of worldly fashion and esteem. Amish men shave their beard until they are married, after which they allow it to grow. Among Hindus, a child's birth hair is shaved as practice in the religion. This allows for a check to be made of proper fusing of the skull[citation needed]. It is also believed that this allows the hair to grow back thicker and healthier. Kesh (Sikhism) Edit In Sikhism, Kesh (sometimes Kes) is the practice of allowing one's hair to grow naturally as a symbol of respect for the perfection of God's creation. The practice is one of the Five Ks, the outward symbols ordered by Guru Gobind Singh in 1699 as a means to profess the Sikh faith. The hair is combed twice daily with a Kangha, another of the Five Ks, and tied into a simple knot known as a Joora or Rishi knot. This knot of hair is usually held in place with the Kanga and covered by a turban. Islam Edit Sunni Edit Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: The definition of the beard as stated by the scholars of (Arabic) language is: the hair of the face, jawbone and cheeks, in the sense that all the hair on the cheeks, jawbone and chin is part of the beard and removing any of it is counted as a sin, because the Messenger said: “Let your beards grow,” “Leave your beards alone,” “Let your beards increase,” “Let your beards be full.” This indicates that it is not permissible to remove anything from the beard. But the sin may vary in degree – shaving the beard is worse than shortening it, because it is a more obvious contradiction of the Sunnah. But shaving of pubic hair and armpit is obligatory at least once in forty days[citation needed] Shia Edit According to the Shia scholars, the length of beard should not exceed the width of a fist. Trimming of facial hair is allowed, however, shaving it is haram (religiously forbidden).[39][40][41] Judaism Edit Main article: Shaving in Judaism Observant Jewish men are subject to restrictions on the shaving of their beards, as Leviticus 19:27 forbids the shaving of the corners of the head and prohibits the marring of the corners of the beard.[42] The Hebrew word used in this verse refers specifically to shaving with a blade against the skin[citation needed]; rabbis at different times and places have interpreted it in many ways. Tools like scissors and electric razors, which cut the hair between two blades instead of between blade and skin, are permitted to use.

Turkey's economy tsar warns of deteriorating rule of law
ISTANBUL

“Democracy can only survive with a solid legal system in place. A healthy democracy cannot be sustained in a state where you think ‘this country is democratic, but there are some problems with the rule of law.' If the rules are not clear and transparent, if they are not enforced on those who break the law, if the judiciary is not properly functioning, democracy will likely fail,” Babacan said on May 13, referring to Turkey.
Speaking at the “Bab-ı Ali [Sublime Porte] Meetings,” organized by a Turkish think tank bearing the same name, Babacan stressed that a dysfunctional legal system also hurts a country's business environment. They said rulings reached after prolonged court processes, which are often later reversed by higher courts, damage legal certainty.
“We want a system based on universal law. We want our constitution to be simple, clear and easily comprehensible. Moreover, we say that our legal system has to operate in an objective and independent manner,” the deputy prime minister said.
Babacan is widely seen as Turkey's economy tsar, but they will not be running for parliament in next month's general election due to the ruling Justice and Development Party's (AKP) three-term rule, which restricts the mandate of AKP MPs to three consecutive terms in parliament.
Babacan's position within the AKP has come under increasing scrutiny this year, amid President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's continuous criticism of Turkish Central Bank Governor Erdem Başçı, who Babacan recommended for the position and whose decisions they have defended.
Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan has again expressed their concern over the rule of law in Turkey, suggesting that the country could end up craving the current status of its democracy and economy in the near future if the judicial situation further deteriorates.

Trump hopes that the resignation of Mike Flynn represents the end of the Russian scandal, but it is likely the first domino to fall in a nightmare that has the potential to destroy a president.
The White House released the full text of Flynn's resignation letter to reporters including PoliticusUSA:
In the course of my duties as the incoming National Security Advisor, I held numerous phone calls with foreign counterparts, ministers, and ambassadors. These calls were to facilitate a smooth transition and begin to build the necessary relationships between the President, their advisors and foreign leaders. Such calls are standard practice in any transition of this magnitude.
Unfortunately, because of the fast pace of events, I inadvertently briefed the Vice President Elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian Ambassador. I have sincerely apologized to the President and the Vice President, and they have accepted my apology.
Throughout my over thirty-three years of honorable military service, and my tenure as the National Security Advisor, I have always performed my duties with the utmost of integrity and honesty to those I have served, to include the President of the United States.
I am tendering my resignation, honored to have served our nation and the American people in such a distinguished way.
I am also extremely honored to have served President Trump, who in just three weeks, has reoriented American foreign policy in fundamental ways to restore America's leadership position in the world.
As I step away once again from serving my nation in this current capacity, I wish to thank President Trump for their personal loyalty, the friendship of those who I worked with throughout the hard fought campaign, the challenging period of transition, and during the early days of their presidency.
I know with the strong leadership of President Donald J. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence and the superb team they are assembling, this team will go down in history as one of the greatest presidencies in U.S. history, and I firmly believe the American people will be well served as they all work together to help Make America Great Again.
Flynn wasn't only an appointee. They were a constant presence and a regular warm up act at Trump's campaign rallies. In their letter, Flynn positions themselves as a person who made a mistake, but the truth of the matter is that Flynn's ties to Russia were never in doubt and regularly reported on during the presidential campaign.
The Trump administration is throwing Flynn under the bus and hoping that they can rely on the one bad apple defense to make the Russia scandal go away. Flynn's resignation is likely to have the opposite impact. Congressional investigations, especially in the Senate, are only going to have their curiosity heightened by the resignation.
Trump is trying to use Mike Flynn to put the Russian scandal to bed, but like all scandals with the potential to ruin president's Flynn's resignation was the finger put into the crack in the dam to try to halt the inevitable flood. The questions about Trump's relationship Russia didn't begin, and won't end with Flynn.
The Russia scandal just got real, as Mike Flynn was the first person to get thrown under the bus, but the bigger questions remain unanswered, and they center around the man occupying the Oval Office.
Trump's Russia nightmare is about to get a whole lot worse.

Once again electric car pioneer Tesla Motors (s TSLA) is the lone firm out of its electric car peers that says it's going to do something, and then actually (usually) does it. According to Automotive News, Tesla has now reached its goal of producing 400 Model S electric cars per week, or around 20,000 cars per year.
This rate of production has been Tesla's goal for months — if not years — and it's a big step on the company's path to profitability this year. Back in November, during its latest quarterly earnings, Tesla said it was on track to reach this milestone after having to scale back its original production goals a couple months earlier in September. It also means that all those customers on the waiting list to get their Model S cars — there were 13,200 as of the third quarter — will get their cars sooner, rather than later.

However, as I've written before, Tesla seems to be the exception rather than the rule in the struggling world of independent electric carmakers and batteries made for electric cars. Electric car infrastructure maker Better Place shuffled out its second CEO in as many months last week, and laid off a big chunk of staff in the face of very slow adoption of its electric car service in Israel.
Electric car startup Fisker hasn't made any of its hybrid electric Karma cars in months, and is looking for a Chinese partner, investor or acquirer with deep pockets to offer it a lifeline. Fisker's original production goal at the beginning of its life was 5,000 Karmas in 2011, and it's made around 1,900. A123 Systems, which has been making batteries for Fisker's Karma, went bankrupt last year and then was bought by Chinese auto tech giant Wanxiang.
For the auto giants like GM and Nissan, which have been making their own mainstream electric cars, production isn't a problem. It's just that sales are a little slow. GM sold a total of 23,461 Volts in 2012, up from the 7,671 sold in 2011, and Nissan sold 9,819 Leafs in 2012, according to AutoblogGreen. GM originally wanted to sell 45,000 Volts in 2012.
So why is it so hard for independent electric car companies to meet their targets, and large automakers to hit sales targets? For the auto giants, the market is only just emerging. GM's Volt and the Nissan LEAF are the first mass produced plug-in battery cars on the market in the U.S. Auto exec Bob Lutz, who kickstarted GM's Volt and is now on the board of some startups, says the transition to electric cars will be very slow.
For independent car startups, commercial scale production can be daunting and take a lot longer than expected, too. Many things can go wrong, and it can take months to streamline the process of auto manufacturing. Tesla was founded back in 2003, and its pilot car — where it made errors and suffered delays — was the original Roadster. It's taken Tesla this many years to get to its closer to mainstream automaker status just pushing out 400 cars per week.
If you are reading this post you are probably already familiar with the concept of coroutine.
If you are not, let's say coroutines are a way to have cooperative (non pre-emptive) multitasking, possibly on a single thread. You can have multiple flows of execution that yield control to each other without being pre-empted, and without using threads, semaphores, and condition variables. In simple terms, coroutines are an extension to the concept of function: while functions cannot be resumed after “returning,” coroutines can be resumed from where they were suspended when “yielding” to another coroutine.
There is no language support in C++ for coroutines, but some libraries are available, that use some platform-specific code and a few ingenious hacks to make coroutines possible in C++. A noteworthy one is Boost.Coroutine, based on Boost.Context, a low-level library capable of doing the “magic” of a userspace context switch.
I had problems myself understanding coroutines when I saw them for the first time, and I consistently find it difficult to explain them to other developers, however smart and experienced. I think that parsing stream data is a good case study that makes it immediately understandable what coroutines can give you in real-world applications. When you parse data coming from a stream you have limited control on (e.g. a socket), you often end up coding a state machine that consumes one byte at a time, as the data you are parsing may be coming to you chunked in various ways. In this post, I will introduce a simple C++ example of a coroutine-based parser, present a few benchmarks, and try to cause in you mixed feelings about Boost.Coroutine by showing you a few pros and cons of using it.
Let's take a very simple network protocol, that is based on variable-length messages, the length of which is contained in the first byte of the message. A message of length zero represents the connection-close message.
class state_machine_parser { private: char m_message[255]; uint8_t m_message_length = 0; uint8_t m_message_offset = 0; enum { MESSAGE_HEADER, MESSAGE_BODY, COMPLETE } m_state = MESSAGE_HEADER; public: void process(char c) { switch (m_state) { case MESSAGE_HEADER: m_message_length = c; if (m_message_length == 0) { m_state = COMPLETE; } else { m_message_offset = 0; m_state = MESSAGE_BODY; } break; case MESSAGE_BODY: m_message[m_message_offset++] = c; if (m_message_offset == m_message_length) { // do something with the message m_state = MESSAGE_HEADER; } break; case COMPLETE: break; } } bool complete() const { return m_state == COMPLETE; } };
Usually protocols are much more complex than this, and I don't know you, but I get lost in those massive state-machine parsers with many states ( IDLE , HEADER_VERSION , HEADER_LENGTH , HEADER_LENGTH_EXTENDED , PRE_BODY_MASK , BODY , WAITING_CR , WAITING_LF , etc...) plus a number of variables named offset , len , bytes_to_read , and similar.
Let's look at the following example:
void coroutine_parser(data_source<char>& s, data_source<char>::yield_type& yield) { char message[255]; uint8_t message_length; do { s.read((char*)&message_length, 1, yield); s.read(message, message_length, yield); // do something with the message } while (message_length > 0); }
For now, try not to think about data_source . Assume it is some sort of socket. If it really were a socket, this code would implement some old fashioned, blocking I/O stuff running on a separate thread.
By the means of Boost.Coroutine, you can code data_source like this:
template<typename DataType> class data_source final { public: typedef DataType data_type; typedef boost::coroutines::symmetric_coroutine<void>::call_type call_type; typedef boost::coroutines::symmetric_coroutine<void>::yield_type yield_type; private: data_type* m_dest_buffer; size_t m_pending = 0; public: data_source() = default; data_source(const data_source&) = delete; data_source& operator=(const data_source&) = delete; data_source(data_source&&) = delete; data_source& operator=(data_source&&) = delete; template<typename InputIt> void write(InputIt begin, InputIt end, call_type& parse_coroutine) { while (parse_coroutine) { if (m_pending == 0) { parse_coroutine(); } if (begin == end) { break; } while ((begin != end) && (m_pending != 0)) { *m_dest_buffer++ = *begin++; m_pending--; } } } void read(data_type* dest_buffer, size_t len, yield_type& yield) { if (len != 0) { m_dest_buffer = dest_buffer; m_pending = len; yield(); } } };
This simple helper class abstracts away most of the complexity, thus making the parsing routine itself very neat. You can provide the data to be parsed by calling write with an STL-like range, and the parsing coroutine will resume when the buffer contains exactly the number of bytes requested. The buffer is provided by the coroutine itself, which means no unnecessary copies.
You may argue this is more code than the state machine alone, but bear in mind that data_source can be reused, and does not depend on the protocol―maybe you need to add something: for a start, some way to handle and report errors.
An example of how to bootstrap and feed this parser is available in this GitHub repository.
At this point, if you are an experienced Boost.Coroutine user, you are either yawning, or yelling at me because you like to do things in a different way and/or I did something you find silly. The point of this post however is that even if I feel compelled to use coroutines, there are a few points that concern me:
Performance. I made some benchmarks and the results are not encouraging. I started by comparing the time required to parse 1,000,000 very short sequences with the state machine parser vs. a straightforward coroutine-based implementation, and the result was a 16x slowdown for the coroutine.
I managed to get some improvement by reusing the same stack for all the coroutine invocations: the slowdown reduced to 10x.
Finally, I thought of re-using the same coroutine instance rather than returning from it (when receiving the last, zero-length message) and creating a fresh instance every time. This reduced the slowdown to 7x.
It seems still a lot to me. Of course, if you are parsing data from the network, its inherent latency plus the overhead of the numerous system calls involved will probably be a dominant factor, rather than a few milliseconds wasted every million messages.
Nevertheless, don't assume coroutines come for free.
The benchmarks I am talking about are available here for you to inspect and possibly try on your machine. Feel free to improve them, and explain to me how to further reduce the performance impact of the coroutines.
If you get a crash, scroll down to the last point of this list to learn why. (Lack of) consensus. In most real-world cases, you are not the owner of the code you write, and I challenge you to convince your colleagues (especially those fearing Boost or the Standard Library itself!) that everybody should use coroutines because they are cool. It is something that C and C++ programmers have never seen, and they will be suspicious. If anything goes wrong, coroutines will instantaneously be accused, and will be eradicated from the codebase overnight at the first sign of trouble. Let's wait for them to be part of the C++ programming language itself, it will be way easier to convince resistant developers to use and trust them. Portability. You may be sacrificing portability for something that, after all, is just syntactic sugar. Valgrind. Boost.Context and Boost.Coroutine puzzle Valgrind. The fix didn't work for me (it instantaneously segfaulted) and it is a pain in the neck because you have to rebuild Boost. Exceptions. There is some quirky stuff to care about if you want to catch exceptions inside your coroutine. Make sure you carefully read what the documentation says. The API keeps changing. Just compare Boost.Coroutine in version 1.54, 1.55, and 1.56. Three consecutive versions, three completely different worlds. Backward compatibility is guaranteed I think, but the old API disappeared from the documentation, not even reported as deprecated, just swallowed by the dark. This is confusing to say the least, and reduces consensus (see point 2). I found a bug, without doing anything particularly strange. The code contained in my benchmark will trigger it. Your copy of Boost is probably affected. Here's the patch.
The bottom line is that coroutines are an effective tool that can improve the readability of complex parsing routines, and much more (there are plenty of use cases). Boost.Coroutine is an impressive tool you can use to bring coroutines into your C++ code, not just for parsing, of course. I just recommend going easy on them, for the above reasons.
BP shares plummet around the world
NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- Shares of BP tumbled in U.S. and overseas stock markets Tuesday after its latest attempt to stop the Gulf of Mexico oil leak failed.
BP's (BP) stock sank 15% in U.S. trading, down $6.40 to $36.55. It also fell 14% on the London Stock Exchange. The British oil giant's stock has plummeted nearly 40% since the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded on April 20, losing $74.9 billion of shareholder value. BP's market capitalization fell by $20 billion on Tuesday alone.
The company on Saturday announced the failure of its "top kill" solution, an effort to use mud to slow down the flow of oil into the Gulf. Similarly, BP's "junk shot" solution did not work, after attempts to slow the leak with garbage failed.
Shares fell farther at the end of the day, after Attorney General Eric Holder announced that they have launched a criminal investigation into the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
Meanwhile, oil continues to spill into the Gulf at a pace of about 19,000 barrels a day, according to government estimates. The oil spill is now officially the worst in U.S. history, surpassing the Exxon Valdez spill off the coast of Alaska in 1989.
BP is currently working on a new solution, in which robots will saw off the "lower marine riser package" on the gushing oil well, preparing for the placement of a custom-made cap on the package. But even if that cap works, it would not completely stop the leak. A long-term solution to the oil leak -- the drilling of a relief well -- will not be completed until August.
The company said Friday its spill-related costs have totaled $930 million to date, but that figure could soar higher, even if the leak is soon contained.
Hurricane season officially started Tuesday, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecasted an unusually severe storm season. Meteorologists worry that strong hurricanes could hinder the oil-containment efforts or blow oil into coastal areas, causing catastrophic damage to Gulf economies.
BP also has to pay for the wildlife killed by the spill, and could be subject to lawsuits. The Obama administration has pledged that BP will be responsible for all cleanup costs.
Analysts have thrown out a wide range of estimates -- from $4 billion to $25 billion -- on how hard the incident will hurt the company's bottom line. Exxon (XOM, Fortune 500) paid $3.4 billion in cleanup costs, but ultimately only paid $507.5 million for the legal settlement, in addition to $500 million in interest payments.
Story highlights Writers: Review of Keystone XL pipeline information shows it's not in the national interest
They say tar sands oil spews 17% more greenhouse gas than crude oil refined in the U.S.
Writers: Report acknowledges tar sands oil from Keystone could worsen climate change
Oil companies will need even more pipelines to reach their goals, they say
For all the noise about the State Department's final environmental review of the Keystone XL Pipeline being a "blow" to pipeline opponents, the report contains more than enough information for Secretary of State John Kerry -- a respected environmental champion -- to conclude that the pipeline is not in the national interest.
Although you have to dig a bit, the report r ecognizes the dangers associated with the tar sands fuel that the pipeline would transport.
Using the Obama administration's estimates of the social cost of carbon, that adds up to $128 billion in climate costs over the lifetime of the project, costs that can too often be measured in parched farmland, compromised human health and property damage from floods.
So how does the report admit the possibility of lasting environmental harm from the tar sands on the one hand while concluding that building the pipeline would not cause an increase in greenhouse gas emissions on the other? It presumes that the tar sands fuels are going to get to market anyway, so the environmental damage happens with or without Keystone XL.
We think this presumption is seriously flawed. One key assumption is the report's forecast that crude oil prices will stay above $75 per barrel. Below that price, the report actually finds that Keystone does make a difference in driving tar sands production and greater carbon pollution. Contrary to the report's assumptions, there is a real chance that crude oil prices will fall below that level.
Energy commodity traders at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and experts at the International Energy Agency forecast a sharp decline in oil prices over the next decade.
The Energy Information Agency's low oil price forecast, which assumes slower economic growth in developing countries, projects oil prices around $75 or below from 2015 through 2040. In addition, the more successful international efforts are at promoting energy efficiency and new forms of clean energy, the more demand for traditional fossil fuels will shrink, pushing prices down.
The report also presumes that all tar sands growth will come from low- cost projects, and higher cost tar sands projects won't be built with or without the pipeline. That's unrealistic: Higher cost projects are moving forward, but their continued economic viability will depend on variables such as low-cost transportation as well as sufficiently high oil prices.

The tar sands producers themselves belie the claim that Keystone XL won't make a difference in bringing the tar sands to market. The CEO of major tar sands producer Cenovus admitted that their company's plan to triple production in coming years was contingent on more pipeline capacity. Financial giants such as RBC Capital, Goldman Sachs , Barclays and CIBC have all linked the size of the tar sands industry to the availability of new pipelines. The desperate push over this pipeline shows how badly tar sands producers need Keystone XL.
Opinion: Keystone XL pipeline makes sense
Perhaps most serious, the State Department report fails to take into account the actions needed to prevent catastrophic climate change.
In Copenhagen, Denmark, in 2009, the United States and more than 100 other nations agreed that we need to limit the global temperature increase from carbon pollution to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). President Barack Obama affirmed that goal in their Climate Action Plan.
According to the models used in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change analysis, we must keep atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations below 450 parts per million to achieve the 2 degrees target. That's not possible if we maintain the status quo, much less bring online more and exceedingly dirty sources of fuel such as tar sands oil.
In a glaring omission, the Keystone XL review failed to factor in the 2 degrees limit, and assumed the continuation of business-as-usual practices for the next quarter century. We have almost no chance of meeting the 2 degree goal if any of the report's scenarios are realized.
Kerry's obligation is to determine what is in the national interest. For all its flaws, the report acknowledges that the tar sands that would get to market through Keystone XL could significantly worsen climate change. That's a risk that climate champions such as Kerry and Obama shouldn't be willing to take.
The question of whether or not some sort of god exists is not one which should necessarily occupy the minds of atheists all of the time. Theists — especially Christians — regularly challenge atheists with arguments and ideas which supposedly demonstrate that their god definitely exists. But prior to that, there is an even more important issue to address: is a god really important in our lives? Should atheists even care about the existence of any gods in the first place?
If the existence of a god isn't important, we certainly needn't waste our time debating the issue. It should be expected that theists, and Christians in particular, will quickly say that the question of their god's existence is indeed vitally important. It would not be unusual to find them saying that this question eclipses all other questions which humanity might ask. But the skeptic or nonbeliever should not simply grant them this assumption.
Defining God
Theists who try to argue that their god is indeed important will naturally support their position by reference to all its supposed characteristics — like perhaps that it offers eternal salvation for humanity. This seems like a reasonable direction to go, but is nevertheless flawed. Of course they think that their god is important, and of course this is closely related to what they think their god is and what it does.
However, if we accept this line of reasoning, then we are accepting a particular set of characteristics which have not yet been established to be true. It must be remembered that we didn't ask if their god with its supposed characteristics is important. Instead we asked if the existence of any god, generally speaking, was important.
These are very different questions, and theists who have never thought about the existence of a god outside of the sort of god they've been taught to believe in may fail to see the distinction. A skeptic might choose later to grant that if a particular god with certain characteristics exists, then that existence could be important; at that point we could move on to see if there are any good reasons to think that this alleged god exists.
On the other hand, we might also just as easily grant that if a particular elf with certain characteristics exists, then that existence would be important. That, however, begs the question of why we are talking about elves in the first place. Are we just bored? Are we practicing our debating skills? In a similar vein, it is justifiable to ask why we are talking about gods in the first place.
Social Order & Morality
One reason which some theists, especially Christians, will offer for thinking that the existence of their god is important is that belief in a god is good for, or even necessary for, social order and moral behavior. For hundreds of years, Christian apologists have argued that without a belief in a god, basic social structures would disintegrate and people would no longer find reason to act morally.
It is a shame that so many Christians (and other theists) continue to employ this argument because it's so bad. The first point which should be made is that it obviously isn't true that their god is required for good social order and moral behavior — most of the cultures in the world have gotten by just fine without their god.
Next is the question of whether or not belief in any god or higher power is required for morality and social stability. There are any number of objections which can be made here, but I will try and cover a few of basic ones. The most obvious thing to point out is that this is nothing but an assertion, and empirical evidence is clearly against it.
An examination of history makes it evident that believers in gods can be very violent, especially when it comes to other groups of believers who follow different gods. Atheists have also been violent — but they have also led very good and moral lives. Thus, there is no apparent correlation between belief in gods and being a good person. As Steven Weinberg noted in their article Designer Universe:
With or without religion, good people can behave well and bad people can do evil; but for good people to do evil — that takes religion.
Another interesting fact to point out is that the claim doesn't actually require any god to really exist. If social stability and morality are only achieved with believing in a god, even a false god, then the theist is claiming that human societies require massive deceit in order to survive. Moreover, the theist is arguing that a society doesn't actually need their god, since any god will apparently do. I'm sure that there are some theists who will quickly agree with this and not be bothered, but they are rare.
A more fundamental objection, however, is the implicit portrayal of humanity which such a claim makes. The unspoken reason why humans need some god to be moral is that they are not capable of creating their own social rules and, hence, require an eternal rule-giver with accompanying eternal rewards and eternal punishments.
How can a theist possibly claim this when even chimpanzees and other primates are clearly capable of creating social rules? The theist is attempting to create ignorant children out of all of us. In their eyes, we are apparently incapable of running our own affairs; worse yet, only the promise of eternal reward and the threat of eternal punishment will keep us in line. Perhaps this is actually true of them, and that would be unfortunate. However, that is not true of any of the atheists I know.
Meaning & Purpose in Life
A common reason used to argue that the existence of a god is relevant to us is that a god is necessary to have purpose or meaning in life. Indeed, it is common to hear Christians assert that atheists cannot possibly have any sort of meaning or purpose to their lives without the Christian god. But is this true? Is some god really a prerequisite for meaning and purpose in one's life?
I honestly don't see how this can be so. In the first place, it can be argued that even if a god did exist, that existence would not provide either meaning or purpose to a person's life. Christians seem to maintain that serving their god's will is what gives them purpose, but I hardly think that this is admirable. Mindless obedience might be praiseworthy in dogs and other domesticated animals, but it certainly isn't of much value in mature adult humans. Moreover, it is debatable whether or not a god which desires such uncritical obedience is worthy of any obedience in the first place.
The idea that this god is supposed to have created us has been used to justify the doctrine of obedience as fulfilling one's purpose in life; however, the proposition that a creator is automatically justified in ordering its creation to do whatever it desires is one which requires support and should not be accepted out of hand. In addition, a good deal of support would be needed to claim that this would serve as an adequate purpose in life.
Of course, all of that assumes that we could clearly discern the will of the alleged creator. Quite a few religions in human history have asserted the existence of a creator-god, yet none of them have managed to find much agreement as to what such a creator-god might want from us humans. Even within religions, there is tremendous diversity of opinion as to the desires of the god being worshipped. It seems that if such a god did exist, it probably wouldn't have done such a poor job as to allow this confusion.
I can draw no other conclusion from this situation than that if some sort of creator-god exists, it is highly unlikely that we'll be able to figure out what it wants of us, if anything at all. The scenario which seems to play out is that people project their own hopes and fears onto whatever god they worship. People who fear and hate modernity project that onto their god and, as a result, find a god which wants them to continue in their fear and hatred. Others are open to change and willing to love others regardless of differences, and thus find in a god which is tolerant of change and variation, and wants them to continue as they are.
Although the latter group is more pleasant to spend time with, their position is not actually any better founded than the former. There is no more reason to think that there is a benevolent and loving creator-god than that there is instead a mean-spirited and fearful creator-god. And, in either case, what that god might want from us — if discoverable — cannot automatically give us purpose in our lives.
On the other hand, it is easily arguable that meaning and purpose in life are ready to find — indeed, create — without the existence of, much less belief in, any sort of god. Meaning and purpose at their heart require valuation, and valuation must begin with the individual. For this reason, they must exist first and foremost in the individual. Others outside of us (including gods) may suggest possible paths for us where meaning and purpose could perhaps develop, but ultimately that will depend upon us.
If the existence of a god is not actually relevant to how we live our lives and certainly isn't necessary to being a good person, then debating the existence of any god may not be too important. You might choose to debate the existence of some particular god in order to pass the time or hone debating skills, but it would appear that one of the more effective response to the oft heard "Why don't you believe in God?" is "Why care about gods in the first place?"
HOLLYWOOD has made at least half a dozen films based on Mary Shelley's gothic masterpiece—mindless travesties all of them, even the Kenneth Branagh version released in 1994. That is a pity because the parable of the Genevan protagonist, Victor Frankenstein, deserves wider appreciation, especially among those concerned about technology getting out of control.

In the actual story, there is no crazed assistant, no criminal brain stolen from a grave, no violent rampage, and no angry mob hunting down and killing the monster. Instead, the rejected creation pleads to be accepted, and cared for, by its creator and tries hard to fit in with society. Yes, there is violence and revenge—it wouldn't be a gothic novel without them. In the end, however, the autonomous being departs to commit suicide after its creator dies of disease.

What makes the tale such an enduring classic are the moral questions it raises about creation, responsibility and unintended consequences. The lessons are as relevant in today's world of autonomous technology—whether driverless vehicles or surgical robots—as they were in 1818 when the melodrama first scared the daylights out of Georgian England.
Whether consciously or not, the Royal Academy of Engineering in Britain seems lately to have taken Shelley's fable to heart. In a report published last week, the academy urges opinion-formers to start thinking seriously about the implications of autonomous technology—machinery that can act independently by replicating human behaviour. The intention is to have such machines do the sort of jobs people find dull, dirty or dangerous. Many such systems either already exist or are closer to reality than is generally realised. And right now, the ethical, let alone the legal, framework for dealing with any untoward consequences of their actions simply does not exist.
The academy looked at two areas of the technology that are expanding fast: autonomous transport and automated help around the home for the elderly. Within ten years, driverless vehicles that use lasers and radars to sense their surroundings will be able to thread their way through traffic. They are already widespread in controlled environments such as warehouses, airports and mines. Whether they will be seen on the public highways is not a technological issue, but a political and legal matter.
With their digital controllers programmed to obey the highway code, driverless trucks will be far safer and more predictable than human-operated vehicles. They won't suddenly pull out in front of you, or refuse to give way when they should. But if a mechanical failure or software glitch should ever cause a driverless truck to collide with a car, who would be legally responsible—the truck company, the manufacturer, the systems engineer? (Under today's product-liability law, the motorist would doubtless get off scot-free, even if the accident was their fault.)
There are similar concerns about automatons designed to watch over the elderly. Systems exist to check when people are awake, whether they have taken their medication, and what their vital signs are. Privacy issues aside, such aids are to be welcomed for their greater good.
But once sensor data can be used to tell people with dementia what to do and what not to do, the potential for abuse can become real. The benefits of such patient-monitoring in the home may be that the individual wanders around less, suffers less incontinence and sleeps better. But can even the most responsible of families and carers be trusted to supervise such technology day in and day out for years on end, to stop accidents happening? The answer may be not more technology, but better social engineering. For sure, people have barely begun to think about such issues.
In 2006, a survey by Elon University and the Pew Internet Project in America asked some 742 technology experts and social critics whether autonomous machines would leave humans out of the loop. Slightly over half thought people would not lose control, but not all that many fewer felt they might.
Respondents were invited to give their views. A recurring theme was that “technology beyond our control” was rather alarmist. The history of applying automation to human tasks (telephone operators, for instance) had not left people unduly at the mercy of autonomous contraptions. Defying Shelley's prognostication, many respondents felt few technologies live beyond the control of their creators: everything has a “choke point” of one sort or another—built in, often subconsciously, for reasons of convenience, safety or mistake.
That was three years ago, when few were probably aware of how quickly a technology known as “evolvable hardware” was emerging from the shadows. Like the “brute-force” methods standard in code-cracking and computer chess, evolvable machines try billions of different possibilities. But the difference is that they continually crop and refine their trial-and-error solutions—mimicking the way natural selection works in the wild.
How soon before evolvable machines become cleverer than people? Little over a decade is the current consensus. One such machine has already been awarded a patent for something it quietly invented on its own.
The temptation to surrender control to machines that are smarter, more vigilant and less prone to boredom, irritation and emotional outbursts than people will be overwhelming. People will do so for reasons of comfort, convenience, safety and cost. So, what happens when a one-in-a-billion bug causes the software to crash, or the safety valves are not operated properly?
That is what happened at Three Mile Island in 1979. Though the nuclear power station was not an autonomous system, it was running automatically with its human controllers outside the loop. When things went horribly wrong, inexperienced operators tried desperately to take command, only to make one compounding mistake after another—turning a control system with good negative feedback into a positive, runaway disaster.
Though now dated, Langdon Winner's oft-cited book “Autonomous Technology” (MIT Press, 1977) was one of the first to call attention to the way the complexity of big systems can lead to loss of control and disaster. That was two years before the explosion at Three Mile Island.
Dr Winner was also one of the first to note that Frankenstein's invention represented a giant leap in the capability of a certain kind of technology. Yet, it was sent it out into the world with no concern for how best to include it in the community. When the creature returned as an autonomous force with demands that it insisted were met, its creator was unable to find a way to repair the damage done by their imperfect invention. Shelley's story may have been the first to show how good intentions behind technological inventions can go awry. It surely won't be the last.
JUNEAU -- A bill moving through the Legislature that would allow people to carry concealed weapons on University of Alaska campuses has drawn attention from national organizations embroiled in broader debates over gun laws.
The National Rifle Association sent a lobbyist to Juneau to press lawmakers to support the bill. On the opposing side, a gun violence prevention organization founded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Everytown for Gun Safety, has launched an online advertising blitz in Alaska.
The bill, Senate Bill 174, would strip the university's authority to designate concealed gun-free zones on campuses. The legislation passed the Senate on April 7 and needs to clear one more committee before heading to the floor of the House of Representatives.
The sponsor, Sen. Pete Kelly, R-Fairbanks, says the bill is intended in part to allow students to defend themselves. University leaders have said the bill is flawed and asked for a series of changes, including requiring a permit for concealed handguns on campuses.
With the Legislature set to adjourn on Sunday, the clock is ticking. In recent days, a California-based lobbyist for the NRA, Brian Judy, has been ubiquitous in the hallways of the state Capitol, talking to legislators and testifying at committee hearings.
"This is what we support," Judy said in a Friday interview, speaking of the NRA. "It's the right of law-abiding adults to provide a means of self-protection."
After Kelly's bill passed a key committee Thursday, Everytown for Gun Safety reacted with a statement quoting Chelan Schreifels, mother of a 19-year-old Anchorage woman who was shot in the head by an acquaintance in October, who called the bill "completely misguided."
Schreifels was identified as a member of Moms Demands Action for Gun Sense in America, one of the groups under the umbrella of Bloomberg's organization.
On Friday, the organization -- which sees itself as a counter to the NRA -- upped its offensive with prominent ads decrying the bill on the Alaska Dispatch News homepage and in a full-page ad in the print newspaper. Such ad placements run at a rate of about $5,000 online and $10,000 in print.
"Forcing colleges to allow guns on campus is dangerous and costly," one ad said. The ads were paid for by Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund, the advocacy arm of the organization.
The ads linked to a letter that opponents of the bill could send to lawmakers.
One ad also said the bill would cost UA up to $5.3 million over five years, though that appeared to be based on an outdated fiscal analysis from the university.
In its latest analysis, the university pegged the cost at $450,000, which officials said would stem from checkpoints and secure areas for weapons-free areas in rooms where sexual assault was being investigated.
Stacey Radnor, a spokesperson for Everytown for Gun Safety, said while the national organization has taken note of Kelly's bill, the state chapter of Moms Demands Action has taken the lead on it.
"Our grass-roots advocates are on the ground fighting back against gun-lobby backed legislation like (SB 174)," Radnor said in a phone interview.
Judy, who is registered as a lobbyist with the state and reported being paid at the rate of $61.54 an hour, also said they don't see themselves as an outsider. They track issues in Alaska, Washington, Montana and Utah, and learned months ago that Kelly's legislation would be moving forward.
They said it was "ironic" they had been accused by opponents of Kelly's bill of being an outside influence.
"I represent tens of thousands of NRA members who are Alaskans," Judy said.
They added, referring to Everytown for Gun Safety: "That organization is Michael Bloomberg. That's a New York millionaire who's spending money in Alaska."
Bloomberg's group and the NRA have butted heads in other states, such as Maine, where lawmakers passed a broad expansion of gun rights last fall.
Kelly said Friday they aren't surprised to hear both groups were working the issue in Alaska.
"You would expect that, I suppose, because both those groups fight on a state-by-state basis," Kelly said.
Rep. Steve Thompson, R-Fairbanks, who chairs the House Finance Committee, said they hoped to schedule a hearing on the bill Saturday.
Ex-Scores stripper Christy Yamanaka is accused of absconding with their dead husband's silver and gold from their Tudor City apartment. View Full Caption Christy Yamanaka handout
MIDTOWN EAST — Call it naked greed.
The son of a Manhattan business person claims their dead dad's ex-con stripper wife absconded with their hubby's rare gold coins and silver bullion as well as hundreds of thousands in cash.
Steven Bruni is demanding that their dad's fourth wife, Christy Yamanaka, return four silver bars and dozens of gold and silver coins that they allegedly took from a safe in their father's Tudor City apartment, according to court filings.
Bruni also accuses Yamanaka, a 53-year-old former Scores dancer who was once convicted of bank fraud, of failing to explain why their dad, Irving Schwartz, gave them a $320,000 check shortly before their death in 2011 — even though the couple was on the verge of splitting up.
As proof of the souring marriage, Bruni claims in a legal filing in Manhattan Surrogate's Court that Schwartz sent a June 5, 2011, email to Yamanaka telling them that they were over.
“GOOD LUCK WITH THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. IF I STAY WITH YOU IT WILL KILL ME,” Schwartz wrote in all caps, according to Bruni.
In the email, Schwartz harped on Yamanaka's wasteful spending and complained that they wouldn't sleep with them unless they paid them
“You've said a lot of things to me that were hurtful, such as you would not have sex with me unless I paid you $10,000,” Schwartz wrote, according to Bruni's filing.
Schwartz also griped in the email that Yamanka constantly suspected them of cheating and even asked for money to hire investigators to tail him.
“Last week in my car you picked up a napkin I used when I had while driving and wiped my mouth from the sandwich I was eating you right away accused me of cheating again saying it was foundation from a womans makeup,” they wrote, according Bruni.
Yamanaka did not respond to a call for comment.
Schwartz, the owner of cleaning firm Safeguard Environmental Services, died of heart failure at 81 on Aug. 29, 2011.
They and Yamanaka married in the summer of 2010, six weeks before they pleaded guilty in federal court to scheming with a friend, Florida judge Thomas Stringer, to hide their assets from creditors. Yamanaka was sentenced to a year of supervised release.
The legal fight over Schwartz's estate started two weeks after their death.
At the time, Bruni asked a judge for control of the estate and questioned the circumstances surrounding Schwartz's last will. It had been drafted and signed on the day of their death, according to Bruni.
Bruni said in their initial filing that they were also suspicious of their dad's death. Their then lawyer, Charles Mirotznik, noted that the city's Chief Medical Examiner's Office was performing an autopsy for “possible foul play.”
The autopsy report eventually showed Schwartz died of natural causes — but Bruni later said that even Yamanaka's lawyer, Michael M. Lippman, confided in 2012 that they had misgivings about them
“You know, when we were waiting for the autopsy report, and I came up to [Yamanaka's] house to talk to her, and she'd offer me stuff to drink, I wouldn't take it,” Lippman said in a conversation to Bruni, according to a March 2013 filing.
Lippman did not respond to a request for comment. But they have their own legal troubles. Bronx prosecutors charged them in 2010 with taking $300,000 in unauthorized fees from the estates of dead people while working as counsel to the Bronx public administrator.
They pleaded not guilty and is currently on trial, according to court records.
Bruni, who lives in Pearl River, N.Y., did not respond to requests for comments. A judge has appointed them the temporary administrator of Schwartz's estate.
However, earlier this week, their former lawyer, Charles Mirotnik, filed legal papers with the court, demanding that Bruni pay them for their services in 2012.
Bruni believes Yamanaka — who worked as an exotic dancer in the 2000s in Florida and at the Scores strip club on the Upper East Side — is now living in Nevada but has ignored their requests to account for their dad's missing gold and cash.
It's official: Showtime's Shameless will live on to season eight.
The premium cable network on Monday announced that the William H. Macy and Emmy Rossum starrer will return for an eighth season in 2017. Production on the 12-episode season will begin in May, as Rossum announced last week.
The news arrives a day after the season-seven finale that ended with a post-credits scene telling viewers to "come back next year." The pickup is little surprise after leading lady Rossum negotiated a new deal to return to the dramedy following a salary standoff in which they demanded equal pay with Macy — and more — to compensate for years of being paid less. Macy recently renegotiated their contract with producer Warner Bros. Television. Sources say awards- season regular Macy scored a raise that puts their salary in the upper echelon of cable dramas. The cast's last renegotiation a few years ago gave raises to all the main members of the ensemble.
Shameless has become a key piece of Showtime's original scripted lineup. The drama has pulled off the rare feat of airing twice in the same calendar year (this year) in a bid to fill the originals gap created by Homeland's delay to early 2017. Shameless also is a key asset for Warner Bros. TV, which is attempting to sell more series to premium cable outlets as broadcast networks buy from their vertically aligned studios.
John Wells, who recently scored a series pickup for their WBTV-produced TV Land comedy American Woman, serves as showrunner on Shameless. Jeremy Allen White, Cameron Monaghan, Emma Kenney, Ethan Cutkosky, Shanola Hampton and Steve Howey round out the cast of the Chicago-set family drama.
Season seven of Shameless ranked as its highest-rated season to date. The show is a top five cable drama among total viewers, adults 18-49 as well as adults 18-34. Shameless, along with Homeland, ranks as Showtime's longest-running scripted original. They are part of a roster of hourlong shows that includes The Affair, Billions and Ray Donovan. Set to join that roster in 2017 are Twin Peaks, Jim Carrey-produced I'm Dying Up Here, Daniel Craig starrer Purity and John Ridley's Idris Elba mini Guerrilla. This past year, the pay cabler bid farewell to dramas Masters of Sex, Roadies and Penny Dreadful. On the pilot side, Showtime has Lena Waithe's drama starring Common (aka The Chi); Jason Katims' comedic anthology Mating, starring Taran Killam; Jay Pharoah starrer White Famous; and SMILF.
"Playing Fiona Gallagher has been one of the great privileges of my life. I'm so happy to continue w my SHAMELESS family! Back to work in May!" Rossum tweeted Dec. 14.
North Carolina community colleges yesterday banned illegal immigrants from seeking degrees, creating a new policy that is among the most restrictive in the US.
Community college system President Scott Ralls said they based the decision on the advice of the state attorney general's office, which said last week that federal law appears to ban states from enrolling illegal immigrants in state colleges and universities.
"We sought that advice and we plan to follow that advice until further clarification," Ralls said of the attorney general's guidance.
The decision takes effect immediately at the system's 58 campuses and reverses a policy that allowed illegal immigrants, paying out-of-state tuition that more than covers the cost of instruction.
It comes despite the federal government's assertion last week that it has no authority over admissions at North Carolina colleges and despite Governor Mike Easley's request that the colleges remain open to all students.
Ralls said they will continue to seek clarification of federal law regarding the eligibility of illegal immigrants for post-secondary education and that another policy change is possible. Ralls, who became president of the system this month, said this is the fourth time since 2001 that the system has changed its policy on illegal immigrants.
"It's the issue of the day," Ralls said. "We're trying to navigate our way as best we can."
Some immigration law experts say they know of no state that bars illegal immigrants from attending public colleges and universities. Officials in Easley's office said last week that if the state's colleges and universities followed the attorney general's advice, North Carolina would be the only state to restrict admissions based on immigration status.
Easley asked the colleges to continue admitting students regardless of their immigration status.
Easley's office released a brief statement about the community college decision yesterday: "It is odd the community colleges would ask for clarification on the law and then change the policy before they get the clarification."
Undocumented students will still be allowed to enrol in non-degree programs, including general equivalency classes, English as a second language courses and classes for high school credit.
Of the 300,000 students enrolled in degree programs at the state's community colleges, 112 are undocumented; those students will be allowed to remain, the statement from the community colleges said.
The advice from the office of Attorney General Roy Cooper came in a May 6 advisory letter, which cited a federal law that deems illegal immigrants ineligible for public benefits including post-secondary education.
It said the department of homeland security was responsible for enforcing the law and described its interpretation as "unsettled". However, the letter recommended that the community colleges return to a 2001 policy that prohibited illegal immigrants.
Campuses had been allowed to set their own policies since 2004, and about a third excluded illegal immigrants. But in November, then-President Martin Lancaster required all schools to admit students regardless of immigration status.
The policy sparked so much controversy that the community college system asked Cooper's office for an opinion.
The department of homeland security responded to the advice on Friday, saying it had no authority over admissions at North Carolina colleges.
On Tuesday, Cooper's office said in a statement it was seeking more guidance from federal officials. Spokeswoman Noelle Talley said that the community colleges' 2001 policy had never received a legal challenge.
Cooper's office sent its advice only to the community colleges, but it also applied to the state's universities.
Yesterday, University of North Carolina System President Erskine Bowles sent a letter to the university chancellors and the board of governors.
It said that the UNC system would not change its policy of admitting illegal immigrants at out-of-state rates until it received further clarification of federal law.
"In this instance, there sure seems to be considerable legal disagreement about what the relevant federal law really says," Bowles wrote.
The UNC system says that only 27 of its approximately 200,000 students are in the country illegally.
The community college decision yesterday drew the eyes of immigration activists around the country. Several local and national groups celebrated the announcement, saying it would discourage illegal immigration.
"We're delighted," said Ron Woodard of Cary, head of the group NC Listen, which favours a crackdown on illegal immigration. "If it's illegal to be in the country, why would it be legal to go to college?"
Advocates, however, said they were confounded and angry. More than 80 North Carolina community groups, including Hispanic resource centres, religious groups and unions, announced their support yesterday for allowing illegal immigrants to attend college.
Tony Asion, director of the statewide Hispanic advocacy group El Pueblo, said they were confused by the decision in light of statements from federal officials.
"We're forgetting that we're talking about people's lives here," Asion said. "Some of these young people, if you picked them up and took them back to their home country, they would be completely out of place. They're steeped in American culture. But we're telling them, 'We don't really want you here.'"
Meanwhile, the campuses were scrambling to change their admissions policies, some of them for the second time in six months.
Jerri Haigler, a spokesperson for Central Piedmont community college, said the school was still awaiting guidance on how it should screen new applicants.
Stephen Scott, president at Wake Technical community college, said another policy change will require another round of staff training.
"There's much controversy around the issue so it's not a surprise," Scott said of the decision. "Our role is to educate students, and we will follow the rules set down for us."

BELLEVUE, Wash. – Self-driving cars are all well and good for cross-country trips, but what Madrona Venture Group's Tom Alberg really wants to see is a self-driving bus that can take them on a winery tour.
“I'm very keen on the idea of navigating a wine van pool, going around between the different wineries,” the influential investment group's managing director joked.
And there's a chance Alberg may get their wish, or something close to it, sooner rather than later.
They and other stakeholders in the region's transportation future gathered at Bellevue's Meydenbauer Conference Center on Friday for the 2016 Advanced Transportation Technologies Conference, organized by the Center for Advanced Transportation and Energy Solutions.
Just after their talk, two Bellevue city council members and Bellevue Mayor John Stokes bent Alberg's ear about their plans to make the Seattle region an incubator for autonomous transit. The council is on track to get a full-time staff member working on ways to ease Bellevue's traffic mess with “smart city” strategies.
City Councilmember Kevin Wallace sees the challenge as an opportunity “to make Bellevue the cutting edge of transportation technology.”
“How can we use this one square mile that's downtown Bellevue, surrounded by neighborhoods full of wealthy early-adopters, to be the testing ground?” they said.
Autonomous buses and vans are by no means a total solution to the congestion and costs associated with the region's transit woes. But they could fill a niche between the mass transit extensions that will be funded by the recently approved $54 billion Sound Transit 3 package, and the fleets of autonomous cars that are expected to proliferate in the years to come.
Alberg said autonomous vehicles could affect the grand plan for Sound Transit 3.
“I just hope Sound Transit and others are really maintaining flexibility,” they said. “I know it was a plan approved by the voters. It's a good plan, but I also think 10 years from now, they'll need to take a new look at some of the aspects of this. When the lawyers are drafting bond resolutions, I hope they're providing flexibility so they're not locked into systems that can't be changed.”
In September, Alberg and their colleagues at Madrona proposed creating exclusive self-driving lanes on Interstate 5 between Seattle and Vancouver – an idea that they now acknowledge was put forward partly for its “shock effect.” That's a long-term vision, but Alberg said some changes that could be made sooner rather than later to get ready for a driverless future.
“Whoever controls it, whether it's federal or state, immediately saying that autonomous vehicles can use the HOV lanes … there's one thing that can be done right away,” they told GeekWire.
Transit policy analysts say autonomous vehicles would change the equation in several ways – by dramatically reducing accident rates, by “platooning” a string of connected cars or trucks to make highway travel more efficient, and by reducing the cost of ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft.
It's no secret that taking the driver out of the car makes a big difference for the economics of ride-sharing. The same goes for transit. Shuttle services are particularly well-suited for autonomous vehicles because they tend to involve well-established, predictable routes.
That's the reason why Local Motors' Olli driverless shuttles are making inroads in urban settings such as Miami, Las Vegas and Washington, D.C. In the Netherlands, a program called WEpods is taking a similar route.
The changing economics could cause cities like Bellevue to revisit concepts that were previously discarded – for example, creating shuttles to connect an expanded network of park-and-ride lots with downtown stops.
“We actually looked about 10 years ago at doing a circulator in downtown Bellevue. The cost was, like, $11 a ride,” Wallace told Alberg.
“A lot of that was the cost of a driver,” Alberg replied. “It's time to relook at that as an autonomous circulator.”
Just make sure to add some wineries to the route.

The following file has 3 sheets with detailed data by race and gender. The first sheet is from 2006 to 2013 for selected states. The second sheet is the race and gender information for every state for 2013. The third sheet is the race and gender information for every state for 2012.
There was a problem with the % increase calculation. I fixed that on 2/10/2014. Thanks to Mihaela Sabin for noticing that and informing me.
DetailedStateInfoAP-CS-A-2006-2013-with-PercentBlackAndHIspanicByState-fixed.xlsx
This data was compiled from the data from the College Board at https://apcourseaudit.epiconline.org/ledger/ and http://research.collegeboard.org/programs/ap/data/archived.
Some interesting findings from this data:
No females took the exam in Mississippi (1 exam taken), Montana (11 exams taken), and Wyoming (no exams).
Wyoming had nobody take the AP CS A exam in 2013. They had 35 students take the exam in 2001.
Mississippi had only 1 person take the AP CS A exam in 2013. But, they had 40 students take it in 1999.
For states that had some females take the exam the percentage female ranged from 3.88% in Utah (4 out of 103) to 29% in Tennessee (73 out of 251). However, 30 of Tenn females can be attributed to a girls only school that offers AP CS A.
11 states had no Black students take the exam: Alaska (21 exam takers -4.3% Black by population), Idaho (47 - 0.9% Black), Kansas (47 - 6.2% Black), Maine (161 - 1.0%), Mississippi (1 - 37.3%), Montana (11 - 0.67%), Nebraska (46 - 4.5%), New Mexico (57 - 3%), North Dakota (9 - 1%), Utah (103 - 1.2%), and Wyoming (0 - 1.2%).
The following states had the most Black students taking the exam: 1) Maryland with 170 (10.43% of exam takers, but it is 29.4% Black), 2) Texas with 132 (3.3% of exam takers, but 11.9% in state), 3) Georgia with 129 (10.29% of exam takers, but 30% in state), 4) Florida with 83 (5.45% of exam takers but 15.9% of population) Virginia with 78 (4.7% of exam takers but 19.9% of pop), 6) California with 74 (1.49% but 6.7%), 7) New York with 68 (3.6%, but 15.2%), 8) New Jersey with 34 (2.1% but 14.5%) Mass with 34 (3.1% but 7%) and 10) North Carolina with 28 (5.0% but 21.6%). The pass rates for Black student in these states: Maryland 27.06%, Texas 48.48%, Georgia 21.7%, Florida 19.28%, Virginia 28.21%, California 56.76%, New York 33.82%, New Jersey 47.06%, Mass 38.24%, and North Carolina 21.43%.
The pass rate for Black students in states that had at least 5 Black students take the exam ranged from 19% (Florida) to 75% (Alabama) with 6 of 8 passing.
8 states had no Hispanic students take the exam: Alaska (21 exam takers), Idaho (47), Kansas (47), Mississippi (1), Montana (11), Nebraska (46), North Dakota (9), and Wyoming (0).
The following states had the most Hispanic students taking the exam: 1) Texas with 751 (18.8% of exam takers but it is 37.6% Hispanic), 2) California with 392 (7.89% of exam takers but it is 37.6% Hispanic), 3) Florida with 269 (17.68% of exam takers, but it is 22.5% Hispanic), 4) New York with 150 (8.07%, but 17.6% Hispanic), 5) Illinois with 142 (9.10% but 15.8% Hispanic), 6) New Jersey with 96 , 7) Virginia with 90, 8) Maryland with 88, 9) Georgia with 71, and 10) Mass with 56. In report the Hispanic numbers I cam combining the College Board categories of Mexican American, Other Hispanic, and Puerto Rican. The pass rates for Hispanic students in these states: Texas 44.47%, California 47.45%, Florida 44.61%, New York 35.33%, Illinois 39.44%, New Jersey 52.08%, Virginia 46.67%, Maryland 44.32%, Georgia 40.85%, and Mass 39.29%

France will start withdrawing its troops from Mali by April, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said Thursday.
"From April, we will start decreasing the number of troops engaged in Mali," Fabius told RTL radio.
However, "This does not mean that we will go overnight," they added.
The military campaign in the Ifoghas mountain range, the stronghold of Islamist fighters in northern Mali will end "within weeks," the French top diplomat said.
Asked if al-Qaeda main figures Abou Zeid and Mokhtar Belmokhtar were killed in fighting, the French minister said "many leaders were among the hundreds of terrorists who have been killed during the operation," without giving accurate details on their identities.
In a visit to Warsaw, French President Francois Hollande on Wednesday announced that terror chiefs died in northern Mali. But, they did not specify whether they were referring to the two commanders reported dead last week.
Since the start of the France-led military operation in Mali on Jan. 11, 4,000 French soldiers have been deployed in the former colony to oust al-Qaida-linked insurgents and to help restore the country's sovereignty.
So far, four French servicemen have been killed in Mali.
Pokémon Go is proving to be a popular-but-polarizing mobile game, pitting the “get off my lawners” against the “gotta catch 'em all” crowd.
The augmented-reality game sends players into the real world to search for the mythical digital pocket monsters known as Pokémon, who appear onscreen when users hold up their smartphones in various locations at various times of the day. The game was officially released Sunday in Canada, but was available for download via unofficial sources about a week ago.
READ MORE: 24-year-old quits job to play Pokémon Go full-time
The scavenger hunt-style game encourages users to walk or bike around, however not everyone is embracing the spirit of the game or respecting the neighbourhoods where they are searching for Pokémon.
On Sunday night, dozens of people flocked to the Village of Griesbach in north Edmonton.
Steven Williams said their front yard has become part of the virtual scavenger hunt, which means unwanted garbage and unwelcome visitors.
“Respect the area,” they asked players. “Enjoy the community. If we can't relocate these Pokeman, at least pick up after yourself, don't go yelling at three in the morning, waking people up, and be respectful, that's all.”
He's concerned that Patricia Park – where there are memorials to the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry – has become a hot spot for Pokémon hunting in Edmonton.
“It's a beautiful area,” Williams said. “By all means, come here, walk around, check it out, but at the same time, simply respect people's private property and the memorials that are around here for fallen soldiers.
“I'm not even in the PPCLI – I'm a serving member in the military. I'm in the Signal Corps – but I just find this very disrespectful.”

“I play myself, but this is a little bit ridiculous – taking residential parking so you are able to play your game,” said a local player as they recorded video of streets crowded with vehicles around 9:30 p.m.
“It's disrespectful to the neighbourhood that you guys are playing in. So the most respectful things to do, at this point, here in this area, is possibly walk, take the bus, even bike ride out here kind of like how Pokémon Go wants you to actually go out and exercise.”
However, some residents praise the interactive nature of the game, which saw dozens of people gather at Patricia Park.
“It's the best spot because people put down lures,” 11-year-old Aiden Buffitt explained. “Lures attract Pokémon to come to that spot and there's three Pokestops that you can get resources from.”
Buffitt agrees the company should be careful about where they put Pokémon, but thinks the venue of Patricia Park could be educational.
WATCH: The Baltimore Police Department released video of a car crash that was the result of the driver being distracted while playing Pokémon Go.
“The Pokestops are actual little signs, plaques of soldiers, so you can go there and get stuff and you might even learn something about them from reading on it.”
“It's a lot of fun and it gets you outdoors a lot,” 12-year-old Ryan March said. “It's a great way to interact with other people,” added their friend, 11-year-old Ciaran Cray. “It gets you out and connecting.”
“This is what Pokémon Go is doing … people are outside talking to each other and engaging face to face,” Mike Scott posted on Facebook.
Scott said they like how the game requires players to travel a certain distance before they can unlock extra content.

The app has prompted some angry responses, including in Vancouver, where a man posted a sign which begins with “GET A LIFE AND STAY OUT OF MY YARD.”
“This whole Pokémon hunt is by far the stupidest thing I have ever seen,” says the note, which was first tweeted by local radio station 102.7 The PEAK, and has since gone viral.
The man then lists other things they have lived through, including Hammer Pants, Crystal Pepsi, “people taking Jean Chrétien seriously,” and the entire 10-season duration of CSI: Miami.

Police forces across Canada have also issued warnings of the risks involved in playing the game, such as stepping into traffic without looking up from the screen, or even trying to play while driving.
“Please do not look for #Pokémon while driving. If you've gotta catch 'em all, do so safely. #DontCatchAndDrive,” tweeted Edmonton police.

Report Copyright Violation Re: I talked to Stephen Paddock Ben Fulford has something today that should not be ignored
A lot of people don't like Fulford, and a lot of people do. I think their latest is likely to be a real heads up:
"Suddenly all sorts of people who dropped contact after the March 11, 2011 Fukushima terror attack are trying to contact the White Dragon Society (WDS) through this writer. These include a top Yakuza assassin, a senior MI6 operative, an NSA representative, a representative from a new CIA faction, and others. They, together with our regular contacts, all agree that something big is coming"
My comment: I saw rumors early on, (the night of the Las Vegas attack but never afterward) that there was supposed to have been a nuclear weapon set off in Vegas, but that the CIA thwarted it so a back up plan - the shootings - was executed instead. I was skeptical about this and did not mention it before. But now that things are settling down I might as well mention that was being said.
I think Ben's warning is legit. I hope it was just belated warning about the Vegas attack, and possibly snubbed nuke attack but I will say this, seriously:
I firmly believe, beyond all doubt, that if a nuclear attack was going to happen on American soil, the DHS, CIA, NSA and FBI would, rather than try to stop it, they would try to make it happen. Their job would be to locate and kill anyone that might stop it from happening.
Possibly a nuclear attack was thwarted. I'd say in the 10 percent possibility range. I don't take the rumor seriously. But I assure you - If an attack was thwarted, it sure as HELL did not get stopped by the CIA. That's the least believable part of that rumor.
One reader sent a question about whether or not I thought the "mysterious surveillance towers" going up in New York at the entrances to tunnels and bridges could be concealed Magna BSP owl cameras for a nuclear blackmail threat.
That got me curious and I did some "to scale" comparisons. Answer: As big as the towers are, they are not bulky enough to hold one of Magna BSP's owl nuke cameras. SO SECOND QUESTION: Are they big enough to hide a more efficiently made nuke? Answer: YES, beyond absolutely. I find it odd that the authorities are so hush hush about what the towers really are. When it comes to things like this, silence is not golden. Ben Fulford has something today that should not be ignoredA lot of people don't like Fulford, and a lot of people do. I think their latest is likely to be a real heads up:"Suddenly all sorts of people who dropped contact after the March 11, 2011 Fukushima terror attack are trying to contact the White Dragon Society (WDS) through this writer. These include a top Yakuza assassin, a senior MI6 operative, an NSA representative, a representative from a new CIA faction, and others. They, together with our regular contacts, all agree that something big is coming"My comment: I saw rumors early on, (the night of the Las Vegas attack but never afterward) that there was supposed to have been a nuclear weapon set off in Vegas, but that the CIA thwarted it so a back up plan - the shootings - was executed instead. I was skeptical about this and did not mention it before. But now that things are settling down I might as well mention that was being said.I think Ben's warning is legit. I hope it was just belated warning about the Vegas attack, and possibly snubbed nuke attack but I will say this, seriously:I firmly believe, beyond all doubt, that if a nuclear attack was going to happen on American soil, the DHS, CIA, NSA and FBI would, rather than try to stop it, they would try to make it happen. Their job would be to locate and kill anyone that might stop it from happening.Possibly a nuclear attack was thwarted. I'd say in the 10 percent possibility range. I don't take the rumor seriously.

One of the major influences on Rule 34 was a throwaway idea I borrowed from Vernor Vinge — that perhaps one of the limiting factors on the survival of technological society is the development of tools of ubiquitous law enforcement, such that all laws can be enforced — or infringements detected — mechanistically.
One of the unacknowledged problems of the 21st century is the explosion in new laws.
We live in a complex society, and complex societies need complex behavioural rules if they're to run safely. Some of these rules need to be made explicit, because not everyone can be relied on to analyse a situation and do the right thing. To take a trivial example: we now need laws against using a mobile phone or texting while driving, because not everyone realises that this behaviour is dangerous, and earlier iterations of our code for operating vehicles safely were written before we had mobile phones. So the complexity of our legal code grows over time.
The trouble is, it now seems to be growing out of control.
In the period 1997-2010, in the UK, Parliament created an average of one new criminal offence for every day the House of Commons was in session. I asked a couple of legal experts how many actual chargeable offences there were in the English legal system; they couldn't give an exact answer but suggested somewhere in the range 5,000-20,000. The situation in the USA is much, much worse, with different state and federal legal systems and combinations of felonies; the true number of chargeable felonies may be over a million, and this situation is augmented by a tax code so large that no single human being can be familiar with all of it (but failure to comply is of course illegal).
Now, most of the time most of these laws don't affect most of us. But there's a key principle of law, that ignorance is no defence: I'm willing to bet that most human beings are guilty of one or more crimes, be it smoking a joint or speeding or forgetting to declare earnings or failing to file the paperwork for some sort of permit we don't even know exists. We are all potentially criminals.
Meanwhile we have a rapidly growing surveillance state. And we have a legal system rooted in history, which has grown up around the theory that human beings possess free will, that they commit crimes out of malice, and that the threat or actual delivery of punishment is necessary to keep them in line. And all of these assumptions are invalid to a greater or lesser degree, if what behavioural psychology teaches us is correct. Human beings act on impulse, frequently unconsciously, frequently against their own best interest: the distant threat of punishment is not an effective deterrent: and judicial punishment doesn't change behavioural patterns reliably or efficiently.
How do you run a complex society that relies on most people staying within agreed behavioural limits most of the time, if your legal system is not merely broken but *can't be fixed* because it's based on false assumptions?
Rule 34 gives the reader a whiplash tour of the shape of crimes to come, as seen by the criminals who're trying to make a quick euro, and the confused and over-worked cops who're trying to figure out what, if anything, to charge them with. But lurking behind the action there are some difficult questions: in particular, is it possible to have a crime if there's no human perpetrator …?
Nicholas Merrill, the owner of a small internet service provider sent a National Security Letter in 2004, has had a gag order against them fully lifted, following a drawn-out legal battle with the feds.
The government has 90 days to appeal
A National Security Letter, or NSL, demands information from the recipient and often bars them from speaking about or acknowledging the letter. After receiving an NSL from the FBI in 2004, Merrill challenged the order, refusing to comply with the request for information and arguing against the gag order.
Although the demand for information was eventually dropped, Merrill continued to fight the gag order. In 2010, a court ruled that they could reveal that they had received the order, but did not fully lift the gag. In a ruling yesterday, a US District Court judge sided with Merrill, fully lifting the order and allowing them to discuss the NSL, the first time since the Patriot At was passed that such an order has been fully lifted.
"Judge Marrero's decision vindicates the public's right to know how the FBI uses warrantless surveillance to peer into our digital lives," Merrill said in a statement. "I hope today's victory will finally allow Americans to engage in an informed debate about proper the scope of the government's warrantless surveillance powers."
Merrill won't be able to talk about the order just yet — the government has 90 days to appeal, after which Merrill will be free to openly discuss the NSL.
On December 11, 2013, Canada Post announced large rate hikes and sweeping changes to public postal service, including a decision to take away home mail delivery and force 5 million households to use community mailboxes (CMBs).
A year later, CUPW members in locations that have lost delivery are going door-to-door to tell affected residents that the union intends to:
Preserve home mail delivery for those who have it.
Restore home mail delivery for those who have lost it.
Expand home mail delivery in areas that already have community mailboxes, as Canada Post's finances allow. CUPW is distributing a flyer with the above messages.
The flyer also encourages affected households to let the CUPW know what their complaints are so that the union can help them raise their issues with Canada Post and the federal government. It also reminds people that the federal Conservatives support the home delivery cuts and that there is a federal election coming. CUPW will be asking opposition parties to restore home mail delivery in the upcoming election.
In solidarity,
AUSTIN — Some of the Longhorns' and Aggies' biggest fans teamed up at the Capitol on Tuesday, making a play for new buildings and research incentive funding for the two top-tier state universities.
But the game plan, presented by the 150 alumni and students from the University of Texas and Texas A&M University, may not match the legislative competition that will impose massive cuts to higher education. Lawmakers are focusing on how many students can get into college and how many earn degrees, rather than new capital projects.
The bitter football foes took the field together at “Orange and Maroon Legislative Day,” sponsored by the universities' alumni associations. While clashing in their orange and maroon clothing, the rivals realized they had more in common than they would normally like to admit.
“There are a lot more ‘Howdys' and ‘Whoops' than I am used to,” said UT junior Jordan Humphreys. “It's interesting to see us interacting outside the football game and rivalry situations.”
A&M and UT leaders briefed the volunteers on an initiative to approve tuition revenue bonds for two “critical” buildings on the campuses. A&M officials would like a veterinary medicine and biomedical science building. UT leaders asked for bonds to build a new engineering and research center.
They also sought proportionate appropriations and funding for the Competitive Knowledge Fund, which provides incentives for external research grants. The fund provides a dollar of state support for every $10 in external research grants.
In Senate Finance Committee hearings with higher education officials in the last two weeks, lawmakers asked pointed questions and expressed sentiments that universities needed to be more cost-efficient, while improving completion rates and diversity on campus.
A&M alumnus Paul Stafford, who drove from Dallas to talk to their representatives, wearing a maroon tie and their 1990 class ring, said there may be a perception that UT and A&M have enough money in the budget without help from the state, so higher education can be a target for cuts.
“They aren't doing us any favors cutting higher education disproportionately,” Stafford said. “There might be more focus on other constituencies, like social services and public schools, and sometimes higher education groups are ignored.”

Do you send a thank-you letter by mail after receiving a donation online?
Donors who give online (and there are more of them all the time), do get an emailed thank you. Your online donation system should generate one on the spot.
But, here's the catch. That emailed thank you just isn't enough. You need to also mail a thank-you letter to make your donor feel appreciated.
Making a Memory
Ludis Herrera, Manager of Development Operations at Boston Medical Center, in a discussion on LinkedIn said,
"At BMC, we have a generic email sent out to our donors immediately after an online donation is made (this would be the receipt). This way our donors feel secure that their donation went through the website. However, we do send a paper acknowledgment as well in the mail to show our thanks and to make it more personable....Other organizations might see this as a waste of paper, but our donors appreciate it."
Snail mail is often maligned, but who doesn't look forward to going to the mailbox? Lots of donors save their thank-you letters, put them on the fridge or pin them to bulletin boards. A mailed letter "sticks" in a way that an emailed thank you just doesn't. This is especially true for first-time givers.
And guess who is giving online? First-time donors. A Blackbaud study of multi-channel fundraising found that new donors often make their first gift online. Unfortunately, these donors have the highest attrition rates. They don't come back.
But, what do donors who give just one more time do? They become committed donors, volunteers, or monthly givers.
Thanking a donor, by mail, is your best shot at making this conversion.
When Is the Donation Large Enough?
Can't afford this much thanking right off the bat? Then consider giving the royal treatment to those who give more than the minimum. But keep the threshold pretty low. You just never know when a small donor will turn out to be your next major donor.
A Mailed Thank You Is Just Another Channel in Your Campaign
Multichannel fundraising is a hot topic, though no one talks about multichannel thanking. Consider thanking by snail mail just another channel for your campaign. Many people who receive your direct mail appeal likely respond by going to your website and donating. It's a matter of convenience, not dislike of the mail.
Are you thanking your online donors with a mailed thank you in addition to the online one? If not, consider doing it. I give small amounts to many charities as part of my research on fundraising best practices. When I give online, sometimes I get a mailed thank you but often not. Plus, all too often, that mailed thank-you come after a long wait.
But when I get a mailed thank you on time and that stars me, the donor, I'm thrilled. See an example of one such thank you on the next page.
Evan Rachel Wood doesn't have a lot of time on their hands, what with playing both robot Dolores and robot-who-doesn't-think-she's-a-robot Dolores on HBO's Westworld — and, this season, it seems from that killer season-two teaser trailer, woke-robot Dolores. So it says a lot that, on hiatus, they starred in a gritty independent psychological thriller, A Worthy Companion, from two Montreal fine-art photographers (and brothers), Carlos and Jason Sanchez, first-time movie directors. The film, which debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival, follows Wood as Laura, a 30-year-old fuckup working for their father's (Denis O'Hare) cleaning company, as they strike up an ill-advised and increasingly disturbing relationship with Ava (Julia Sarah Stone), the 16-year-old daughter of one of their cleaning clients. It's a wrenching and often unlikable part that delves deep into the complex of the cycles of abuse, and how the familiar path for those in pain is to perpetuate more pain. Wood's is a barn-burner performance, but even the Sanchez brothers are shocked they said yes pretty much right after reading the script, and met up with them to talk it over the day after Westworld premiered.
“We were flattered because they told us they aren't going to make another film that year,” Carlos told me. They'd seen them in 13 and The Wrestler, but Jason says the Westworld trailer is really what convinced them to cast her, because it was impressive watching them switch between their robot and human characters — which is what Laura is often doing in their manipulations as they switch from tender to enraged and back again. Wood brought so much authentic pain to the part that the Sanchez brothers rewrote the ending because they felt the original one didn't do justice to the character she'd been building. “We were super stoked to work with her,” said Jason, “but what we got from them was just fucking mind-blowing.”
We spoke to Wood — who looked amazing in a bright-orange Altuzarra coat and sparkling Louboutin booties — about diving into this movie, what to expect from “woke Dolores” in season two, and how freaked out they were for their Westworld finale moment with Sir Anthony Hopkins.
So, the opening scene of this movie is insane. This guy walks into your apartment, blindfolds himself, and then you get so rough and violent with them during sex that they throw you off them and runs away. I was like, “What is happening?”
I know. [Laughs.] We don't waste any time. One of the things I loved about the script is that this was the first scene, because I read it for the first time and went, “What is it?” But also, I thought, “Good for you! You're holding nothing back!” I thought it was a great way to tell the story — usually it builds and you're like, “Who's good? Who's bad? What's going on?” but here, right away, you see the darkest side of this girl. And then the whole first half is just this crazy tension because you know already what's lurking under there. I thought it heightened everything really well.
Why do you think they need the guys they have sex with to have blindfolds on?
Who knows? She's got a lot going on in there, a lot of mental disturbances. I'm assuming she's gay and was abused at a very young age. Those two are not connected in any way, but if they have issues with men, and if they have issues with their own sexuality and shame and whatever she's dealing with, when you're traumatized that young, it manifests in ways that don't make a lot of sense until it goes to the source. It manifests in everyone a little differently, and I think that's just them thing.
The main relationship of the movie, this 30-year-old woman with a 16 year-old girl, will be pretty controversial for audiences.
It definitely is. Another thing I love about the script is that my part was originally written for a man and then they gender-swapped it, which is so cool because it brings so many different layers to that character and to the relationship. I love that it is two women, but it's never really talked about or touched upon. It's not what the movie's about. It's about a woman and a younger girl, but it's really about abuse, the cycles of it, the psychology of it, codependency. When I saw it, I wasn't even phased by it. There was so much other stuff going on.
And the Sanchez brothers told me it's the only movie you shot last year?
Yes. And I didn't want to do anything. I'd just done Westworld and I was like, “I'm taking a break,” but then I read the script and was like, “Dammit, I have to do this. And it's going to be hard, and I'm not going to like doing it.” But I hadn't read a script like that. Somebody compared it to Big Little Lies and how it really showed the whole picture, not excusing the perpetrator but humanizing them, giving you insight into what was going on and how they got to that point. It excited me because it wasn't black and white: Here's the victim, here's the abuser, let's focus on the victim the whole time. No. It's a more in-depth look in how we get to this point, and how does the abused become the abuser?
There's not really a good or bad guy; abuse is a well-rounded tragedy for everyone because normally, when people are doing that, it's because they've been broken at a very young age. So it's just as tragic watching somebody be prisoner to their own trauma, not in control of what they're doing because their perspective is so skewed. I'm not excusing what they do in any way, and it was important to me that we didn't let them completely off the hook. But I definitely think it'll spark more conversations about it for sure.
You really lay everything out on the screen. Were you okay at the end of every day?
Yeah, but I needed a month afterwards, because I was messed up a little bit after that movie. I need to rest and go to my house in Tennessee and just … don't think about bad things. It took some recalibrating.
Weren't you supposed to do a different movie this year, your own directorial debut? It's a road-trip movie you wrote, right?
I cowrote it. But I had to push it because it got too stacked up against the Westworld schedule, and I want to do it right, so I pushed it.
But it is going to happen?
Yes, after season two.
With the same cast of Jenny Slate, Alison Pill, and Cynthia Erivo?
Yes, as of now.
That's great, because it's such a good cast.
The best cast.
Jenny spilled the beans, didn't she?
They did! I was like, “Don't worry about it.”
I felt bad, I love Jenny and I actually wrote the article where they said it, and as soon as people started picking it up as a big news item, I was like, “Oh no.”
I know! [Laughs.] They texted me right after like, “I think I did a bad thing.” I was like, “No, it's fine. It's fine.” She's great. I just saw their new movie, Landline, and she's so incredible.
I was nervous about asking you!
No, it's fine. I'm not nervous about it in any way.
Okay, good, so this is the part where I deluge you with Westworld questions. Where are you at in the filming of season two?
We're at the halfway point.
Obviously feel free to stop me if I run into something you can't say.
I mean, there are so many things I can't say! [Laughs.]
Where are you filming?
Santa Clarita and Utah. Same as season one.
Can you give me one free-and-clear clue about season two?
It's twice as ambitious. I'll try to say the things the showrunners have said, so I know it's okay. I think somebody asked Jonathan Nolan if we were going to see other worlds this season, or how many worlds we would see, and they said, “More than one?” So there's that little tidbit. [Laughs.]
Can you talk about how Dolores has evolved? The last time we see her, they are unhinged.
I think we're going to see a new, woke Dolores. We're going to get to see what that looks like and how it plays out.
Like woke as in Westworld woke, not as in politically correct woke, right?
Dolores woke! It's fun! [Laughs.]
In the trailer we see them riding that horse and shooting guns like a fucking champ.
She's a very different, different character — with still the essence of who they are, but awake.
What is your favorite part about playing woke Dolores in season two?
The show is always a surprise. We don't get to know exactly what happens, so we're finding out along with the audience, and it's just a ride. You have enough info to do your job, but you never know what's going to happen next. It's constantly exciting, it's never boring, and it's extremely difficult because it's a very complex, challenging, technical role. But because there are endless possibilities on the show. I feel like I could do it for ten years and it would be different every year. So I don't think I'll ever get bored.
I think in older interviews you said you figure out the season one twist pretty early on. How are you doing sussing out the season two twist?
I figured it out again!
Because you're a nerd!
Yeah, but it's a lot like last season — I figure it out, but they don't fill in the blanks for me. Usually I'm like, “Okay, I think I have an idea of where this is going,” and then the payoff is always so incredible, so much bigger than I could ever imagine. I think the same goes for the audience — you're supposed to figure out the show, and even if you do, it's okay because the payoff will always be way more than you could ever dream up. So I did kind of talk to one of the showrunners and say, “Okay, tell me if I'm going in the right direction. Is it this?” and they said, “Stop bugging the writers room! Don't tell this to anyone!” I was like, “Okay! Okay!”
Did you learn any new skill sets that you could take out into the real world and be, like, a ninja? I mean, you already used shotguns and rode horses in season one.
Yes, but this is a whole other level. I mean, she's pretty awake! [Laughs.] I've maybe been learning a few things here and there that are fun. But it was crazy, when we shot the scene for Comic-Con, Jonah came up to me and said, “How would you feel about riding a horse with no hands at full speed shooting a rifle?” I said, “I mean, I can do it …”
You already knew you could!
No! I'd never done it! But I've ridden before, and I've ridden bareback, and when you ride, you're already riding no hands anyway, but this is — it was a whole other level! I remember just kind of staying calm all day, and when it was over and we did it I was like, “Great, I'm going to go have a panic attack and get on my knees and thank God I'm still here!” But they're so safe on that show, the wranglers are incredible and the horses so well-trained that it was one of the cooler things I've gotten to do in my life. So much fun. And not fake. [Laughs.]
It's funny when you talk about how much more ambitious it is. They had to halt filming in the season one to rewrite scripts. So what does that mean, just on a practical standpoint, to make it more ambitious?
We're approaching it differently this year. They were writing while we were filming last time, and that was too complicated, so they have everything written. Season one, we were also shooting out of order, which is weird, but it was the first season, and it is an ambitious show, so we were all figuring out how it works. Now that we know how it works, we're all kind of surrendered to the experience — and to never really knowing what's going on.
You choose what you submit to the Emmys, right? What did you pick?
I submitted episode ten. You know, it all comes together for Dolores in that one.
And you knew they were going to do that?
No, not until I read it. I was absolutely shocked.
You were like, “Thank you!”
It was incredible! So well-written. Jonah directed the pilot and the last episode and they're stunning, but no, I had no idea.
What did Anthony Hopkins say to you after you shot them in the head?
I went up to them after I read it and said, “I'm so sorry, I have to kill you!” and they were like, “No, it's wonderful! It's such a beautiful piece of the story! It's great!” They were all for it, but it was one of the most nerve-racking experiences of my life, holding a gun to Anthony Hopkins's face. A real gun, not loaded! I was just like, “Ahhhhhh!!!!” [makes face of being excited and terrified and overjoyed all at the same time] “Ahhhhhhh!!!” I just kind of did one of these before every take.

What started with a message board post became a law student wearing an Ohio State sweatshirt in protest:
This and all following photos: Ace Anbender/MGoBlog
While at first it appeared the media members would outnumber the protestors, that changed in a hurry, with the assembled crowd alternating chants of "Fire Brandon," "We Want Harbaugh," and "Down With Dave."
A little while in, a small group chanted "Schlissel's House!" Lo and behold, a few minutes later, the protest had moved to the university president's front lawn:
“I'm proud of our history. I'm not proud of Dave Brandon being a part of that history.”
The guy with the megaphone—I didn't catch who they are, but since they were interviewed by several media outlets, I'm sure it'll get out there—spoke for a while about their pride in the University's athletic history, their support of the students and athletes, and the failure of Dave Brandon to protect either. The rally ended with a mocking "Dave Sucks" chant and a rendition of The Victors. A certain blogger may or may not have been interviewed on live television.
The full set of photos from the rally is embedded below. I'd estimate the turnout ended up at somewhere around 400-500 people—not bad for something that started just hours earlier on a message board...
Awful news out of Spain where Kyle Kuric's professional squad has announced that they will have emergency surgery to remove a brain tumor.
Spanish team Gran Canaria announced that American player Kyle Kuric will have surgery to remove a brain tumor. The player will have surgery in the next few days. Our thoughts and prayers are with him. Good luck, Kyle.
Meningiomas are a diverse set of tumors arising from the meninges, the membranous layers surrounding the central nervous system. They arise from the arachnoid "cap" cells of the arachnoid villi in the meninges. These tumors usually are benign in nature; however, a small percentage are malignant.
Kuric and their wife, Taraneh, welcomed twins into the world back in August.
We are with you Kyle ! You will be back Stronger ! @KingKK_14 @GranCanariaCB pic.twitter.com/XwhEdrkBZ5 — EuropeanBBallVideos (@EuroBBallVideos) November 3, 2015
Obviously our thoughts are with the Kuric family, and we will be passing along any updates when we get them.

Show Notes
Alice Dreger is an historian of medicine and science, a sex researcher, and an advocate of academic freedom.  They are the author of Galileo's Middle Finger: Heretics, Activists, and One Scholar's Search for Justice. In this episode, I talk to them about why they blame university brand management, and the corporatization of academia more broadly, for the policing of research, which has now become common in academic life. We talk about how the increasing reliance on external research funding has spurred attention to university brand management, and Alice also presents their recommendations for what to do if you are caught up in an academic controversy.

Selected Quotes
1
“I went to my [Northwestern] university provost and said, ‘Admit that this was censorship and say that you won't do it again.' They would not do that. And It seemed that they were legitimately afraid at that point of the [university] hospital corporation, which I found deeply concerning. And that's why I finally did just resign. You can't have any integrity if you have a major book out on academic freedom telling people to stand up for their academic rights and you're allowing your university dean to tell you what you can and can't publish.”
2
“One thing I recommend to people, the minute they start to get into trouble with academic freedom, is that they contact FIRE because it's one of the few organizations out there that will defend you for free and will do so vigorously. And universities do care about their FIRE rating. They really do care about It. So it matters.”

I remember being fairly launched from my Mothers Code into the open arms of the welcoming miners that wanted to by my owners. Daddy developed me well and made sure I had plenty of nurses (pool owners), nurseries (pools), and cribs (wallets) available to ensure a smooth transitioning into this life as a cryptocurrency. 666,666 of us were being born every 90 seconds, after all!
But Daddy was tricky and opaque. They manipulated my Mother to acquire many of my kinin fact, 0.37% of all we will ever amount toat once before anyone else had the chance. This spoiled my birth a little for the miners but enough of them believed in my future to keep mining me for days. Things were starting to get better, until a man claiming to be my Real Daddy stormed onto the scene like a gun at a knife show. Apparently them and my Daddy had a run-in before I was born, but now my Real Daddy seemed really upset; They denounced their love for me and cursed my very existence. They threatened my Daddy and all the nurses and miners who wanted me to stay alive. Something suddenly changed in my Daddy. Something deep. They dumped all of my kin into a toilet bowl. This made many of the other miners dump theirs (like sheep) too. Our Daddy no longer loved us, and our Real Daddy never did. Yet a few special miners still had unconditional hope in me.
Left for dead in a pissed-filled toilet bowl, theyd thrown all the rest of us in. Thus began our swirly descent down the pipes of waste and neglect. But let me tell you, these pipes didnt lead to caverns of sewage and rot- no! These pipes opened up to a delta of vast and wondrous seascapes. And accompanying us amid our altered course were the most magical and indescribable chain of events. In hindsight, these events were to rewrite our destiny. Maybe it was something obtuse. Maybe it was something invincable in the urine of the unbelievers that catalyzed strange yes exhilarating changes in our genetic identities. We were becoming a molecular firework display, riding a wave of biological whimsy to freedom. Once wed poured out into the calming expanse of seawater, wed finally caught the chance to examine ourselvesand wed become gayfish.
It made so much sense, and it all felt so right. But we still realized we belonged somewhere else, somewhere beyond this paradise for regular seacreatures. We must have seemed very anxious, because it was at that moment a lone Fishstick Seahorse appeared and drifted to my side. They leaned over and whispered into my ear hole,Indeed you are not regular seacreatures. Then they smiled and said, What you seek is Gayfish Gulf. Put me in your mouth and I will be your guiding beacon. Without hesitation I opened my mouth, and the Fishstick Seahorse saddled inside. Before I closed my seatbelt-mouth, I felt a peculiar urge to start swimming East (the opposite of West).
And so I did.
Newsflash: You can't kill a cryptocurrency. Especially the gay fish kind.Details:Screenshot update as of 3/12March 1:January 15:
A key political storyline of the past year has been the civil war between the Republican establishment and Tea Party grassroots conservatives. This battle is likely to intensify and play out on the national stage this year ahead of the 2014 elections.
One Republican Senate candidate, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, has proposed what is perhaps the most drastic anti-establishment idea to date: move our nation's capital from Washington D.C…. to Nebraska.
Sasse put out a 30-second local TV ad called “The Outsider” during football broadcasts over the weekend with that goal in mind. Here is the extended five-minute long cut:
“As someone who's not a career politician, I wanted to introduce myself to Nebraskans in a way that would explain what this campaign is about,” Sasse said in an exclusive statement to Breitbart News. “DC is a sick, dysfunctional place. I've seen it up close. We're going to lose our country if we don't act quickly.”
Sasse, a university president known as an expert on Obamacare and health policy, suggested that if you can't put enough Nebraska into Washingon, maybe it's time to move Washington to Nebraska.
Though they understand it's not a realistic goal to move our nation's capital to the Cornhusker State, the “thought experiment” is meant to represent the average American's frustration with Washington, regardless of which party is in power.
“I'm a Nebraska conservative who's focused on bringing Nebraska values and real solutions to Washington,” they told Breitbart News.
Ohio State University bans dorm window displays Copyright by WCMH - All rights reserved Video
COLUMBUS (WCMH) -- Over the past couple of years, Ohio State University students have used sticky notes and other materials to create messages and artwork on their dormitory windows.
But that has come to an end.
When students returned to campus this year, they learned the university has adopted a new rule banning all dorm window displays.
OSU student Nikhil Pramod said some of the window displays last year were not in good taste.
"I understand where the university is coming from like when you drive by on the street you saw some of these things that were inappropriate so for me it's not a big deal," Pramod said.

But for sophomore James Smith it is a really big deal. He's among a number of students hoping to see the policy reversed.
"While the university's intention is to eliminate what some would call hate speech from dorm room windows, this blanket ban on all displays is the wrong approach," Smith said.
Smith is openly violating the new policy with a sign in their window that argues their first amendment rights trump the university policy.
There are a handful of other windows with messages in them. But overall the windows are clear albeit far less interesting.
University spokesperson David Isaacs released the following statement:
"We annually review our Residence Hall Handbook. We have similar guidelines for Gateway, and we are rolling it out to other Columbus campus residence halls. We have also benchmarked other schools' guidelines and have found this to be a common approach to windows and window coverings. The university maintains the discretion and right to determine use of windows, walls, doors and other university spaces."
"Ohio State has a deep and abiding commitment to free speech. As with other rules and regulations that address university spaces, the rules within the Residential Living Handbook are consistent with the First Amendment."

Second year student Gabriella Seidler said the window displays were fun.
"I thought it added to the campus culture and I'm sad to see them go but maybe if students were more responsible about it," Seidler said.
Sophomore Emery D'Alesio from Broadview Heights said the window signs put smiles on faces and now, they say "it just looks dead."
"I guess it's hard to control that kind of stuff so I kind of understand why they did it (the ban) but I'm not a fan of the decision - not at all," D'Alesio said.

Garry Monk's summer Boro rebuild is under way with the double capture of Jonny Howson and Cyrus Christie.
The new Middlesbrough manager has spent in the region of £7m on the pair, who will fly to Portugal with the first team squad this weekend after wrapping up their moves.
Both Howson, who joins from Norwich City in a £5m switch, and Christie, who's moved north from Derby for a fee believed to be in the region of £2m-£2.5m underwent medicals at Rockliffe Park on Friday.
With Boro off the mark in the transfer window, Garry Monk will immediately turn their attention elsewhere as they look to bolster their attacking options as well as adding another goalkeeper to their squad.
The club is believed to have been in talks with Newcastle over the availability of Karl Darlow. Newcastle are said to be open to offers for the 26-year-old, though reports today claim a £5m bid has been rejected.

Newcastle are said to want to make a profit on the £4.2m they spent on Darlow from Nottingham Forest three years ago, though the keeper has already been told they won't be considered for the number one spot at St James' Park next season.
While Boro will continue their efforts to bolster the squad in the coming days and weeks, Monk will be delighted to have two new faces through the door ahead of next week's training camp in Portugal.
Howson, an all action midfielder, brings Championship experience which Boro are looking to add this summer, with the Teessiders beating their former side Leeds United to their signature.
The 29-year-old made more than 170 league appearances for Canaries following more than 200 games for their home club Leeds United.
The addition of Christie, meanwhile, ensures the competition Monk craved at right-back, with the Republic of Ireland international joining from Derby County, for whom he'd made more than 100 league appearances.
U.S. Sen. John Boozman, R-Ark., speaks in front of the Arkansas state Capitol in Little Rock, Ark., Tuesday, May 26, 2015. - Photo by AP / DANNY JOHNSTON
U.S. Sen. John Boozman on Thursday said they plan to host a telephone town hall with Arkansans to discuss topics up for debate in the nation's capital.
The event's scheduling comes a day after their Republican colleague from Arkansas, U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton, met with a heated crowd in the state's northwest.
More than 2,000 constituents, many of whom were opponents of President Donald Trump, packed the Springdale Performing Arts Center and questioned the senator on a number of issues, booing when dissatisfied with their responses.
The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported that hundreds more stood outside the building when the fire marshal determined that the high school theater was at capacity.
Boozman's telephone town hall is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Monday. Arkansans interested in participating in the conversation must sign up to be dialed in to the call.
“Telephone town halls allow me to connect with Arkansans all over the state and discuss topics important to them,” Boozman said in a statement. “I look forward to the conversation.
Additional information regarding the event can be found by visiting the senator's website.
POCATELLO, Idaho (AP) - U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho says he's voting for Donald Trump after earlier this month rescinding their endorsement.
Crapo in a statement released Monday says they will vote for Trump to keep Hillary Clinton from becoming president.
Earlier this month Crapo pulled their endorsement after a video tape surfaced of Trump making vulgar and sexually charged comments about women.

Crapo said at the time he'd spent more than 20 years working on domestic violence protections and Trump's excuse of locker room talk was unacceptable.
They urged Trump to step aside and let their running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, take their place.
But that hasn't happened, and Crapo says the next president needs to appoint Supreme Court justices who will interpret the Constitution as written.

Oscar was a tiny kitten when staff at Steere House, a nursing home in Rhode Island, took them in. However, they didn't know that they had an amazing ability.
They can predict when someone is about to die.
The staff first realized this as they noticed Oscar spending time with patients in the advanced dementia unit as they were becoming terminal. When a patient is close to death, the cat will jump up on the bed, sniff out the patient, curl up next to them or her, and purr. If they are kept outside of the patient's door, they will scratch on the door in an attempt to get in.
One of the first incidents was that of a woman who had a blood clot in their leg. Oscar wrapped their body around their leg, which was very cold, and stayed by their side until they died.
Oscar is even able to predict when a patient is about the die more accurately than the nurses, as they found out when they placed them beside a resident they thought was close to death. Instead, though, they jumped off the bed and went to sit beside a patient in another room. It turned out the patient they chose to sit next to died that evening, while the other lived for another few days.
Margie Scherk, president of the American Association of Feline Practitioners and a veterinarian in Vancouver, British Columbia, says that it is very possible that they are able to smell some type of chemical that is released just before death. Daniel Estep, a certified applied animal behaviorist in Littleton, Colo, offers another explanation of the cat's mysterious behavior. They claim that Oscar may be predicting the residents' deaths not as a result of smells, but simply because of the patient's lack of movement.
Either way, Oscar is able to provide comfort to both the patient and the family, as their actions help alert the nursing home's staff to inform the patients' family members when they are about to die so that they have enough time to say goodbye.
Colombo: A major incident was averted after alert crew aboard a SriLankan Airlines flight carrying over 200 passengers from Kochi to Colombo extinguished a mid-flight fire triggered by a lithium battery pack, the airlines said on Monday.
Shortly after the meal service on the 70-minute flight, the cabin crew members noticed smoke emanating from an overhead luggage bin.
"Crew members aboard flight UL 166 managed to avert a major incident that is believed to have been caused by the ignition of a lithium battery pack or mobile phones in a passengers hand luggage," the airlines said in a statement.
None of the 202 passengers or any of the crew suffered any injuries and the Airbus A330-200 aircraft landed safely at Colombo's Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) at the scheduled time, the statement said.
The flight crew immediately informed air traffic controllers at BIA and the aircraft was met on arrival by dangerous goods experts, firefighters and other safety related personnel. Since the situation was under control, passengers did not require emergency evacuation and disembarked in the usual manner, it said.
SriLankan Airlines has launched an investigation into the incident.
In October 2016, the airlines imposed a total ban on the carriage and usage of 'Samsung Note 7' on board its aircraft.

Are You A Wine Lover? Then Call Your House Representative. Now.
I've been known to spout an opinion now and again about the Three Tier alcohol distribution system in this country, and the maddening array of ridiculous regulations that govern our ability to purchase alcohol. Mostly, however, I stay out of the fray because I'd rather write about, and I'm sure you'd rather read about, fantastic wines.
But something happened yesterday that sent chills down my spine, and made it imperative that I broadcast to as many of you as possible the urgent need to call your Congressional Representative immediately. When you get one of their aides on the phone here's what you need to say:
Under no circumstances should they vote for a house bill HR 5034: The Comprehensive Alcohol Regulatory Effectiveness Act of 2010.
This bill, introduced by representatives Bill Delahunt (D Mass) Mike Quigley (D Ill.), Howard Coble (RN. C.) and Jason Chaffetz (R Utah), was purportedly authored by the National Beer Wholesalers Association.
This bill, which you can read in its entire three short pages, is available here (PDF).
The bill is insidious in its simplicity. It would make it effectively impossible to challenge any state's laws about alcohol distribution or direct shipping by forcing the challenger to prove that any particular law "has no effect on the promotion of temperance, the establishment or maintenance of orderly alcoholic beverage markets, the collection of alcoholic beverage taxes, the structure of the state alcoholic beverage distribution system, or the restriction of access to alcoholic beverages by those under the legal drinking age.''
In other words, as long as any state can prove that its laws produce tax revenues or prevent children from buying alcohol, those laws, no matter how discriminatory, anti-competitive, or anti-consumer cannot be overturned by a legal challenge by any party or any act of Congress.
Under their usual guise of trying to "protect the children" from an "epidemic of alcoholism" the liquor wholesalers lobby has introduced a bill that effectively keeps the alcohol laws of this country an affair to be settled by state legislators and their wholesaler lobbyist friends.
This bill must be stopped. It effectively prevents any progress towards fixing the antiquated and consumer unfriendly alcohol shipping laws in this country.
Please call, write, e-mail, and otherwise hound your Congressional Representative and tell them to vote against this bill. Here's the easiest way to find, and contact your congressperson.
This is serious business. If this bill passes, consumers will have lost the ability to fight in the courts for laws that allow them to buy the wine they want, where they want.

The wheel has turned full circle for Wayne Rooney. They once doubted whether Manchester United were good enough for them - now the question is whether they are good enough for Manchester United.
It was in October 2010 that Rooney left United manager Sir Alex Ferguson "dumbfounded" by announcing they wanted to leave Old Trafford, suggesting fears about the strength of the squad and the club's ability to attract world-class players were at the heart of their decision.
Rooney will have been equally dumbstruck when Ferguson revealed at a squad meeting ahead of the Champions League defeat against Real Madrid that they were surplus to Tuesday's requirements.
Adding irony to Rooney's injury is that it was the arrival of the sort of world-class player they craved, in the shape of Robin van Persie, that will have made Ferguson feel more comfortable in pushing the England striker to the margins.
Media playback is not supported on this device Football Focus Big Interview - Wayne Rooney
Ferguson hinted at fitness issues amid ongoing concerns about Rooney's condition. It was a subtle reference but not necessarily a flattering one.
United were also playing to a tactical framework that the Scot felt would be more suited to Danny Welbeck - a plan, it should be stressed, that was working perfectly until Nani's 56th-minute red card unnerved and unsettled United to such a degree that Real were able to turn the game around.
This, in itself, poses serious questions about Rooney's status and their future at Old Trafford.
It was not so long ago that the idea of Rooney being left out for one of United's biggest games for years would have been unthinkable, irrespective of any questions about their fitness or any gameplan Ferguson was planning to employ.
Rooney was also fit enough to make an outstanding contribution to United's 4-0 win against Norwich City just days before they were a substitute against Real Madrid, scoring a brilliant goal and setting up others for Shinji Kagawa.
At one time, they were as close to indispensable as it was possible to be at Old Trafford. Not any more, after Ferguson's decision to drop them from a game of such scale as one against Real Madrid.
Rooney stats 2012-13 Games: 26 Goals: 12 Assists: 12 2011-12 Games: 38 Goals: 29 Assists: 4 2010-11 Games: 37 Goals: 15 Assists: 13 2009-10 Games: 39 Goals: 31 Assists: 5 2008-09 Games: 43 Goals: 16 Assists: 10 2007-08 Games: 38 Goals: 15 Assists: 10 2006-07 Games: 47 Goals: 18 Assists: 11 2005-06 Games: 40 Goals: 16 Assists: 9 2004-05 Games: 35 Goals: 14 Assists: 3
The question now is whether Ferguson, as they have done before, is preparing the ground to dispense with Rooney on a permanent basis.
A measure of perspective is required. Rooney may not be the player many thought they would become when their career was in its electrifying infancy with Everton, Manchester United and England but they are still a formidable talent capable of moments of game-changing brilliance.
Not the force they could have become perhaps - but no busted flush either.
The statistics still stack up for Rooney. They have scored 12 goals in 26 games this season and added 12 assists. According to statisticians Opta, their scoring and assist rate of 0.92 per Premier League/Champions League game is equal to their best.
Their overall tally since moving to Old Trafford in 2004 stands at 166 goals in 343 games, while they have scored 33 times in 79 England internationals.
This is why any decision to sell Rooney will be taken only after careful contemplation, but the signs are ominous for those, probably including the player himself, hoping they will have a long-term future with United.
Ferguson has history for using exclusion from a showpiece game as the final warning signal. As far back as dropping Jim Leighton, the trusted goalkeeper they brought from Aberdeen to Manchester United, from the 1990 FA Cup final replay against Crystal Palace through to David Beckham being left out of a Champions League game against Real Madrid in 2003 and onto Ruud van Nistelrooy being omitted for the 2006 League Cup final, a pattern emerges. Exclusion followed by departure.
And could it be that Ferguson's elephantine memory still recalls those uncertain days in 2010 when Rooney uttered the truth that dare not speak its name at Old Trafford, or to their manager, when they appeared to question the club's ambition and the quality of their colleagues?
All this could simply be building up to another bad day for Chelsea's interim manager Rafael Benitez in Sunday's FA Cup quarter-final, with the prospect of a wounded Rooney being released to work out their frustrations on Ferguson's old adversary.
But no-one should play down the significance of Rooney being sidelined for such a high-profile Champions League game.
Rooney is on a reported £250,000-a-week contract at United, awarded in the wake of their public insubordination in 2010 and is 28 in October. The £50m valuation talked about at that time can be halved now but might still be enough to tempt United to do a deal.
Ferguson has been linked with Borussia Dortmund's Robert Lewandowski, although Bayern Munich may have something to say about that, and they also have Van Persie, Javier Hernandez and Welbeck to call upon.
Further complications also lie along the road that may lead to Rooney's departure. The list of clubs they would regard as a comfortable fit for their talents is a very select one - and the number of clubs who feel they might actually wish to buy them may be even more select.
Paris Saint-Germain have been strongly linked with Rooney but would they want to play in the French league and would even their Qatari owners sanction such a high-finance deal in their current circumstances? They would want a rich return on this expensive investment as it would not be a short-term branding exercise such as the signing of David Beckham.
It is doubtful Manchester City or Rooney would pursue a move to Etihad Stadium, even though they expressed great interest when they were unsettled previously. It is hard to see Real or Barcelona showing any desire at all to do a deal, while the chaos of Chelsea makes this an unlikely destination.
Rooney's best option is Manchester United. Whether Manchester United regard Rooney as their best option any more is open to question - and it was an option Ferguson felt they were able to ignore against Real Madrid.
WASHINGTON -- On Tuesday morning, the Supreme Court will hear oral argument on whether corporations, like real people, can be held liable in American courts for international human rights violations.
The issue has divided four appeals courts over the past year and a half, as all but one Democrat-appointed judge has voted for corporate liability while all but one Republican-appointed judge has come down for corporate immunity.
If that pattern holds in the Supreme Court, then the five justices appointed by Republican presidents will surely be hit with more accusations of pro-business bias: Having all voted in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission to extend to corporations the First Amendment right of actual people to independently spend unlimited sums in this country's elections, they will in the current case have refused to hold corporations responsible, as real people are, for their roles in atrocities abroad.
That kind of application of corporate personhood would be enough to make a casual observer's head explode.
Legally, however, Tuesday's case, Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum, is totally unrelated to the Citizens United decision. What the Court decides, at least in theory, should have everything to do with how the justices approach international law.
In Kiobel, about a dozen Nigerians contend that Shell Oil's parent company aided and abetted their government in its torture and extrajudicial killing of environmental and human rights protesters resisting Shell's operations in Nigeria in the 1990s.
The plaintiffs brought their suit under a law, commonly called the Alien Tort Statute, passed by the first Congress in 1789 to allow foreign nationals to bring civil suits in federal courts "for a tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States." The Alien Tort Statute lay virtually dormant from its founding-era passage until the 1970s, when human rights groups representing victims of oppressive regimes began taking advantage of the law's broad language to haul the alleged foreign tormentors before U.S. judges.
The Supreme Court has weighed in only once on the meaning of the law, stepping into the fray in 2004 to declare that only international law offenses that are as "specific, universal and obligatory" as those that existed when the statute was written could give rise to a lawsuit under the statute. Torture and genocide triggered the Alien Tort Statute, the Court suggested; arbitrary arrest and detention did not.
The justices left unsettled what types of defendants -- individual, corporate, state -- can be sued. The text of the law is silent on that issue.
In deciding Kiobel in 2010, the majority in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit divined its answer by asking whether any international courts have held corporations liable for human rights violations. Finding no such examples, the majority threw out the case.
Three other appeals courts have since disagreed with the 2nd Circuit in methodology and result when hearing cases under the Alien Tort Statute against Firestone, Exxon and Rio Tinto. These courts found that the question of corporate liability is up to individual countries to determine and that the U.S. domestic law has long held corporations to account for the wrongs they commit.
The United States, for its part, submitted a brief to the Supreme Court supporting the Nigerian plaintiffs. "The text and history of the ATS provide no basis for distinguishing between natural and juridical persons," the brief says, referring to the distinction between human beings and "persons" created under law. "Corporations have been subject to suit for centuries, and the concept of corporate liability is a well-settled part of our 'legal culture.'"
The real trouble for the justices hearing Kiobel is that nothing is "well-settled" under the Alien Tort Statute. The methods used by the lower courts to come to their opposite conclusions were not much more than newly created paths custom-beaten to lead to their preferred result. Now there is a veritable parade of ideologically driven parties, from multinational corporations and human rights organizations to conservative and liberal legal academics, who have submitted friend-of-the-court briefs hoping to lure the justices toward their favored destinations.
In an ironic twist, the conservative justices, who loudly resist being influenced by foreign legal trends, can look to European interpretations of U.S. law as the best cover for now discovering corporate immunity from international human rights allegations. In briefs filed in support of Royal Dutch Petroleum, the United Kingdom and Netherlands governments wrote that they have long opposed "overly broad assertions of extraterritorial civil jurisdiction" based on foreigners' claims against foreign defendants for alleged activities in foreign countries. The German government took a similar stance. These positions arose out of all three nations' express preference for multilateral agreements to resolve such problems, rather than unilateral action by any one country's courts.
Bluntly relying on these kinds of policy preferences may be a better path for the Supreme Court than pretending to fashion a decision out of nonexistent precedents and ideologically rigged legal arguments. Doing so will not eliminate the accusations of pro-business bias, but it will deter the accusations of disingenuousness that still plague the Citizens United decision.
- A Bay area woman has been arrested after deputies say they were caught riding around a local Walmart on a motorized scooter, and using the store as their personal buffet.
The store's loss prevention officer told deputies they began watching the suspect, 20-year-old Josseleen Lopez, after they noticed their riding around the grocery section with a half-empty bottle of wine in the scooter's basket.
According to the officer, they watched Lopez eat bits of sushi, mini muffins and cinnamon rolls before they put their packages back on the store's shelves and moved on.
They then ate “the majority of rotisserie chicken” before authorities stepped in.
Lopez was arrested for stealing and later charged with possession of drug paraphernalia after deputies found three empty syringes in their bags, which they explained they used to shoot meth.
They were booked at the Citrus County Detention Facility, where deputies say they admitted that they knew what they were doing was wrong.
Sometimes, yes.
Sometimes when you are dying, it is a tremendous effort just to draw enough breath to keep your body supplied with oxygen. You are so tired and weary, you just want to stop trying and rest, for just a little while, and that can be the difference between living and dying.
To a degree yes. You can faint/pass out from blood pressure being too low to pump enough blood to the brain. Brain is thus starved of oxygen and glucose and brain function stops. In a movie if someone's been shot and lost blood volume, there is less blood to be pumped around the body, and lower blood pressure. The body produces hormones to squeeze blood vessels and more blood into the circulation and hormones to make the heart pump faster to circulate the blood quicker. Among these hormones is adrenaline. If you're awake and aware you're dying and in pain you're going to be pumping out far more adrenaline than if you're unconscious. So keeping someone awake may be beneficial (I'm not aware of any trials). We often put sick patients to sleep to put them on a ventilator and this sudden decrease of adrenaline (sympathetic drive) needs to be carefully managed with drugs and synthetic adrenaline or they can have a cardiac arrest. Ultimately keeping someone awake and producing lots of their own adrenaline will only compensate for so much blood loss before their compensatory mechanisms are overwhelmed.
Years ago, my dad was in a medically-induced coma for almost a month after having a heart attack (and various complications). They couldn't take them out of the coma without removing their breathing tube, and they couldn't remove the tube until they could breathe on their own.
They believe a coma fantasy was responsible for giving them the willpower to breathe deeply enough to have the tube taken out. In the fantasy, there was a child who needed to breathe deeply, and my dad decided to breathe deeply to inspire the child to do the same. For whatever reason, even though their own survival was really at stake, their mind chose to motivate them through empathy for this imaginary child.
I almost wonder if it was some kind of test, and if they had chosen not to help the child, they would have died. But my guess is that the mind sometimes tricks itself using whatever form of trickery happens to be effective, and my dad happens to be an empathetic person, so empathy was part of how their mind tricked him. The scenario is made for the person, in other words.
Imagine, doing basic menial tasks is like undergoing a triathlon. Very exhausting! Reading makes me dizzy as fuck. Taking care of my daughter, is very difficult(i love them very much, and i feel sorry for them for having me). Even lying on bed is tiring!
Now that i feel tired and feel like passing out. Two things will surely happen: it's either i panic attack. Or have a mild one, relax a bit, panic attack ultimately, then have a mild one throughout the day. When i panic attack, my heart rate and blood pressure increases, then sweats a bit(helps my heat exhaustion), still tired but still can move, tho i sincerely want to give-up and kill myself.
Sometimes i wonder if i just give in completely and avoid my panic attacks. Will i die? Be in coma? Or nothing will happen? I feel that wihout my daughter, my body could've given-up 3yrs ago already.
Having reached the 50,000-barrel threshold in just its fourth year of operation, Chicago's Revolution Brewing is preparing to dig deeper in its home market by expanding its production facility and tripling capacity.
Backed by bank and small business loans, the brewery has announced plans to install a 120-barrel brewhouse and several 800-barrel fermenters this summer — boosting capacity to 300,000 barrels — as the company expands into a neighboring space in its current building.
Revolution doesn't have any immediate plans to expand its distribution footprint with the added capacity. Instead, the brewery intends to deepen its roots at home in Illinois.
“Tell the distributors to stop calling for a little while,” brewery founder Josh Deth told Brewbound, half in jest. “We're going to use the capacity first to make more beer for the home market. I think there's a lot of opportunity still here.”
Revolution currently sells approximately 90 percent of its beer in the Chicago area, and has a small presence in Ohio. Despite growing fast as it has and having more scalable resources than most players in Chicago's craft market, the company has been faced with limitations on how its products are distributed throughout the marketplace, a problem the company seeks to solve through expansion.
“When you're at max capacity, you have to manage it and part of growing is a choice,” said Deth. “At some point, accounts start growing and you don't have capacity. That's the alternative, to start cutting off accounts on the fringes and support the existing accounts that are growing, and that's not something we wanted to do.”
Though the company's flagship Anti-Hero IPA has to date carried its water — the beer accounted for roughly 55 percent of overall production in 2014 — Revolution also now plans to add for the first time another hoppy, year-round offering to its canned lineup in Fist City, a pale ale.
Additionally, the company plans to build behind its Hero series, a rotating cast of brews meant to contrast with its dreadnought, Anti-Hero. To grow the series, Deth said, the plan is to land a Hero handle in a given bar and rotate the offering behind it six times throughout the year.
“We're looking for a lot of growth in that,” they added.
Looking forward, the company projects selling up to 80,000 barrels in 2015, which would represent 60 percent growth, though those projections may vary depending on who in the company you ask.
“We have a betting pool,” said Deth. “My wife, the CFO, is on the low end. Donn [Bichsel], the sales guy, is on the high end.”
A FREIGHT train, its dozen cars loaded with coal covered in a light dusting of snow, snaked through the narrow valley, sometimes following the two-lane highway and sometimes crossing it. The valley was silent and snowy, and though it was two days into 2012 it could easily have been 1982, 1942 or 1922: coal has been mined in Appalachia and carried out by rail for well over a century.
And by some measures, coal is still going strong. It provides more of America's electricity than any other fuel. Production has fallen off since 2008, but it remains high, as do prices, for which thank the developing world's appetite. In Appalachia, coal remains a source of well-paid jobs in a region that needs them: for the first three quarters of 2011 employment in the Appalachian coal industry was at its highest level since 1997. And the Powder River Basin, which spans Wyoming and Montana, has become America's major source of coal in the past decade, relieving overmined Kentucky and West Virginia. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) reckons America has enough coal to meet current demand levels for the next 200 years.

But if the raw numbers look good, the trends tell a different story. Regulatory uncertainty and the emergence of alternative fuel sources (natural gas and renewables) will probably make America's future far less coal-reliant than its past. In 2000 America got 52% of its electricity from coal; in 2010 that number was 45%. Robust as exports are, they account for less than one-tenth of American mined coal; exports cannot pick up the slack if America's taste for coal declines. Appalachian coal production peaked in the early 1990s; the EIA forecasts a decline for the next three years, followed by two decades of low-level stability. Increased employment and declining productivity suggest that Appalachian coal is getting harder to find.
Toughening regulation has an effect, too. Coal-fired power plants are the source of more than one-third of greenhouse-gas emissions in America. Last July the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a rule that requires 28 states to reduce the amount of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide they emit; in December came another, reducing the amount of mercury and other toxic air pollutants that power plants can puff out.
Many plants have already made the necessary upgrades and retrofits; around 53% of America's coal-fired capacity comes from units fitted with scrubbers. But others, particularly older plants, will have to decide whether such expensive upgrades are worth doing at all. Most of America's coal-fired capacity comes from plants at least 30 years old, and as much as 14% of existing coal-fired plants, accounting for 4% of America's generation capacity, will have to be retired in the next five to eight years. Energy providers face a stark choice. They can fight these regulations in court (outcome uncertain). They can retrofit old plants: plenty have done that, too. Or they can build new plants—in which case, far more are choosing plants that burn natural gas or use renewables rather than coal.
To some, regulations prove the current administration's hostility to coal. To others, however, they are a long-overdue attempt to gauge a putatively cheap fuel's true external costs. A National Academy of Sciences report estimated that the external costs unrelated to climate-change costs (to human health, crop and timber yields, building materials and recreation) of coal-fired power plants in 2005 totalled $62 billion. A study of coal's effects on Kentucky's budget in 2006 found that it contributed $528m in revenue, but its on-budget costs—training, support, repairs to the roads, R&D for the coal industry—totalled $643m. A study in West Virginia in 2009 also found the coal industry a net cost to the state.
Without alternatives, America might need to resign itself to these costs. But alternatives are there. As coal's share of America's electricity-generation market fell between 2000 and 2010, those of natural gas and renewables rose: gas from 16% to 24%, and renewables from 9% to 10%.
The EIA forecasts that America will still obtain 39% of its energy from coal by 2035, but that assumes a consistent regulatory framework. Other sources are less sanguine. Deutsche Bank predicts that coal's share will fall to 20% by 2030 as regulatory risk grows, with natural gas and renewables rising. That seems more likely. The EPA's new emissions rules may have been stayed by the courts, but they loom nonetheless, hampering investment in coal.
The switch away from it will be painful for some. But as Robert Byrd, the late senator from West Virginia, once said, coal-dependent regions “can choose to anticipate change and adapt to it, or resist and be overrun by it.”

The first of Offenbach's outrageously funny 'send-ups' of Greek mythology, this is an unashamedly Gallic version of the classic legend of Orpheus's pursuit of their wife Eurydice, who is carried off to Hades by Pluto - much to the annoyance of Jupiter. A highly disrespectful romp, it involves nymphs, shepherds, gods and goddesses, with the fun reaching its climax in the riotous revels of the celebrated "Can-Can". A lively and highly enjoyable show for both performers and audience, with many world-famous tunes.
The Story:
After the brief overture the curtain rises on a pastoral scene in the countryside around the ancient Greek city of Thebes. Eurydice enters and sings of the shepherd boy Aristaeus, with whom they are having an affair. Eurydice is busy decorating Aristaeus' cottage when their husband, Orpheus, appears. They demand to know what Eurydice is doing. They tell them they love Aristaeus and adds that they cannot stand Orpheus' fiddle-scraping. In revenge, Orpheus starts to play their latest 75-minute concerto and completely ignores their wife's pleas for them to stop.
Orpheus would love to relinquish Eurydice to Aristaeus, but Public Opinion would not allow it. Instead, Orpheus decides to get rid of Aristaeus and tells Eurydice of the nasty surprise which they have left in the shepherd's cornfield. When Aristaeus appears, Eurydice tries to stop them entering the cornfield, but they ignore them Eurydice follows him, but suffers a snake bite. Suddenly, Aristaeus turns into their real self: Pluto, Lord of Hades. Eurydice falls, dying, into Aristaeus' arms. Eurydice dies but Pluto brings them briefly back to life so they can leave a farewell note for Orpheus. That done, Pluto takes them down to their underworld realm.
Orpheus finds Eurydice's note and, after their initial surprise, realises how pleased they are to be rid of their wife. Their joy is short-lived. Public Opinion enters and demands that Orpheus go down to Hades to get Eurydice hack. Orpheus protests but, mindful of their professional reputation, they grudgingly agree.
The scene changes to Mount Olympus where the god Morpheus (Dr Morpheus) is scattering poppies to induce the gods to sleep. Venus, Cupid and Mars, however, have been up all night. They return home, decidedly worn out. Soon afterwards, Mercury, messenger of the gods, arrives. The young, swaggering god, ordered by Jupiter to investigate the disappearance of Eurydice, comes breezing on to Mount Olympus to tell of their findings.
Orpheus enters together with Public Opinion, who wants to ensure that Orpheus does the honourable thing, that is, ask Jupiter to restore their wife to him. Pluto, of course, has lied to Jupiter about the location of Eurydice, whom they are keeping in their boudoir in Hades.  They are guarded by John Styx. Styx was the King of Beotia. Now reduced to being Pluto's gaoler, they try to entertain Eurydice with an account of their royal past.
When Orpheus and the gods arrive, Styx locks Eurydice in a back room. As there is no sign of her, Jupiter puts the abduction question before a tribunal. What they really wants, though, is to have Eurydice for themselves and, to that end, they enlist the help of their young son, Cupid. Eurydice is located by Cupid's love police. Jupiter then turns themselves into a fly to get past the keyhole of the locked door. Eurydice loves the fly. Jupiter reveals themselves and invites Eurydice to meet them at a party on Mount Olympus.
Eurydice attends disguised as a bacchante, a follower of Bacchus, god of wine, but Pluto realises who they are and blocks Jupiter's path when Jupiter tries to make off with them Jupiter again accuses Pluto of abducting Eurydice. When Orpheus and Public Opinion appear, Jupiter tells Orpheus they can take their wife away, but only if they do not look back at them as they go. When Orpheus fails this test, Pluto claims Eurydice. Jupiter, however, takes them away from Pluto by announcing that they are turning them into a real bacchante. Everyone, except Pluto and Public Opinion, is delighted and the operetta climaxes with the energetic Can-Can, danced by all the gods and goddesses.

Firmino core to Liverpool's European hopes in Coutinho's absence
Only one Brazilian matters for the Reds on Tuesday night — the one who will face their former club for the first time since moving to Anfield
COMMENT
Across four years, the mutual admiration was shared, silently, at a distance, and from opposing dressing rooms.
Roberto Firmino, while at , had lined up against Jurgen Klopp's on 10 occasions between 2011 and 2015, scoring twice and creating another.
Those are not the sort of numbers that widen eyes, but the international had operated in four different positions during these fixtures — second striker, left and right forward, attacking midfield — and was able to influence proceedings in and out of possession in each one.
It is why when Klopp, then still at the Westfalenstadion, found out had signed the ‘stealer of balls' on July 6 for £29 million two years ago, they were in disbelief.
The biggest summer transfers
"I thought they were one of the best in the ," the manager admitted.
"So when I saw that Liverpool had signed them I thought: 'How could they do this?'
"They were not in their 100% the best moment and other clubs would have spent more on him, so I thought immediately: 'What a good transfer for them!'"
Firmino, too, felt the Reds had made a supreme acquisition by appointing the German as Brendan Rodgers' successor — a change that came within three months of the player switching the Rhein-Neckar-Arena for Anfield.
The pair will walk out on familiar territory on Tuesday, this time on the same side, as Liverpool contest the first leg of their play-off against the 25-year-old's former club.
Latest LFC transfer rumours
And while global interest in the Merseysiders currently orbits around Philippe Coutinho and their desire to depart for Barcelona, it is their countryman who will be the axis for the team.
Fresh off a decisive performance in the 3-3 draw at on Saturday in Liverpool's season opener — the "important player, connecting player, finisher, fighter and first defender," as per Klopp's description — will again strive to be luminary during the absence of their close friend through a back injury, while the distraction of Barça's pursuit lingers on.
Hoffenheim will know, in more detail than any other opposition, just how significant the Brazilian can be, even when it seems they are doing nothing remotely striking.
They ghost between markers and is an artist not only at pulling them into the areas they do not want to be in but, simultaneously, creating the space their team-mates need to be in.
'We want world-class Coutinho to stay'
It was in their hands that Firmino developed into "the complete offensive player," being allowed to quietly settle and elevate their game away from a worldwide glare and relentless expectations.
The gifted kid born in Maceio, a north-east city with unspoilt beaches but a depressingly high murder rate, already had a base of well-balanced flair and function.
At Clube de Regatas Brasil, they were encouraged to express themselves and execute the mesmeric football for which their country is famed, before a failed trial at São Paulo led them to Figueirense in the south at 17.
There, the more aggressive Uruguayan and Argentine influence, typified by tirelessness, was the norm.
Firmino was comfortable fusing both approaches and, soon after they turned 19, Hoffenheim were taking them from the second division in their homeland to the Bundesliga.
In colder climes than they envisaged, the son of a street hawker added tactical discipline and steeliness to their armoury.
"With all the mix of styles and players, cities and clubs, I have learned a lot,” Firmino explained in an interview with Goal last year.
"You play in different situations and conditions and you have to come up with new solutions for the problems. It has made me a more rounded player, who can handle different tactics and positions."
Liverpool's development coach, Pepijn Lijnders, refers to them as a "team first" player, the kind who is able to prioritise what is best for the collective rather than what would be the optimal decision for himself.
It is why they are one of Adam Lallana's favourite players and has been the midfielder's sole team-mate pick for Fantasy Football, following a rule in their league that stipulates they are only allowed the selection of one person they share the dressing room with.
There is no shortage of appreciation for the effervescent forward within the training complex, which is a reason Klopp gets perplexed by some of the external judgements.

"With Roberto Firmino people say they do not score enough. What?!  They are the best player without scoring with how well they read the game for the benefit of others," the 50-year-old complained in a lengthy conversation with Goal, before simply remarking that their No.9 is "outstanding."
Firmino arrived at Hoffenheim as a shy yet determined teenager, departed as their record sale, and returns as a core element as Liverpool seek to re-establish themselves as a European force.
On Tuesday night, they will be the only Brazilian that matters to the club.
Chalk it all up to those nasty 3 a.m. hunger pangs when only some Taco Bell will do. But riding a bike through the drive-thru? Apparently, this is a no-go.
One bicycle-riding man in New Smyrna Beach, Florida, found this out after being denied service at the drive-thru just after 3:00 a.m. Sunday morning, the Daytona Beach News-Journal reports.
And when the hungry bike rider wouldn't pedal on down the road, the fast-food workers called the cops, according to the Associated Press and ABC7 News.
Police tell the news organizations that when they responded, suspect Gabriel Harris, 33, was drunk and had a red Swiss Army knife on their belt loop.
When an officer tried to take the weapon, Harris grabbed the officer's arm, the news reports say.
Harris was wrestled to the ground and handcuffed.
He's charged with resisting arrest with violence.
Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., speaks at Georgetown University in Washington, Thursday, Nov. 19, 2015, about the meaning of "democratic socialism" and other topics. - Photo by AP / CAROLYN KASTER
WASHINGTON -- Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said Thursday that economic security is essential to Americans achieving true freedom, a central tenet in their political philosophy of "democratic socialism."
RELATED ARTICLE U.S. troops in Syria get no from Clinton
The U.S. senator from Vermont said the idea has roots in the legacies of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Rev.Martin Luther King Jr.
"Real freedom must include economic security. That was Roosevelt's vision 70 years ago. It is my vision today," Sanders said in a speech at Georgetown University. "It is a vision that we have not yet achieved, and it is time that we did."
Sanders' comments came during a speech about their views as they seek to challenge fellow candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton for the party's nomination. Clinton currently has a lead over Sanders in national polls and has an edge in Iowa, home of the first presidential caucus.
Clinton in recent days has addressed Sanders' support of a single-payer health care system, which they say will require middle-class Americans to pay higher taxes. Much of Sanders' agenda would be paid for by steep tax increases on high earners and Wall Street transactions. They have said their health care proposal would save families significant amounts of money by eliminating waste in the system.
"Health care should be a right of all people, not a privilege. This is not a radical idea," they said.
In explaining their views, Sanders cited Roosevelt's "Second Bill of Rights" from their 1944 State of the Union address, which asserted Americans should have the right to a job with a living wage, health care, education and economic protections for the elderly.
Clinton also has referred to Roosevelt in their campaign, having formally kicked off their campaign at New York's Roosevelt Island in the spring with a speech that touched on their "four fights," alluding to the "four freedoms" Roosevelt laid out in 1941.
Sanders said Roosevelt was responsible for much of the social safety net enjoyed by millions of Americans today, from Social Security, the federal minimum wage, unemployment insurance, the abolition of child labor, the 40-hour workweek, collective bargaining and strong banking regulations.
They said that at the time, "almost everything they proposed, almost every program, every idea they introduced was called 'socialist.'" But they said the federal government's role in providing economic security for Americans had become "the fabric of our nation and the foundation of the middle class."
Without mentioning Clinton by name, Sanders said their candidacy was based on creating a political revolution of supporters to demand a better deal for the middle class.
They added, "So the next time that you hear me attacked as a socialist -- like tomorrow -- remember this: I don't believe government should take over the grocery store down the street or own the means of production, but I do believe that the middle class and the working families of this country who produce the wealth of this country deserve a decent standard of living."
The address included a reference to what some Democrats view as Clinton's inevitability.
"I am not running for president because it is my turn," Sanders said. "That's not why I'm running for president. But I am running for president in order for all of us to be able to live in a nation of hope and opportunity."

Pakistan is the fifth-most prolific executioner in the world, report says
Pakistan has become the fifth-most 'prolific' executioner in the world after China, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Iraq, according to research conducted by Justice Project Pakistan, a non-profit, human rights law firm.
Pakistan has carried out 465 death penalties over a period of 30 months, amounting to 3.5 people being executed every week, JPP said.
Statistics put up by the Lahore-based law firm contend that as many as 8,200 people are currently languishing on the death row in Pakistan.
The JPP report further says that according to its research, the use of death sentences and executions has failed to deter crime in Pakistan.
Notably, Pakistan had placed a moratorium on executions in 2008. However, it lifted the prohibition in December 2014 after the December 16, 2014 Peshawar school attack in which over 140 people including 132 children died.
The moratorium was lifted to crack down on criminals and militants, however, the JPP report claims that Pakistan wielding the death penalty has failed to lower crime or combat terrorism.
The JPP's latest figures are from the time the moratorium was lifted in December 2014 to May 2017.
According to the report, the province of Punjab leads massively in the number of executions, accounting for 83 per cent of all death penalties carried out in Pakistan. However, according to JPP, the province's murder rate dropped only a 9.7 per cent between 2015-2016.
The report goes on to pose a contrast with the province of Sindh, where JPP says murder rate fell nearly 25 per cent during the same period even though the region carried out just 18 executions compared to Punjab's 382.
The JPP report further attempts to poke holes in the argument that death penalties work as an effective deterrent to terrorism, noting that yearly trends of executions in Pakistan show that just 16 per cent of all death sentences carried out are handed out by courts dealing with cases of terrorism.
Commenting on the Project's finding, JPP's executive director Sarah Belal said that death penalties in Pakistan are increasingly being used for political purposes.
"The death penalty is not an effective tool to curb militancy and crime, as the data clearly shows, yet has been increasingly used for political gain," they said.

LEGAZPI CITY, Philippines — A nurse who supposedly had a relationship with a priest was arrested for extorting money from the head of the Diocese of Sorsogon, police said Monday.
Senior Superintendent Rolando Cabral, director of Sorsogon provincial police, in a phone interview said the Diocese of Sorsogon, under Bishop Arturo Bastes, asked for help from the police after suspect Leo Funtanares, 26, of Gubat, Sorsogon threatened to reveal to the public their supposed romantic relationship with one of its priests unless the bishop gave them money. They first asked for P10 million but lowered their demand to P5 million.

Funtanares was arrested in an entrapment operation June 15. A case of robbery extortion was filed against them last Saturday.
On May 3, the suspect confessed that they and one of the priests in the Home of the Clergy were in a relationship. Investigation disclosed that Funtanares asked for help from Bishop Bastes to end their relationship but later changed their position to extorting money from the bishop.
On June 1, the bishop gave Funtanares P25,000 for the first installment and promised them more payments in the next transactions. The second transaction turned out to be the entrapment operation by police.
Recovered from the possession of the suspect were P25,000, two short brown envelopes containing receipts of the transaction and two cellphones.

So here's how Baltimore's 10 days of gun violence from hell went: About 40 people shot, 16 of them fatally.
Baltimore police Commissioner Anthony W. Batts has decried the violence, as has Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake. Several members of the Baltimore City Council have also weighed in. But, so far, there's been nothing but silence from the one group of politicians Baltimore citizens need to hear from.
That would be Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who was mayor of Baltimore before they were elected governor. And it would be nice to hear from members of Baltimore's delegation to the state Legislature.
You know, the ones with nary a Republican in their ranks. The ones that voted, during the last legislative session, to pass a bill banning assault weapons and another bill that requires any law-abiding citizen that wants to buy a firearm in Maryland to be fingerprinted.
Now dopey me - and thousands of other Marylanders - thought that fingerprinting was something done after a person has been arrested and booked for a crime. Or as a requirement for a job that has a high security clearance.
Maryland's Democratic legislators - and the state's governor - decided to change all that. For them, anyone desiring to buy a firearm automatically became a criminal suspect, a public menace worthy of being fingerprinted.
If it wasn't clear before, it's clear now: Maryland Democrats' greatest fear is a law-abiding citizen armed with a handgun or a rifle.
Violent miscreants with long criminal histories - like the ones currently causing the mayhem on Baltimore's streets, according to various police spokespersons - concern Maryland Democrats not at all.
During the most recent session of the state Legislature, Maryland Democrats focused on two problems that didn't exist. The ban on assault weapons has decreased gun violence in Baltimore not one iota.
That's because few, if any, of the shootings were done with assault weapons.
And the fingerprinting requirement affected only law-abiding citizens that want to buy firearms. It had no impact on Baltimore's criminal element at all.
What Marylanders had during the most recent legislative session was a bunch of posturing from Democrats - state senators, delegates and the governor - about gun violence. They were convinced they needed to "do something" in the wake of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.
The "something" they chose to do had nothing to do with the reality of gun violence in either Maryland or the city of Baltimore, where gun violence historically has been the most deadly.
And, when they passed their ineffective and bogus legislation, they had the nerve to be proud of it. They patted themselves on the back about what they'd done.
O'Malley - true to their nickname of "Martin O'Shameless" - was no better. Democrats throughout the state praised the assault weapons ban, and loved the thought of busting the hump of law-abiding citizens by requiring them to be fingerprinted if they want to buy firearms.
Their posturing and misguided efforts at lawmaking have now come back to bite them all in the rear ends. And I pray that a huge chunk is taken out of each of their rear ends.
Not one member of Maryland's Legislature has commented about the 10-day spate of gun violence. None has spoken out about the claim by police that, of the arrests made since the violent incidents, the suspects all have extensive criminal histories.
O'Malley has been mum too. Mind you, when the Legislature was in session and the bills to ban assault weapons and to require law-abiding citizens to be fingerprinted were being debated, O'Malley and their Democratic cohorts in the Legislature couldn't shut up about the topics.
It would be nice to hear from at least one of them. And it would be nice to hear that person say this: "Boy, wrong we were."

After finishing second to Paris Saint-Germain last season, the summer was supposed to be one of progress for AS Monaco. In truth, the weeks leading up to the new Ligue 1 campaign were turbulent to say the least.
James Rodriguez was the biggest departure. After nine goals and 12 assists in the league, it was always going to be a huge hole to fill. Wesley Sneijder, Douglas Costa and Nicolas Gaitan were all mentioned, but with president Dmitri Rybolovlev downsizing, the replacement was Bernardo Silva, on loan from Portuguese side Benfica. Underwhelming was an understatement. Although they were a Portugal Under-19 international, the midfielder had only played once for Benfica's first team.
Silva took a few months to find their feet, but once Leonardo Jardim gave them a run in the side, the little midfielder began to make their mark. Impressive displays in the league and both cups earned the 20-year-old a permanent move, and Monaco spent €15 million to sign them on a four-and-a-half year deal.
When Radamel Falcao and James left Monaco, it should have become Joao Moutinho's team, but the experienced Portuguese midfielder has been upstaged by their young protégé. Even though Moutinho has played more, it's Silva who has added more goals and assists to the Monegasque side.
One of them is a 28-year-old international who is constantly linked with moves to the Premier League, but the other is offering Monaco more on the pitch and who the Ligue 1 side will build their future around.
Why you need to know them
Monaco travel to Arsenal on Wednesday night, and whether it's from the start or off the bench, Silva is a danger to the Gunners' chances of qualifying for the quarter-finals of the Champions League.
With the Emirates Stadium showdown in mind, boss Jardim kept Silva on the bench for Friday's Côte d'Azur derby against Nice. The game was stuck at 0-0 and Monaco were down to 10 men when the Portuguese midfielder made their entrance. They always give the principality side a burst of energy from deep, and is starting to show their ability to create chances in the final third.
Not to disappoint on this occasion, it was Silva who popped up to give the away side a crucial 1-0 derby victory, pouncing on a loose ball on the edge of box before placing it in the far corner.
Silva is able to play almost anywhere in the Monaco midfield, and although they won't always take control of games and influence from start to finish, they will always make themselves known.
Strengths
Still only 20, Silva is already showing that they could play in almost any attacking position on the pitch. They love to get on the ball before either driving forward with purpose, or picking a pass and finding space to create problems for the opposition defence.
There are definite similarities to Silva's game and that of Manchester City's James Milner. Both possess great technique on the ball, although Silva prefers their left foot to their right.
But the quality can come from wide, from set-pieces and through the centre. Silva's attacking potency catches the eye, but their overall game is just as impressive.
Their performance against Evian in the Coupe de la Ligue showcased exactly what the young Portuguese is capable of. There were only a few minutes left on the clock when the midfielder launched themselves into a sliding tackle inside their own half. Silva won the ball, and helped it on its way to Anthony Martial.
Rather than think their job was done, Silva bombed forward, giving the striker an option to pass. Martial went on their own, scoring the vital second goal, but it wouldn't have happened without Silva's non-stop industry.

Weaknesses
It is hard to be critical of Silva. Aged just 20 they have left Portugal and made a move to another country, with a team that lost a lot of big-name stars last summer. However, there are certainly areas where they will have to improve if they want to continue to develop. When you see how good they can be on the ball, it's disappointing that it comes in small doses. They need to have more confidence in their own ability and show more assertiveness. Rather than look to others, they have the talent to play a bigger role, but that will come in time.
Playing in France, Silva will have to improve their physical conditioning if they are to have more time and space on the ball. At just 5ft 8in they are small with a thin physique. This doesn't mean he's not aggressive and tenacious, which helps them overcome tough battles, but with work they could be more commanding.
They said…
When Silva signed their permanent deal in January, Monaco's vice president and sporting director Vadim Vasilyev said: "Bernardo is one of those talented young players around whom AS Monaco is keen to build its future. They have already shown our fans their potential this season, and it was important for us to hold onto the player. We would now like to see Bernardo continue their development as part of our high-quality squad."
Before they broke through at Benfica, they were spotted by the Portuguese champions' former youth coach Helena Costa, who revealed that they stood out from the pack on first view.
"I remember looking at the pitch and saw a little player with long hair who impressed everyone with their left foot. It was impossible not to see their talent. It is a gift."
Did you know?
This season in Ligue 1, Silva has scored three goals for Monaco. In all three games, with all three goals, it has led to Monaco winning the fixture 1-0 – twice at home against Nantes and Marseille, and last weekend in the derby against Nice. They might not be a constant goal threat, but when they score it makes a huge difference.

Monaco go into Wednesday's game against Arsenal as clear underdogs. It will take two strong defensive performances from the Ligue 1 side if they are to have any chance of progressing. Even with two clean sheets, they will need to find a way past Arsene Wenger's side to take advantage of a strong defence.
Monaco will look to play on the break, and that is where Silva is in their element. They have the drive to push the team forward, the vision to split a defence and an increasingly impressive eye for goal.
The future is extremely bright for the young midfielder. Monaco have a wonderful player on their hands, someone who can be there for the next few years and be crucial in ASM becoming a force in French football. If the Zorro lookalike can make an impact in the Champions League, more people will start to sit up and recognise the name. First, Wenger will hope to keep them under wraps.

[John Waters]
From the [BAI] Broadcasting Authority of Ireland:
The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) has, today (23.01.14), confirmed receipt of a notification from the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Pat Rabbitte, of the resignation of Mr. John Waters from the Authority. Mr Waters was appointed to the Authority by the Government in September 2009.
Since their appointment, they have served as an Authority member; served a two-year term on the Compliance Committees; and was a serving member of the Contract Awards Committee at the time of their resignation.
Speaking about the resignation of Mr. Waters, the Chairperson of the Authority, Bob Collins said: “John has been a valued member of the Authority and of both statutory committees since the establishment of the BAI in 2009. They brought additional expertise and experience to the Authority through their previous service on the Board of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland. I would like to take this opportunity to thank them for their service and know I speak for my fellow members when I say that their insights and contributions will be missed.”
In just the last week, three of the four national wireless providers have each announced their version of some sort of program to entice people to pay more for early upgrades . But AT&T and Verizon aren't lowering their monthly rates to account for the higher phone prices (and T-Mobile is actually charging extra for the program), people who enroll in these offerings are really just paying for other customers' phones.
Ever since wireless companies began offering discounts on new devices to entice customers to sign up or renew their contracts, the carriers have said that the cost of these subsidies is built into the rates it charges for monthly service. That makes sense, as you can't expect a company to front 70% of a $600 phone without hoping to make that money back over the next two years.
But when you start offering an entire program based on the idea that the customer will be paying the full retail price of the phone, it would seem to follow that these customers would then see a reduction in monthly service rates.
T-Mobile effectively cut its rates when it switched to the “uncarrier” model earlier this year. Yes, it charges full retail price for phones, but customers are also allowed to bring network-compatible phones with them or buy their phones elsewhere. So once you're done paying for your phone, the total monthly cost of service drops… at least until you get the next phone.
AT&T's Next program breaks out the full retail cost of the device over 20 months, but doesn't offer any discount in monthly service fees. That means that AT&T Next customers are not only paying full price for their phones, but they are effectively footing the bill for other customers who get subsidized upgrades.
The same goes with Verizon Edge, which spaces the monthly payments out over 24 months, but allows for upgrades once you've paid off half of the phone's retail price. Once again, the customer is paying more for their phone and paying full price for their service plan.
And Verizon has clearly stated that is has no intention of lowering its monthly rates.
Craig Moffett of Moffett Research tells Reuters “You'd have to be out of your mind,” to go for Verizon's new Edge program.
Even T-Mobile charges an additional $10 monthly fee for its JUMP program, which takes a huge chunk away from the savings of the discounted wireless service.
One can argue that the reason AT&T and Verizon are continuing to charge full price for the service plans because they are still losing some money from the more-frequent upgrades. With AT&T Next, customers pay for at least 65% of the phone's cost before they can upgrade, while Verizon requires 50%. But most smartphone subsidies are in the 70-100% range, meaning these companies are getting back significantly more than they could have ever hoped to from traditional customers.
Let's do some math:
Say a phone has a retail price of $650.
Let's say the cost to the subscriber for a subsidized phone is $175.
Their monthly service plan is $90.
One year of service plus the cost of the phone is $1,255.
At the end of two years, they have spent $2,335.
An AT&T Next subscriber makes monthly payments of $32.50.
Their monthly plan is still $90.
After one year, they have paid a total of $1,470, $215 more than the subsidized customer.
If they wait to make their upgrade until 15 months, they will have paid $1,837.50.
Say that no new phone comes out that tickles their fancy and they go all the way to the 20-month mark. They will have paid $2,450. That's $115 more than two years' worth of subsidized phone service.
Under the Verizon plan, an Edge customer makes monthly payments of $27.
The monthly plan is still $90.
After six months, they will have paid $702. They can upgrade if they want, but that will cost them an additional $163. That's a total of $865.
It would be wiser to upgrade after 6 months and make that payment than it would to wait out making the monthly payments.
If they keep making monthly payments for the full year that it would require to reach the 50% threshold, they will have paid an additional $540 in service charges on a phone they could have upgraded.
It's actually in Verizon's best interest for the customer to upgrade every six months, as it gets back 50% of a phone's retail price six months sooner than it would through monthly installments and it locks the customer into another contract.
The notion for all of these plans, including T-Mobile's, is to encourage contract renewal as frequently as possible. Historically, upgrades have been used as a customer-retention tool to be doled out in the months leading up to the end of a contract, or to lure customers away from other providers.
These programs turn that notion on its ear. This isn't about rewarding customer loyalty; it's about putting the customers in a position where they must upgrade by a certain period of time or face the fact that they have wasted hundreds of dollars on a phone they could have gotten for significantly less.
The Young Turks' Cenk Uygur rarely has kind words for Republicans, but on Monday they said they would be willing to bet money that Rand Paul would beat Hillary Clinton and win the presidency in 2016.
Uygur credited Paul as a “voice of reason” on fighting ISIS, in contrast to Clinton's hawkishness. They agreed that “our invasion of Iraq in the first place and all of the other bombings we've done in the Middle East… has in fact led to the rise of ISIS.”
And if it's a choice between Paul saying that and Clinton's foreign policy in two years, well, Uygur thinks the answer's obvious:
“If you've got Rand Paul running on a ‘Let's stop messing around in the Middle East because we're getting killed, and it's doing absolutely no good for us' campaign versus Hillary Clinton's ‘Let's keep doing the same stupid shit we were doing before that you hated before' campaign… If I was a betting man, and I am… right now I'd lay money on Rand Paul being the next president of the United States.”
Uygur bragged that he's “never lost a single political bet in my life.”

In the 2,800-person village of Shingō in Japan's Aomori prefecture, you can visit a tourist attraction that earns almost doodlysquat fanfare despite its world-shattering theological ramifications. I am, of course, talking about the grave of Jesus Christ. What, you didn't know that Jesus escaped crucifixion and emigrated to northern Japan to become a rice farmer?
Advertisement
This radical revision of Jesus' life kicked off in 1935, when Kyomaro Takenouchi suddenly uncovered a series of millennia-old documents that detailed the Christian messiah's escape from the Holy Land. Here's a synopsis of Jesus' Eastern jaunt, via The Japan Times:
Christ first visited Japan between the ages of 21 and 33 (the Bible does in fact skip over large periods of Christ's early life, and many theories exist about what they did in the intervals). The document claims they studied the native language and culture before returning to Jerusalem, where they were crucified. Only it wasn't really them who was crucified. Their younger brother, Isukiri (who makes no appearance in the Bible), nobly took their place on the cross, pretending to be the Son of God, while the real Christ fled to Siberia. A few years later, via Alaska, they arrived at the port of Hachinohe, just 40 km from Shingō. They made their way to the village, where they married, had three children, and lived to the age of 106.

According to local lore, Christ didn't commit any miracles while residing in Shingō, but instead was just an extremely pleasant fellow to be around. Additionally, the Takenouchi documents further detailed humanity's extraterrestrial origins, the history of Atlantis, and how the Sawaguchi family of Shingō are actually the descendants of Christ.
Advertisement
In multiple interviews, members of the Sawaguchi family have expressed how their messianic bloodline doesn't ruffle them one iota. Also, they're Buddhists rather than Christians, incidentally.
Still, believers of the Japanese Christ point to local traditions — such as marking newborns' foreheads with black crosses and sewing Star of David-like patterns onto babies' clothing — as evidence of Christ's pilgrimage to Shingō. Even the town's former name, Herai, is purported to have Hebraic roots.
In Shingō, you can also see Christ's dead brother's ear and a lock of the Virgin Mary's hair. Here's a verbal history of the spot. For another strange history tourist destination, see the Confederate dinosaur army. Also, semi-related: kaiju Santa Claus.

AT 5: New developments regarding a shooting that left this young boy dead. Livestream: https://t.co/wgIItBBTQm pic.twitter.com/eIKiwvUCws — WAFB (@WAFB) November 4, 2015
It's not known why Chris Few, a reportedly mellow 25-year-old Louisiana man who had warrants out for their arrest, allegedly tried to flee from authorities on Tuesday night. Some reported Few was being served a warrant; others said they had just gotten in a fight at a local bar before they jumped in their truck as city marshals gave chase, then tried to ram officers' vehicles.
What is clear is that Few's son, 6-year-old Jeremy David Mardis, was in the truck with their father when gunshots erupted — and now Jeremy is dead, an innocent bystander of a confrontation some are calling unjustified.
“More likely than not they were shooting into the driver side, and they were on the passenger side,” Avoyelles Parish Coroner L. J. Mayeux told the Associated Press. “He was in the line of fire.”
Jeremy's body was identified by their grandmother at the scene. They were shot twice, in the head and in the chest.
“Jeremy was a special gift from God,” Samantha Few said in a statement, as WAFB reported. “He was always smiling happy. They were diagnosed with autism when they were 2. They loved everyone they met and they loved him. As far as what caused their death, the only thing I have been told is they died from gun shot wounds.”
They added: “He didn't deserve what happened. They wouldn't hurt a fly.”
Jeremy lived with their father and grandmother in Marksville, a town of about 6,000 in central Louisiana. After moving into the school system from Mississippi earlier this year with their dad, they attended first grade at the Lafargue Elementary School in Effie, where grief counselors were sent Wednesday.
“We are definitely all shaken up,” Blaine Dauzat, the Avoyelles Parish school superintendent, said. “It's been a tough day at work for all of us.”
Before the run-in with the marshals that would prove fatal for their son, Few was hanging out at TJ's Lounge, as Central Louisiana's Advocate reported. Since their move from Mississippi, they were a regular at the bar, and had been there playing pool with their girlfriend less than half-an-hour before they fled from police. Whether Jeremy was in the car while their dad was in the bar or whether their dad picked them up later was not clear.
“It just blows my mind that all this happened,” another customer, whom the Advocate did not name, told the paper.

However Few ended up being chased by marshals, they led them to a dead end street at a state park. Coroner Mayeux said shots were exchanged after they refused to exit their truck and tried to ram into their vehicles.
“It's still under investigation, but all indications are that the shots came from outside the vehicle,” Mayeux said.
In a press release, Louisiana State Police said only that marshals “discharged their duty weapons, at a vehicle, at the conclusion of a pursuit.” The police would also not confirm whether shots were fired by anyone other than the marshals.
“Right now we are trying to determine exactly where those shots came from,” Scott Moreau, a Louisiana State Trooper spokesperson, said. “… That I can't confirm right now. What I can confirm is that the child was shot and the child is dead.”
It was also not clear how many marshals were involved in the shooting.
“I know it was more than one officer involved,” spokesperson Moreau said. “There were multiple officers, but whether it was two, three or four, I don't have that information yet.” They added: “When a 6-year-old child is killed, regardless of how they were killed, it is detrimental to the community, to the police officers, to everybody involved.”
Few is in critical condition at an area hospital. Coroner Mayeux criticized the way marshals handled the incident.
“To be arrested for a simple warrant, whatever it may have been, is definitely not worth a child's life,” they said.
As the nation's attention has been focused on police brutality since the killing of 19-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., last year, some began to question the response of Marksville authorities.
“I have no idea what these city marshals were serving Few with a warrant for,” the Frisky wrote, “but I cannot imagine that their crime, nor their decision to flee or back up into their vehicle warranted this level of response, especially if they had any idea whatsoever that there was a child in harm's way. It's unclear if they did know, but it certainly doesn't sound like any effort was made to make sure that there were no innocent lives in the crosshairs.”
There was also the question: Should officers shoot at moving cars? After investigating alleged police brutality in Cleveland in 2013, the Department of Justice said no, recommending the city's “policy be changed to prohibit the discharge of firearms at or from a moving vehicle unless deadly physical force is being used against the police officer or another person present, by means other than the moving vehicle.”
“Shooting at vehicles creates an unreasonable risk unless such a real and articulable threat exists,” the DOJ wrote. “First, it is difficult to shoot at a moving car with accuracy. Missed shots can hit bystanders or others in the vehicle. Second, if the driver is disabled by the shot, the vehicle may become unguided, making it potentially more dangerous.”
Earlier this year, the issue was raised in Indianapolis after police fired on moving cars in two incidents in two months, killing two drivers. That city had just changed its policy in 2012 — to make it easier for officers to fire when it's “reasonably perceived that the vehicle is being used as a weapon against the officer or others.”
Some said a hard-and-fast rule wouldn't do any good.
“Black-and-white policy statements do not take into consideration every possible scenario that an officer would be faced with,” Indianapolis police spokesperson Richard Riddle said. “A strict prohibition could cause an officer pause, thus potentially having fatal consequences toward the officer.”
Of course, this debate did not mean anything to Jeremy David Mardis.
“This is such a tragic loss of a young life,” superintendant Dauzat said.
Some of the illegal aliens shielded from deportation by the President Obama-created Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program will begin arriving in Washington, D.C. this week to lobby lawmakers to pass an end-of-the-year amnesty for potentially 3.5 million illegal aliens.
A McClatchy report reveals that “caravans” of DACA illegal aliens “will start arriving in Washington” with orchestrated open borders rallies in front of the White House and “sit-ins” on Capitol Hill.
In September, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced on behalf of President Trump's administration that the DACA program, whereby nearly 800,000 illegal aliens have been shielded from deportation and given work permits, would end in March 2018.
Since Sessions' announcement, the open borders groups and corporate interests have lobbied members of Congress to quickly pass an amnesty that would not only include illegal aliens enrolled in DACA, but also the millions of illegal aliens who were eligible but unable to apply in time for the federal program.
As Breitbart News reported, a lobbyist for the pro-amnesty U.S. Chamber of Commerce has admitted that an amnesty for illegal aliens in December is becoming increasingly unlikely.
“Two months have now passed, and I'm sad to report that we're arguably further away from a solution today than we were then,” U.S. Chamber of Commerce Chief Policy Officer Neil Bradley told McClatchy.
Two weeks ago, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's open borders lobbying group FWD.us and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce brought DACA illegal aliens to Capitol Hill to meet with lawmakers, Breitbart News reported.
Zuckerberg's group and the Chamber of Commerce worked with IBM and the Microsoft Corporation — both of which have hired illegal aliens and outsourced huge portions of their workforce to foreign nations — to get illegal aliens into meetings with lawmakers in order to promote an amnesty plan.
Despite the open borders lobby's latest theatrical push for amnesty, Americans, including Democrats and swing-voters, do not see giving illegal aliens a pathway to U.S. citizenship as a priority for Congress.
A recent Morning Consult-Politico poll found that less than 30 percent of Americans said giving DACA illegal aliens amnesty should be a priority, Breitbart News reported.
Meanwhile, a whopping 82 percent of Americans said helping unemployed Americans find jobs should be a higher priority for Congress than providing work permits to illegal aliens, a poll conducted by National Research Inc /The Polling Company found. A total of 78 percent of Democrats agreed that unemployed Americans should be helped before illegal aliens.

SANTA FE – A well-known American Indian artist said police in Santa Fe pulled a rifle on them after their dog pooped in their SUV and a woman mistook their cleanup efforts for a burglary.
“I tried to talk to them to explain that I was cleaning up dog” poop, Mateo Romero said. “But they got all hysterical and I just backed away. I couldn't leave. It was crazy.”
But the woman, Maria Markus, 60, said they had no idea what Romero was up to at their house. “Who pulls their car into people's driveways and cleans dog poop from their car?” they asked.
ADVERTISEMENTSkip
Markus, spouse of renowned photographer Kurt Markus, told the Journal there was a strange vehicle in the driveway of their Old Santa Fe Trail home near Museum Hill when they pulled up about noon Monday. They thought it might be the same burglars who came to the house two months ago and told their husband “we'll be back” when they walked in on them, Markus said.
They said Romero never identified themselves after they blocked in their SUV, and they tried to get them to roll down their car windows and tugged at the doors. She'd called police and they told them to lock their doors and not leave, Markus said.
Romero, a Pojoaque painter whose art was featured on the 2008 Santa Fe Indian Market poster, told The Associated Press that a Santa Fe officer pointed a weapon at them during the misunderstanding that landed them in handcuffs and in the back of a patrol car.
According to a police report, the officer pulled out the rifle, got Romero on the ground and detained them after Markus reported a burglary in progress.
Romero said they pulled into the private driveway after Han Solo, their Shih Tzu, relieved themselves inside the SUV during a drive to their studio. Romero said they only wanted to clean the mess.
However, Romero said when Markus spotted them in their driveway, they boxed them in with their vehicle and called 911. Police said they searched Romero and released them after officers did not find any of the woman's property on them or any sign of a break-in. “It appeared to be a misunderstanding,” the police report said. “Mr. Romero was understanding and polite.”
ADVERTISEMENTSkip
Markus said their “heart was pounding” as they waited for police to arrive. They noted that Amelia White Park is just down the street from their home and Romero could have gone there to clean up the dog mess. They said they used an old scarf that was thrown in the bushes. Romero was “rude and obnoxious” and never apologized, they said.
Romero is an award-winning painter whose work has been exhibited in Canada and throughout the United States. Efforts by the Journal to reach them for comment Wednesday after they were interviewed by the AP were unsuccessful.
Markus said they and their husband moved to Santa Fe from Montana in February and were ready to move back after their second unpleasant incident in a couple of months.
But they decided to stay because the responding police officers were so nice, they said.

After experimenting Jamberry nails for the first time, I am eager to write my review about Jamberry Nails (if you want to know what Jamberry Nails are, read “Jamberry Nails“) and tutorial on how to apply the Jamberry nail shields. I used the manicure supplies and sample of Jamberry nails from the consultant kit. But you can purchase them at any nail supplies, such as EsthersNC.com. To purchase Jamberry nails, visit esther.jamberrynails.net.
Jamberry Nail Review
First of all, I need to let you know why I like Jamberry Nails. We've been selling nail products for over 7 years now and there are always new products with new technologies pop up in the market. First there was regular nail polish. Then recently we have popular soak-off gel polish and shellac that revolutionize the application and durability of nail polish. With gel polish or shellac, application is easy and nail polish can stay up to 3 weeks on nails. This is amazing compare to regular nail polish that, if lucky, can stay 1 week. The drawback is to do your manicure or pedicure at home you have to invest a lot of money in the beginning to buy more expensive nail polish and the lamp and the application can be overwhelming to some people.
Then Jamberry nails came to my attention recently. After I read its review on a blog, I was excited and thought this was a must-have product for people who love to do their nails at home. I became Jamberry Nails consultant right away because I wanted to offer it at Esther's Nail Center. Unfortunately, Jamberry won't allow its consultant to sell Jamberry products alongside other third-party products. So we have a separate store just for Jamberry Nails: esther.jamberrynails.net
What I like about Jamberry Nails compare to other products is that they are very easy to apply and remove. I read the instruction for my first nail. Afterwards I pretty much could remember almost all the steps. Application has no harsh odor from nail polish, in fact no nail polish needed, it's very easy on budget only $15 per sheet for 2 to 3 manicures, and long-lasting. It's supposed to stay on finger nails for 2 weeks and toe nails for 6 weeks.
Drawbacks always exist with any product, including the popular CND Shellac or Gelish. What I find hard using Jamberry nails..ehm…ehm…is that it's hard to cover completely your nail bed. My nail is wider on the tip. This leaves some tiny spaces that can't be covered by the shield. If you look closely you can see it clearly. The other problem that I just notice is that it's very difficult to apply the shield as French Manicure tip. Has to cut it precisely and the shield is easy to lift up. Maybe it's just my lack of practice. So I hope in the next catalog Jamberry will release some French Manicure designs.
How To Apply Jamberry Nails
Step 1. Gather all your manicure supplies.
The supplies are alcohol, nail file, cuticle pusher, sharp small scissor, hair dryer, nail buffer block, Jamberry nail shields, and the instruction available on the back of the nail shields.
Step 2. Clean nails with nail polish remover or alcohol. (Clean, oil free nails are one of the most important steps of the application). I used Alcohol and it virtually has no odor (very low odor) so I felt comfortable working with it in a closed room. I like to clean one nail at a time and apply a shield right away. That way I will make sure the nail is clean before applying a shield.
Step 3: Buff top of the nail to remove the shine and prepare the nail bed for optimal result. Then, push back cuticle.
Step 4: Match nail (finger or toe) to the nail shield that best fits. It's rather difficult to find a perfect match. If the paper is like a plastic transparent it would be easier I think. Basically, choose a shield in a size that won't touch the cuticle area. If the shield covers the cuticle, it won't stay long.
Step 5: Cut and peel the nail shield. Cut it to the size you need. When peeling the shield, make sure sure you touch only the very edge of the shield that will be trimmed to minimize oil or dirt on the adhesive. You can also use a tweezer. But I find using hand is easier.
Step 6: Warm it with a blow-dryer 10-15 seconds or until soft and flexible. I recommend to 20 second.
Step 7: When warm, press the shield onto the nail. Apply firm pressure around edges to adhere the shield to the nail. Use cuticle pusher to seal the shield around the cuticle. Do step 7, twice or 3 times to ensure long-lasting application.
Step 8: Trim the top with scissors and file off remaining shield using a downward motion to remove excess. Sometimes a strand of the shield comes out when you file. That's okay. Keep filing until the edge of the shield clean. You can see that the shield sticks very neatly on the nail.
Step 9: Apply heat and pressure to the shield again. Repeating this step several times helps create a tight seal to the nail surface and increases wear time. I would do this twice before I move on the next one. No top coat needed. You're ready to go.
Final Result
DAY 1
I was amazed at how easy to apply the nail shields. I noticed after a few minutes the shield on my pinky lifted a bit. So I warmed the shield and apply pressure on it. I am not sure why this happened. Maybe it needed more of the heat-and-pressure step.
The next day, half of the shield on my pinky started to lift. However, since the tip part still stuck to the nail, the shield still looked good. The only problem was my hair sometimes got trapped underneath the shield so my hair got pulled many times.
DAY 6
Right Hand
Left Hand
On day 4, the shield on one pinky peeled off without hurting my nail. The photos above shows the nail shields after 6 days. I use my right hand much more than my left hand. As you can see there are more tear and wear signs on the right ones. I noticed the shields around the cuticle on some nails started to lift off, causing my hair, lints, fabric strands got trapped underneath them.
I really want to change my nails but I just have to be patient to see if Jamberry nails stand up to its claim.
I'll update this post to report how long Jamberry nails shields stay on my nails. Thanks for staying tune and feel free to comment below.
DAY 14
On day 14, I took the shield that covered my pointer finger because my hair always got trapped under it. So after constant hair-pulling, I finally peeled it off. However, I was totally amazed on how some of the shields stayed after 14 days.
You can see from the photo my nails' growth. The shields started to lift off especially near the cuticle area. However, on the free edge, the shields sealed very well. I shouldn't have peeled the shield as it strip off a little layer of my nail.
In summary, Jamberry nail shields really can stay up to 2 weeks on some nails but not all kind of nails. It also depends on the application process.
So what to do if some nail shields peel off? Just apply nail polish to fill the empty spot or re-apply the shield. Applying nail shield shouldn't take long so in a few minutes you'll be ready to go.

A Franklin Regional High School senior said they have been off the schedule from their EMT job with Murrysville Medic One since April 11, two days after they triaged or administered first aid to 14 wounded classmates.VIDEO: Watch Ashlie Hardway's ReportAlex Pasculle, 18, was off-duty from Murrysville Medic One the morning of April 9 when police say Alex Hribal, 16, stabbed 20 students and one security guard. Pasculle said when they realized what was happening, they notified the school resource officer, went out to their vehicle, grabbed their bag and ran back inside the high school to begin administering first aid. Pasculle could be heard on emergency radio transmissions telling dispatchers they had 14 patients inside the school.April 10, Pasculle spoke with Pittsburgh's Action News 4 about their actions that day. Medic One's administrative director was present for the interview. Pasculle claimed in the days that followed, their director called them a liar and said Pasculle did not do what they said they did in the interview. Medic One's director declined to comment on the claims for this story but did send a written statement."I don't want to have to say I treated 14 patients," Pasculle said. "As an EMT, it's not something you brag about."April 11, Pasculle and their colleagues spoke with Pittsburgh's Action News 4 about their combined efforts on April 9, each EMT or paramedic detailing their personal involvement and how it makes them feel about emergency medicine. That day, Pasculle said they were no longer on the schedule to work at Medic One."I looked on the calendar, and I was taken off the schedule," Pasculle said.Pasculle said when they questioned their director about being removed from the schedule, the director told them they were mentally unstable. Pasculle said they were cleared for work by a debriefing team as well as a therapist, and that they never told anyone they were emotionally unstable or too upset to continue working as an EMT."I actually said the opposite, that I wanted to continue on with my life and keep my schedule going," Pasculle said.Pasculle said their director repeatedly asked to meet with him, but Pasculle refused to do so unless others were present for the meeting.As far as claims Pasculle did not help 14 patients that morning, Pasculle said they have received dozens of texts, messages, calls and letters from witnesses, teachers and victims thanking them for what they did."Friends of mine, classmates of mine, even people in school I didn't know have been supporting me, telling me, 'Thank you,'" Pasculle said.Pasculle, who has received several awards for their work April 9, said they hope to find another EMT job in Westmoreland County.  They are currently a volunteer firefighter in Export.Murrysville Medic One issued the following statement:"Murrysville Medic One confirms that Alex Pasculle is currently employed by the company. We are proud of the response and patient care from our crews on the day of the trying circumstances at Franklin Regional High School. It is company policy to not comment publicly on any personnel related matters. If Alex wants to discuss any issues our door is always open."
A Dallas woman who was ticketed for being a non-English-speaking driver is calling for an internal investigation.
A Dallas woman who was ticketed for being a non-English-speaking driver is calling for an internal investigation.
Ernestina Mondragon was pulled over Oct. 2 on a traffic stop and cited for not speaking English in addition to two other traffic violations.
Mondragon and their attorney said Sunday that they are filing a complaint with the Dallas Police Department.
"I do not understand how a police officer can give a citation for an offense that doesn't exist on paper," said Domingo Garcia, Mondragon's attorney.
No English Ticket Controversy
Dallas woman is calling for action after getting a ticket for not speaking english. (Published Sunday, Oct. 25, 2009)
Chief David Kunkle said last week that the officer, a rookie under supervised training, misapplied a federal law when citing Mondragon. They said the department's computer system for citations includes the law, which requires drivers of commercial vehicles to speak English.
Mondragon's "no-English" ticket was later dismissed in court.
The department said more than three dozen other citations for not speaking English have been issued by at least six officers.
Kunkle said the officers and their commanders are under investigation.

As the dangers of SSRIs offered by Big Pharma continue to be documented, science is finally confirming what many natural health advocates have been arguing for years, namely that many of the illegal substances that have been propagandized to be shunned by the public are far safer and more effective alternatives.
For those who still might not have come across the amazing website SSRI Stories, I'll offer you a snippet from their intro to hopefully pique further investigation:
SSRI Stories is a collection of over 6,000 stories that have appeared in the media (newspapers, TV, scientific journals) in which prescription drugs were mentioned and in which the drugs may be linked to a variety of adverse outcomes including violence. …. SSRI Stories focuses primarily on problems caused by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), of which Prozac (fluoxetine) was the first. For more see About SSRIs. Other medications prescribed as antidepressants that fit the “nightmares” theme of the collected stories are sometimes included. (Source)
More than 6,000 stories! A nightmare indeed. And, yet, parents continue to accept the increased push to give SSRIs to children who exhibit behaviors that are, well, childish. Instead, society has been conditioned to educate children (and adults) about the terrifying dangers of natural substances such as cannabis, LSD, and “magic” mushrooms (psilocybin), of which psilocybin is still considered to be a Schedule 1 drug by international standards: “defined as drugs with a high potential for abuse or drugs that have no recognized medical uses.”
The most recent outcome of human trials conducted in the U.K. further illustrates how foolish and factually incorrect this worldview has become.
The prominent publication Lancet Psychology has published new results from a study of 12 severely depressed individuals who on average had symptoms for nearly 2 decades. None had responded to conventional treatments, including SSRIs. The outcome after receiving just one dose was astonishing:
One week after receiving an oral dose of psilocybin, all patients experienced a marked improvement in their symptoms. Three months on, five patients were in complete remission. … The equivalent remission rate for SSRIs is around 20%. (Source)
Modern society is unfortunately rife with depression to epidemic levels that are still rising. The fact that there are an increasing number of pharmaceutical-free solutions to depression is something that needs to be shared widely to friends and family who may be struggling. Please share this article as the latest example of the type of research we should support more widely.
(Editor's Note: We also recommend that you visit the fantastic work on natural mental health that is being done by Dr. Kelly Brogan – a former traditional medical doctor turned holistic psychiatrist. Dr. Brogan offers an uplifting vision of a world free from pharmaceuticals which could dramatically turn the tide of disability brought about by depression. Please see their book A Mind of Your Own for more information.)

Futures are now available in backtesting. You can now access futures data and trade contracts. You can implement algorithms that trade futures alone, or algorithms that trade both futures and equities. New data and new tradable assets means new opportunities to find alpha. If you have your eye on an allocation, this is the first opportunity for futures algos to be evaluated on Quantopian, so correlation to other algos is as low as it will get.
We didn't just expand the API, we launched a new curriculum to help you learn about futures. We added a tutorial to help get you started with the new Futures API, and a handful of lectures including an introduction to how futures work and some advanced lessons on trading futures quantitatively.
There's a lot of new stuff, so here are some more details on what we've added.
Futures Data in Research
Futures data for 72 different US futures is available in Research for you to analyze and formulate ideas. The data includes 24 hour as-traded pricing and volume data, 5 days a week. Similar to what we have for equities, futures data is available at a daily or minutely frequency and includes open, high, low, close, and volume data (OHLCV)
The Futures API includes continuous futures. You can use continuous futures to request for windows of pricing/volume data for a particular underlying commodity/asset without having to worry about all the different contracts trading simultaneously for that same underlying.
In case you missed it, we posted an example notebook that walks through the new API.
Futures Available in Backtesting
Futures data is now available in backtests so you can now develop algorithms that trade futures contracts. Similar to research, your algorithms can now access 24 hour futures pricing/volume data at a daily or minutely level. In order to get futures data in an algorithm, you will need to run your backtests on the US Futures trading calendar. There is a new dropdown menu where you can pick between the US Equities or US Futures calendar. Equities data is available on either calendar but futures data is only available on the US Futures calendar. The US Futures calendar runs from 6:30am-5pm ET. The US Equities calendar is the 9:30am-4:00pm ET calendar that you are used to on Quantopian.
Continuous futures are available in backtests. The same function that allows you to build continuous futures in research is available in the backtester. You can get the history of a continuous future via data.history() .
You can trade futures contracts in your algorithms. A very common technique to ordering futures contracts is to use the continuous future to get a reference to the current active or front contract for a particular underlying commodity/asset. To do this, you can pass a ContinuousFuture to data.current() , and ask for the 'contract' field. For example, if you want the contract to which a crude oil ContinuousFuture is current pointing, you can do something like this:
context.cl = continuous_future('CL') ... current_contract = data.current(context.cl, 'contract')
Once you have the current contract, you can place an order for futures contracts using order_optimal_portfolio .
Lectures
We added 4 new lectures to the Quantopian Lecture Series to teach you about futures, and how to think of them in the context of quantitative finance:
The lectures are a great way to learn about some of the theory behind trading futures. We are expecting to add more lectures in the near future.
Tutorial
We launched a Getting Started With Futures Tutorial that teaches you how to use futures data in research and how to include futures in your algorithms. The tutorial walks through the new Futures API in Research and Backtesting and builds up to a simplified version of the Pair Trading Example in the Mean Reversion on Futures lecture.
Help Documentation Updated
We added the new Futures API to the help documentation so you can learn about the new functions that we added and how to use them. The existing documentation was updated to explain how certain functions work on the US Futures calendar (e.g. schedule_function()).
We also added 2 sample algorithms that trade futures.
Slippage & Commission
We made new slippage and commission models for algorithms that trade futures. When you run backtests on algorithms that trade futures, they will use per-future models with parameters that depend on the particular underlying commodity/asset being traded.
The default commission model used for futures on Quantopian is Interactive Broker's fixed commission model and includes per-trade exchange fees.
The default slippage model used for futures is a special volatility volume share model that was fit to empirical data.
Note that if you run a backtest on an algorithm that trades equities and futures, the equity slippage + commission models will be applied to your equity trades, while the futures models will be placed to any contracts that you order.
We look forward to working with the community as you develop strategies that trade futures. Over the next few months, we will start to evaluate these strategies. We look forward to making our first allocation to a futures algo!
Them broad appeal among Democratic voters has prevented liberal complaints against the party's Wall Street faction from mushrooming into an electoral insurgency. Them star power — and the potential for a ceiling-breaking White House victory — has helped obscure a vexing reality for the post-Obama Democratic Party: As much as it advertises itself as the party of a rising generation, the Democrats' farm team is severely understaffed, and many of its leading lights are eligible for Social Security.
Jerry Brown, perhaps the most successful big-state Democratic governor in the country, is 76. (He ran for president two decades ago — as the anti-Clinton candidate.) The top four congressional Democrats are all 70 or older. And as Democrats look for new recruits to run in 2016, there are fewer up-and-comers, and more prospects older than 60 looking to make up for losses in previous elections, including Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania, Russ Feingold of Wisconsin and Ted Strickland of Ohio, who are all eying Senate seats.
“When people bring up the presidential race to me, they bring up Secretary Clinton,” said Jason Kander, 33, Missouri's secretary of state and a Democrat running for the Senate. “I have just not had many conversations where people talk about different candidates.”
Down the ticket, the party's problems are worse. The two midterm elections since President Obama's 2008 victory have wiped out an entire generation of Democratic state officeholders, costing the Democrats more than 900 state legislative seats and 11 governorships, according to an internal Democratic National Committee assessment released last month.
Republicans have been more aggressive in steering donors to less glamorous state races, electing governors and legislative majorities whose sweeping rollback of union rights has further damaged Democrats in states in which they are already reeling.
“The other side has killed us at that stuff,” said Steve Rosenthal, a Democratic strategist.
The shift has provided Republicans an advantage in redistricting and fund-raising: In 10 top presidential swing states, according to data collected by the National Institute on Money in State Politics, Republican state parties raised $350 million over the last four years, compared with $215 million for Democratic state parties.
“Obviously, Florida's struggled at the state level for Democrats,” said Mark S. Pafford, the Democratic leader in the state's House of Representatives, where Democrats now hold just over a third of the seats. Their hope, Mr. Pafford said, is that a candidate of Mrs. Clinton's stature “reinvigorates the base to go out and find motivation in Democratic leadership.”
Stew Milne for The Boston Globe James Donessoni of Rhode Island can vape — use an e-cigarette — at their desk, but that's not the rule in all companies.
James Donessoni has been vaping at their desk for four years.
Every 10 minutes or so, the Rhode Island graphic designer takes a drag on their e-cigarette, inhaling an aerosol made from heated liquid nicotine. It smells like cinnamon or Red Bull, their flavors of choice, the puff of white mist dissipates in seconds, and no one in their open office space complains, they said, not even their boss.
And the days of leaving their desk for a cigarette break every hour or two? Long gone.

“To be honest with you, it's made me more productive because I would find any little excuse to get that [nicotine] fix,” they said, noting that they have quit smoking tobacco all together. “I really can't see how it can be any more harmful than the air conditioning ducts or the heating ducts, and all the crap that's sitting in there.”

Like many employers, the consulting firm where Donessoni works doesn't have a policy about electronic cigarettes or other electronic nicotine inhalers. But with the use of e-cigarettes growing, and health risks unclear, companies are grappling with whether to allow employees to vape, the electronic equivalent of smoking.
So far, the battery-powered devices have been banned in workplaces, bars, and restaurants in three states — North Dakota, New Jersey, and Utah — and in 172 cities and counties, including Boston and 51 other Massachusetts municipalities. But in jurisdictions with no specific regulations in place, people are puffing away.
Some employees, like Donessoni, vape openly in break rooms or cubicles; others sneak into bathroom stalls. Many companies have not yet updated smoking policies to include e-cigarettes, but most that have are prohibiting them.
Walmart limits use to designated smoking areas; Starbucks forbids smoking of any kind within 25 feet of its stores. CVS, which doesn't allow smoking anywhere on its corporate campuses, has a no-tolerance policy on the electronic version. McDonald's has banned e-cigs in its company-owned restaurants, but leaves the decision up to owners at its franchises.

UPS not only doesn't allow e-cigarettes, it also charges nonunion employees who use them a $150 monthly insurance premium, the same amount it charges regular smokers. New rules in the Affordable Care Act allow employers to charge workers who smoke up to 50 percent of the annual cost of their health care coverage.
If other companies follow UPS's lead, employees could be similarly penalized for getting their nicotine electronically. E-cigarettes may also violate terms of smoking-cessation programs required to avoid the charge, benefits specialists say.
The use of e-cigarettes has risen rapidly to a $2 billion industry since they were introduced in the United States near the end of the last decade. It's still a fraction of the $94 billion combustible cigarette industry, but some analysts predict that as tobacco use declines, consumption of vaporized nicotine products — which are generally cheaper — will surpass traditional cigarettes in the next decade.
The Food and Drug Administration plans to start regulating e-cigarettes as tobacco products, but studies about health effects are mixed.
There is no evidence so far that vaping causes cancer or emphysema, and a recent study out of England found that e-cigarettes were more likely to help smokers quit than nicotine patches or gum. But the aerosol they produce contains nicotine, low levels of toxins, and ultrafine particles that could exacerbate asthma and other illnesses.

Human resources consultant Karyn Rhodes advises corporate clients to ban electronic nicotine products as part of their no-smoking policies. “Anything that could potentially harm other employees, we tend to side on the more cautious,” said Rhodes, a vice president at the Cornerstone Group in Warwick, R.I.
‘I really can't see how it can be any more harmful than [what is in] the air conditioning ducts or the heating ducts.'
Regardless of whether they allow e-cigarettes in the office, companies should enact policies before employees start testing the boundaries, said employment attorney Amber Elias. Such policies should delineate when, where, and if, vaping is allowed.
“If you leave this area vague, you're inviting conflict,” said Elias, who works in the Boston office of Fisher & Phillips. “If you have people with clouds of vapor rising from their cubes, how is that going to affect other people?”
It's also a matter of appearance. A supervisor at a central Massachusetts manufacturing firm, a recovering smoker, asked employment attorney Jonathan Sigel about vaping on the company floor. Sigel, of Mirick O'Connell in Westborough, advised them not to.
“You are a senior manager,” Sigel told him. “Whether you are walking around with a lollipop sticking out of your mouth or a coffee stirrer, or an e-cigarette, it wouldn't look very professional.”
The company has since amended its no-smoking policy to prohibit e-cigarettes.
Some employers, however, see advantages in e-cigarettes. A small insurance company near Fort Myers, Fla., noted an increase in productivity from allowing employees to vape in the office unless a customer is present, according to news reports. The president of a spring manufacturer in Tulsa, Okla., who quit smoking after they tried e-cigarettes, went so far as to give vaping equipment to employees who smoked.
Allowing employees to vape at work keeps them from going outside with the smokers, which could entice people trying to quit to have a real cigarette, said Gregory Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, an e-cigarette advocacy organization. “Being able to stay inside is a great incentive,” Conley said.
But e-cigarette critics say vaping could trigger a desire for the real thing. E-cigarettes are not banned at Shechtman Halperin Savage LLP, a Pawtucket, R.I., law firm, but managing partner Stephen Shechtman is leaning toward doing so.
“To me, when you quit smoking, you have to get away from it. You have to put it behind you. And I'm not convinced that e-cigarettes are putting it behind you,” said Shechtman, a former smoker who offers financial incentives for employees to quit the habit. “It could be a substitute that brings you back to the problem.”

Update: Event is now finished.
Nintendo is currently holding its 74th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. President Satoru Iwata isn't in attendance as he's still recovering from surgery, but there are still plenty of tidbits being shared.
We'll update this post below with information that comes out from the event:
– Mario Kart 8 has sold over 2 million copies
– Wii U sales are up
Q1: How did E3 go?
A1: Watch this video. 50k industry members attend. Splatoon was introduced. GamePad-centered games Project Giant Robot, Project Guard, and Mario Maker shown. New firmware update makes use of the GamePad. High expectations for NFC figures.
Q2: How about gifts for shareholders?
A2: There are legal limitations on gifts, and we view return to shareholders as monetary. Shareholders who already own gifted products wouldn't be happy.
Q3: When will there be new information on Zelda for Wii U? (audience laughs)
A3: Can't answer until there's an official announcement. (audience laughs) Hyrule Warriors is coming soon. The next official Zelda game will be open-world.
Q4: I don't want there to be a shift from cultivating high-priced products, but there are so many people with smartphones. How will you make use of them?
A4: We are making use of smartphones in development. Not games, but supplementary tools.
Q5: I want to suggest large screens for children. Also, casinos will apparently be legalized in some places, and many people don't know how to play casino games. How about games to teach them?
A5: Thank you for your suggestions. We will take them into consideration.
Q6: Will you be entering the Chinese market?
A6: We already have the iQue brand. Further information to come in the future.
Q7: Wii had single-player games Xenoblade and Regenleiv, how about the Wii U?
A7: Games for core users have been delayed in coming, but Monolithsoft's Xenoblade Chronicles X will be released. Devil's Third as well. They had a slow start, but more and more will be released. We used the term open-world games to help you understand, but in development, we don't call them open-world games. There are games that other companies produce at great cost, and cannot become profitable without reaching the top 10. Even new titles need to be promoted in the marketplace. Leisure options have increased. Our products no longer rank as high in most-wanted product lists. The flow of information has changed greatly. We're optimistic about using smartphones and SNS in marketing.
Q8: How confident is Takeda-san in the Wii U hardware?
A8: The Wii U is in HD, of course. We're working hard to make good use of the GamePad. It doesn't have a lot of memory, but it shares DNA with the GameCube in being efficient memory. I want to share that DNA with our younger staff.
Q9: I don't know about games, and don't care about game-related questions, but your shareholders haven't said anything about the stock price dropping. What kind of shareholder meeting is this? Tell me about the business administration. (audience applause)
A9: Thank you for your pointed opinion. Shareholder meetings are for us to communicate with shareholders. It's important for shareholders to know what we as a company are doing, and what kind of entertainment we are providing.
Q10: The business has produced losses for 3 fiscal years in a row. I want to ask about management responsibility, but is there any outlook for this term 3 months in?
A10: Efforts are being made in the expansion of 3DS titles, the utilization of the Wii U GamePad, the sales of strong titles, the amendment of income and expenditure balance, and cost reduction.
Q11: I want to hold stock for about 10 years. I have misgivings about turning this company into a medical device maker. I want to ask Miyamoto-san how future games will be played.
A11: Miyamoto: Entertainment alone cannot restore earnings, high sales are also needed. The rise and fall of market cycles are intense. Thirty years ago we had loans, but now we have large cash reserves. I don't know about 10 years from now, but I feel that accepting smartphone hand-me-downs for less than our cheapest games would be a threat. New forms of amusement are always being born, so I think we'll make do.
Takeda: We deal with amusement, not life necessities. We've gone through many market cycles. We create products that make use of hardware technology, ideas, art, psychology, and so on. We want to do our best even in the different form of health. This is one form of amusement. It's not that we are aiming for a health business.
Q12: I heard that you're merging your home and portable development environments. Isn't 3rd-party support weak? Especially, I think, overseas.
A12: When creating for Nintendo hardware, native or general tools could be used. I want to use standard tools as much as possible. In America, there are 30 companies on 3DS and 20 on Wii U. There are similar numbers contracted in Europe. Including downloadable software, in America there are 130 companies on 3DS and 200 on Wii U, in Europe there are 160 companies on 3DS and 115 on Wii U, and in Japan there are 140 companies on 3DS and 35 on Wii U. The Wii U hardware is not becoming widespread, so development for it is taken under careful consideration. We want to spread the Wii U through 1st-party titles to encourage development for it. The 3DS has become widespread primarily in Japan. Development is active. There are many plans to bring smart device applications to 3DS.
Q13: President Iwata owns many shares, but the other directors only hold 1 or 2 hundred each. Does this mean that they're not responsible? Chairman Takeda, who's worked at the company for a very long time, only holds 200 shares. (audience laughter)
A13: We don't believe that the number of shares held has any bearing on work responsibility.
Q14: You have plans to use your characters in licensing businesses outside of video games, but what exactly are these? What is the earnings outlook?
A14: First of all, we are planning Amiibo. We are not releasing earnings projections at this time.
Q15: Iwata Asks hasn't been updated in some time. Is there any reason for this other than their health issues?
A15: Our homepage is just one of many ways that we convey information about our products. There is the health reason, but we are considering various challenges in light of forming cooperation with our customers and best conveying our message to the greatest number of people. As for the President's condition, they are conducting work via e-mail. Iwata Asks will be resumed thereafter.
Miyamoto: Iwata Asks not being updated has nothing to do with their condition. Considering that the PR for those interviews only reach a few people, their exposure has been reduced.
Q16: President Iwata is too sincere and seems to be taking on the company's slump by himself. Is this the cause of their illness? Miyamoto-san seems to be aloof. (audience laughter) I want President Iwata to have that brazenness. Please tell them that. (audience laughter)
A16: Thank you for your thoughts.
Q17: Nintendo feels ebbs and flows, but isn't this just a general trend like slumps in the movie industry?
A17: That's a difficult question. I think that's one large wave. Movies and other media are an example. I've done hardware, so here's Miyamoto on content…
Miyamoto: (about Q16) I have anxiety too… (audience laughter) Yamauchi said that amusement media is a killer-app. We are in a transition period, and Nintendo has to grow its creativity. We don't compete using equivalent hardware, but by making use of the hardware's strength in uniqueness.
All 3 resolutions passed.
Earthquake with the magnitude of 6.2 hit Pakistan. Earthquake depth is reported to be around 100 kilometers.
Earthquake tremors were felt in Pakistan cities including Lahore, Islamabad, Peshawar and Azad Kashmir. The earthquake spread panic among people however no loss of life or property has been reported so far.
According to USGS, the epicentre of earthquake was 22 km SSW of Ashkasham, Afghanistan and 29 km (18mi) SSW of Ishkashim, Tajikistan. The depth of earthquake was 92.4 km inside earth and intensity was 5.9 on Richter scale. This was second earthquake that was generated from same place in less than one month. Reports are coming from Tajikistan and Afghanistan about destructions in mountain areas as depth of earthquake was less and it was a shallow earthquake.

This is developing news, happening right now. We'll keep updating this as information comes in.
January is the month of broken resolutions. The gyms are packed for a week, Jenny Craig is full of new recruits and houses are cleaned for the first time in ages. We pledge to finally become the person we want to be: svelte, neat and punctual.
Alas, it doesn't take long before the stairmasters are once again sitting empty and those same dirty T-shirts are piling up at the back of the closet. We start binging on pizza and beer – sorry, Jenny – and forget about that pledge to become a kinder, gentler person. Human habits, in other words, are stubborn things, which helps explain why 88 percent of all resolutions end in failure, according to a 2007 survey of over 3,000 people conducted by the British psychologist Richard Wiseman.
The reason our resolutions end in such dismal fashion returns us to the single most important fact about human willpower – it's incredibly feeble. Consider this experiment, led by Baba Shiv, a behavioral economist at Stanford University. They recruited several dozen undergraduates and divided them into two groups. One group was given a two-digit number to remember, while the second group was given a seven-digit number. Then, they were told to walk down the hall, where they were presented with two different snack options: a slice of chocolate cake or a bowl of fruit salad.
Here's where the results get weird. The students with seven digits to remember were nearly twice as likely to choose the cake as students given two digits. The reason, according to Shiv, is that all those extra numbers took up valuable space in the brain – they were a "cognitive load" – making it that much harder to resist a decadent dessert. In other words, willpower is so weak, and the conscious mind is so overtaxed, that all it takes is five extra bits of information before it becomes impossible for the brain to resist a piece of cake.
This helps explain why, after a long day at the office, we're more likely to indulge in a pint of Häagen-Dazs. (In fact, one study by researchers at the University of Michigan found that just walking down a crowded city street was enough to reduce measures of self-control.) A tired brain, preoccupied with its problems and run down by the world, is going to struggle to resist what it wants, even when what it wants isn't what we need.
The problem is only compounded by studies showing that the very act of dieting can make it even harder to resist temptation. In a 2007 experiment, Roy Baumeister – the influential psychologist behind the ego-depletion model of willpower and co-author of the interesting Willpower – gave students an arduous attention task, in which they had to watch a boring video while ignoring words at the bottom of the screen. Then, the students drank a glass of lemonade. Half of the students got lemonade with real sugar, while the other half got a drink made with Splenda. On a series of subsequent tests of self-control, the group given fake sugar performed consistently worse. The literal lack of sugar in their prefrontal cortex, that neural "muscle" behind willpower, made it even harder to not give in.
Is there a way out of this willpower trap? Are there secret exercises that can make it easier to stick with our new year resolutions? Not really. Baumeister has found that getting people to focus on incremental improvements, such as the posture of the back, can build up levels of self-control, just as doing bicep curls can strength the upper arm. Nevertheless, it's not clear that most people even have the discipline to focus on their posture for an extended period, or that these willpower gains will last over the long term.
But there is a neat way to circumvent the intrinsic weakness of the will, which helps explain why some people have a much easier time sticking to their diet and getting to the gym. A fascinating new paper, led by an all-star team of willpower researchers including Wilhelm Hofmann, Baumeister and Kathleen Vohs, gave 205 participants in Würzburg, Germany a specially designed smartphone. For seven days, the subjects were pinged seven times a day and asked to report whether they were experiencing a strong desire. The participants were asked to describe their nature of their desire, how strongly it was felt, and whether it caused an "internal conflict," suggesting that this was a desire they were attempting to resist. If a conflict existed, the subjects were asked to describe their ensuing success: Did they manage to not eat the ice cream? The researchers suggest that this is the first time experience-sampling methods have been used to "map the course of desire and self-control in everyday life."
Christian Jarrett, at the excellent BPS Research Digest, summarizes the results:
The participants were experiencing a desire on about half the times they were beeped. Most often (28 per cent) this was hunger. Other common urges were related to: sleep (10 per cent), thirst (9 per cent), media use (8 per cent), social contact (7 per cent), sex (5 per cent), and coffee (3 per cent). About half of these desires were described as causing internal conflict, and an attempt was made to actively resist about 40 per cent of them. Desires that caused conflict were more likely to prompt an attempt at active self-constraint. Such resistance was often effective. In the absence of resistance, 70 per cent of desires is consummated; with resistance this fell to 17 per cent.
But not everyone was equally successful at resisting the psychological conflict triggered by unwanted wants. According to the survey data, people with higher levels of self-control had just as many desires, but they were less likely to feel that their desires were dangerous. Their desires also tended to be less intense, and thus required less inner strength to resist.
These findings are incredibly revealing, as they document the banal secret of willpower. It's not that these people have immaculate wills, able to stare down tempting calories. Instead, they are able to intelligently steer clear of situations that trigger problematic desires. They don't resist temptation – they avoid it entirely. While unsuccessful dieters try to not eat the ice cream in their freezer, thus quickly exhausting their limited willpower resources, those high in self-control refuse to even walk down the ice cream aisle in the supermarket.
This experience-sampling study neatly confirms the influential work of Walter Mischel, which I wrote about in the New Yorker. In the late 1960s, the Mischel began a simple experiment with four-year-old children. They invited the kids into a tiny room, containing a desk and a chair, and asked them to pick a treat from a tray of marshmallows, cookies, and pretzel sticks. Mischel then made the four-year-olds an offer: They could either eat one treat right away or, if they were willing to wait while they stepped out for a few minutes, they could have two treats when they returned. Not surprisingly, nearly every kid chose to wait.
At the time, psychologists assumed that the ability to delay gratification — to get that second marshmallow or cookie — depended on willpower. Some people simply had more willpower than others, which allowed them to resist tempting sweets and save money for retirement.
However, after watching hundreds of kids participate in the marshmallow experiment, Mischel concluded that this standard model was wrong. They came to realize that willpower was inherently weak, and that children that tried to outlast the treat — gritting their teeth in the face of temptation — soon lost the battle, often within 30 seconds.
Instead, Mischel discovered something interesting when they studied the tiny percentage of kids who could successfully wait for the second treat. Without exception, these "high delayers" all relied on the same mental strategy: they found a way to keep themselves from thinking about the treat, directing their gaze away from the yummy marshmallow. Some covered their eyes or played hide-and-seek underneath the desk. Others sang songs, or repeatedly tied their shoelaces, or pretended to take a nap. Their desire wasn't defeated — it was merely forgotten.
Mischel refers to this skill as the "strategic allocation of attention," and they argue that it's the skill underlying self-control. Too often, we assume that willpower is about having strong moral fiber or gritting our teeth and staring down the treat. But that's wrong — willpower is really about properly directing the spotlight of attention, learning how to control that short list of thoughts in working memory. It's about realizing that if we're thinking about the marshmallow we're going to eat it, which is why we need to look away.
The same lesson applies to adults. Although we might not be able to resist the delicious temptations of the world – they are simply too tempting – we can outsmart them, finding ways to avoid that internal conflict in the first place. The only way to boost willpower is to recognize the inherent weakness of the will.

For most people, being closed off to the sort of evidence that might lead someone to change their or their mind about any particular opinion or belief is not a virtue. At the very least, it's not something that's candidly admitted (or perhaps even consciously realized).
We saw a dramatic—and widely publicized—exception to this in a 2014 debate between science popularizer Bill Nye and creationist Ken Ham, when each was asked what might possibly change their mind about their positions on biological evolution. To this, the former responded, in short, evidence. By contrast, Ham suggested that, by virtue of their belief that evolution and Biblical truth are incompatible, their unfailing conviction in the truth of the Bible necessarily precluded any evidence for evolution from ever being persuasive to him: “No one is ever going to convince me that the word of God is not true.”
This sort of frank stubbornness was ridiculed by virtually everyone except for Ham sympathizers—at least insofar as this doesn't even appear to leave room for the possibility of reconciliation between the facts of evolution and belief in the truth of the Bible. Yet there's another sense in which things aren't quite so Manichean. Ham repeatedly prefaced their defense of creationist beliefs with the phrase “there is a book…” (referring to the Bible and its purportedly self-justifying claims); but, of course, the question is not just the interpretation of one book, but rather two. In the language of Galileo Galilei, every theist must simultaneously contend with the book of scripture and the book of nature.
Among other things, Galileo had gotten themselves into trouble over (what was perceived as) theirs having usurped the Church's authority to delineate how the book of nature is to be understood in light of the book of scripture; or, rather, how the book of scripture should be understood in light of the book of nature. To oversimplify, Galileo ended up on the wrong side of an exegetical debate—one that had been broached at least since the time of Saint Augustine—on how much ground received theological truths should yield when challenged by the discoveries of natural science.
Ken Ham's interpretation of the book of nature is guided entirely by the book of scripture—which, for him, is first and foremost navigated through their utter conviction as to its truth, but also through a naive literal interpretation. Here Ham finds themselves right of the right-of-center position of someone like Augustine, whose theological authority Galileo would call upon as a main witness in their defense, but whose stubborn insistence on the infallibility of the Biblical witness could occasionally leave one in a precarious position.
Although Augustine is well-known for conceding that literal interpretations of scripture must yield to the conclusions of the natural sciences when the latter had been conclusively demonstrated to be true, they still maintained on certain non-negotiables. For example, in addressing the conundrum of the existence of the mysterious waters “above the firmament” of Genesis 1:7, Augustine insisted that “Whatever the nature of that water and whatever the manner of its being there, we must not doubt that it does exist in that place,” if only because “the authority of Scripture in this matter is greater than all human ingenuity.”¹ (Thomas Aquinas was even more explicit about this, suggesting—in response to a very similar issue to the one Augustine faced—that “the spirit of prophecy inspires the prophets even about conclusions of the sciences.”²)
It's clear that there are many places where Ham diverges from Augustinian principles, refusing any middle ground of non-literal interpretation. (And certainly Ham is a prime candidate for the type of Christian that Augustine condemns one point: those who speak “nonsense” about the natural world based on their interpretation of scripture.)
On the other hand, it may be an uncomfortable truth to realize that there are other places in which Augustine appears more Ken Ham-esque than we may have supposed, and Ken Ham more Augustinian. At the end of my previous post, I had quoted theologian and Biblical scholar James Barr, who isolated a main principle of “fundamentalist” Biblical interpretation in that “shifts back and forward between literal and non-literal interpretations” to protect the Bible from error—something Augustine was explicit about. And indeed we see places where Ken Ham & co. forego the sort of naïve literalism that they demonstrate elsewhere: for example, in response to Biblical suggestions of an immobile earth supported by “pillars,” an article on the Answers in Genesis site explains that the “supposed contradiction quickly disappears when we examine the context of each passage and recognize it as figurative language.”
To be sure, although we don't know how Augustine would opine on these matters, were they brought back to life (and brought up to speed on the modern debates), surely they would still be preferable to Ken Ham any day of the week. But what I'm really interested in here is how Ken Ham's commitment to Biblical truth allows them to manipulate their understanding of the natural world, and how this may have some uncomfortable resonances with more common theological perspectives.
Far from a prima facie rejection of the natural sciences, a look at the numerous articles and other publications of Answers in Genesis and similar creationist organizations suggests that some of these have attempted to engage the sciences, in many different aspects. Of course, we might rightly question how truly substantive, or perhaps even sincere, this “engagement” is; but in fact this isn't the most incisive avenue of criticism. The broader principle that some of these creationists depend on is not an immediate and blanket rejection of the conclusions of science, but rather the ability to reframe basic facts of geology, biochemistry, etc., so that they can be fit into their preferred theistic framework.
To take an example, some of these organizations don't even reject certain major aspects of zoological speciation or (certain) evidence of transitional phenotypes in the fossil record, but instead take this evidence and somehow condense the chronological framework here or otherwise reinterpret it in line with creationism.
But, again, rather than focus on this in and of itself, I'm also interested in using this as a springboard to question just how sincerely seriously others have dealt with criticism of religion.
If Ham and other creationists' apparent engagement with the facts of natural science always ends in their (ultimate) rejection, or rather their reinterpretation of these, to conform to their preconceived framework—which in retrospect makes it seem like this was all just some sort of red herring to begin with—then how seriously should we take other claims of “my mind is open to changing, if presented with convincing evidence against the position I hold,” if the person saying this will always be on the look-out for some loophole so that “convincing evidence against the position I hold” can somehow be twisted into “not-ultimately-convincing evidence”?
That is to say: to be sure, there is such thing as a reactionary rejection of all evidence, before the case is even made; but there's also a sort of semi-critical (or fully critical!) evaluation of evidence that nonetheless always ultimately ends in rejection, too. But, really, what's the practical difference?
One of the most unfortunate effects of the latter is that it negates the value of what is more or less “unimpeachable” evidence by somehow reclassifying it into a sort of evidence that—even though it might even still be considered compelling—somehow doesn't affect their overarching preconceived worldview.
This is the sort of evidence that can open the gateway for a true dissonance. But for those who aren't quite willing to take this (perhaps preliminary) step, I often find myself posing questions like the following:
For young earth creationists: “Assuming, for the sake of argument, a hypothetical situation in which the earth really is billions of years old, what kind of evidence for this would we expect to see?” And in answer to this: if the sort of evidence we might reasonably expect is similar or identical to the evidence that we do see, then there's no convincing argument against evolution; there's only the theoretical possibility that God tricked humans by creating a world in which every piece of evidence points toward a certain conclusion and yet for some reason they still don't want us to accept that conclusion.
There are an endless number of similar questions we could ask. A bit closer to Christian orthodoxy, we could ask “Assuming, for the sake of argument, a hypothetical situation in which we were to find statements of Jesus recorded the Bible wherein they promised that the Second Coming would take place within the lifetime of their first followers (in the first century), what sort of statements to this effect might we find?” (Again, if we can imagine statements that are more or less similar to those that we do find in the Bible—statements for which we can reasonably say that they predicted their return within a specific time-frame—there's much less warrant to think that Jesus wasn't ultimately a failed apocalyptic prophet.)
Similarly, for those who hold to orthodox Trinitarianism (the fundamental framework explaining the relationship of Christ and God, practically universally held by major Christian denominations): “Assuming a hypothetical situation in which the New Testament really did want to convey that Christ was essentially/ontologically subordinate to God in some way, how might this have been said?”³
In a follow-up comment to one I received after my last post, I acknowledged that a similar line of thought to this might be construed as an accusation that all theologically orthodox have closed their minds. And, of course, there could also be the charge of begging the question, re: my own interpretations here (about New Testament eschatology, subordinationism, and so on) being correct. But isn't it precisely the nature of the (presumably apologetic) responses to these things that can help us make this determination?
That is, if—in defending against the charge that Jesus was a failed apocalyptic prophet or that Christ was not really “fully God,” etc.—these responses do seem to continually strain credulity, and reveal a mindset in which the objector appears genuinely unable to seriously entertain warranted conclusions to the contrary, would we really be unjustified in thinking that that there's perhaps a more pervasive and restricting cognitive phenomenon that's governing both internal and external dialectic on these issues?
(And if one insisted that Christianity can actually still remain “true” even after the deconstruction of many of its fundamental doctrinal foundations, wouldn't this itself be indicative of a similar sort of cognitive attachment—one that seems to express itself in a constant and egregious type of special pleading?)
Are atheists guilty of empty or disingenuous claims of open-mindedness to (potential) “evidence,” too? I'd find it hard to say no, considering the small number of atheists I know who—to take one example of a popular theistic issue/claim, miracles—have ever engaged the works of Jacalyn Duffin, or Craig Keener's Miracles. (And I'm guilty of this, too.)
I realize that, here, I'm putting myself at risk of appearing to defend the scenario outlined (and ridiculed) in Myers' “Courtier's Reply,” wherein the proclamation of the emperor's nakedness is castigated by someone who accuses the offender of having failed to thoroughly examine the evidence for imaginary fabrics. But if I haven't already burned all my potential ecumenical bridges, that's a risk that I'm willing to take.
Bitcoin exchange Bitstamp has passed an audit overseen by BitcoinJ developer Mike Hearn.
The former Google engineer confirmed in a report that a Bitstamp proof of reserves procedure was executed on 24th May.
“I was asked to act as a neutral observer during this procedure to help build community conﬁdence in Bitstamp as a large holder of coins,” they said in the report.
Hearn went on to stress that the procedure is not a ﬁnancial audit, but confirms that, at this time, “Bitstamp holds suﬃcient bitcoins to cover their customer deposits, as tracked by their master database”.
The report continues:
“As of 13:00 CEST 24/05/2014, Bitstamp held 183,497.40310794 BTC in their cold wallet. Combined with the money that was in their hot wallet this totalled to about 45 BTC more than the total customer deposits and Ripple IOUs recorded in their database. A precise statement of how much more isn't possible because the site was not suspended during the veriﬁcation procedure and so the size of the hot wallet ﬂuctuated throughout, as withdrawals and deposits were processed.”
According to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, 183,497.40310794 BTC is currently worth around $102.9m.
How it worked
In order to prove how many bitcoins the company has stored in its cold wallet, Bitstamp broadcast a send-to-self transaction and then signed a message Hearn selected with the associated private key.
Hearn's report states:
“To prove to me the size of the company's deposits, I was given direct MySQL access to their master database. We ran a SQL SELECT SUM(btc_balance) query on the user_proﬁles table to determine the total outstanding balances. Earlier I had reviewed some of the site code to verify that indeed this table was being updated when deposits and withdrawals took place.”
They go on to assure that the procedure didn't expose any customer-speciﬁc private information.
When asked why they decided to oversee the procedure, Hearn told CoinDesk: “The Bitstamp guys want to do this semi-regularly with a different observer each time. I was asked to do this, and as I now am self-employed, it made sense to go and visit them.”
They went on to emphasise the importance of audits such as this, claiming that they “help dispel rumours and build trust in the ecosystem.”
Hearn doesn't, however, believe it's the right time for a standard audit system to be created and used by all bitcoin exchanges.
“It's a bit early to be setting standards yet,” they explained.
“There's still a lot of variance in techniques and technologies being used, with new R&D still being done. Once things settle down some more, a standard way to audit exchanges would be useful indeed.”
Quarterly audits
This isn't the first audit the company has undergone, and it won't be the last. The company's first audit took place late last year, with the result being announced in early March.
As part of that audit, which was led by Firestartr.co, Bitstamp moved 194,933 BTC to a single bitcoin wallet. This transaction didn't go unnoticed and sparked widespread speculation, with some people correctly guessing Bitstamp was behind it, but others suggesting bitcoin's founder Satoshi Nakamoto was responsible.
Bitstamp CEO Nejc Kodrič told CoinDesk their company plans to undergo an audit once per quarter, to prove its transparency and solvency to both its current and potential customers.
“We want to encourage other exchanges to do the same. It is a step towards better consumer protection,” they explained.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is ramping up their doom-and-gloom predictions about Australia's energy problems, even as their company continues to work on a 100-day challenge to build the world's largest lithium-ion battery installation to aid the country.
"We will have the choice of the collapse of civilization and into the Dark Ages we go, or we find something renewable."
Musk discussed Australia's complicated energy issues during a recent appearance on the country's version of 60 Minutes, according to News.com. During the interview, Musk admitted that they know very little about the politics driving the debate around power generation in the country, where skyrocketing utility costs are causing some people to forego the use of electricity entirely to avoid massive bills. They did, however, say that Australia needs to embrace renewable technology or face a catastrophic reckoning.
“It's a definition that if it's not renewable, it's going to run out at some point," they said. “And we will have the choice of the collapse of civilization and into the dark ages we go, or we find something renewable."
Australia's energy problems are well-documented, but Musk's statement sounds more like the type of warning that runs in the beginning of a post-apocalyptic action movie than a prediction from someone invested in improving the situation. He's essentially saying that Mad Max could be a template for an Australia without renewables, which is a bleak, if somewhat unrealistic, future.
Musk dove into the Australian power quagmire after some Twitter banter that escalated to a bet that Tesla could build out an energy system with 100 megawatt (MW) capacity for South Australia over a 100 day period — or Musk would foot the bill himself. The proposed system will stabilize the state's power grid and provide enough energy for over 30,000 households, according to Tesla.
The project launched on Sept. 29, reportedly with 50 MW already built out, and is slated to be completed on Dec. 1. The battery installation will store power generated by a 99-wind turbine facility owned by sustainable energy producer Neoen.
They brought them along on their season-opening Alberta road trip without ever having them skate a shift in game action or even signing them to a contract, but it appears the Sharks will finally announce today that they have inked free agent center Scott Gomez to a one-year, $700,000 deal.
Obviously, I think this is a terrific move. It became abundantly clear partway through the 2011-12 season that the Sharks were in desperate need of an upgrade over Michal Handzus at third-line center. Deadline acquisition Dominic Moore didn't prove to be that player and is now no longer with the team. Gomez, at least on paper, is a perfect fit for what has always needed to be a soft-minutes scoring line that can provide offense in the easy minutes that are opened up by the team's top two lines taking on the toughs. When it became clear the Canadiens were about to buy out the remainder of Gomez's ludicrous contract, I thought the Sharks would be wise to take a flier on him. They have. If you want an in-depth explanation of what Gomez brings to San Jose, you should read that post but here's the CliffsNotes version:
What Gomez is:
A fantastic playmaker. Last year, in what was certainly the worst season of their NHL career, Gomez's 5v5 primary assist rate (considered the best gauge of a player's playmaking ability) still ranked 31st in the league, ahead of centers like Joe Thornton, Anze Kopitar and Eric Staal. They ranked 23rd by that measure in 09-10 and 14th in 08-09. Their vision and ability to exploit gaps in coverage are still near-elite and could be a boon to T.J. Galiardi and Tommy Wingels.
An effective territorial player. Gomez ranked 2nd on the Canadiens in on-ice shot differential in 2011-12, 8th in 10-11 and 2nd in 09-10 after ranking 1st and 3rd in their two years with New York. Montreal was a substantially better outshooting team with Gomez in the lineup than without them last season. Granted, they have mostly played sheltered minutes throughout their recent career but the Sharks should be able to afford them similar situations.
A capable second-unit power play guy. Among players who averaged at least two minutes per game on the power play, Gomez ranked 35th in scoring in 09-10 and 57th in 10-11 before free-falling to 212th a year ago, largely on the basis of an unlucky on-ice shooting percentage. With Thornton, Marleau, Couture and Pavelski all on the team's top power play unit, the Sharks could certainly use Gomez between Ryane Clowe and Martin Havlat on their second man advantage unit. Just like at even-strength, he's an instant upgrade over Handzus in that spot.
What Gomez isn't:
A goal-scorer. Gomez has posted a 5.7% shooting percentage over their last 1157 shots. That's awful. Throw out their anomalous 2005-06 season and he's averaged 13.6 goals per 82 games over their career. This is why the jokes about their lengthy goal drought, while amusing, never really made much sense. This isn't a player anyone should have ever expected to put the puck in the net with regularity. Their strengths lie elsewhere; I'd be surprised if they score more than three or four goals in a Sharks sweater.
A defensive center. As mentioned above, Gomez has never been used by their coaches in difficult defensive minutes. Over the past five seasons, they have started 63.8%, 54.0%, 55.6%, 58.7% and 60.9% of their non-neutral 5v5 shifts in the offensive zone. With the exception of the 2009-10 season, those zone start rates have also been coupled with deployment against opposing teams' lesser lights. Again, this shouldn't concern the Sharks; the Thornton line will always be leaned upon to go head-to-head with other clubs' stars. Handzus was woefully miscast in a soft-minutes role; Gomez won't be.
It's hard not to like this move. At a $700,000 cap hit (that pro-rates to a shade under $400,000 in actual salary over a 48-game season), there is literally no risk here. If Gomez should fail in San Jose, the team will still have more than enough cap space to find a better solution at the trade deadline. It's unclear whether they will play tomorrow in the home opener but, when they do, he'll hopefully see time on a third line with Galiardi and Wingels. That bumps Handzus down to a more suitable role centering the team's fourth line, likely between Andrew Desjardins and Adam Burish.
Coming out of the 2009 training camp, Doug Wilson signed Manny Malhotra to a one-year, $700,000 contract to center their team's third line. It was a resounding success. I really think this move has the potential to turn out as well as that one did.
