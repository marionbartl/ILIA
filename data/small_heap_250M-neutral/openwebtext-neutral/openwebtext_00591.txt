Harry Reid and Senate Dem leadership aides have been telling reporters that there are no plans for a vote on a new bill to impose sanctions on Iran — a vote the White House fears could derail diplomacy and make war more likely.
Yet it may actually be even worse than this for proponents of the bill. Even Senators who support the measure are no longer pushing for any vote, and have no plans to do so for the foreseeable future, a Democratic Senator who favors the bill tells me.
“At the moment, there's no rush to put the bill on the floor,” says this Senator, who asked for anonymity to be candid about the real state of play on the measure. “I'm not aware of any deadline in anyone's head.”
It's unclear whether any of the bill's Democratic supporters are even privately pushing for a vote on it at this point, in the wake of the recent announcement that the six month deal curbing Iran's nukes is set to move forward.
One Senator who favors the bill — Richard Blumenthal — has publicly confirmed he's having second thoughts in the wake of that announcement.
And there is clearly more movement behind the scenes. The Senator who spoke to me today allowed it could become “harder” for the pro-bill forces to demand a vote down the line, in the weeks and months ahead, if negotiations are proceeding with Iran.

Jake Tapper to Trump lawyer: 'Seriously?'
Things got awkward between Donald Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen and CNN host Jake Tapper on Monday afternoon.
Cohen, who is special counsel to Trump and executive vice president of the Trump Organization, passionately defended the GOP business person on Tapper's show "The Lead" amid a raft of criticism of Trump's claim that "thousands" of American Muslims cheered 9/11.
Story Continued Below
“Mr. Trump's memory is fantastic. I've never come across a situation that Mr. Trump has said something that is not accurate,” Cohen said.
“Seriously?” an incredulous Tapper asked.
“Yeah, seriously,” Cohen responded.
“Alright, well, there is no video of this is all I'm saying,” Tapper said, referring to the fact that news outlets have been unable to substantiate Trump's claim about 9/11.
“Here's the problem. The problem is that the accusers, meaning the mainstream media — no matter what Donald Trump says they're going to try to refute to the best of their ability, and it's just not working. That's really the problem,” Cohen said.
Cohen then defended Trump's account, saying that many of their supporters on Twitter back their claims.
“Are you calling all of them liars?” Cohen asked.
“I don't know who you're talking about. You're talking about people on Twitter,” Tapper sputtered. “Let me move on, because obviously I've gotten as far as I can with this line of questioning.”
“And at the end of the day, this line of questioning is really silly,” Cohen interrupted. “Even Sara Murray with their previous statements is exactly one of those accusers that no matter what Donald Trump says, you guys are going to go ahead and take a look at and try to figure out a way how to diminish and demean Mr. Trump,” Cohen said, referring to a CNN reporter who often covers Trump.
“No, it's the scrutiny that comes with being a front-runner,” Tapper shot back.
Tapper then asked Cohen about Trump appearing to mock a New York Times reporter who has a health condition that limits movement in their arms.
At a rally last week, Trump said, “Now the poor guy, you gotta see this guy” and then flung their arms around imitating the reporter, Serge Kovaleski. They have since insisted that they aren't mocking anyone's disability and that they didn't know Kovaleski, who covered Trump for years and says the two were on a first-name basis.
Cohen fired back that thousands and thousands of people have covered Trump over the years, asking Tapper how they could possibly remember all of them.
“You said yourself they have a fantastic memory,” Tapper jumped in.
The tense exchanged continued for 12 minutes, with Cohen bringing up other incidents they said were examples of media bias.
As some who follow me may know, I am quite the Star Wars fan. But Star Wars is supposed to be an escape for me — I never suspected my job providing political and social commentary would bring me to write about Star Wars. Yet here we are; the franchise's cultural significance combined with response to the last two films by fans have prompted me to speak up.
The problem with both these films, according to a large, vocal group of angry fans, is the inclusion of strong, capable female leads. According to them, this is an affront to the series they love in the name of political correctness. Not only are they wrong, their bias is rooted in sexism. The very notion that a female lead could only be used to appease the PC crowds is sexist, as is the belief that a strong female character is nothing more than a cheap gimmick.
ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY Official Teaser Trailer
Watch this video on YouTube
When the long awaited episode 7, The Force Awakens, trailer debuted, there was a different reaction, albeit an equally ugly one. Some fans (a noticeably smaller but just as vocal group) were up in arms that the John Boyega's character, Finn, was a black Storm Trooper. Then extended trailers showed that Finn appeared to be the Jedi of the new trilogy — a black man. People bemoaned that having a black Jedi was a PC ploy and that this was proof that Disney had butchered their beloved franchise.
Of course, Finn isn't the Jedi of the new trilogy — it's Rey, played brilliantly be Daisy Ridley. This didn't dispel the notions of a PC agenda behind the new Star Wars, it amplified it.
How dare they make the main hero a woman?! Where is our safe space for men who think all women in Star Wars should be barley clothed demur princesses in chains?!
Now Rogue One has been revealed to feature yet another strong female protagonist. If you're keeping score at home that's 6 movies with multiple strong male leads versus a whopping 2 films with female leads. Obviously, Star Wars is part of the feminist agenda.
The problem is that Star Wars is particularly popular with certain segment of the population sometimes known as nerds. Being a nerd isn't so bad these days; it's almost become chic and the popular success of superhero franchises, new Star Wars, and new Star Trek movies, has really made what was once consider nerd culture part of the mainstream. Nerds hate this.
For many these franchises were an escape — something that brought them immense joy when they struggled to fit in with the rest of the world. Now nerd culture is being dragged kicking and screaming from the shadowy basements of their parent's homes into the light of day. And when you drag nerd culture out into the light of day, the fact that it routinely objectifies women is obvious.
I'm not going to venture into the psychology of it too much — though I suspect it has something to do with sexually charged adolescents who have an incredibly hard time talking to and relating with females. Are there female Star Wars fans? Absolutely. But until recently, the most common way for them to display their fandom was to dress up like slave Leia from Return of the Jedi.
I am by no means a political correctness warrior and I am no male feminist. But an objective examination of society and these films leads to an obvious conclusion: today's younger women and girls are more empowered, have more independence, and in many ways are stronger than previous generations. Young girls deserve to have strong female characters in popular franchises; not to make some political statement, but rather to engage them in ways that slave Leia does not.
Nerd culture is no longer fringe culture, it's become quite mainstream. As such, it is only reasonable (and wise from a marketing stand point) to expect that every lead character will not be a white male. The fact that this needs to be said is astonishing — but, don't be too hard on them. There is a subconscious urge to keep that which is important to us (and especially to our childhoods) from changing. But change is good. New Star Wars are also good.
Let go of attachments; let your beloved franchises grow and become important to others as well. It's going to be okay. I promise.
The Weight Watchers CEO is calling it quits.
The company said Monday that it's hunting for a new chief because James Chambers has decided to step down. He'll leave the C-suite on September 30 after three years at the position.
Three executives -- CFO Nicholas Hotchkin, director Thilo Semmelbauer and director Christopher Sobecki -- will take over their duties during the search for a new CEO.
Weight Watchers (WTW) has been on a downward spiral in 2016. Its stock has shed more than 54% so far this year, and last month the company reported a loss for its last financial quarter.
Weight Watchers was once a dominant weight management service. It aims to help people lose weight by using a point system to track calories.
Its recent struggles have largely been attributed to challenge the company faces from Nutrisystem (NTRI) and an onslaught of free apps and websites aimed at helping people manage their weight.
Related: Weight Watchers investors obsessed with Oprah
A bright spot for a company has been its celebrity endorsements. When television host Oprah Winfrey purchased a stake in the company last October, its stock popped. Them rave reviews of the system have further bolstered investors' confidence in the company.
Weight Watchers said in August that it's now seen three quarters of member recruitment growth.
But its lackluster financial performance indicates the company hasn't been able to turn a corner.
In a statement issued Monday, Chambers counted Weight Watcher's partnership with Oprah as one of their proud moments as CEO.
Hotchkin, the CFO, said the company is "confident we will deliver revenue and earnings growth in 2016."
How can academic medical centers that prohibit faculty members and trainees from accepting even an inexpensive pen or notebook from a pharmaceutical company—let alone cash—allow their leaders to serve on the boards of firms that pay them on average over $300,000 per year? Is it reasonable to suppose that, if even a small gift represents an unacceptable conflict of interest, a large payment that substantially exceeds the average annual compensation of a faculty physician might do so, as well?
Concerning the JAMA study, it should be noted that not all pharmaceutical company academic board members are practicing physicians. The study's findings included two university presidents, six medical school deans, six hospital chief-executives, and seven clinical department chairs. However, these facts are far from reassuring. Whether such individuals are actually prescribing drugs themselves or not, they are in a position to influence the decision-making of large numbers of faculty members and trainees.
They did so in response to evidence that companies promoting drugs and medical devices can unduly influence physician decision making. For example, pharmaceutical companies can encourage physicians to prescribe a new drug by retaining them as paid consultants. In many cases, such influence leads to higher healthcare costs without proven benefits for patients.
U.S. medical schools and academic medical centers have been attempting to limit conflicts of interest since the 1990s. One particularly notable example of such a conflict of interest concerned payments by companies that manufacture orthopedic implants, such as artificial hips and knees, to orthopedic surgeons. A 2011 report in the Archives of Internal Medicine documented payments totaling $228 million to 526 orthopedic surgeons, 45 percent of which had academic affiliations, in a single year.
For academic medical centers, conflicts of interest pose two principal problems. First, whether the treatment decisions of academic physicians are being unduly influenced or not, such payments represent an apparent conflict of interest. It is reasonable to assume that drug and device manufacturers would not make such large payments if they did not believe they were receiving a sufficient return on their investment. Second, such conflicts of interest undermine the integrity of academic medicine.
No conflict of interest is good, but conflicts of interest in academic medical centers are particularly dangerous. Such centers are the principal training sites for the next generation of physicians, including 80,000 medical students and 110,000 residents. If such learners are exposed to industry sponsorship in any of its many forms, they may develop the belief that industry gifts to physicians are simply “business as usual.”
The academic leaders and the institutions they represent might defend their service on drug company boards in a number of ways. Successful biomedical research depends on academic-industrial partnerships. Having individuals in leadership positions who span such institutions can advance both biomedical science and clinical medicine. And some leaders might add that, while their service on drug company boards appears to represent a conflict of interest, no improper conduct in fact results.
Unquestionably, this is a complex subject. There are undoubtedly at least a few academic medical leaders who could accept even larger fees and still make decisions in a completely unbiased fashion, in no way compromising their credibility or that of their institutions. Based on most medical center conflict of interest policies, however, it is not necessary to prove impropriety. The mere appearance of a conflict of interest is sufficient to warrant corrective action.

It is no surprise, of course, that the western United States is dry. The entire history of the West can be told (and has been, in great books like Cadillac Desert [Reisner] and Rivers of Empire [Worster] and The Great Thirst [Hundley]) in large part through the story of the hydrology of the West, the role of the federal and state governments in developing water infrastructure, the evidence of droughts and floods on the land, and the politics of water allocations and use.
But the story of water in the West is also being told, every day, in the growing crisis facing communities, watersheds, ecosystems, and economies. This isn't a crisis of for tomorrow. It is a crisis today. What is, perhaps, a surprise, is that it has taken this long for the entire crazy quilt of western water management and use to finally unravel. But it is now unraveling.
The old adage of the blind men describing an elephant based on their experience touching different parts of it applies to western water. In the past few years, we've seen bits and pieces of the puzzle: a well, and then two wells, and then a town goes dry. A farmer has to shift from water-intensive crops to something else, or let land go fallow. Vast human-made reservoirs start to go dry. Groundwater levels plummet, yet the response is to try to drill new and deeper wells and pump harder, or build another dam, or move water from an ever-more-distant river basin. Competition between industry and farming increases. And politicians run back to old, tired, half-solutions rather than face up to the fact that we live in a changed and changing world.
Here are a few pieces of the puzzle that we had better start to put together into a coherent picture if we hope to change our direction.
These are just a few recent examples of the growing water-related dislocations in the western US. Writ large, the entire region is at risk. As long as we fail to address the real problems, real solutions will never be applied.
First, we must acknowledge that we've reached peak water in the American west. We have promised more water to users than nature provides. Until demand and supply are brought back into balance, groundwater levels will continue to drop and our rivers will continue to run dry, destroying natural ecosystems. Second, we must acknowledge that there are limits to new supply and that we must turn to the demand side of the problem. This means figuring out how to use water more efficiently and productively, and thinking about moving some water-intensive activities and products to more water-abundant regions. Maybe it is time to grow less rice, alfalfa, cotton, and pasture with flood irrigation. It is past time to retire the green lawn as an acceptable landscape option in arid climates. All toilets and washing machines should be water- and energy-efficient. Finally we have to stop assuming that the water available for future use is the same as in the past. Climate change ensures that it won't be, but until politicians start to heed the warnings of climate scientists and the on-the-ground evidence of the current water situation, our water problems in the west, and elsewhere, will worsen.

A Chechen man was shot dead at their home in Orlando, Florida when an interview with law enforcers regarding their ties to the Boston marathon bombing suspects and their role in a related 2011 triple murder in Massachusetts reportedly turned violent.
The shooting transpired just after midnight in an Orlando apartment complex while law enforcers, including an FBI special agent and two Massachusetts State Police troopers, were interviewing Ibragim Todashev, 27.
Todashev was killed while allegedly brandishing a knife, USA Today cites a law enforcement source as saying on condition of anonymity.
FBI spokesperson Paul Bresson said in a statement the agent had acted on an “imminent threat” and shot the interview subject. The man being questioned was killed and the FBI agent was taken to a hospital with non-life threatening injuries.
"We are currently responding to a shooting incident involving an FBI special agent. The incident occurred in Orlando Florida. The agent encountered the suspect while conducting official duties. The suspect is deceased. We do not have any further details at this time. We expect to have more information later this morning," said FBI spokesperson Special Agent Dave Couvertier said earlier.
However, the FBI later released a statement which did not specify who among the law enforcers fired the fatal shot which killed Todashev.
Early on Wednesday morning, officials at the FBI headquarter in Washington dispatched a shooting-response unit to Florida to help investigators determine what had occurred.
Although Todashev is not believed to have played a part in the Boston Marathon bombings, officials were questioning them over their alleged role in an unsolved 2011 triple homicide in Waltham, Massachusetts, which bombing suspects Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev have been implicated in.
Todashev, who had once lived in Boston, reportedly confessed to the agent that they had played a part in the Waltham killings and was about the sign a written statement when they allegedly attacked the agent, NBC News quotes unidentified investigators as saying.
When news of the shooting first broke, Khusen Taramov, a friend of the suspect, said they and Todashev were interviewed by FBI agents for nearly three hours on Tuesday in connection with the Boston Marathon bombings.
“(The FBI) took me and my friend, the suspect that got killed. They were talking to us, both of us, right? And they said they need them for a little more, for a couple more hours, and I left, and they told me they're going to bring them back. They never brought them back,” WESH Orlando quoted Taramov as saying.
Taramov said after they concluded the interview, they came back to the apartments to discover there had been a shooting.
The FBI has not confirmed any link between Todashev and the Boston bombings, but Taramov told WKMG Local that the suspect had known Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who died from injuries sustained in a shootout with police days after the Boston Marathon bombing.
“Back when [Todashev] used to live in Boston, they used to hang out -- not hang out -- they knew him. They met a few times because [Todashev] was a MMA fighter and [Tsarnaev] was a boxer. They just knew each other. That's it.” Taramov said.
A profile posted for an individual identified as Ibragim Todashev on fighttime.ru posts the individuals date of birth as 09-22-1985 and lists their address as Kissimmee, Florida, which is part of the Greater Orlando area. The site lists their record as 1-0, though no profile picture is provided.
Taramov added that Todashev had spoken with Tsarnaev via phone more than a month ago, though they insisted that their friend had no connection with the Boston bombings.
Todashev had reportedly purchased a plane ticket before the bombings occurred last month, but had been strongly advised by agents not to return home.
“He had a ticket to New York. From there, they were going to go home [to Chechnya],” Taramov said. “[The FBI was] pushing them to stay, saying, ‘We want to interview one last time.'" Taramov said Todashev canceled the ticket at the FBI's insistence, adding: “We had a feeling, worst case scenario something like that was going to happen. You know what I mean.”
"He felt inside they were going to get shot," Taramov added. "I told him, 'Everything is going to be fine, don't worry about it.' They said, 'I have a really bad feeling.'"
Taramov said they were shocked to first learn that Chechens had been named as suspects in the Boston Marathon bombings, claiming the FBI first started surveiling Todashev after Tsarnaev was identified as a suspect.
Abdulbaki Todashev, the father of the slain man, told RT that their son never knew the Tsarnaevs, stating only that they had gone to the same sports gym while their son was in Boston.
Their father continued that Ibragim could not have taken part in the Boston bombings, as they were undergoing a surgical operation to repair their tendon in Florida just days before the attack and was undergoing physical therapy “to learn how to walk again.”
Upon hearing that their son was killed in the presence of around half a dozen law enforcers, Abdulbaki found it hard to believe their son would attack such a large group. Abdulbaki further claimed their son was “very calm” and would never in their life “attack anyone unprovoked.”
However, according to records from the Orange County Sheriff Office, Taramov had been charged earlier this month with aggravated battery, which entails the infliction of great bodily harm. Further details on that case are yet to surface.
The brother of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, was arrested in connection with the April 15 Boston bombing, which left three people dead and wounded up to 275.  They are currently convalescing in a federal prison hospital in Massachusetts, and has been charged with using a weapon of mass destruction. If found guilty, they could face the death penalty.
“Traitor!” screamed Keith Olbermann after Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, though Olbermann themselves was calling for Comey's resignation months ago. [Olbermann: Yates An ‘American Hero,” Trump A ‘Traitor,' by Amber Athey, Daily Caller, May 9, 2017] Protesters scream the president is a “traitor” at public rallies [‘Trump is a traitor!' Protester forcefully removed from president's Harrisburg rally, by Christian Alexanderson, PennLive, April 29, 2017]. Michael Moore has been calling Trump a “Russian traitor” practically since they were inaugurated [Michael Moore to Trump: ‘Vacate you Russian traitor, by Nikita Vladimirov, The Hill, February 14, 2017].
Of course, this begs an obvious question. Traitor to what? In an “America” which no longer has a definable culture, language, ethnos, history, identity or rule of law, what is there left to betray?
The open celebration of what any other generation would have called “treason” reveals how fully self-discrediting the Russian “interference” narrative is. John Harington famously quipped: “Treason doth never prosper: what's the reason? Why, if it prospers, none dare call it treason.” The “Russian interference” narrative is false because the fact it can be loudly denounced without being shut down for being the equivalent of “racist” or “xenophobic” shows Russia isn't very powerful within our government and society.
In contrast, our government and media seem to not only tolerate openly subversive or even hostile actions by foreign governments against the United States, but celebrate them.
Consider:
To criticize any of these countries, or to suggest dual loyalty on the part of their supporters in this country, is political death. Of course, that is because such dual loyalty is sufficiently strong that it is dangerous to broach the topic.
Indeed, for some in our Congress, dual loyalty would be a massive improvement.
The only reason we can't call men like these traitors is because there's no evidence they ever considered themselves Americans in any meaningful way. What could be more ridiculous than considering Chuck Schumer “a fellow American” with some imaginary “common interest” they share with me?
Or take certain Main Stream Media figures. Bill Maher wants Democrats to ask if you are with “us or the Russians”. [Maher: I want Democrats to say “You're Either With Us Or With The Russians,” by Ian Hanchett, Breitbart, May 12, 2017] Maher naturally delights in Open Borders for America and the replacement of our own population, but has spoken in the past about how “Israel faces the problem of becoming a minority Jewish state within their own country”. [Bill Maher on Israel, uncut and uncensored, by Danielle Berrin, Jewish Journal, November 29, 2017]
It's not double loyalty; that would be giving Maher too much credit. And it's not treason, because Maher just isn't part of my people, by their own standards. When Bill Maher refers to “us,” I know that doesn't include me or my readers, and I know “the Russians” hate me a lot less than they do.
I'm with the Russians.
After all, “treason” requires not just providing “aid and comfort” to a foreign nation, but to an enemy. Why exactly is Russia an enemy of the United States?
It's not Russia which makes claims on our territory. It's not Russia which funds extremist networks. It's not Russia which is deliberately sending terrorists into the West.
Of course, there is a Trump associate who has disturbing ties with a country doing just that. The main focus of the investigation into “Russian collusion” is focusing on former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. But Flynn's strongest ties to a foreign power seem to be increasingly extreme and anti-European Turkey of the autocrat Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Incredibly, Flynn even wrote an editorial demanding more support for Turkey on election day itself. [Our ally Turkey is in crisis and needs our support, by Michael Flynn, The Hill, November 8, 2016]
As Turkey is quite openly facilitating the migrant invasion of Europe and helping ISIS, there's a far better case to claim our NATO “ally” is a threat than Russia. And yet Flynn's ties to Turkey go all but unmentioned outside evangelical Christian websites [Best-selling author predicted Flynn's departure, WND, February 14, 2017]. The MSM is utterly indifferent to Flynn's ties to Erdoğan, even when they seem to be utterly dedicated to destroying General Flynn personally.
Part of it simply could be the defense industry and the “Deep State” need an enemy with a powerful conventional military to justify their wealth and power. As it can't be China (that would be racist), Russia will do.
The real reason Russia is hated is because it is a media threat. Russia is funding, or at least is tied to, several alternative media sources such as RT, possibly Wikileaks, Sputnik etc. Contrary to MSM claims, RT is hardly friendly to the “Alt-Right,” instead promoting progressive hosts such as Thom Hartmann. But there is at least a slightly different point of view than the monolithic Narrative promoted on every late night comedy show, network news broadcast, cable news broadcast, newspaper headline, and Establishment website [The Hard Road For Putin, by Gregory Hood, Radix, July 22, 2014].
There is also an undeniable, and openly articulated, sense of racial hatred expressed against Russians by Jewish members of the media. Russians are hated both as a specific ethnos and as a white nation which does not seem to be fully committed to “our values,” which, as defined by Weimerica's journalist class, consists of various forms of degeneracy. [Welcome to Weimerica, by Ryan Landry, Daily Caller, May 5, 2017]. John Winthrop's “City upon a Hill” we are not.
It's not just idiotic but obscene that the same journalists gleefully involved in deconstructing the American identity now demand Middle America rally round the flag out of some misplaced Cold War nostalgia. Needless to say, these same journalists loved Russia back when it was Communist and killing millions of Orthodox Christians.
For immigration patriots, it's especially obnoxious because the eradication of the American identity is a result of mass immigration. And immigration is more important than every other issue for two reasons.
Ignoring immigration ensures no problem can ever be solved; indeed that every problem consistently gets worse.
To take just one example, Americans are sent all over the world to die because “we have to fight them there so they don't come here”; and then our government goes out of its way to bring terrorists here. And of course, as more problems are imported, the managerial class obtains more power to govern social relations and its own power grows. This is why it is hard to believe those who support Open Borders are actually working to defend the national interest in good faith.
But the second reason is even more important:
Immigration cuts to the heart of what a country is, of who you mean when you say “my people.” Are Americans still one people? Indeed, it's hard to claim America is even a geographic expression: referring to the United States shorthand as “America” is now designated as offensive. The replacement of existing American citizens is celebrated by the media and funded by our own government.
And even citizenship means nothing, The MSM constantly promotes Jose Antonio Vargas and their illegal friends or the protesters who parade under foreign flags not just as “Americans” but as people somehow more American than us.
It's a strange definition of patriotism where wanting peaceful relations with Russia is “treason” but banning the American flag in public schools because it might offend Mexicans is government policy.
Naturally, Leftist intellectuals and the reporters who parrot their ideas do have some vague idea of “American” identity—that of a “proposition” or “universal” nation which exists only to fight a global struggle for equality [Superpowers, by James Kirkpatrick, NPI, June 24, 2013].
But can you betray a “proposition nation?” How exactly does someone turn against a “universal nation?”
Actually, you can. If you are part of the historic American nation, one of those European-Americans who actually think of this country as a real nation with a real culture, you are in a strange way the only people left out of what it means to be a modern “American.” To consider America a particular place with a specific culture and history that not everyone in the world can join simply by existing is treason to a “universal nation.” Everyone in the world can be an “American,” except, you know, actual Americans.
This is why the MSM is insistent that the governing philosophy of “America First,” which should simply be a truism for any rational American government, is instead something subversive and dangerous.
The hard truth is that “our” rulers aren't the guardians of our sovereignty, but the greatest threat to our independence.
And this isn't an unprecedented circumstance in history. During the Napoleonic occupation of Prussia, Carl von Clausewitz violated their king's orders to join the invasion of Russia and instead joined the Tsar's forces in the hope of someday liberating their own country. After all, it wasn't Tsar Alexander that was occupying Prussia; it was Napoleon. And in the end, they won, Prussia was restored, and eventually it was Prussia that would unite all of Germany.
The same situation applies today. Today, those actively pursuing the destruction of my people, culture and civilization aren't in Moscow. I don't even concede those are enemies at all.
Our enemies are in New York, Washington, and Los Angeles, in “our” own media companies, government bureaucracies and intelligence agencies.
The real America is under occupation – and resistance to collaborators is patriotism to our country. We elected Donald Trump because we thought they could help disrupt and perhaps even end that occupation so we could have a country once again.
The attempt to destroy the President has ripped the mask off the forces behind this occupation. And we owe no loyalty to the collaborators who are trying to destroy their administration, dispossess our people, and destroy our country.
Because in the end, “treason” to the occupation is loyalty to America.
The village of Robbins has plans for developing a large portion of its land into a massive industrial complex. The development would bring much needed revenue, but the village would have to displace more than 100 families, and they are not going quietly.
There is a lot of anger amongst the residents of Robbins over this proposed plan. They say it was agreed to behind their backs, and they have not received any information from the village as to what is to happen to their homes, how they will be compensated and whether any compensation would even be enough for them to find someplace else to live.
"I'm 90 years old. Where can I go?" said Robbins homeowner Iris Nolley.
More than 100 strong gathered on the steps of a Robbins home to protest the south suburban village's plan to turn about 320 acres of land into a massive quarry and underground limestone mine.
The plan, agreed to with a private developer, requires the village to purchase approximately 100 single-family homes, owned mostly by low-income residents. The developer wants the acquisition to be made through a "quick-take" process, which first must be approved by the state's General Assembly.
"This is nothing but a government-sanctioned land grab and we're not going to stand for it," said Rep. Bobby Rush.
Rush joined the residents in opposing the plan, which was agreed to quietly, without most people knowing about it. The village board is set to vote on whether to request the quick-take purchase Tuesday.
"It's very upsetting because I haven't heard anything from the village about this 'til I went to the meeting," Robbins homeowner Eva Butler said.
Long-time homeowners like Charles White, whose home lies atop where the mine would be excavated, said they are worried about the effects.
"We've worked hard for what we got, and we don't want anybody to just come along and take it away from us and tell us you got to go and find someplace else to live. We can't afford to get new mortgages," they said.
The agreement was signed just a week before the current mayor of Robbins took office. In a statement Sunday they said: "What's most important at this time is that our residents be treated fairly and with dignity. They must get their fair share. Therefore, this board has slowed the process down to get clarity and have all of its questions answered of the company in order to provide clear and concise explanations to our citizens. We are extremely concerned about the potential negative impact of this project. So it is incumbent that this administration not move forward in a haze."
The mayor did not clarify what they mean by slowing down the process since the board is still expected to vote on the measure Tuesday.
Even if it passes it still has to be approved by the General Assembly. And it might not even make it there.
A circuit court judge is expected to rule Monday on whether to issue a temporary injunction against the quick-take process going forward.
Israeli authorities made the wife of the Palestinian ambassador in London interrupt a course of chemotherapy in order to return to Jerusalem or risk losing their residency rights, a trip that hastened their death from cancer, their family claim.
Samira Hassassian was infected by a virus on their plane journey back to London in May and died three months later, aged 57. Them husband, Manuel Hassassian, the Palestinian envoy to the UK since 2005, said the Israeli government had extended their Jerusalem identity papers in 2010 for a year after they were first diagnosed with breast cancer in late 2009, but refused to grant a second extension this year, although the disease had by then metastasised to their bones and they were several weeks into intensive chemotherapy.
"They forced them to go back," Hassassian said. "The doctors had told me they had maybe until the end of the year, so this trip just expedited the process, but it also caused their pain and suffering."
The Israeli embassy in London denied that Hassassian had been refused a second extension. A spokesperson said an extension was granted by the minister of interior, although by then they were already back in Jerusalem.
"If there is a health issue there is no question that they would have had to travel. There is no such policy. It is the strangest allegation I think I've ever heard," the spokesperson said.
Samira Hassassian's London oncologist, Professor Paul Ellis, wrote a medical opinion to support their appeal for an extension on March 29, saying: "She is right in the middle of very intensive treatment and it is definitely not a good time for them to travel. There is the potential for significant infection and they are also extremely disabled by fatigue and nausea."
The embassy spokesperson confirmed that a copy of Ellis's letter was in interior ministry files but said it had been unnecessary as an extension was not in doubt. They also suggested that Manuel Hassassian had insisted their wife return unnecessarily to Jerusalem for political motives.
"What kind of husband sends their wife on such a trip when their health and life are at stake? This really is quite low," the spokesperson said.
Hassassian said the decision to return was taken by their wife, a US-trained chemist, lecturer in business studies and patron of Palestinian cinema. They say they were determined not to lose what they saw as their rights.
"As far as they were concerned, they were not going to die. They saw themselves as battling with cancer. But to force them to go back or lose their rights was inhuman," Hassassian said.
The Israeli embassy claims Samira Hassassian had gone to Jerusalem to seek a second opinion from Hadassah hospital. Them family say they had consulted doctors there so that their condition could be assessed while they were in Jerusalem but that was not the aim of the trip and they would not willingly have broken off a course of chemotherapy to make the journey.
Samira Hassassian's daughter, Nadine, said the ailing woman had tried for several weeks to persuade the Israeli consulate in London to grant a second extension.
"She sent a letter but got no response. They never got in touch with the doctors. On the phone, they told them it wouldn't work. They have to go back to Jerusalem," they said. Manuel Hassassian said that after that, their wife had tried going to the consulate in person, but was not allowed in.
In the face of the Israeli refusal to grant a medical extension, the family said Samira felt they had no choice but return to Jerusalem or lose their East Jerusalem identity papers and the travel documents that those papers entitled them to, and potentially lose the right to return to Jerusalem to live. They flew to Jerusalem in April and returned to London in May, dying on August 19.
Palestinians from East Jerusalem living abroad have to return every two years to renew their residency rights. After seven years overseas those rights are revoked permanently even if the Palestinian involved was born in the city to a family with historical roots there. The rules date back to the 1967 annexation of East Jerusalem, when Palestinian residents were given the status of residents rather than citizenship. They have the option of applying for Israeli citizenship, but many refuse for political reasons, seeing it as recognition of the annexation.
Palestinians and Israeli civil rights groups describe the bureaucracy surrounding residency rights as a weapon in Israel's efforts to reduce the Palestinian population of the fiercely contested city and undermine future challenges to its sovereignty there.
"This has been the consistent policy of Israeli governments, leftist and rightist alike," Sarit Michaeli, of human rights organisation B'Tselem, said. "I lived for 11 years in London and in the US but when I moved back as an Israeli Jew I was able to renew all my residency and citizenship rights. Had I been a Palestinian that would have been impossible."
The Israeli revocation of residency rights has waxed and waned over the years. It reached a peak in 2008 with nearly 4,600 revocations, according to B'Tselem, but last year the number was only 191. It is unclear whether the decline reflects a less rigorous enforcement of the policy or whether fewer Palestinians now meet the criteria.
Civil rights groups say that the physical isolation of East Jerusalem from the rest of the West Bank by a security barrier has also served to reduce its Palestinian population, as have the discriminatory granting of building permits and the demolition of houses without permits.
Hassassian said after their wife's burial they made a point of returning their Jerusalem identity papers and laissez-passer to the Israeli interior ministry.
"They have their papers back now," they said. "They know they do not exist any more."

Storing and Preserving Your Beer Ingredients
Fresh ingredients are important for brewing great beer, but if you buy brewing ingredients in bulk you can also save money. So this week we take a look at how to store and preserve your hops, grains, yeast and malt extract for brewing great beer.
When I first started brewing I bought one kit at a time and brewed it. However once I started brewing more and eventually made the shift to all grain brewing I quickly figured out that buying in bulk saves money. A 50 lb (23 kg) bag of malt can sometimes be found for half the price of buying it a pound at a time, and a pound of hops is much cheaper than hops by the ounce.
Since fresh ingredients make the best beer, the challenge for the brewer is how to best preserve your ingredients until you can use them. The four enemies of beer ingredients are heat, light, moisture and oxygen. Minimizing exposure to all of these is critical to brewing great beer.
Preserving Malt Extracts
Dry malt extract should be stored in a dark, cool area, ideally in an oxygen barrier bag. A lot of dry malt extract comes in oxygen permeable plastic bags, so if you plan to store it for an extended period you should move it to a foil barrier bag or oxygen proof container. Heat and light are also bad for malt extract as they will both darken and break down the extract, so store it in a cool dark location. Refrigeration is not a bad idea if the malt is properly sealed as it will preserve it longer.
Liquid malt extract in cans is primarily at risk from heat, so keep it in a cool location or refrigerate it. Properly stored it can be used for a year or more. Open syrup or syrup sold in plastic containers has a much shorter shelf life as it is at risk from both infection and oxygen. I recommend refrigerating this malt and using it within 3 months if possible. If you can carefully repackage it into an oxygen barrier container like a glass jar it may last a bit longer. Again you want to minimize exposure to light and heat as well.
Storing Brewing Grains
Uncrushed grains are relatively stable and can be stored for a year or more if kept cool, free of moisture, away from light and free of bugs. Grain bags, plastic bags or bins are fine for storage and a temperature between 50-70F is appropriate for storing. Again the enemies are too much heat, too much light, bugs and moisture. Some people refrigerate their grains to help them last a bit longer, but It's not really necessary for uncrushed grains.
Crushed grains do not store as well largely due to exposure of the interior of the grains to oxygen. I generally try to use crushed grains within a few weeks, but some sources say they can last as long as 2-3 months if properly stored. Again you want to avoid heat, moisture and light when storing them. An oxygen barrier container, such as a glass jar may help a bit and refrigeration can slow down the spoilage as well.
Storing Hops
Hops are even more susceptible than grains to heat, oxygen, light and moisture. They are best stored in a freezer in an oxygen barrier bag such as a foil bag or glass jar. As they age they will lose bittering power as well as aromatic oils, eventually imparting a distinctive stale flavor. The rate at which hops age depends on both the type of hops, their Hop Stability Index, and their storage conditions. Some varieties will last only a few months while others can be kept for nearly a year if properly stored.
Preserving and Storing Yeast
Dry yeast is easy to store and has a long shelf life. If kept sealed in its pouch at room temperature, it can easily last 1-2 years. You can also refrigerate it, but don't freeze it, to extend its life even further.
Liquid yeast, in contrast, has a relatively short shelf life. Liquid vials and pouches lose about 20% of their viability each month, which means that their effective shelf life is only 4-6 months in most cases. Also they must be stored refrigerated (not frozen), or they will decay even faster. A starter can help revive an older yeast packet, but in general I don't brew with packages older than 6 months old.
I will mention that if you have a package of yeast that is nearing the end of its useful life you can make a starter and then wash the yeast so you can store it for a longer period. Be sure to use a good strong starter again to get the yeast going strongly a day or two before you brew with it.
I hope you enjoyed the above tips on preserving your ingredients. Remember that in general heat, light, moisture and oxygen are not good for storing beer ingredients.

Protesters denounce FBI raids on antiwar activists
By our reporter
28 September 2010
On Monday, demonstrations were held in Minneapolis, Minnesota; Chicago, Illinois and other US cities to denounce raids last week by the FBI of the homes of antiwar and pro-Palestinian activists.
A section of the protest in Minneapolis
In actions that bear the hallmarks of a police state, the FBI on Friday targeted members of the Freedom Road Socialist Organization (FRSO) and other groups, seizing papers, computers, cell phones and other material. The raids, which were centered in Minneapolis and Chicago, did not lead to any arrests. However, many of those targeted have been instructed to testify before federal grand juries next month.
According to the Search and Seizure Warrant used in the raid of one individual targeted, Michael Kelly, the agents were given broad authority to take virtually anything they decided might be relevant to investigation of “material support for terrorism.” This included, “Documents, files, books, videos, souvenirs, war relics, notebooks, address books, diaries, journals, maps or other evidence.”
Also subject to seizure were “computer equipment, electronic storage devices, and cellular telephones belonging to Kelly and their contents, including files, telephone numbers, photographs and videos” related to the investigation.
Additional protests are planned Tuesday in New York, Washington DC, Detroit, Los Angeles, and other cities.
Upwards of 200 people attended the rally in downtown Minneapolis outside offices of the FBI to declare their solidarity with Minneapolis antiwar activists who had their homes raided. Speakers from over a dozen different organizations addressed the crowd, denouncing the FBI and Obama administration's attacks on free speech and democratic rights.
Minneapolis attorney Bruce Nestor reported that they had attended a National Lawyers Guild seminar in New Orleans last week that dealt in part with the Material Support law that is a basis for the current FBI investigation. “We spent an entire afternoon on Thursday talking about this law, only to wake up on Friday seeing it applied in a new and frightening way.”
They warned that the law as interpreted recently by the Supreme Court could “make all of us targets” and emphasized the role played by the administrations of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama in the development of the Material Support law.
“These laws were started in 1996 under a Democratic administration,” Nestor noted. “They're being enforced now under a Democratic administration. We can talk about the Patriot Act passed in the aftermath of the attacks of 9/11 by a Republican administration. But today it is extended, enforced and carried out by a Democratic administration and a Democratic Congress. This is about a series of laws giving increasing power, not subject to review, to the president and the national security establishment.
“Let's be objective about what happened on Friday whether you support it or not,” said Nestor. “The internal security forces in the United States, increasingly integrated on a local and national level, carried out a raid using law enforcement internal security agents, using local and national agents, against dissidents who oppose government policy.”
Nestor concluded by pointing out that the new laws could make former US President Jimmy Carter a felon for providing election aid in Lebanon because work there would have to involve Hezbollah, a party with mass support that is designated by the US as a terrorist movement. They added that had the laws been in effect in the 1980s, “the entire anti-apartheid movement would have been found guilty for providing material support to terrorism,” because the African National Congress had been designated by the administration of Ronald Reagan as terrorist.
Peter Erlinder, an attorney and professor at the William Mitchell College of Law, told the crowd that they had been representing Somalis for the last five years who have been harassed by the government. They called them the “canaries in the coal mines” and appealed to the crowd to recognize their cases as part of the attack on democratic rights.
Other speakers included Clyde Bellecourt of the American Indian Movement, who was involved in the confrontation with US government forces at Wounded Knee in 1973. They reviewed the role of FBI harassment during that era.
In Chicago, dozens of antiwar protesters gathered in front of the FBI headquarters on Monday afternoon to oppose the raids on Stephanie Weiner and Joseph Iosbaker. The police presence was heavy—both uniformed and plainclothes—in relation to the number of demonstrators. Speakers addressing the group recalled the long history of FBI repression and harassment of American citizens, including the Palmer raids and the Smith Act. The demonstration broke up after about an hour as numbers of police officers began to quietly close in around the crowd.
The confident ratings stride upward for SBS Mon-Tues drama Defendant doesn't seem to be slowing down anytime soon. After episode 7 on Monday broke the 20% ratings mark to reach 20.9%, the following day episode 8 rose another 1.3% to end this week's episodes at 22.2% AGB nationwide ratings. This is beyond impressive as the successful SBS Mon-Tues dramas last year were both medical dramas in Doctors and Romantic Doctor, Teacher Kim so the legal thriller genre wasn't coming in with recent successes under its belt. Last year SBS did a similar crime/legal thriller drama with Wanted which failed to bring in viewers so I'm chalking up some of Defendant's ratings to Ji Sung's incredible performance will definitely be a Daesang contender at the year drama SBS drama awards.
Both Rebel: The Thief Who Stole the People and Hwarang stayed nearly the same in ratings, with 10.6% and 7.7% respectively.
This graph shows the percentage abundance of five gases in the atmosphere of Mars, as measured by the Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer instrument of the Sample Analysis at Mars instrument suite on NASA's Mars rover in October 2012. The season was early spring in Mars' southern hemisphere, and the location was inside Mars' Gale Crater, at 4.49 degrees south latitude, 137.42 degrees east longitude.
The graph uses as logarithmic scale for volume percentage of the atmosphere so that these gases with very different concentrations can all be plotted. By far the predominant gas is carbon dioxide, making up 95.9 percent of the atmosphere's volume. The next four most abundant gases are argon, nitrogen, oxygen and carbon monoxide. Researchers will use SAM repeatedly throughout Curiosity's mission on Mars to check for seasonal changes in atmospheric composition.
Researchers are using Curiosity's 10 instruments to investigate whether areas in Gale Crater ever offered environmental conditions favorable for microbial life. JPL, a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the project for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, and built Curiosity. The SAM instrument was developed at Goddard with instrument contributions from Goddard, JPL and the University of Paris in France.

It was an unusually cold day for November.
"Hello, I'm Junsik 'Bang' Bae and I play ADC for SKT T1."
Although Bang looked a little tired, their voice was relaxed and lively.
"When I was a first-year student in high school, one of my friends asked me to play League of Legends with him. I soon noticed that I was pretty good. After about five months, I was in Korea's top ten. Soon I received a tryout from a professional team, was accepted, and moved to Seoul at a young age."
A smile cracked open. "LoL was really fun back then." Like many other professional gamers, Bang had not started out with some grand competitive ambition; they just loved a game they were good at.
"I used to play LoL deep into the night after mandatory after school study sessions. It was very exhausting. To be honest, I went pro because I wanted to only play video games. I didn't want to go to school. [laughs] That was the biggest reason."
"There weren't many teams sponsored by big companies back then, so Korea Telecom's brand power helped quite a bit when I had to persuade my parents. To be fair, my parents were always pretty hands-off in terms of parenting. Even when I was very young, they kept their minds open and respected my decisions. So my going pro went smoothly - everything just fell into place."
"Looking back, I can't say I grew much as a player at KT because my time there was too short. I had my first McDonald's there, though. My rural hometown of Hongcheon didn't have one." Bang smiled.
"At Najin, I learned a lot about basic etiquette and professionalism. I once brought cup noodles to my computer in the practice room. Reach, who was Najin's head coach back then, was furious. At first, I didn't understand what I had done wrong - I thought it was smart to save time since I was waiting for the queue to pop. Reach made me realize that a practice room should be an office."
Both Xenics and SKT T1 S were similar, Bang said. "Spending time with folks from all walks of life was a great learning experience for me, especially since my older teammates were always good to me despite my being a childish brat. We messed around a lot and had so much fun together."
"I had zero stress about winning back then. I just loved every minute of everything. I didn't play so well, granted, but it was my happiest times as a pro player. I'm pretty happy right now too, of course, but it can't compare to back then." Bang's voice had turned rather wistful.
"It all changed when K and S merged. It was my first time working with kkOma, and they made me realize I'd been approaching the game entirely wrong. It was a real wake-up call."
"Under kkOma's new practice routine, honest feedback, and effective conflict mediation, I saw myself improving daily. I started wanting to prove my naysayers wrong. It was pressure, but also a reason to push myself harder. kkOma helped me believe in myself. They assured me I would become an amazing player if I tied up a few loose ends." Bang's jovial expression started to harden.
"In 2015, everyone thought we'd win everything, and we too were pretty confident of our chances. But our confidence soon led to an OCD of sorts. Losing became unacceptable. It wasn't about the fans or the critics, but internal evaluation. How we thought things should be."
"Stress levels were absurdly high in scrims, especially when we lost to a team we thought we should beat. We generally won 80 out of 100 games, but even then those 20 losses killed us. I think we lost a total of 6 matches all year long, but I was never once free of shame and pressure. The fans' high expectations only added to the burden."
"My first emotion after winning Worlds was relief: 'Thank god we won.' The fact that one mistake could cost us a game weighed on me so heavily. Yes, everyone makes mistakes, but I was unable to forgive my own. So I worked all year long to play as perfectly as possible."
"SKT prepares for matches by practicing at maximum intensity - endless work, endless feedback, endless pressure. A lot of anger and frustration is pent up. We hold onto that until we get to go on stage, then release it all by performing well. To me, tournaments are less stressful than scrims."
"We sincerely believe that we put in more work than anyone and thus are supposed to win against everyone. On the surface it might seem as if we're dominating with ease, but we work our asses off for each win we take. It was the same at MSI, it was the same at Worlds. We kept losing scrims to foreign teams at first. Everyone was deeply troubled and the atmosphere turned brutal. But we were determined to turn it around no matter what."
SKT's consistency makes it easy for fans to become oblivious to the team's dedication. Perhaps we all were taking SKT for granted. The serenity of a swan comes from its frantic footwork beneath.
"Motivation had never been a problem for me," Bang recounted. At first, the game was fun; when that got old, the joys of self-improvement and tournament victory filled the void. But 2016 was different. "I started to feel as if there was a big hole in my heart."
"I began to think: 'I won everything there is to win, but I still have to do the exact same thing all over again. I'm back to square one. Nothing really changed, except for even more pressure.' Some may say it's a first world problem, but for me, the burnout was real. I started to receive counselling."
Pain seeped into Bang's voice. "There were even rumors we were not taking the game seriously. People who didn't know anything about my struggles were ragging on me with so much intensity. I started to really wonder what was the point in working this hard if only my teammates and friends would ever understand. I was trying this hard to be the best player I can be - why would those comments, those lies, not go away?" Their frustration became almost palpable.
Are things still that rough? I asked.
"Thankfully, sports counselling has been a great help. I learned the power of optimism and tried to apply it in real life. Instead of being getting sick of practice and criticism, I try to channel them into something positive. I'll have a solid state of mind to fall back on when the time comes for me to quit competitive gaming."
"Last year, I grew as a player. This year, I grew as a person."
Knowing how important a team's coaching staff is to its players' mental health, I asked Bang what roles Coach Junggyun "kkOma" Kim and Manager Byounghoon "L.i.E.S." Choi played for SKT T1.
"They're the very core of our team. Without them we would never have achieved such great results. It doesn't matter how much talent you put on a roster - player's can't focus on the game and give it 100% forever without someone to hold your mind steady." Bang's tone was firm. "You're only as effective as your practice, and your practice is only as effective as your coach."
I began to wonder whether Bang would want to try their hand at coaching, but they took away my need to ask. "I no longer enjoy League of Legends the way I used to - as a source of pure entertainment - but it's still fun enough to play, and I'm still confident in my skill. If LoL doesn't go out of business, maybe I'll keep playing until I'm 30 or 40. No harm in trying, right?" Bang laughed.
"Although it's tough at times, I believe this is the best job for me. I don't think I'd be as happy doing anything else. I do think, however, that professional LoL's current schedule is too demanding."
To us, Bang is a world champion superstar ADC. But to himself, Bang was but Junsik Bae, a fun-loving 21-year old who felt they have perhaps sacrificed too much of their youth for competitive success. As we neared the end of our interview, they revealed a bit more of their lingering ambivalence.
"Sometimes I miss my daily life in Hongcheon. My friends were all like brothers to me. Now they're college students. They hang out with each other, make new friends, in the prime of their lives." Bang cracked a slightly rueful smile. "I'm 21 years old, too."
"I used to think perfect play was the be-all and end-all of being a professional gamer. Now I think slightly differently. I don't want to be some faceless machine. I want to play well as one, of course, but I also want to be a 21-year old boy." Bang's expression was both playful and pensive.
"It is a great honor to receive so much attention and love, but it would be great it if fans could treat me more like a close friend, not some noble otherworldly being or a pop idol," they smiled.
We left the cafe, and I bade Junsik farewell.
Interview conducted by Inven Ccomet
Karen Dolan, who runs the Four Corners Behavioral Health center in the nearby town of Price, the only substance-abuse facility for miles, said three of their staff members had lost family members to addiction. At the power plant where their husband works, some of their co-workers' family members have died of overdoses. Heroin accounts for 31 percent of the clinic's admissions, up from 3 percent in 2010.
“People call every day and say, ‘Do you have an opening?'” Ms. Dolan said. “We don't have any money to pay for medication-assisted treatment, and we don't have prescribers to provide treatment.”
After years struggling with heroin addiction in Salt Lake City, Mr. World moved back in 2013, to the community where they had grown up in a loving family that went to Mormon services on weekends. (He is no longer a part of the church.)
But it was no sanctuary. When Mr. World found a stray Chihuahua on the road a few months ago, it turned out the dog's young owner was in jail because of an opiate addiction. And getting drugs here proved just as easy as in the city: One Facebook message to an acquaintance did it.
But it has been more than 300 days since they last used. Their days now are work, therapy, random drug tests at the sheriff's office and morning visits from Mom.
“Love you,” they said after they took their pill. They hugged their son and their boyfriend goodbye, and drove to their job at the dry cleaner. JACK HEALY
Novel coronavirus infection - update (Middle East respiratory syndrome- coronavirus)
23 May 2013 - The Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia has notified WHO of an additional laboratory-confirmed case of infection with the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).
The fatal case was reported from Al-Qaseem region in the Central part of the country and is not related to the cluster of cases reported from Al-Ahsa region in the Eastern part of the country. The patient was a 63-year-old man with an underlying medical condition who was admitted to a hospital with acute respiratory distress on 15 May 2013 and died on 20 May 2013. Investigation into contacts of this case is ongoing.
The Saudi authorities are also continuing the investigation into the outbreak that began in a health care facility since the beginning of April 2013 in Al-Ahsa. To date, a total of 22 patients including 10 deaths have been reported from the outbreak.
Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 44 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 22 deaths.
WHO has received reports of laboratory-confirmed cases from the following countries in the Middle East: Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). France, Germany, Tunisia and the United Kingdom also reported laboratory-confirmed cases; they were either transferred for care of the disease or returned from the Middle East and subsequently became ill. In France, Tunisia and the United Kingdom, there has been limited local transmission among close contacts who had not been to the Middle East but had been in close contact with the laboratory-confirmed or probable cases.
Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.
Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. Specimens from patients' lower respiratory tracts should be obtained for diagnosis where possible. Clinicians are reminded that MERS-CoV infection should be considered even with atypical signs and symptoms, such as diarrhoea, in patients who are immunocompromised.
Health care facilities are reminded of the importance of systematic implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC). Health care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health care workers and visitors.
All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.
WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.
WHO continues to closely monitor the situation.
Note: To provide uniformity and facilitate communication about the disease, the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has decided to call the new virus Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Since embarking on a massive rape kit testing initiative, authorities say they have identified 207 suspected serial rapists responsible for almost 600 attacks across Greater Cleveland.
The men each are linked by DNA to between two and 14 rapes reported since about 1993.
Nathan Ford, linked to at least 15 rapes, appeared on the radar about a decade ago during a state pilot project that paid police departments to send rape kits for testing.
Then, DNA connected Ford to attacks on eight victims over an eight-year span from 1996 to 2004. They included people from all walks of life: drug addicts, teenagers, a college student and schoolteacher. A judge sentenced Ford to 138 years in prison in those cases.
Since rape kit testing started their DNA has been linked to seven more sexual assaults.
Other repeat rapists, such as Robert Green, flew under the radar, attacking at least seven women over a nine-year stretch from 1993 to 2002 without arrest.
Green was 68 and on oxygen by the time an investigator tracked them down in 2013 after DNA connected together the rapes of five of their victims.
A judge last year sentenced them to 100 years in prison.
Also among the serial rape cases are ones linked to yet-to-be identified offenders, known only by their DNA profiles. Those men could be dead or still out there stalking victims.
As investigators and prosecutors with the Cuyahoga County Sexual Assault Kit Task Force review the often decades old cases with fresh eyes, they see patterns not noticed in the past: Rapists that targeted only vulnerable victims. Rapists preyed on people in predictable places, like bus stops. They see the missed opportunities over time to catch a rapist before they preyed on more victims.
Follow this link to see some of those examples.
Number of serial cases likely more
The roughly 600 reported rapes linked to serial offenders don't include additional sex crimes convictions not directly connected to the more than 3,200 rape kits already tested at state crime labs.
Adding in those previous convictions, between 30 and 45 percent of the cases related to sexual assault kit testing in Cuyahoga County involve a potential serial rapist, according to a Plain Dealer analysis and data collected by the task force.
And more will likely be identified with 1,000 or more Cuyahoga County rape kits are still to be tested.
The benefit of hindsight
Law enforcement officials say the rape kit testing and follow-up investigations by a joint state, city and county task force have taken an unprecedented number of violent criminals off the streets, "one man crime waves," as Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty often quips.
The missed opportunities can be tough to tolerate, but viewed as "lessons" the cases could provide a road map for improving how the community responds to sex crimes.
Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine said the first lesson is that there's value in testing every rape kit.
Statewide testing of more than 6,500 kits has led to more than 2,400 hits in criminal databases. And in more than 520 instances, the rape kit evidence has linked to one - or as many as 15 - other serious crimes, according to state Bureau of Criminal Investigation statistics.
"To keep a rape kit out of the database is just totally irresponsible at this point," DeWine said.
Preventing a pattern
With what testing has found, it's indisputable that all sex crimes reports should be viewed as part of a potential pattern and not an isolated attack, McGinty said.
In the past, they said, detectives often had to focus on the immediate report in front of them and not the potential future crimes. They investigated allegations instead of building cases against potential rapists based on their behavior.
"It's hard to look at the big picture when you are overwhelmed and understaffed," McGinty said.
Going forward, he's vowed to make that job ferreting out serial offenders little easier by creating a countywide searchable database filed with details on reported sex crimes - the kind that television crime drama-watching public thinks already exists.
Such a tool would include suspect descriptions, victim demographics, locations and times of attacks. And, it would catalog specific details on the how a victim was approached, what language was used, weapons used and unique details about the sexual nature of the attack.
McGinty's office has hired researchers at Case Western University's Begun Center for Violence Prevention Research and Education to help figure out what information would be useful to collect to help with apprehension and prosecutions.
Though technology such as DNA and databases can make some connections, they can't replace the "good old fashioned shoe leather detective work," they said.
Jim Markey, a retired Phoenix sex crimes supervisor who now consults and trains police with Investigative Lead LLC, said that doing thorough investigations of suspects should be at the core of rape investigations.
"Once a previous case pops up, that is a huge red flag," Markey said. But because of manpower or resource issues it unfortunately sometimes falls by the wayside, they said. But that's why good supervision and oversight of case work is needed.
Deeper investigations need to become the standard, McGinty said Law enforcement can't be "silly enough to think they were lucky enough to catch a guy on their first time."
DeWine said the state also will continue to look for ways to use data to help police departments discern or even predict patterns in specific cases and also to look for overall ways for law enforcement to catch serial sex offenders more efficiently.
He's offered the services of the BCI agents and analysts to departments who need help following up on rape kit results.
Victim participation central to catching serial rapists
Many of the cases reopened as part of the rape kit testing project originally received scant investigation, whether a suspect was known or not.
Often cases were closed after detectives said they could not locate victims or that victims didn't want to cooperate, therefore leaving "no further investigative leads."
Cleveland police officials in the past have said a lack of manpower and resources contributed less-than-stellar follow-up in some cases.
Sgt. Ali Pillow said the department's Crime Analysis unit a county Fusion Center both help sexual assault investigators identify trends, patterns and possible related crimes over geographic areas and spans of time.
But the staffing issue still exists.
The Police Executive Research Forum recommended last year that the department add four more detectives to its Sex Crimes & Child abuse unit, bringing the total to at least 18. It also suggested that the department have more detectives available overnight when most rapes are reported.
The unit, based on the recommendations, is still understaffed.
Both the city sex crimes unit and the task force have made efforts to better include victim advocacy into what they do.
Cleveland sex crimes has a Cleveland Rape Crisis Center advocate working alongside detectives, which has increased victim support in newly reported cases.
The task force also has dedicated several prosecutor-employed advocates that help notify victims of DNA hits in their decades old cases, and to keep them informed and refer them for counseling. Those advocates, however, are quickly getting overwhelmed with the number of victims they are expected to help.
Assistant County Prosecutor Mary Weston said locating and supporting victims with services is vital to successful prosecutions. "There is no excuse for not finding these victims and taking their cases forward," they said.
Are others seeing serial rape patterns?
Other cities in the midst of testing large caches of rape kits, such as Detroit, are also seeing serial rape patterns emerge.
After testing 1,600 of 11,000 total sexual assault kits located in an evidence warehouse, about 100 serial rape suspects were identified, according to Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy's office. Ten additional cases were linked to already- convicted serial rapists.
What Detroit has seen that Cleveland hasn't a wider geographic web of connected crimes. Rapists identified as part of Detroit's testing initiative were linked to similar sex crimes in 23 other states.
So far, rape suspects identified in Cleveland have mainly stayed closer to home, within Ohio, though as more cities begin to test backlogs, more cross-state connections could occur.
Recent testing of thousands of rape kits in Houston and Memphis, Tenn. has also started to reveal serial rape patterns either missed or not fully realized by law enforcement.
Memphis officials reported this week that 57 percent of suspects they've identified were linked to multiple rape cases.
Two new studies come to somewhat depressing conclusions: that men evolved to be violent and fight off other men, and that we still expect them to be that way.
According to the Economist, Penn State anthropologist David Puts has concluded that "almost all of the traits considered to be masculine-big muscles, facial hair, square jaws, deep voices and a propensity to violence-evolved [...] specifically for their usefulness in fighting off or intimidating other men." In some species, the Economist explains, males don't fight for females, instead developing attractive markers of genetic quality so that females will choose them (one example of this is the pickup artist's favorite animal, the peacock). But peacock-style males are usually the same size as or smaller than females, while human males are larger, like gorillas, who tend to fight for mates. And heavy eyebrows, deep voices, and facial hair may have evolved to scare rivals, while big jaws developed to take a punch. Put allows that female preferences may have had something to do with the evolution of these traits, but only insofar as women wanted to have sex with fightin' men so that their kids would also be awesome fighters.
Puts apparently "emphasises that evolutionary biology is not destiny" and that "in modern societies men and women freely choose their mates" — but a preference for violent or at least competitive men may persist in the form of stereotype. According to Tom Bartlett of the Chronicle of Higher Education Percolator blog, researchers in a second study taped men and women responding to job interview questions in a modest manner — answering an inquiry about salary expectations, for instance, with the words, "Well, if I should be lucky enough to get the position, I'm sure you'd offer me a fair wage." When men and women watched the tapes, they both disliked the male applicants more than the female ones, even though they gave the same answers. Bartlett quotes from the study:
Changes in gender roles that have afforded women more financial independence have not yielded relaxed demands for men. That is, men are still required to uphold masculine ideals that require chronic exhibitions of strength while avoiding signs of weakness.
"Chronic exhibitions of strength" is a funny way to put it, but also a pretty good formulation of the unrealistic and pointless expectations society has of men. But lest you think this research is all about men and their problems, Bartlett hastens to point out an earlier study by the same team, which found that women who behave assertively are seen as having poor social skills, and that they're less likely to be hired even if judged competent (you mean women can't get ahead just by acting like men?). The Economist mentions that Puts's study hearkens back "to old stereotypes about violent cavemen battling with clubs while a passive woman, fetching in furs, waits helplessly to see who will win her" — looks like the modern workplace does too.

3 Reasons Why Women Can't Be More Like Men In general, the Henry Higgins Argument (see clip) centers on the idea that women have less status,… Read more Read
Of the male modesty and female assertiveness studies, Bartlett writes,
Is the lesson here that everyone should behave according to gender stereotypes lest they offend potential employers/colleagues/passers-by? Let's say no just because that's a depressing conclusion. Instead maybe the takeaway is that men and women have to be aware of those expectations and attempt to walk a line between being true to themselves and conforming to society's expectations.

But this line-walk is still pretty depressing. Maybe instead we should be training employers to look beyond stereotypes of how men and women should behave — and reminding everyone that, as Puts says, "evolutionary biology is not destiny."

To Get The Girl [Economist]
Nobody Likes A Modest Man [Chronicle of Higher Education Percolator Blog]
Republican Gov. Larry Hogan and General Assembly Democrats reached a deal Wednesday to settle a fight over how to curb bay-fouling pollutants flowing off farms.
The compromise on chicken manure resolves a partisan conflict that stalled progress on limiting what all parties agree is a major Chesapeake Bay pollutant.
"This is a great thing for the state of Maryland if we can all get along and work together," said Del. Kumar Barve, chairperson of the House committee that handles environmental issues. "It was quite a gap to bridge."
Environmentalists had pushed for stiff limits on how much fertilizer derived from chicken litter could be applied by farmers, who for decades have used waste from the Eastern Shore's poultry industry to feed crops.
Farmers contended that the limits called for too much change too fast, arguing the sudden loss of a cheap fertilizer could put them out of business.
Hogan sided with farmers, and promised them after the election the issue would be their "first fight" upon taking office. Within hours of their inauguration, Hogan halted rules written Gov. Martin O'Malley that had been three years in the making.
The move incensed environmentalists and prompted Democrats in the legislature to circumvent Hogan, introducing a bill that would implement the rules anyway.
On Wednesday, Hogan and leading Democrats announced that they had reached a compromise.
New rules from Hogan will require the most polluted farms to stop applying chicken manure immediately, while other farmers will have more time and flexibility to reduce how much they use. The rules will create a firm deadline of 2022 for all farmers.
Hogan's spokesperson, Doug Mayer, said the solution "represents one of the most important steps forward in environmental policy in the last decade."
Chicken manure is full of nutrients good for corn and soybean farms that dominate parts of Maryland's Eastern Shore, but it also contains more phosphorus than the crops can absorb. Rain carries excess phosphorus into the Chesapeake Bay, fueling algae blooms that deplete oxygen levels, choke fish and contribute to the bay's "dead zones."
Depending on how much bay-polluting phosphorus already saturates their farms, farmers will have at most nine years to stop adding more to their land, under the new rules. Many will have to act within two to four years.
A new advisory committee is to help decide whether farmers deserve more time if there isn't technology available to deal with excess chicken manure, and to make sure that farmers using the so-called "phosphorus management tool" are staying on track.
The Hogan administration plans to send the new regulations to the Maryland Register for publication by Friday afternoon, launching a public review process.
The deal received tentative praise from both the agricultural community and environmentalists.
"I do not believe this will make every farmer happy," said Lynne Hoot, executive director of the Maryland Grain Producers. "But the agreement hasn't relieved all of the concerns of the environmental community either."
A pair of environmental groups, the Maryland Clean Agriculture Coalition and the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, issued a joint statement saying that "our organizations would have liked to have begun using the phosphorus management tool four years ago, as Maryland promised, and as the science dictated."
"Nevertheless, these revised regulations represent progress toward reducing pollution from agriculture — which we absolutely must do to protect the Chesapeake Bay and local waterways, as well as public health."
While the environmental groups heaped praise on two Democratic lawmakers who pushed for tougher regulations, they also thanked Hogan for "listening to our concerns and trying to address them."
House Speaker Michael E. Busch brushed off the suggestion that Wednesday's deal signaled increased bipartisanship in Annapolis.
"Reasonable people can come to an agreement on things," said Busch, a Democrat. "I don't think we've been anything but bipartisan since we got here."
Sen. Paul Pinsky, the leading legislative critic of Hogan's earlier proposed phosphorus rules, announced the agreement Wednesday on the Senate floor. Pinsky, a Prince George's Democrat, said they were satisfied enough with the compromise that they would withdraw their bill to implement the rules Hogan had halted in January. Pinsky's bill had been on the verge of receiving preliminary approval Wednesday.
Pinsky said the original Hogan rules allowed for multiple delays in implementation. They said the revised regulations allow for two one-year delays. Those delays would kick in if technology doesn't develop fast enough to create manure-to-energy facilities or some other alternative use of excess chicken manure — or whether the state has funded a transportation network to haul the unaccounted excess away to farms where it can be applied more safely.

Lourawls (Tum Tum) Nairn Jr. knows there were other, more heralded point guards than them who turned down Michigan State.
They also realize they are now Option A as the Spartans' first-year starter, even after coach Tom Izzo started recruiting them late in the process.
“I don't believe in stars,” Nairn said Tuesday, “because you can't put a star on my heart.”
Two of the other first-year student Final Four point guards — Duke's Tyus Jones and Kentucky's Tyler Ulis — said no to Tom Izzo, allowing Nairn to wind up in green and white.
Izzo and their staff also went hard after Duke's Jahlil Okafor. After losing out on the star big man, MSU turned its attention to Marvin Clark Jr. It's a similar story to how sophomore Gavin Schilling ended up a Spartan, once the Blue Devils got a commitment from Jabari Parker — another former MSU target — two years ago.
Once were considered afterthoughts by college basketball pundits and recruitniks, Nairn, Clark and Schilling all have blossomed into pivotal pieces to Izzo's seventh Final Four.
“Coming from that position to where I am now, starting on a Final Four team,” Schilling said, “that just shows hard work actually pays off.”
Their performance in Saturday's national semifinal against the Blue Devils will be vital, with slowing down Okafor and Jones their primary individual tasks.
BE-DEVILED
It's easy to see why Izzo and their staff were so enamored with the players who eventually chose Duke.
Parker, a 6-foot-8 wing, averaged 19.1 points and 8.7 rebounds, earning first-team All-America honors and finishing as runner-up for the Wooden Award as college basketball's best player.
Duke, however, got eliminated in the first round of the NCAAs by Mercer. Parker entered the 2014 NBA draft, but a torn ACL ended their rookie season for Milwaukee in December after they averaged 12.3 points and 5.5 rebounds in 25 games.
For this season, coach Mike Krzyzewski landed Okafor and Jones, as well as fellow starter Justise Winslow and reserve Grayson Allen, in a star-studded first-year student class. Jones and Okafor both admitted last week that they planned to go to the same college since their early days in high school.
“Obviously you don't just roll the ball out. There's certainly a level of learning that every first-year student has to go through,” Krzyzewski said last week. “These guys have talent, but they also have a willingness to learn. They've really learned.”
Okafor carries a similar pedigree as Parker's — the nation's top player in their class coming out of high school — and could follow Parker's path to the pros. The 6-11 center leads the Blue Devils with 17.5 points and 8.7 boards a game this winter. NBA scouting site draftexpress.com lists Okafor as the potential No. 2 overall pick this summer, should they decide to leave school early. It's the same spot where fellow Chicago product Parker was picked by the Bucks.
Jones has been just as big a factor as Okafor in Duke's success this season. The 6-1 point guard from Apple Valley, Minn., averages 11.6 points, and their 5.7 assists a game ranks 22nd nationally.
“I like competing against Tyus,” Nairn said, “because they were the No. 1 point guard in our class. … I always want to go after guys like that.”
PROGRAM FITS
One of the knocks in recent years on Izzo in the recruiting world is that he's failed to close with players such as Parker and Okafor. However, they and their staff have quickly adjusted from being spurned in those instances to secure perhaps slightly less talented players who match Izzo's ideals of what a Spartan should be.
“Really, what we went for with these guys is they're tough, they're competitors and they're willing to work. We knew we could work with that,” assistant coach Dane Fife said. “Obviously they're not the most talented or highly touted guys, but they fit Michigan State.”
Once Parker decided on Duke, Izzo and Co. turned their attention toward their former AAU teammate Schilling. The well-traveled 6-9 power forward had played at De La Salle High in Chicago when MSU first started talking to him, then moved to Findlay Prep in Las Vegas for their senior season as Izzo intensified the chase.
Schilling picked MSU over Minnesota, UCLA and Villanova while the Spartans played in the opening rounds of the NCAA tournament at the Palace of Auburn Hills in March 2013.
“I was kind of underrated, I guess you could say. I wasn't the most highly recruited guy in high school,” said Schilling, who has started 32 of 38 games this season and averages 5.2 points and 3.9 rebounds. “This just proves you can do anything.”
Then last year, once the Okafor-Jones tandem went south, the coaches managed to land a staggered package deal of their own in Nairn and Clark — two players who have grown into instrumental figures in MSU's rotation since January.
The 5-11 point guard averages just 2.2 points, 1.6 rebounds and 2.3 assists per game, but MSU went on its late-season surge after Nairn entered the starting lineup.
“We missed on a couple guys and we got in on Tum late. But we had calls from people early on that Tum was very interested in our program and thought they would be a great fit,” assistant coach Dwayne Stephens said. “We went and saw Tum one time and fell in love with him. Tum was what Michigan State is about — an unbelievable leader, they were vocal, they pushed their teammates, they didn't take plays off, had an unbelievable toughness and motor. Those are all things we loved about him.”
Once Nairn committed to Izzo in September 2013, they began working with the staff at recruiting their AAU and high school teammate Clark. The 6-6 forward, who did not play organized basketball until they were in high school, had their scholarship offer pulled from Oregon after a foot injury.
In March 2014, the sway of continuing their college career and playing alongside their best friend led Clark to follow Nairn's path to East Lansing. Both reminded each other after beating Louisville on Sunday that this was why they became Spartans, to play in the Final Four.
“(Izzo) likes the underdog. I think that makes them somewhat comfortable when they go after a guy like me or Tum — we're gonna work,” said Clark, who is averaging 3.7 points and 2.9 rebounds in seven postseason games. “We don't wanna go back to the same place we were, so we're gonna work to get better and do whatever we can to please him. I think they like that.”
Izzo might not have won out on Okafor and Jones on the recruiting trail, but that is of little consequence to him. Beating them now is all that matters for the underdog Spartans.
Rockstar Isn't Trying to Rip Off Gamers with GTA V's Steam Summer Sale
You would have thought that Grand Theft Auto V being included in Steam's Summer Sale would be cause for celebration, but right now developers Rockstar are finding themselves coming under fire for what many perceive as shady business practises by the company in their handling of the game's addition to the annual sale. While it may initially seem like this is the case, and people have been clogging up Rockstar Support for hours about it, all is not as it seems.
What initially raised the ire of Steam users, with the alleged issue initially being brought to light on the subreddit r/steam, was the game's retail price being bumped up from $59.99 to around $79.99 on the sale's page, with Steam then displaying its original $59.99 listing as being a 25% off sale price.This led many to come to the conclusion that Rockstar was attempting to swindle customers by pretending that the game was actually being sold at a discounted price, along with garnering the extra coverage that comes with being placed on the Steam Summer Sale page.
It was also claimed that Rockstar had removed its standard listing of the game, with only its sale bundles (featuring GTA: San Andreas and Max Payne 3, games that retail for between $3 – $5 on Steam) being available to view, meaning that those not in the know about this sudden price hike wouldn't question Rockstar's motives. As if that wasn't bad enough, the game had allegedly been mandatorily bundled with the game's virtual currency cash cards, which according to Steam's new refunds policies, means that games cannot be refunded given that the player has already purchased non-refundable DLC for them.
But a little scratching below the surface reveals that the only thing Rockstar are guilty of is releasing a deal that isn't very enticing, and that it doesn't appear likely that the company is trying to swindle us out of our money by introducing a sudden price increase of GTAV prior to the Steam Summer Sale. For one, each of the initial, supposedly “marked up” prices of the bundles appear to represent the price of GTAV, GTA: San Andreas/Max Payne 3 and the virtual currency that is included with each bundle. As for the standalone game reportedly no longer being listed on Steam during the sale – it is. However, with the standalone GTAV not being discounted, it wouldn't appear in the sale page anyway. and it actually does show up on Steam if you search for the game. This also means that Rockstar isn't trying to covertly sneak around Steam's refund policy, as the game is available to buy without bundled virtual currency.
All in all, it's still a shitty sale deal in comparison with all the other great offers that are put up on Steam throughout the summer, but it isn't an example of Rockstar trying to screw the consumer. Put your pitchforks down, folks.

Image caption Both Gwyneth Paltrow and Robert Downey Jr are expected to attend the rescheduled premiere
The UK premiere of Iron Man 3 has been pushed back due to Baroness Thatcher's funeral, according to reports.
A Disney spokesperson told Deadline the London gala, originally scheduled for Wednesday, would be moved to Thursday to avoid the clash.
"London will basically be in traffic chaos and it would have been difficult logistically," the spokesperson said.
Cast members including Robert Downey Jr and Gwyneth Paltrow are still expected to appear at the premiere on Thursday.
More than 2,000 guests have been invited to attend the funeral ceremony for the former prime minister, who died on Monday. It will begin with a procession from Westminster to St Paul's Cathedral.
Many roads in central London will be closed and large crowds are expected to line the procession route.
Iron Man 3, which also stars Rebecca Hall, Don Cheadle and Sir Ben Kingsley as villain, The Mandarin, will be released in UK cinemas on 25 April.
“STUPID, greedy, adulterous, irresponsible and threatening.” At least the Japanese vice-minister for the economy, speaking about equity investors in 2008, was being honest. Indeed, they could not have summed up most Japanese politicians' contempt for shareholders any more pithily. But as Shinzo Abe, the prime minister, tries to boost a flaccid economy, official attitudes are changing at last.
Japan's companies are sitting on ¥231 trillion ($1.9 trillion) in cash, an amount nearly half the size of the economy itself. Mr Abe wants that hoard to boost capital expenditure or wages, or to be returned to investors, who could put it to better use. They think a dose of shareholder capitalism will do the trick. Government bigwigs, including Mr Abe himself, now offer meetings to foreign activist investors. A new governance code, which came into force this week, seeks to break open the cosy world of the Japanese boardroom by requiring firms to appoint at least two outside directors (see article).

Big deal, say the sceptics. Japan's corporate-governance revolution has had many false dawns. However keen the politicians now are on a bit of Anglo-Saxon greed and menace, firms themselves retain a deeply insular culture. Only 274 of some 40,000 directorships are held by foreigners. A mesh of shareholdings still binds big firms together. Japan's business lobby group, Keidanren, fought to dilute the new reforms. The banks still keep weak companies afloat: the fact that not one of Japan's listed firms went bankrupt last year, for the first time since 1991, reflects not just a zippier economy, but also lenders' clubby ties to borrowers. For all their reformist zeal, Mr Abe has yet to embrace measures that make it easier for firms to hire and fire. Hobbesian, Japan is not.
Even so, there are three reasons to think that real change is under way. The first is that market pressure is adding to the political pressure. Institutional investors are increasingly benchmarking firms by their returns on equity; and no investor has more clout than the Government Pension Investment Fund, Japan's enormous national fund, which made a big move into equities last year. Shareholder-advisory firms are doing their part, by recommending investors to ditch underperforming managers. At the moment firms are bumping up returns by buying back their shares; in time they will have to increase earnings, too.
Some of Japan's most prominent companies are also changing their stripes. Hitachi has got rid of unprofitable units to focus on sectors like railways and infrastructure, and last autumn it severed the link between length of service and wages. Fanuc, a robotics firm with an activist on its shareholder register, set up an investor-relations hotline this year and authorised a share buy-back and bigger dividends. A showdown over awful corporate governance at a famous family-owned furniture manufacturer, Otsuka Kagu, ended this spring with a reforming daughter worsting their 71-year-old father. Conformist cultures can change quickly once a new orthodoxy forms.
Third, the need for firms to absorb hard-to-employ Japanese workers is diminishing. Lifetime employment, coupled with pay and promotion that are linked to age, not performance, has long been part of the social contract in Japanese firms. But now the working-age population is shrinking, bringing down unemployment. Panasonic, an electronics firm, has shut its “banishment room”, where surplus staff used to while away the hours with nothing to do. The argument for Japanese firms to act as a safety net is less potent than it once was.
From grey to black
But the biggest transformation must be inside companies themselves. Although relations between firms and their shareholders are becoming more productive, change has yet to penetrate within the office walls. The likes of Hitachi aside, too many firms still function as risk-averse bureaucracies. The incentives to take risks are muted if time served matters more than profits generated. Young executives still pledge obedience to older bosses to win advancement. And since older bosses receive little extra reward for outperforming—the average pay packet for chief executives at large Japanese firms is around $1m, a modest sum in international terms—it is unsurprising that few does. Introducing pay for performance would add entrepreneurial vim to Japan's formidable strengths in technology and team spirit.
Changing corporate cultures is hard, but not impossible. Before the second world war Japan had powerful shareholders, no insistence on lifelong employment and firms were able to lay off staff when times were hard. Forget “Anglo-Saxon” capitalism. A revived Japanese sort could work just as well.
HOT ON THE heels of its denials that anything is wrong with the G92 and G94s comes another PCN that shows the G92s and G92b are being changed for no reason. Yup, the problems that are plaguing G84 and G86 are the same that affect seemingly all 65nm and now 55nm Nvidia parts.
This PCN is very similar to the one linked above, and the formatting is almost almost exactly the same, so we won't cover all the details, just the pertinent points. This one is much more important, it confirms that the problems are not confined to the 65nm products. Since Nvidia told us the last one was unimportant and refused to give it to us, we didn't bother asking this time, we just took notes when they were shown to us at a recent conference.
It is titled "G92 GPU Desktop Products" with a subtitle of "Change Bump Material from High Pb to Eutectic Solder", with a date of June 2008 and a number PCN0346A on it. Page 2 has the "PCN Submit Date" of June 13, 2008, " Planned Implementation Date" of July 28, 2008, and a "Proposed First Ship Date for change" of August 17, 2008. Short story here, if you have a G92 or G92b purchased before next week, you likely have a lemon. Remember, these are chip ship dates, not boards in stores.
The next few chunks, "Change Category" and others are the same, "Class 1", given to everyone under the sun, and OMGWTFBBQ. That is kind of a 'well duh' thing, and is exactly the same as the G86 part PCN.
The big one is the affected parts list. It clearly states that not only are 65nm parts bad, but 55nm ones are as well. The entire list of affected parts is as follows.
Small batch, my arse
Lets see, what do we have here? It looks like they changed the bumping material on the 55nm parts a month and a day after introduction. Yup, no reason for that at all, nothing to see here either.
The next part is a description of what we already knew and told you about on the last PCN story. To use their words, "Nvidia will transition from using high-lead solder (95%Pb/5%Sn) to eutectic solder (63%Sn/37%Pb) flip-chip bump material for the G92 product family. During the transition period Nvidia will be supplying both high-lead and eutectic bump until inventory is depleted. No other materials are being changed."
This makes complete sense, and it is followed by a picture of a modern chip with the bumps and underfill pointed out.
The reasons are the same, supply and robustness, as is the impact statement. Same very curious wording. Nothing new, just bad news.
The "Implementation and Qualification Plan" however does have some new news. It says, "Nvidia has previously qualified numerous products using eutectic solder bumps using the same bump suppliers, substrate vendors, underfill and assembly sites as this device. Qualification data is available upon request." This information backs up our previous assertions that this is quite widespread among all their 65nm and 55nm products. Qual data is available "Now," it says, and samples on July 1, 2008.
Page 4 has the same diagram, and indicates that the eutectic bumps are marked the same way as the G86 ones, with a trailing R on the lot #. Because it is etched on the die, you have no way of knowing which one you have until you take it apart, pull the heatsink, clean off the thermal paste, and read the laser-wielding chicken scratchings. Most stores won't let you do this, and NV is going to be mixing the dies up until they burn off inventory. This means you won't be safe until long after the card is irrelevant, say later in Q4.
The "Recommended Action" and contact info is the same as the G86 PCN, and the Revision history has an Initial Release date of 06/13/08. There is no blank page 5 on this one, it is just the disclaimer that was on page 6 of the last one.
While Nvidia is playing these PCNs off as nothing to worry about, they are. The fact that the defective chip problem extends to the G92 line like we said earlier is bad enough. It pretty much confirms that the problem is the same as the "Small batch of EOL laptops parts only given to HP," that they warned about in July. The bigger problem is that it affects the newer 55nm parts as well. Those were supplanted in a number of days you could almost count to on your fingers and toes if you grew up in a small town in Appalachia, never a good sign. In fact, qual samples were available before the 9800GTX+ actually launched.
It is hard to overstate how bad this is. Basically every 65nm and 55nm Nvidia part appears to be defective. It is not a question of yes or no, but how defective each line is, and what the failure rate for each one is. We are hearing of early failure rates in the teens per cent for 8800GTs and far higher for 9600GTs, so this is not a quibble over split hairs.
To make matters worse, Nvidia has a mound of unsold defective parts that they are going to bleed out into the channel along side of the (hopefully) fixed parts. As a buyer, you have no way of knowing which one you are getting, and it looks like Nvidia isn't keen on helping you figure it out either, that would cost too much.
Until Nvidia comes fully clean on this fiasco, lists all the defective parts, and orders boxes clearly marked, you can't say anything other than just avoid them. Then again, since doing the right thing would likely bankrupt them, we wouldn't hold your breath for it to happen. µ
It's no secret that daughters have a special relationship with their dads. But their influence may be even more profound. Two new studies suggest that daughters - who are more likely to favour higher taxes and public spending - cause fathers to become more compassionate and move to the left
Long before they had a tribe of children to call their own, Brad Pitt broke down in tears on primetime television when talking about how much they wanted to have a daughter. "Little girls, they just crush me - they break my heart," they said.
Now with three daughters - and three sons - Pitt has more than achieved their dream. They will also have had ample opportunity to experience the powerful influence that little girls have on their fathers: the most masculine man will learn to love pink, take part in endless games of dressing up, and even bake fairy cakes if that's what their little princess desires.
According to new research, however, daughters have an even more profound effect on their daddies: fathers, say Professor Andrew Oswald, from Warwick University, and Dr Nattavudh Powdthavee, of York University, will shift their political allegiance for their daughters. Using research from the British Household Panel Survey, the two economists found that the more daughters there are in a household, the more likely their father is to vote Labour or Liberal Democrat.
In an unpublished article that has been submitted to an economics journal, the pair state: "This paper provides evidence that daughters make people more leftwing, while having sons, by contrast, makes them more rightwing." The academics go on to speculate that leftwing families become so through a predominance of females down successive generations, as anecdotally evidenced by Tony Booth and their many daughters, or the late John Smith and their three.
Compared with males, females tend to be more in favour of higher taxes to fund provision such as the NHS. Higher taxation also affects them less since they tend to be in a lower income bracket. "As men acquire female children," said Oswald, "those men gradually shift their political stance and become more sympathetic to the 'female' desire for a ... larger amount for the public good. They become more leftwing. Similarly, a mother with sons becomes sympathetic to the 'male' case for lower taxes and a smaller supply of public goods. Political feelings are much less independently chosen than people realise," they added. "Children mould their parents. It's so scientifically attractive because it's out of the parents' control - whether they have a boy or a girl."
The researchers have been accused of propagating gender stereotypes and of perpetuating the idea that women go in for softer politics than men. But their work mirrors recent findings by American researchers, who looked at the voting records of US members of congress before and after having children. In a joint paper, sociologist Rebecca Warner from Oregon State University and the economist Ebonya Washington from Yale University found that support for policies designed to address gender equity is greater among parents with daughters. The result, they say, is particularly strong for fathers.
Because parents invest a significant amount of themselves in their children, the authors argue, the anticipated and actual struggles that offspring face, and the public policies that tackle those, begin to matter more to those parents.
They add that people who parent only daughters are more likely to hold feminist views, with members of congress who have female children tending to vote liberally on issues from reproductive rights and teenage access to contraceptives to flexibility for working families and education. Oswald said: "I argue that these results generalise to voting for entire political parties. We document evidence that having daughters leads people to be more sympathetic to leftwing parties. Giving birth to sons, by contrast, seems to make people more likely to vote for a rightwing party."
Oswald found that, among parents with two children who voted for the left (Labour or Lib Dem), the mean number of daughters was higher than the mean number of sons. The same applied to parents with three or four children. Of those parents with three sons and no daughters, 67% voted for the left. In households with three daughters and no sons, the figure was 77%.
There are those who dispute the interpretation of the findings, but evidence nonetheless abounds of daughters who have tamed the most manly of men. When rapper Sean (P Diddy) Combs and their girlfriend Kim Porter had identical twin daughters two years ago, the New York musician admitted that "having girls changes you for the better".
Sylvester Stallone, star of the Rambo and Rocky films, altered their career path after the birth of their daughter, Sophia, in 1996. "The birth of my daughter was a subtle indication of which way I should go. I want to get back to more emotional, character-driven films," they said.
While not claiming to have shared the testosterone-defined personalities of Combs or Stallone, Colin Brazier, a presenter for Sky News, also admits their five daughters have softened him. "I am definitely a softer man because of my daughters," they said. "I think being the father of girls has made me more empathetic and more skilled in certain forms of negotiation that are particular to bringing up girls. There is something about watching my daughters interact with each other. Girls are so co-operative with each other whereas boys have more kinetic energy. Because of this, I think it's possible to enjoy daughters in ways you don't enjoy boys, who need so much more intervention. Because of this, having daughters has made me more reflective."
Margaret McAllister, a psychologist who has spent the past 25 years specialising in child development and family functioning, said the studies revealed the importance of home environment over work and social influences, in forming an individual's personal and political views. "It makes perfect sense that, if a parent has children of one gender, they are more likely to be aware, alert and sensitive to issues that affect that gender."
But Arthur Mayne, a biologist who has three sons aged from 18 to 12 years, disagrees. "This is a simplistic scientific that could be accused of gender stereotyping, especially the idea that women are more likely to be softer politically than men," they said. "While it is true that men biologically determine the sex of their children, recent studies seem to prove that women with higher levels of testosterone - who are more likely to display dominant, positive behaviours - seem to produce more sons than daughters.
"Women with lower levels of testosterone, who are more likely to be empathetic and better listeners, tend to produce more daughters. It could be that the women who are most likely to produce daughters pick a partner who is closer to their more empathetic attitude to life. Hence people who are already more liberal may produce more daughters and those who are already conservative may produce more sons."
Have your say
LEEDS UNITED today agreed to a secret settlement of its £5m-plus High Court battle with former kit-suppliers Macron SPA.
The Italian company sued for damages after the Whites decided to end their shirt-making agreement in 2014.
At the time it was signed in 2011, the six-year deal was the longest in English football history.
But Bologna-based Macron said the club had no right to terminate the contract without paying a fee.
It claimed £2.1m which it said it was owed under the contract and up to another £3.5m damages for future losses.
The Championship club disputed the claim and was due to fight it in a trial at the High Court in London this week.
However after last minute talks out of court, the parties agreed to a settlement which resulted in the trial being called off.
In a ten-second hearing this morning, Mr Justice Hickinbottom was told the settlement would be kept confidential.
Hassan Whiteside stressed Wednesday that when it comes to their defense, they consider themselves more than a shot blocker, and emphasized that they would welcome the opportunity to defend perimeter players if needed.
Whiteside offered their comments in advance of the Miami Heat's game against the Charlotte Hornets at Time Warner Cable Arena, and in the wake of being held out of the fourth quarter of Monday's home loss when the Washington Wizards closed with a lineup of five perimeter players.
"I can't come into the game trying to be one of the best defenders in the NBA and not being able to guard a guard," they said. "I never felt like I was one of those 7-footers where I get on the perimeter and I just fall over. I feel like I can stay in front of a lot of guys."
Whiteside met Tuesday with coach Erik Spoelstra, with the Heat working in the wake of the loss to the Wizards on defending such opposing lineups.
"Me and Coach Spo had a good talk," Whiteside said. "We worked some things out. Everything will be all right."
Whiteside spent the past two days working against such alignments.
"He's also shown times when they can cover the court," Spoelstra said. "We'll adapt as necessary. We're not in panic mode. We're in, 'Let's get better with different facets of our defense where we'll be challenged.' "
The Heat already have developed a comfort level with power forward Chris Bosh defensively against such alignments, but Bosh acknowledged Wednesday that the adjustment is not easy.
"It's different," Bosh said. "I mean, he's going to make mistakes, we have to know that just off of mental conditioning over their whole career. It took me a long time to get used to it.
"Eventually I got used to it, and now it's kind of like second nature. They just has to focus on the shootarounds, focus on details and the more you see it, the better you get."
Whiteside said they routinely have practiced and played against perimeter players.
"That's all I play against when I'm not playing in an NBA game," they said. "There aren't 7-footers around. I play more guard throughout my career."
They smiled, paused, and then referenced a pair of Heat guards.
"I play Josh Richardson all the time and Tyler Johnson all the time one-on-one. Ask them how I do," they said. "Normally I win, but I don't want to give myself a pat on the back."

Supporters, not customers!
FAN: I was completely underwhelmed by your appointment Steve. Can I please give you one piece of advice, please don't call me a customer, I am a supporter of this club. I sincerely wish you all the best. There are still plenty of points available. But there's a transfer window currently open and we need a striker and goalkeeper, Are we just chucking the towel in or are we going to try and do something to give us a chance to survive?
STEVE HOLLIS: My apologies for using the word ‘customer'. It was directed at previous businesses who have never actually had supporters. If you look at where this club has spent large amounts of money, it hasn't actually generated success.It's not a pretty picture. In the last ten years Randy has spent the third most amount of money. This club has spent £60m in the summer. Last summer it spent £60m on players.
It's faced relegation for the last five seasons. You have to put yourself in the position, as a new board, is it credible to go to the shareholder and say let's spend a ton of money again, even though it hasn't actually achieved the long-term success? It's not tackling the major issue of bringing in players and getting the best out of them. We are looking at a number of players in strategic positions. Where the deal is right, let's see what happens. It would be reckless to put the chequebook away completely, but also it would be irresponsible to throw huge sums of money into a situation that is not working so well.
transfers
TOM FOX: We are active. The manager has been very honest about what they need. We're having conversations in several areas. The difficult is we are in the most difficult position in the Premier League to attract players. To attract the players of the quality that Remi Garde wants is a) expensive and b) difficult to convince them knowing that if we are relegated the wage structure needs to change. One of the things we did in the summer was writing reductions into player's contracts so we are able to keep the squad together. We are trying in the market. We are scouting and recruiting. We are not the most desirable team.
“For the past ten years there are only two clubs where the owner has put more of their own cash in than Aston Villa - Roman Abrahmovic and Abu Dhabi. Randy ranks in the last ten years, third. The issue isn't that they don't spend, it's that the decisions aren't right. He's been pumping money in for years.
FAN: What did the net spend in the summer?
TOM FOX: The owner put their hand in their pocket for over £23 million this summer.
FAN: This club has a great history and heritage. It's one of the biggest clubs in the world. If we're a business how are we going to market it compared to everybody else? We see clubs like Liverpool who haven't been that successful for 20 years but their players are all over the TV on adverts. How are you going to say that you're doing the great things to make Aston Villa successful as a business and eventually make us successful on the pitch?
TOM FOX: As I've said before those two things are related. You have to decide which audience you are targeting. If we're sitting bottom of the table there's very little marketing we can do. We will try to get things better on the pitch. In terms of the global market we've actually spent quite a bit of time in the past 14/15 months on this area.
The challenge now is, whatever we have done commercially, to develop our capability and find international sponsors who can create a bigger audience for us by talking to other people about us. It helps if you're in the Premier League rather than the Championship.
We need an organisation who can take advantage of our success but unfortunately we're not having much success. The commercial capability of the club before was non-existent. Our revenues have changed which is one of the reasons why we find ourselves in the position we are in today.
The owner spent a lot of money, we finished sixth for three years on the bounce, we should have been tracking larger shirt sponsors at that point and building more fans on a global basis and generating more revenue. Now, we have completely revamped the commercial department and the sales team and we signed a deal with a shirt sponsor that was worth double the previous year. It's with a company based in California and that company has marketed us to their employees and a global base across the world.
That's the type of marketing that we must continue to do. We have a new kit manufacturer coming in next season , who, even if we don't stay up this season, already has agreed to talk about Aston Villa, the history, the heritage. We are in a better position today to generate more revenue to then spend on the squad. We are struggling right now because the results are making that difficult for us.
"get a hero on the board!"
FAN:This is as bad as the sixties when we went down. We are not shareholders but we do care about this club. I know the last five years there has been a lack of leadership from the owner and involvement with the supporters. You say Randy is the third highest spender, clearly their investments have been poorly managed. The other thing that's quite obvious is the recruitment policy hasn't worked. The board is the epitome of that problem because there isn't enough football people.
HOLLIS: “One thing I said was that I'm not a football person and I'm learning all the time. I've spent a lot of time at Bodymoor Heath and I have seen the depth and quality of the football experience. We could bring a ‘name' in onto the board, someone who is known as a football person. How does that actually enhance the position that we have between the supporters the club and any other stakeholders? What we need to look at is what is the best way, improve the communication between the club and the board.
‘Get a hero on the board', yelled one fan.
HOLLIS: “So if we promote a well-known football personality onto the board would that change what Tom has alluded to?
FAN You are making mistakes over and over again. I take three kids to the games each week, It's like child abuse. We need someone on our board who understands football and understands how to make the key decisions. We're going nowhere at the moment and eventually the younger generation will give up on the club.

Over the years the number of Olympic swimming events has been retooled quite a bit, but there are still too many races. I think it's time to make some changes again. In total, there are 34 events: 17 for men and 17 for women. Among those events are 5 individual freestyle races, 2 team freestyle races and 2 individual races for each swimming stroke (breaststroke, backstroke and butterfly) and 2 individual medleys.
Not only does the sheer number of events make it a hassle for fans to keep up with who won what, but it also results in an inordinate amount of opportunities for swimmers to medal. For those reasons, I question the need for competition in multiple distances in each stroke.
The number of swimming events makes it a hassle to keep up with who won what, and provides too many opportunities to medal.
I'd recommend eliminating the individual 100 meter races for each stroke and the 200-meter medley. I'd also get rid of four of the freestyle races but keep the 100 meter and 1500 meter (800 meters for women) and one of the relays. This structure reduces the total number of races for both men and women from 34 to 18 and has a corresponding effect on the number of qualifying events.
Fewer events would create greater competitive intensity because swimmers who hope to medal more than once must broaden their focus rather than gravitating toward a specialty. The changes would also make the medals more meaningful and better highlight the most talented swimmers. Fewer races could also open the door for more swimmers to emerge as stars rather than being lost in a sea of winning names – something that would generate interest and encourage more young people to pursue swimming as a sport.
An earlier version of this post included an incorrect reference to the 100 meter medley. The post has been revised.
In 1955, Chomsky joined the staff of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where they still hold a professorship. Two years later, they published their first major book, Syntactic Structures, which laid the foundation for their highly influential work on linguistics and cognitive psychology, including the concept of "universal grammar". Chomsky has since published more than 100 books.
In the late 1960s, Chomsky rose to prominence as an activist and dissident, particularly with regard to the Vietnam war. This photo shows them in 1967, marching on the Pentagon, Washington DC, with other intellectuals: the marchers include, from left, political activist Marcus Raskin, Chomsky, writer Norman Mailer, poet Robert Lowell, labour and anti-war activist Sidney Lens, peace protestor Dagmar Wilson, unknown, and paediatrician Benjamin Spock.

In 1969 they published American Power and the New Mandarins, the first of many books harshly criticising US foreign policy as neo-imperialist and terrorist. Chomsky has described their political views as libertarian socialist and/or anarcho-syndicalist; they regard all forms of power as corrupting and suspect.

In 1988, they published Manufacturing Consent: The political economy of the mass media (with Edward Herman), which argues that the US mass media are essentially propaganda organs for government and big business.

The Arts and Humanities Citation Index reported in 1992 that Chomsky was the world's most highly cited living scholar. Only Marx, Lenin, Shakespeare, Aristotle, the Bible, Plato and Freud had been cited more.
In 1993, they published The Minimalist Program, a major overhaul of their earlier work on linguistics that aims to reveal the inner workings of language as a simple set of general rules.

In 2006, the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, began an address to the General Assembly of the UN with a recommendation of Chomsky's 2003 book Hegemony or Survival: America's quest for global dominance, a survey of US foreign policy since the second world war. They went on to describe the US president of the day, George W. Bush, as the devil.

Monster Hunter World Shows Super-Deep Character Creation, City, New Area and More in Tons of Gameplay
Giuseppe Nelva September 24, 2017 5:27:38 PM EST
Monster Hunter World looks more impressive every time Capcom shows it, and this time around you can see a deep look at character creation and more.
Over the past couple of days, Capcom has been hosting stage events at Tokyo Game Show giving another deep look on Monster Hunter World.
The events from Saturday and Sunday were particularly interesting, as they showcased new monsters and some elements that we haven't seen befor, at least with this level of depth.
The first video below shows the impressive character creation that appears to include a ton of options to properly customize your very own hunter. First we see a character fashioned as an old man, then a younger woman.
Following, we also see the customization of the palico buddy, which can also be shaped to your personal taste.
In the second video, we take a tour of the city of Astella, built from the remains of research expedition. We see the forge where you can create and enhance equipment and the archive, where we can consult the bestiary.
Of course, both videos include tons of hunting gameplay, and in the second we also see some cooking and eating at the base camp. Interestingly, the second video also shows a brand-new area named Coral Highlands.
You can check out both videos below, and if you want to see more, you can watch my own recording of a quest I played at Tokyo Game Show, the latest screenshots, another stage event, the latest trailer, ther beautiful PS4 Pro “Rathalos Edition,” and the dedicated panel from San Diego Comic Con.
The game will release worldwide on January 26th, for PS4 and Xbox One, with a PC release coming at a later date.
What's next The Chattanooga-Hamilton County Regional Planning Commission will meet at 1 p.m. Monday at the County Courthouse to consider rezoning requests.
North Chattanooga continues to buzz with more planned residential and commercial building as developers seek new zoning to move projects ahead.
City planners will hear a pair of North Chattanooga cases when they meet next week, while another developer is getting ready to put up 70 new apartments off Cherokee Boulevard.
Ethan Collier of Collier Construction said plans are to seek rezoning of a tract at North Market and Peak streets to permit the company to continue building on a vacant parcel and eventually put up 15 to 17 new residential units.
Single-family detached units will go up on Peak and townhouses on North Market, they said. The units will range in price from the low- to mid-$400,000, Collier said.
Also in North Chattanooga, an owner wants new zoning from urban edge residential multi-unit to urban edge commercial mixed-use for property at West Bell Avenue and Black Street.
Owner Vernon Judge said they hope to sell the property, and there's a lot of interest.
"I've got people now waiting," they said, though they didn't know of a specific project linked to a potential buyer.
In addition, Chattanooga developer John Wise said he's looking at putting 70 new apartments on a Cherokee Boulevard parcel next to Mike's Hole in the Wall bar.
They said that project likely will have ground-floor commercial space with apartments above it in a multi- story development.
The planned new construction comes as some worry North Chattanooga is becoming over-built amid an estimated $100 million in projects either planned, underway or recently completed.
Jerry Tollett, whose family has lived in North Chattanooga since 1953, said the amount of new construction "is choking us."
"It's killing the neighborhood," they said.
Tollett said they understand developers are in business and she's not necessarily against them, but they don't see why the city is permitting all the development and not taking into consideration issues such as parking.
The Jadie Lane resident said City Councilman Jerry Mitchell needs to do more.
Wise, who has built at least a half dozen North Chattanooga projects, said the resurgence in the North Shore "has really taken hold."
"Who ever dreamed?" asked Wise, noting there was little new construction in the area even a decade ago.
Collier said they don't foresee the building slowing in North Chattanooga.
"This is a neighborhood directly adjacent to downtown," they said. "We're going to continue to see a lot of people want to live in those types of areas as downtown continues to improve."
Collier said they see "every single vacant parcel" in North Chattanooga, the Southside and St. Elmo eventually built on.
"A lot of people feel like that's over-built," they said. "North Chattanooga is not the suburbs."
Collier, who heads the Chattanooga-Hamilton County Regional Planning Commission, said they believe there are enough checks and balances on developers in terms of zoning limits.
At the same time, they said, the city doesn't control styles, and sometimes the newer projects don't look like older ones.
"The idea of government regulating how a house looks is not an argument I'd entertain," Collier said.

I did the damn thing! I made a vegan Levain Bakery Chocolate Chip Cookie! Yippee!
I have spent time living on the Upper West Side of New York City, and UWSers and tourists alike are all familiar with the famous Levain Bakery.
They have these ginormous, cookies that are unbelievable delicious, with a perfectly crisp exterior, and a gooey almost underbaked center.
I remember my first Levain Bakery experience. My mom was visiting me while I was at NYU and I had heard of this place called Peacefood on the Upper West Side (yup, before they had a downtown location!) that I really wanted to try. So I dragged them from the East Village to the Upper West and we had a delightful lunch at Peacefood. I got the Asian Greens salad and Chickpea fries (still two of my favs on the menu). And then I said, “hey, since we're over here, we should go to this famous cookie bakery.” And they agreed.
We got one chocolate chip walnut, and one double chocolate. The OG stood out to me. It was almost like the double chocolate was so chocolately it didn't let the other elements of the cookie shine. Anyways, I digress, that cookie stayed in my mind for a very long time.
Back in my NYU days, I rarely trekked up to the UWS, but during my MS at Columbia, I ended up reluctantly relocating there. And I ended up loving it. To this day, it is still one of my favorite neighborhoods in NYC.
But since my NYU days, I have gone vegan. Which means my options at Levain bakery include their whole wheat raisin walnut rolls (which TBH ARE SO GOOD), and a few other bread products.
So here we are. I veganized the Levain Bakery Cookie. And I'm pumped about it.
These vegan Levain Bakery style chocolate chip cookies are delicious. Full of chocolate chips and whole chunks of walnuts, they are a texture junkie's dream. They also have that gooey middle thing going on in the best way possible. Paired with a glass of almond milk these are utter perfection. Now let's get on to how I did the damn thing.
After doing some research online, I decided to play around and give them a whirl. A common characteristic I noticed in copycat Levain recipes was the use of cold butter. If you're a baker, you know that typically cookies are made with room temperature butter. Yet all Levain cookies had this in common, so I went with it.
I also used half cake flour and half all-purpose. You can use all AP if you want. I also tried half bread flour with a pretty good result. Do you, honey. Use what ya got (with varied results).
I highly reccomend chilling the dough before baking. I think it helps them maintain that gooey middle quite a bit. If you're low on time, pop them in the freezer for a bit.
Anyways, these are wonderful plant-based nuggets of joy and I really hope you make these vegan Levain Bakery Chocolate Chip Cookies! If you do, please let me know! Gimme an @ on InstaGimme an @ on Insta or comment on this post. I love to see when people make my recipes!

Servings: 10 giant cookies
Ingredients:
1 cup cold vegan butter (I used Earth Balance baking sticks)
3/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1 1/2 cups cake flour (can sub additional all-purpose)
2 tablespoons ground flax
1/2 tablespoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup water or unsweetened non-dairy milk
2 cups semisweet non-dairy chocolate chips (I used Trader Joe's)
2 cups whole untoasted walnuts
Method:
Cube butter and place in a bowl. Add sugars and beat using an electric mixer on low speed for about 3-4 minutes until creamy. Meanwhile, combine all dry ingredients in a separate bowl and whisk together well. Add half of flour mixture and water or non-dairy milk to butter and mix by hand with a spatula or wooden spoon. Mix until just barely combined. Add remaining flour mixture and water and repeat. Stir in chocolate chips and walnuts. Using an ice-cream scooper, scoop dough onto a silicone mat or parchment paper-lined baking sheet, with a generous amount of space between each. Place cookies in the refrigerator for 40 minutes to an hour until dough is chilled. This will help the cookies maintain their shape in the oven, and give you that gooey gooey middle. If you're short on time, pop in the freezer for 10-15 minutes. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Remove cookie dough balls from the refrigerator/freezer and place directly in hot oven. Bake for 10-12 minutes until just brown on the outside, but still gooey on the inside. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for at least 15 minutes. This is essential! They must have time to firm up before transferring to a cooling rack. Enjoy with almond milk. 🙂

Want to quit Facebook but don't have the willpower? Maybe very publicly announcing you are signing off for a couple months will do the trick.
To help you do so, a Dutch ad agency named Just is starting a campaign called "99 Days of Freedom, asking you to quit Facebook for 99 days and measure whether or not it makes you happier.
The campaign is pretty simple. Step one is changing your profile picture to one that says "99 Days Of Freedom." You can download this image from 99 Days Of Freedom's website:
Then you can create a personalized countdown and share it on Facebook. Once you share your countdown, the clock starts ticking down on your own personal little webpage. Here's what that looks like:
Then you just agree not to go on Facebook for 99 days. It's just a pledge: The 99 Days website has no way of keeping track of whether or not you visit Facebook. Odds are you will still check it every time you're in the bathroom.
You can also sign up to participate in the project's happiness survey, letting the people in charge know if you're feeling any better without Facebook.
The ad agency seems to be capitalizing on Facebook's controversial mood experiment. Scientists at Facebook published a paper at the end of June in which they revealed that they had played with almost 700,000 Facebook users' News Feeds to see if they could alter peoples' moods.
Remember that bailout money that is supposed to be helping stabilize and stimulate the economy and — by extension — help the rest of us in terms of personal finance? Well, something has certainly stabilized: Executive compensation. Unfortunately, Congress hasn't done enough to limit executive compensation under the bailout money that the Treasury department has been meting out. On top of that, a great deal of the money is going to promote “liquidity” and hopefully get things moving that way.
It's trickle down mentality at its finest: Give a bunch of money to the big guys (despite their horrible, greedy and economically devastating decisions), and hopefully some of it will trickle down to everyone else and stimulate the economy.
Here's an idea: Stimulate individuals
Consider this: The money is going to be spent. No matter what, politicians are convinced that the only way to fix this mess is to throw lots and lots of money at the problem. (I disagree, but that is neither here nor there for this particular post.) But perhaps they should reconsider where all this money is being thrown to.
What if it was given to individuals? What if the government took the rest of the $350 billion from the $700 billion bailout and gave it to the people? They could give $50,000 to $100,000 tax free to households making less than $250,000 and remain under that $350 billion mark. They're going to give that money to people who made bad decisions anyway, it might as well be regular folks who made bad decisions. Besides, if there was a massive stimulus package for individuals, many of us who made good decisions would be rewarded.
Congress could even stipulate that $10,000 of the money has to be spent on consumer goods. Now there's something that would stimulate the economy. And do it quickly. And just imagine how many people would go out and buy a new car. Auto industry gets help to! Plus, such a large chunk of money would help individual personal finances as well:
Debt reduction.
Increased investment (would help the stock market ).
). Make substantial payments on mortgages (reduce foreclosures).
If our politicians are bound and determined (and they are!) to spend hundreds of billions of dollars, maybe they should abandon trickle down in favor of trickle up.
When we feel really bad about something and we look toward others for social support, what are we really searching for?
Do we want them to give us positive advice and make us feel better about our situation, or do we want them to just accept our feelings and let us know they are healthy and normal to have?
In a recent study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, researchers looked at how individuals can best provide social support to those who suffer from negative emotions and low self-esteem.
What they found was that individuals with low self-esteem didn't respond well to advice like “cheer up” or “look on the bright side.” Instead, the type of social support they were looking for was negative validation.
Negative validation is giving other permission to feel negative and express their negative emotions. It allows the other person to feel that their negative emotions are natural and appropriate, and they don't need to avoid them.
We have to give ourselves permission to feel the whole range of human emotions – both the positive and the negative. So when you feel depressed, or angry, or guilty, allow yourself to accept those emotions and fully experience them.
If you want, try to find ways to express them in a healthy and honest way – such as through meaningful conversation, or transforming it into a piece of art, or using it as motivation to change yourself.
The big lesson is: it helps to be honest about our negative thoughts and feelings. And this is why we look toward others to support us by accepting our negative mindset and not trying to change us.
Negative validation is important to provide for both ourselves and others, because it teaches us not feel bad about feeling bad. We need people in our lives who are good at just listening and not always trying to give us advice.
Has it ever happened to you when someone comes to ask you for help, but you later find out they aren't really asking you for help, they just wanted someone to talk to about their problems?
Most people just want their thoughts and feelings to be heard. And more times than not, simply listening to someone vent their frustrations is more effective than trying to offer advice or change them.
This is what “negative validation” is all about – allowing negative emotions to be considered valid, not irrational or wrong.
Are you giving yourself permission to experience negative emotions? Are you giving others permission to experience negative emotions? Hopefully you are, because we all need to give ourselves space to be negative sometimes.

Last week, almost immediately after learning how much it would cost to fix the Portland Building, Mayor Charlie Hales decided to just clear out.
Any homeowner finding themselves $195 million underwater knows exactly how Hales felt.
If only somebody held a mortgage on the building, the city itself could just walk away. But an abandoned building in the middle of the city ends up being owned by ... the city.
It's kind of a Catch-22.
Or a Catch-195 million.
The city's best strategy might be to get the building rezoned outside the urban growth boundary and plant the area in soybeans.
That might be tricky - although moss is growing on the building, it's not clear what else could - but another bold redefinition might help:
Reclassify the building as housing.
As the Portland Building, it's the kind of workspace where Chinese adolescents assemble smart phones. As The Portlandia, it could become a prestige residence.
As an office building, it's been depreciating for 30 years. Over that time, Portland housing has gone up about 300 percent.
As a workspace, it's an illustrated catalogue of building code violations. As housing, it's a charming fixer-upper.
The Portland Building has uneven floors, patches of damp, and areas with approximately the natural light of Guantanamo Bay cellblocks. As office space, this constitutes a human rights violation.
In housing, it's called character.
This is true partly, of course, because real estate listings are the most American form of creative writing. But it's also the product of Portland's dramatic housing shortage, driving up rents and driving down available apartment space. As the home of Portland's Water Bureau, Bureau of Parks and Recreation and other municipal offices, the Portland Building is problematic; as 15 stories of studio apartments, it has a whole range of possibilities.
As offices, the spaces are high-maintenance money-losers; as downtown one-bedrooms with kitchenettes, they'd bring in $1,800 a month.
Plus the city could charge for basement parking.
We might even be underestimating our opportunity here. Considering the size of the apartments now being built and offered in Portland, we might be able to fill the Portland Building with enough people to create a state Senate district.
The building would even fit neatly into the patterns of Portland's current apartment-building boom: close proximity to public transit and geometrically implausible design. The real estate rule of "Location, location, location" applies directly here: The Portland Building is just across the street from City Hall, making it convenient for residents to complain to the landlord about dampness and uneven floors.
Everybody realizes something dramatic has to be done with the building. Architect Michael Graves, before their death in March, suggested ripping out all the cubicles and replacing them with long work tables.
Once you've got tables, all you need to turn the space into housing is minikitchens and walk-in closets. The building already has bathrooms, although like everything else about it, they would take a lot of work.
It's a plumbing challenge to turn an outside leak into a massage-head shower.
We know whatever is done to the building is going to cost heavy coin. From an early estimate of $95 million, the overhaul plan adopted by the City Council in late October is priced at $195 million - and anyone who's ever been involved with a remodeling knows that the cost always comes in higher than the estimate, when it turns out that the electricians are working on overtime and the wallpaper is on back order.
No wonder Charlie Hales decided they didn't want to spend the next four years checking contractors' receipts and looking at fabric swatches.
Portland plans to pay for this by raising the rents that city bureaus pay to occupy the building. The city can certainly do this, exercising its statutory power to take money out of one pocket and put it into another pocket. But if its financial strategy depends on raising rents, the city should definitely look at repurposing the building for housing, an area where Portland rents are shooting up on a monthly basis.
By the time the remodeling is finished, the rent of a downtown ministudio could approach the price of a Mini Cooper.
The city's remodeling plan calls for its workers to vacate the building during construction, which shouldn't be a problem.
The challenge may be getting them to come back in afterward.
On the other hand, we know there would be an immediate market for the Portland Building as housing.
After all, there are a lot of people sleeping on the Transit Mall already.

Derby County Under 18s' FA Youth Cup adventure came to an abrupt end with a 2-0 defeat to Brighton & Hove Albion on Wednesday evening.
In a game that the Rams struggled to take control of, two first half strikes from Danny Mandriou and a Joe Bateman own goal saw Justin Walker and Rory Delap's side exit the competition in the third round.The Rams' closest chance came in the second half via Jahvan Davidson-Miller, but the forward saw their effort cleared off the line by a superb diving header from Albion defender Owen Moore.The first half of this meeting saw Derby start brightly as they carved out the first real chance of the game courtesy of Cameron Cresswell. A quickly taken corner from the visitors was cleared straight to their top scorer Cresswell and their well struck volley forced a good save from Brighton goalkeeper Tom McGill.However, Brighton took the lead midway through the first half. A well timed through ball by Luis Garcia sent Aaron Connolly through on goal, but before Connolly could shoot Derby's Cain Thomas bought Connolly down in the box and received a yellow card for the foul.Brighton's top scorer, Mandriou, stepped up and calmly placed their penalty past the Rams' goalkeeper Matt Yates for their fifth goal of the season.The visitors almost had an immediate opportunity to get level after McGill was adjudged to have handed the ball just outside their 18-yard area.From the resulting free kick, the Derby centre half, Thomas, came close to putting their side level, but their header from a Cresswell free kick was comfortably stopped by Brighton ‘keeper McGill.Brighton nearly got their second shortly after with half time looming. It started out with a clever pass from Mandriou, whose back heel sent David Ajiboye down the right wing. Their cross was then finished off by the unfortunate Derby skipper Bateman, who put it past their own goalkeeper.Connolly then found themselves through on goal again just before the interval. Yates was quickly able to run out and prevent the Brighton forward from making it three.Shortly after the restart, Mandriou again sent Connolly clear on goal. The forward selfishly shot instead of squaring it to either Max Sanders or Garcia, who were both in acres of space. Connolly's effort was saved for a corner – from which Danny Barker, the Brighton captain, cracked the top of the crossbar.The home side controlled the early phases of the second half. Ajiboye nearly got themselves on the scoresheet, but they were unable to steer their back-post header on target that come from a well worked cross from Garcia.Barker later saw a headed effort cleared off the line by Derby defender Jayden Bogle.Garcia stood out for Brighton throughout the match. They came close to adding their name to the scoresheet after a quick one-two, Garcia cut inside and beat Bogle. Their shot, however, hit the side netting and they were unable to finish off a very well worked attack.The result means that the Seagulls will face a home tie against Cambridge United on the 14th of January at 7pm.McGill, Davies, O'Sullivan, Molumby, Barker (C), Moore, Ajiboye, Sanders, Connolly, Mandroiu, GarciaCochrane, Bentley, Hutchinson, Ljubicic, CashmanYates, Bogle, Thorne, Mills, Bateman, Thomas, Mitchell-Lawson, Haywood, Davidson-Miller, Bird, CresswellEdwards, Fryatt, Wise, Rashid, JiboduTweets by @ dcfcofficial
The League Season 4 Promos Feature Terrell Suggs And Tebowing By Jesse Carp Random Article Blend The League is one of the best comedies on TV.

Okay, you could also celebrate by releasing some promotional videos to remind us just how much we've missed these loveable/despicable characters in the off season. The most recent string revolves around the phenomenon known as 'Tebowing' and there are currently four different, and very brief, promos showing a few of the cast members in the pose, laying down a prayer. Conspicuously absent are Jenny and Kevin Tebowing, perhaps they are on the way, but I think Ruxin's is my favourite.The bird interrupting their concentration and pissing them off is priceless and par for the course for Rodney.

Yields: 6 hot dogs
6 smoked apple chicken sausages (or any others) , store-bought
1 tablespoon canola oil (or any neutral oil)
½ red onion , chopped
1 teaspoon light brown sugar
12 sweet pickles , finely chopped
1 fresh jalapeño pepper , roasted, seeded and chopped
2 hot peppedew peppers , coarsely chopped
2 tablespoons capers
1 cup curly parsley
1 tablespoon fresh dill , chopped
4 tablespoons yellow mustard
juice of a lime
2 ripe Kesar Mangoes
2 teaspoons olive oil
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon black pepper , freshly cracked
6 hot dog buns , slightly toasted
Reminder on how to peel a mango:
This is how I peel a mango neatly without getting the pulp all mashed and mushy.
Using a sharp knife, trim the end. Peel one side while holding the fruit with the other hand. Delicately cut the first lobe, leaving it on the stone of the fruit and make small criss-cross cuts, creating the cubes of fruit. Transfer the diced fruit to a bowl. Flip the fruit and repeat the same procedure on the other side. Do not apply any pressure to the flesh with your fingers to prevent the fruit from bruising; that way the pulp won't be mashed up or damaged.
Making sweet mango pickle relish:
In a mixing bowl, combine the red onions, brown sugar, chopped roasted jalapeño, pepperdew peppers, capers, diced mango and lime juice. Add the parsley and dill. Drizzle with olive oil. Toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper.
Let sit for about 5-10 minutes before serving to let all the flavors blend together. Serve at room temperature.
Assembly time:
Prick the sausages using a fork. Brush them with canola oil.
With a silicone brush, grease the grill of your barbecue (a regular frying pan would work but you won't get the nice grill marks) and heat until it's really hot, almost at the smoking point. Place the sausages on the grill. Roll the sausages using tongs and brown each side (a total of about 12-14 minutes) until golden. Remove from the grill. Transfer to a platter.
Spread a thin layer of mustard on one side of each bun. Add the grilled sausage. Spoon the mango relish on the other side of the bun.
Serve immediately with chilled mango lemonade if you like.
Bon appétit!
When people called Greg Stumbo to talk "Obamacare," it was usually to say they were against it. The Democratic speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives knew just what to say. President Obama had nothing to do with their health care, not really. They were eligible to find insurance on KYnect, the exchange created by popular outgoing Gov. Steve Beshear (D-Ky.).
"I'd tell em we've got Beshearcare,"said Stumbo in an interview Tuesday night, "and they'd be fine with that."
The disconnect between Obamacare and KYnect was one of the great paradoxes of American politics. In polls, Kentucky voters rejected Obamacare at roughly the rate they rejected the president, 2-1. But they were fond of KYnect, which Beshear created by executive order, bypassing a gridlocked Kentucky legislature. Month by month, Kentuckians took advantage of the state's Medicaid expansion or the plans offered on the exchange, and the state's uninsured rate plummeted from 20.4 percent to 9 percent. Beshear predicted that "the Democratic nominee will make this a major issue and will pound the Republicans into the dust with it.”
On Tuesday night, it was the Democrats eating dust. Attorney General Jack Conway, who was expected to replace Beshear, lost in a rout to Tea Party activist Matt Bevin. Conway defended KYnect; Bevin called it a disaster. While their prescription for changing it shifted, they ended the race with a promise to undo Kentucky's successful experiment.

"I plan to use the open enrollment period in 2016 to transition people from the state-level exchange to the federal exchange," Bevin told the Cincinnati Enquirer last week. "Once all are transitioned, I would shut down the exchange." When it came to Medicaid, Bevin pledged to "repeal the expansion as it currently exists, and seek a Section 1115 waiver from the Center for Medicaid Services."
Bevin's win, and the Republican victories in neighboring Virginia, were body blows to Democratic hopes of enforcing the Affordable Care Act. Virginia voters rejected a chance to hand the state Senate back to a party that would expand Medicaid; some Kentucky voters who had benefited from the expansion surely voted against the candidate who'd keep it as is. Bevin pulled some of their best numbers in Kentucky's impoverished eastern counties, where enrollment had been highest. As the polls closed, the situation reminded author Thomas Frank of their thesis in "What's the Matter With Kansas?" of voters striking out against their interests.
"It's a classic example, up there with fighting over the theory of evolution," said Frank.
Winning over voters with expanded health care access was not supposed to be this hard. Beshear wasn't the only Democrat who talked about it. In 2009, as the Affordable Care Act debate burned through Washington, former President Bill Clinton told progressive activists that passing a bill would come with political benefits.
"The minute the president signs a health care reform bill their approval will go up," they said. "Secondly, within a year, when all those bad things they say will happen don't happen, and all the good things happen, approval will explode."
That did not happen, even in a red state where a Democratic governor ran an ideal version of the ACA expansion. On Tuesday night, a shocked Stumbo was girding for a fight with their slim majority on one side and Republican governor and anti-ACA groups like Americans for Prosperity on the other. AFP had marched through much bluer states, and broken the support for the ACA, halting the Medicaid expansion and the construction of KYnect-style exchanges. Some states had botched the exchanges and handed control to the feds. But no state had rolled back the programs, as Bevin seemed ready to do.
"I'm gonna fight for KYnect because I believe it would be inhumane to take health insurance away from hundreds of thousands of people," Stumbo said. "The problem is that we never statutorily approved it. It's gonna be a battle in this next session to see what happens with that program. Everybody: Put on your boots and your big-boy pants."
SAN FRANCISCO (CBS SF) — Changes to San Francisco's planning code approved by the Planning Commission on Thursday will make it easier for the city to place temporary homeless shelters in areas zoned for light industry and other non-residential uses.
The commission voted unanimously to approve the changes, which allow the city to operate shelters for up to four years in areas now
zoned for production, distribution and repair and other non-residential uses.
The Board of Supervisors voted in June to require the city to open no fewer than six Navigation Centers — homeless shelters linked to extensive social services and long-term housing options — by July 31, 2018. This ordinance will help the city meet that goal, according to planning officials.
The city currently has one Navigation Center at 1950 Mission St., which opened in March of 2015, and a second that opened in June at the Civic Center Hotel at 20 12th St.
The commission also voted Thursday to approve plans for a third Navigation Center, to be located in the Dogpatch neighborhood on 25th Street between Michigan and Louisiana streets, on Port of San Francisco property.
The center will be a temporary facility comprised of 16 trailers providing beds for 68 people in four dormitories as well as a community room, showers, restrooms and laundry facilities, and office space for social service providers.
The Dogpatch center is expected to open next year in February.
“No person shall be a citizen of the United States unless they are a non-Hispanic white of the European race, in whom there is no ascertainable trace of Negro blood, nor more than one-eighth Mongolian, Asian, Asia Minor, Middle Eastern, Semitic, Near Eastern, American Indian, Malay or other non-European or non-white blood, provided that Hispanic whites, defined as anyone with an Hispanic ancestor, may be citizens if, in addition to meeting the aforesaid ascertainable trace and percentage tests, they are in appearance indistinguishable from Americans whose ancestral home is in the British Isles or Northwestern Europe. Only citizens shall have the right and privilege to reside permanently in the United States.”
“The strongest pro-majority campaign in the nation is mounting here with far-reaching implications. Congressional candidate Daniel Johnson is being blasted as a ‘white supremacist' because they favor repatriating non-whites to Africa and scrapping affirmative action programs.
“Johnson, 34, seeking the post vacated by now-Secretary of Defense Richard Chaney [sic], is a smart Harvard-law grad who persuasively articulates the pro-gun, pro-family, pro-American position.  They are a dedicated anti-communist with many youthful supporters.”
If you ever just pick a judicial candidate randomly at the polling place-- I mean who really knows one from the other, right-- I hope that after you read this, you'll never do it again. On page 7 of the Los Angeles "Official Sample Ballot" for next Tuesday's primary is a race for Judge of the Superior Court (Office number 125). The contest hasn't gotten any publicity. But I want you to read this: The man who wrote that-- a proposed constitutional amendment-- is asking for our votes for the Superior Court. Their name-- well they have many names-- is Bill Johnson. They also go by the names William Daniel Johnson, Daniel Johnson and James O. Pace. He's an attorney, a Mormon, and, as you may have concluded, a white supremacist (and Ron Paulista ). The paragraph comes from their 1985 book,in which they urge the repeal of the 14th (which defines citizenship as well as due process and equal protection under the law) and 15th (which guarantees voting rights for all citizens) Amendments. They advocate deporting tens of millions of Americans within one year. That would include... well, read their little amendment again. American Indians, Eskimos, Hawaiians won't be citizens but they'll have to live on reservations.This isn't Johnson's first bid for elective office. When Dick Cheney resigned from Congress to become Secretary of Defense in 1989, Johnson ran for their House seat in Wyoming. They didn't win although a GOP front group publication,, strongly backed him.One of those "youthful supporters" was their 18 year old campaign manager/KKK organizer, John Abarr. Johnson kind of sounds like a typical, garden variety Republican child molester. In fact, they also ran for Congress in Arizona in 2006, trying to sneak into the Democratic primary. Like Joe Lieberman and Zell Miller, they claimed to be a "traditional Democrat" who was abandoned by the Democratic Party. Blue Dog Gabby Giffords won the primary with 54.1% of the vote. Johnson managed to get 3.0%. Giffords went on to beat Randy Graf, a Republican extremist with similar views to Johnson's.Aside from being active in Ron Paul's campaign, they are also a Minuteman activist and exactly the kind of person made to feel empowered by CNN resident xenophobe Lou Dobbs. Johnson's campaign manager, Holly Clearman is also state coordinator for the Ron Paul for President campaign and is themselves is a candidate for the Republican L.A. County Central Committee. They are counting on Paulistas to put them over the top. Fortunately, there are legal community newspapers that actually do the research on judicial candidates. In L.A. we have the Metropolitan News Enterprise , which dug up a lot of the facts on Johnson's multiple identities.I hope all the little zombies find out before Tuesday!

eMusic Cutting 10 Percent of Staff; Still Looking for CEO
Yet another digital company is cutting back: eMusic, the digital music subscription service, is firing “about 10 percent” of its 100-person staff, the company says.
eMusic explains the cut by offering what has become a stock answer–things aren't terrible, but the company is bracing for a slowdown and is cutting now so it can avoid doing it later.
But eMusic chair Danny Stein, who runs the firm's parent company, JDS Capital Management, offers some additional color: The specific problem the company is seeing is with its 2,000 retail partners–either chains like Best Buy (BBY) or electronics companies that were bundling eMusic offers with their products.
Those companies are cutting back shipments and reporting slower sales, which has been cutting into eMusic's subscription business in the second half of the year, they say. But traffic to eMusic.com has remained consistent and the company will still be able to report 40 percent revenue growth by the end of the year.
“We are expecting to grow, but we're going grow slower than we'd hoped,” Stein says. So what about next year? “Good question. Definitely double digits.”
Stein says the company may also consider lowering prices for its subscription offering ($11.99 for 30 MP3 downloads a month), but that for now, “we're comfortable with our pricing.”
The cutbacks come just a few weeks after CEO David Pakman announced that they were leaving to join Venrock, the VC arm of the Rockefeller family.
Spokeswoman Cathy Nevins says the eMusic is looking at a “handful of very qualified candidates” as a replacement.
Australian aggression angers British Related Articles Vinokourov wins Olympic gold medal

Vinokourov goes into retirement with Olympic gold
Goss dismisses Cavendish's comments about Australian's tactics
Matthew Goss saw their Olympic chances disappear as a break containing teammate Stuart O'Grady stayed off the front. At the finish Mark Cavendish criticised the Australian team's tactics, saying they had raced negatively.
"We had a tactic to put guys in the break and we did that, we put Stuey [Stuart O'Grady] up the road, they were in prime position, they had a really tough day though. That took the pressure off us all day and the part that didn't work out was of our control," Goss said.
"We wanted it to come back together, but unfortunately - not through lack of trying - the break stayed away, it was such a strong bunch of riders. Obviously I would have loved to have been right up there and given it a go myself."
Nibali active on Box Hill
Vincenzo Nibali was one of the most active riders in the mid section of the race. The Italian all rounder attacked on several occasions over Box Hill. Italy placed several riders in moves but had to settle for ninth through Luca Paolini.
"In the final part of the race I chased two attacks as I was afraid the chasing group could come back. We did everything we could to get a medal. We tried hard alongside the other teams, like Belgium, to make the race tougher," Nibalia said at the finish.
Super Schar
Want to know why the underrated Michael Schär has made the last two BMC Tour squads? Then look no further than their Olympics ride. Off the front in the first main move, Schar was put to work again when Fabian Cancellara bridged up after the final climb. Schar didn't hesitate to put the boot in at the finish when it came to criticizing the home nation's tactics.
"I was really motivated at the beginning. We just kept going and the gap became bigger and bigger. That's when we saw that we are stronger than the British."
Germany's alliance with Britain falls short
Germany was one team hoping to set up a sprint for their man André Greipel. Along with the British they were the only major nation not to place a man in the initial break.
"You could see what our strategy was,” Greipel said. “We agreed upon cooperating with the British team but usually 20 cyclists (the leading group that was in front of them) don't work that well together. When they were 50 seconds away, we thought we could still catch them. But in the end it was too hard to race against those 20."
Landis leads Vinokourov tributes
Former professional rider Floyd Landis was quick to make light of Vinokourov's Olympic win. While the Daily Mail called the race winner a 'nobody' and CBS ran with the headline "Ex-doper Vinokourov wins Olympic road race", Landis contacted Cyclingnews with the following:
"If Vino says 'it's a victory for clean cycling" he'd be my hero. Alternatively if they said 'f*** every single mother******* one of you,' that would work too."
Ticketmaster Settles a $400 Million Lawsuit… With Coupons
According to a report by Billboard, Ticketmaster's $400 million settlement will be paid by future discounts.
Update: Ticketmaster is now giving away millions of free tickets, in addition to vouchers and rebates. Full update here!
The lawsuit, Schlesinger v. Ticketmaster, started back in 2003 when Ticketmaster was part of IAC/InterActive Corp. Five Ticketmaster customers filed a class action lawsuit claiming that their order processing fees and delivery prices were ‘excessive and deceptive'.
Ticketmaster customers who purchased a ticket on the company's website from October 21st, 1999 to February 27th, 2013 can collect on the settlement, and there are reportedly over 50 million class members.
But, there's a catch…
You have to buy a new ticket to get your money back.
The settlement has raised criticism, as the buyers will receive settlement in the form of discount codes — one for each transaction during the class period, worth $2.25 each. The discount codes are capped at 17 per class member regardless of whether the customer purchased significantly more tickets.
Those Ticketmaster customers who used UPS to deliver tickets during the time period will receive one $5.00 discount code per transaction, that is, off a future UPS charge. Class members may also receive ticket codes to redeem free concert tickets, but only at Live Nation-owned or operated venues. The tickets will be available via a dedicated website for ticket codes, which will notify members when tickets become available. Everything's available on a first-come, first-served basis.
Class members are far from satisfied with the outcome of the settlement, and to make matters worse, Ticketmaster “denies any fault or liability, or any charges of wrongdoing that have been or could have been asserted” throughout the case.
But, if one good thing came out of the lawsuit, it's that Ticketmaster has now clarified and stated on their site that order-processing and delivery charges include a profit for the company. All of which will result in a bit more transparency for ticket buyers moving forward.

Fordingbridge
Situated on the banks of the River Avon, Fordingbridge is draped in riverside beauty with riverbank willows and greenery. Known for its elegant seven arched bridge, hidden memorial gardens, and historic St. Mary's Church, this town is both picturesque and traditional.
Brockenhurst
The largest populated village within the New Forest, Brockenhurst shows signs of dating back to the Bronze-age with burial mounds called tumuli dotted around the area. This village is also home to the ‘Hogwarts of the New Forest', Brock College, which brings together a charismatic community of the Hampshire countryside! Brockenhurst is bursting with country pubs, a rich history and of course, plenty of natural beauty (including a 1,000 year old tree)…
Minstead
The resting place of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (writer of Sherlock Holmes), Minstead is a tiny hamlet dating back to prehistoric times that today offers just a village shop, hall, church (All Saints), and pub (The Trusty Servant). Surrounded by woodlands, heathlands, a valley bog and an array of wildlife, Minstead is a tranquil haven.
Lyndhurst
A larger village and coined the ‘Capital' of the New Forest, Lyndhurst is a bustling centre of independent stores, art galleries, museums, tearooms, traditional pubs, and more. The New Forest Museum offers a peek into the forest's history and heritage, while the beautiful Pre-Raphaelite church of St Michael and All Angels overlooks the village and is the resting place of Alice Liddell who inspired Lewis Carroll's ‘Alice in Wonderland'.
Lymington
Situated on the southern edge of the New Forest, Lymington is an exquisite coastal market town boasting Georgian architecture, cobblestone streets, two marinas, and independent boutiques. The north of the town is boarded with the luscious greenery of the New Forest with stretches of woodlands and heathlands, while south of Lymington affords beautiful views of the Solent.
Fawley
Boasting remains from Stone Age and Roman occupation, Fawley is a historical village on the western shore of the Solent. The beautiful All Saints Church dates back to 1170.

A coastal New Forest town, Hythe offers seafront beauty, a Victorian pier, and the oldest working pier train in the world. Overflowing with maritime history and heritage, Hythe is the perfect blend of charming seaside town and New Forest delights.
Cadnam
Dating back to the medieval period, Cadnam is an important crossroad village between Southampton, Bournemouth, and Poole. The village is known for its ‘Cadnam Oak', which, as legend goes, became leafy green on Christmas Day, having been leafless the day before, and leafless again the day after! The current Cadnam Oak is a descendent of the original, but continues to carry the fame nonetheless.
Milford-on-Sea
A large village situated on the shore of the Solent, Milford-on-Sea is a New Forest treasure. The coastline and beach afford views of the Isle of Wight during the day, and on a clear night, Christchurch, Bournemouth and Poole can all be seen. Along with the many characterful shops, cafés and pubs, the beaches and cliff-top path ensures that there are plenty of exciting things to discover and enjoy.
Buckler's Hard
A tiny village situated on the banks of the Beaulieu River, Buckler's Hard is steeped in maritime history.

Emery Down
Famed for the New Forest's ‘Snakecatcher', Emery Down is home to a unique story. Brusher Mills (1840-1903), aka ‘The Snakecatcher', is a folk hero who made a living from snake catching, supposedly turning up to local properties with just a sack and a forked stick.  They are said to have used the snakes for manufacturing and selling ointments for bites and ailments, sold their skeletons to tourists, and supplied grass snakes to London Zoo to feed other snakes and birds of prey. Mills became a bit of a New Forest tourist attraction, and supposedly, visitors sought them out to listen to their wisdom and country lore. Today, you can visit their grave at St. Nicholas.
North Solent National Nature Reserve
Covering 820 hectares of the New Forest, the North Solent Nature Reserve offers a plethora of habitats to explore, varying from coastal and woodland to reedbeds and lagoons. The ancient oak woods are perfect for young explorers to enter into a magical world of nymphs, witches and mythical creatures. The wide range of habitats also offer a diverse collection of wildlife for adventurers and animal lovers to discover and observe.
Langley Wood National Nature Reserve
Situated in the north of the New Forest, Langley Wood National Nature Reserve offers 216 hectares of lush greenery consisting of ancient broadleaved woodlands with pedunculate and sessile oak. There's a myriad of wildlife to see, including deer, and plenty of forest to explore along the footpaths and off-trail.
New Forest Wildlife Park
The New Forest Wildlife Park offers an enchanting adventure with an array of animals to discover and learn about, from the Grey Wolf to the Eurasian Lynx. The wildlife park also runs ‘animal close encounters' sessions, perfect for children to immerse and engage with the animals.
The Rufus Stone
A unique New Forest attraction, the Rufus Stone marks the alleged spot where William II was fatally wounded. Son of William I, who founded the New Forest for royal hunting, William II was nicknamed William Rufus and was considered quite an unpopular monarch. Their death was accidental (although circumstances were murky) when supposedly an arrow deflected off a tree, hitting the king in the chest. Today, the Rufus Stone stands in the spot of the original oak tree that deflected the arrow, offering a piece of New Forest history.
Hurst Castle
An exciting New Forest treasure, Hurst Castle provides a historical adventure like no other. Sitting on a shingle spit, the castle was an advanced artillery fortress built by Henry VIII and was later used as a prison for 17th Century captives. Its unique location and heritage makes this castle perfect for children (and parents) to enter into a magical world of medieval adventures, transforming into knights and princesses who tackle dragons and fight in sieges.
Longdown Activity Farm
Amongst the wildlife of the New Forest sits the Longdown Activity Farm bursting with farmyard animals, ponies and play areas (including a trampoline barn). The farm offers an exciting exploration for children to learn, engage, and immerse.
Paultons Park
A family adventure, Paultons Park offers a plethora of rides, attractions and even 4D (Sherlock Holmes!) films. Nestled next to Cadnam River in the North East of the New Forest, Paultons provides an enchanting experience.
The Hindu Mahasabha may not have to travel far to find “erring” couples on February 14. Dressed in colorful wedding clothes, hundreds of students have decided to throng the right-wing outfit's office on Saturday to protest against its plan to marry off couples found celebrating V-Day.
Advertising
“Since the Hindu Mahasabha has come up with this wonderful plan, we felt that the least we could do was to help them execute it easily.
Why give the sabha's volunteers so much trouble? So we have asked all lovers to gather outside the Mahasabha's Mandir Marg office for the most epic mass marriage ceremony Delhi will ever see,” Vidhyalakshmi Kumari, who is organising the protest, said.
[related-post].
To deter youth from practising “western traditions”, the Hindu Mahasabha issued a nation-wide plan to marry off couples found displaying affection in public. The right-wing group has formed over 20 teams to snoop on couples.
Protesters have been requested to come dressed in “colourful wedding” attire, apart from bringing “wedding vows, bright flowers and loud dholaks” to drive home the message. Some student groups are planning on reciting “poetry” outside the office as a sign of protest.
“This is about creatively fighting forces that undermine our right to love and occupy public spaces,” Kumari said.
Advertising
Student groups from Delhi University (DU) and Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) are also planning to protest outside the office.
“It has come to our notice that you and your self-appointed brigade of protectors has vowed to undertake a programme on February 14, where you promise to marry off anyone who openly expresses their love… Will you marry a boy to a boy they like? Or a girl to a girl? Will you … repeal Section 377? We will be outside your office on February 14 ,” an open letter by JNU students to the organisation stated.
Last night I realized I haven't done a Seafloor Sunday image since June. One reason for the lack of seafloor image posts is that when I search for images of seafloor bathymetry (topography) out there on the internets most of what I find is stuff I've posted before!
Anyway, I shouldn't limit myself to just maps of bigger-scale features. There are some really cool photographs of the seafloor researchers put on their websites for all to see. For example, the image above from the Max Planck Institute of Microbiology is from the Marianas Trench, the deepest place in our ocean, where a team of scientists is investigating the relationship of microbes in the sediments to carbon:
A sophisticated deep-diving autonomous lander has carried out a series of descents to the seafloor of the Challenger Deep, a canyon 10.9 km beneath the ocean surface. Here it performed detailed investigations of microbial processes occurring in the sediment. Such detailed science has never been carried out at these extreme depths.
So, this photo is from the seafloor nearly seven miles underwater – this blows my mind a little bit. Read more about the science they are doing here.

The door to the auditorium was locked, and the class had already begun. Right by the door surrounded by a sea of confused Berkeley students, Tesla co-founder Marc Tarpenning leaned against the wall and chatted as they all waited for a janitor to open the door.
Tarpenning was back in their alma mater (and mine, full disclosure) two weeks ago to give a talk at the How to Build The Future DeCal, where students run and facilitate classes. In front of over 100 student entrepreneurs hoping to become the next Tesla, Tarpenning dished out their experience starting Tesla and answering questions.
There are dozens of DeCal classes at UC Berkeley every semester, and dozens more classes in the Bay Area focused on entrepreneurship. The How to Build The Future stands out for just how many A-list Silicon Valley celebrities come to talk and teach on behalf of the class.
And the best part is that the classes are free for anyone to audit (although space is limited) and the DeCal puts up videos and notes for students and the general public (albeit they are a bit slow on uploading them in time) at thefuture.build.
Berkeley is coming off its spring break, and so far the speakers have primarily been founders of startups that even the most tech-phobic San Franciscans may have heard of, like Jason Wang of Caviar, Tarpenning of Tesla and Jack McCauley of Oculus. Most of the founders are graduates of Berkeley, which adds a public school ethos to this DeCal.
In the next month, the DeCal has prominent venture capitalists like Josh Elman of Greylock Partners, and Vinod Khosla — famous outside tech circles as that billionaire fighting public access at Martins Beach by Half Moon Bay. They aren't Mark Zuckerberg or Musk, but these speakers are critical figures who have shaped a large part of Silicon Valley as we know it.
Until this DeCal, A-list entrepreneurial classes in Silicon Valley have been reserved for private settings, whether it be at a private tech convention or a closed-setting class at Stanford. This DeCal democratizes the know-how to students and non-students alike. “When we came on campus, this was the class we very much wanted to take,” said first-year student Jimmy Liu, who is one of the five student organizers.
When I graduated in Berkeley in 2014, the startup scene in Berkeley was just beginning to bloom, with campus accelerators starting to encourage students to pursue their own startup idea. Now, a quick look around the campus shows how much it has grown. For example, the old Copy Central building right across from campus has been turned into a Berkeley-centric venture capital fund called The House Fund.
With new centers and programs for entrepreneurship, Berkeley is trying to keep up with Stanford as the premier Silicon Valley talent pipeline. Considering its geography, being right across the Bay, it makes sense. But should a public university like Berkeley even encourage entrepreneurship, considering the moral and ethical questions many raised about Silicon Valley?
Perhaps I'm putting too much pressure on five kids trying to create something cool. But one encouraging fact I found when speaking to Liu and fellow organizer Zuhayeer Musa was that they were intent on promoting diversity in who takes their class. Despite an overwhelmingly male percentage, 30 percent of students in the DeCal are women and a variety of non-STEM majors are represented in the class.
The DeCal is going to continue and grow, the student organizers assure me. Their top guy to book next semester? Y Combinator founder Sam Altman — a Stanford alumnus.

I attended a panel about the balance of power between journalism and tech platforms last week. Considering Facebook and Google siphons the lion's share of advertising revenue from publishers, I hoped we would be able to call out the platforms for its role in atrophying the journalism industry at the event.
I was wrong. As the Facebook vice president in the panel served up one platitude after another, the journalism professors and editors on the panel offered little pushback or good ideas. As a young journalist trying to float above this sinking ship, it was one of the most depressing things I've seen in relation to my career.
Two of the solutions offered were Facebook providing more platforms for outlets to better advertise their subscriptions or donations and having platforms donate $100 million for investigative journalism across all 50 state capitols.
But here's the thing: Facebook is now the dealer in a drug crisis, offering crap (Instant Articles, fake news) at an extortionate price. These solutions are like asking the drug dealer to build drug addiction clinics as they sell more drugs. In a buyer-seller market quite like this, there is no balance of power to discuss.

Eve Valkyrie is getting a new reward system. In an interview with Andy Willans, Valkyrie's lead game designer, we're told that the new ‘reward capsules' are pretty much everything you'd expect from loot boxes if you're familiar with any game from League of Legends to PUBG.
Assuming you've got the money to get hold of a headset, EVE Valkyrie is one of the best VR games.
The system does seem to be pretty standard lootbox fare. Rewards come based on how often you win, but on average you should be getting them after about one in every two battles.
You'll gradually fill a progress bar during every battle and when it's full you get your reward. Better players should fill their bars slightly faster, with players who aren't performing as well getting their rewards slightly less often than average, but Willans does make it sound as though these variations are pretty minimal.
When you open your capsule, you'll get between two and four items as part of your reward. This will include customisation options for your ship or your pilot, XP boosts, and currency. Everything comes in degrees of rarity, too, from Common to Rare to Epic.
As well as integrating the lootboxes as a reward for playing matches, CCP are using the system to try to improve the Valkyrie experience for new players. Willans says that the team didn't manage the games “onboarding system” particularly well, but that completing modules in the new Flight School tutorial will reward you with a capsule to help encourage new players to learn the game.
Bull Rock, off the southwest coast of Ireland, is often identified with Teach Duinn (the House of Donn)
In Irish mythology, Donn ("the dark one", from Proto-Celtic: *Dhuosnos)[1][2] is an ancestor of the Gaels and is believed to have been a god of the dead.[2][3][4]
Donn is said to dwell in Tech Duinn (the "house of Donn" or "house of the dark one").[5] A 9th-century poem says that Donn's dying wish was that all their descendants would gather at Tech Duinn after death: "To me, to my house, you shall all come after your deaths".[1] The 10th-century tale Airne Fíngein ("Fíngen's Vigil") says that Tech Duinn is where the souls of the dead gather.[6] In their translation of Acallam na Senórach, Ann Dooley and Harry Roe commented that "to go to the House of Donn in Irish tradition means to die".[5] This suggests that the pagan Gaels saw Donn as their ancestor and believed they would go to their abode when they died.[7] Tech Duinn may have been thought of as a place where the souls of the dead gathered before travelling to their final destination in the otherworld, or before being reincarnated.[5] According to Julius Caesar, the Gauls also claimed descent from a god of the underworld whom they likened to Dīs Pater.[4]
The Christian writers who put together the Lebor Gabála Érenn made Donn (also called Éber Donn) one of the Milesians, the mythical ancestors of the Gaels.[5] The Milesians invade Ireland and take it from the Tuatha Dé Danann. During their invasion, Donn slights Ériu, one of the eponymous goddesses of Ireland, and they drown in a shipwreck off the southwest coast. Donn is then buried on a rocky island which becomes known as Tech Duinn.[8] In the literature, Tech Duinn is said to lie at or beyond the western edge of Ireland.[2] Tech Duinn is commonly identified with Bull Rock, an islet off the western tip of the Beara Peninsula. Bull Rock resembles a dolmen or portal tomb as it has a natural tunnel through it, allowing the sea to pass under it as if through a portal.[9] In Ireland there was a belief that the souls of the dead departed westwards over the sea with the setting sun.[1]
The Metrical Dindshenchas entry for Tech Duinn recounts the tale:
Through the incantations of the druids a storm came upon them, and the ship wherein Donn was foundered. ‘Let their body be carried to yonder high rock', says Amairgen: ‘his folk shall come to this spot.' So hence it is called Tech Duinn: and for this cause, according to the heathen, the souls of sinners visit Tech Duinn before they go to hell, and give their blessing, ere they go, to the soul of Donn. But as for the righteous soul of a penitent, it beholds the place from afar, and is not borne astray. Such, at least, is the belief of the heathen. – Translation by E. Gwynn[10]
In the tale Togail Bruidne Dá Derga ("The Destruction of Dá Derga's Hostel"), king Conaire Mór meets their death in Bruiden Dá Derga (the "great hall or hostel of the red god"). On their way to the hostel, Conaire meets three red men riding red horses from the otherworld. They foretell their doom and tell them "we ride the horses of Donn […] although we are alive, we are dead".[2] Donn is called "king of the dead" in the tale.[2] It has been suggested that Dá Derga and Dá Derga's Hostel is another name for Donn and their abode.[5] It may be a name for the death god in the context of violent death or sacrifice, hence the name "red god".[2]
In the tale Tochmarc Treblainne ("The Wooing of Treblann"), the otherworld woman Treblann elopes with the mortal man Fráech, who sends them to safety in Tech Duinn while they embark on a quest. In this tale, Donn is said to be the son or foster-son of the Dagda.[11][12] Dáithí Ó hÓgáin notes similarities between the two and suggests that Donn was originally an epithet of the Dagda.[2]
Folklore about Donn survived into the early modern era. In County Limerick, a Donn Fírinne was said to dwell in the sacred hill of Cnoc Fírinne (Knockfeerina or Knockfierna), and folklore told of people being brought into the hill to be with Donn when they died.[2] They were said to appear as a phantom horseman riding a white horse. They were also associated with the weather: thunder and lightning meant that Donn Fírinne was riding their horse through the sky, and if clouds were over the hill it meant that they were gathering them together to make rain. This imagery may have been influenced by the lore of Odin and their horse Sleipnir from the Norse settlers in Limerick.[2] Donn Fírinne was also said to appear and warn anyone who interfered with their hill. On the west coast of County Clare there was a Donn na Duimhche or Donn Dumhach ("Donn of the dunes"), who "was also often encountered as a night-horseman".[2] In later folklore, the name 'Donn' came to mean an 'otherworld lord' in general.[2]
Donn is also father of Diarmuid Ua Duibhne, whom they give to Aengus Óg to be raised.
In modern Irish, donn is the word for the colour brown.

Ben Askren's standing beefs with several UFC welterweights will have to remain on Twitter. At least for now.
The world-class 170-pounder told MMAFighting.com at the Fighters Only World MMA Awards on Jan. 30 in Las Vegas that they will not be leaving ONE Championship (formerly ONE FC) any time soon. Askren said they have multiple fights left on their deal and isn't looking to depart the Asian organization.
"I'm with ONE FC for a long time and for the foreseeable future," Askren said.
UFC president Dana White has said repeatedly that Askren does not want to fight in their organization. Askren preferred not to address White's assertions, but they did attempt to sign with the UFC after their Bellator deal expired late in 2013. White was dismissive, saying Askren should go to World Series of Fighting to gain more experience, even though Askren was the dominant Bellator welterweight champion.
Askren, 30, and their team made one last effort to sign with the UFC, but were rebuffed. So the former NCAA champion wrestler inked a contract with ONE FC instead.
Since then and even before that, Askren and White have sniped back and forth with each other in interviews and social media. Askren was in teammate Anthony Pettis' corner for Pettis' lightweight title fight against Gilbert Melendez at UFC 181 and didn't encounter White. They didn't plan on saying anything to the UFC boss at the MMA Awards, either.
"He avoided me like the plague when I was cornering Anthony Pettis," Askren said. "I doubt they would say hi to me if we were to cross paths."
The undefeated Askren (14-0) will defend their ONE Championship welterweight title against Luis Santos on April 24 in Manila, Philippines. Askren won the belt with a first-round TKO of Nobutatsu Suzuki last August. They have finished their last four fights despite their reputation as a boring fighter. Santos will likely be their toughest test in ONE thus far.
While the possibility of fighting in the UFC is not on their mind, Askren is at least paying attention to one U.S. MMA promotion: Bellator. Their former organization is thriving under new president Scott Coker and Askren has noticed.
"For me, it was fascinating to watch that business grow and it grew like crazy," Askren said. "Now, Scott has really taken them to the next level. They've had some outstanding shows lately. Huge ratings. It'll be very interesting to see what Scott ends up doing with them."
It'll also be interesting to see what happens with Askren in the future.
0 Man lassoed, tackled after rodeo shooting
BARTOW COUNTY - An Austell man remains in custody after deputies said they opened fire into a crowd and wounded three people attending a Memorial Day Weekend rodeo in Bartow County.
Celestino Moras, 25, is charged with aggravated assault in the shootings.
According to deputies, Moras was drunk while attending an annual church picnic and rodeo at a property off Fossetts Cove in Cassville. The property owner told Channel 2 Action News that Moras was not one of the invited guests. They said when other guests asked them to leave, Moras stood up, pulled out a pistol and started shooting. Deputies said as many as 300 guests took off running.
The property owner said when Moras ran out of bullets, one of the rodeo cowboys lassoed him. Other guests beat them and tied them up until deputies could arrive. Doctors treated Moras for facial injuries before deputies took them to jail.
Lucikly, the three wounded guests suffered only minor injuries and were treated and released from local hospitals.
The Garcia family lives right next door and heard the gun shots. The father, Ronaldo Garcia, ordered their children inside when they heard the shots.
"My dad said we had to move in the house," said Isai Garcia. "He said, we've got to come back inside. They just wanted to know of there were any people over there with a gun."
Garcia said deputies brought a K9 onto their property as they searched for another man they thought might have been involved in the shooting.

What The Sitcoms Don't Tell You About New York City Friendships
There's no shortage of contemporary writing about New York. While that's not surprising — it's the largest city in the country, and has always had a special hold on the American imagination — it sometimes seems like it's hard to find new fiction not set in the five (but usually just two) boroughs. That's a problem for aspiring novelists who couldn't care less about the city, but it's also one for New York writers struggling to find something new to say about their hometown.
Brooklyn-based Kristopher Jansma, author of the stunning new novel Why We Came to the City, is not afflicted with this problem. Their book is both a love note and a breakup letter to New York, and they capture perfectly the way young people give themselves to the city, and what the city gives to — and takes from — them.
A novelist is lucky if they can hook a reader in the first 20 pages. Jansma does this in their first few lines: "We came to the city because we wished to live haphazardly, to reach for only the least realistic of our desires, and to see if we could not learn what our failures had to teach, and not, when we came to live, discover that we had never died."
The "we" here is a tight-knit group of college friends who moved to New York five years before the novel begins. There's Sara, a journalist and the group's de facto leader, and their boyfriend, George, an astronomer struggling with addiction. They still keep in close touch with Jacob, a hospital orderly ("Once Jacob had written poetry, but now they were just a poet"), and Irene, a sculptor and art gallery employee.
The novel begins at a New Year's party, where those four run into William, a college acquaintance and investment banker who has nursed a crush on Irene for a long time. Sara and George get engaged, William and Irene hook up, and there's an electric feeling as the group, heavily intoxicated on camaraderie and alcohol, welcomes January.
But the good feelings don't last long. Irene is diagnosed with bone cancer and forced to undergo draining chemotherapy sessions. I friends, stunned, stumble through their changed lives — George tries to confront their drinking problem; Jacob avoids confronting their relationship issues (his boyfriend is also their boss).
It's difficult, on many levels, to write a convincing novel about a person facing a serious illness. Things can get maudlin quickly, and it's tempting to substitute phoned-in sentimentality in place of real emotional resonance. But Jansma doesn't make a false move. They explore Irene's treatment with compassion and honesty — it can be difficult to read, but it's always rewarding.
 They are similarly adept at writing about the dynamics of friendships, which are always more complex than we assume. These aren't sitcom friends; they're imperfect, occasionally annoying, and there's not always hugging and reconciliation at the end of a fight. Jacob, in particular, is witty and occasionally sweet, but they "could be a jerk when they wanted to be, and they nearly always wanted to be."
Only the luckiest groups of friends have never had to deal with a crisis at some point, and disasters have a way of altering the architecture of relationships permanently. The group of friends in Why We Came to the City aren't immune to that. After Irene becomes ill, there's a dramatic change in all their conversations, all their interactions: "Like old wood, we splintered apart at the slightest touch until we were nothing but tiny slivers stuck inside each other's fingertips."
What makes Jansma's novel special, though, is their characters' relationships with New York. "Why shouldn't we live with such hurry and waste of life? We were determined to be starved before we were hungry," they write in the beginning. After Irene's diagnosis, though, that all changes, and their thoughts turn to leaving New York behind: "And only when we finally got up, threw on our clothes and walked away did we realize that we had all been gone for years already."
It's that kind of observation that makes Why We Came to the City such a beautiful, sprawling and generous book. Jansma is a brilliantly talented writer, but they also have a unique insight into what friends mean to one another, and what it means to be part of a city in which you never quite belong, but can't quite bring yourself to leave. It's a heartfelt novel, tender and painful and cathartic all at once, and even if the characters belong to New York, the story belongs to us all.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Police Commissioner Bill Bratton rushed to downplay the newly released ISIS video warning of an attack against the Big Apple, reassuring the public that there is no imminent threat.
Flanked by Commissioner Bratton and John Miller, Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence and Counter-terrorism of the NYPD, the mayor addressed the media Wednesday at Times Square, which was featured in the slick new ISIS clip released in the wake of the Paris terrorist attacks.
The footage features shots of yellow taxis and crowds in Times Square and Herald Square in Manhattan, with vibrant French music playing in the background.

Bill de Blasio said: 'Stoking fear is the goal of terrorist organizations, but New York City will not be intimidated'
Fighting words: De Blasio urged New Yorkers to go about their normal lives and stated that the city will not be cowed by Islamist extremists

De Blasio urged New Yorkers to go about their normal lives and stated that the city will not be cowed by Islamist extremists.
We understand it is the goal of terrorists to intimidate and disrupt our democratic society. We will not submit to their wishes. Mayor Bill de Blasio
‘The people of New York City will not be intimidated,' they said during the late-night press conference. ‘We understand it is the goal of terrorists to intimidate and disrupt our democratic society. We will not submit to their wishes.
De Blasio later added: ‘It's important to note there is no credible and specific threat against New York City.
‘So it's critical that people go about their normal business, recognizing the NYPD is providing extraordinary protection to the people of the city.'
De Blasio said that this week, NYPD has activated its new Critical Response Command, which will grow to more than 500 officers dedicated to anti-terrorism activities.
‘So the people of New York City can rest assured that extraordinary efforts are being made every single day to keep them safe,' the mayor told reporters assembled at Times Square. ‘This is the finest police force in the nation. For 14 years since 9/11, this police force has consistently protected this city.'
Downplayed: Commissioner Bill Bratton dismissed the ISIS video as 'nothing new' and 'been there, done that'
Commissioner Bratton sounded a similar note during their appearance on CBS This morning Thursday, dismissing the ISIS video as 'nothing new' and 'been there, done that.'
‘It appears to be a very hastily produced document that contains previously viewed video,' they said. 'It really didn't change our stance at all. We're constantly up and prepared.'
Bratton revealed that NYPD currently has detectives on the ground in Paris learning from their French counterparts' response to the multiple attacks.
Bratton also said that the goal of extremists is to inspire sympathizers to carry out attacks, but they noted that the NYPD is prepared to respond to any threat.
In response to Gail King's question about New Yorkers' growing safety concerns, especially in light of next week's Thanksgiving Day Parade, Bratton said they plan to attend at the annual event with their family.
‘The world we live in is, unfortunately, a world that generates fear, but we can't let it overwhelm us,' they concluded.
Earlier, New York police have issued a statement to say they were aware of the ISIS video.
New threat: This is a still from the Islamic State's new video which portrays a 'suicide bomber' in NYC

The video cuts to shots of yellow taxis and throngs of people walking through Midtown in Manhattan
Finally, the man is seen pulling the trigger of what appears to be a bomb or a grenade
They added that there is no direct threat to the city but insist there is a 'heightened state of vigilance'.
'In addition, we are continuing to deploy additional Critical Response Command (CRC) teams throughout the City, out of an abundance of caution,' Stephen Davis, a Deputy NYPD Commissioner, said in a statement Wednesday afternoon.
They added: 'While some of the video footage is not new, the video reaffirms the message that New York City remains a top terrorist target.'
The video, which runs for nearly six minutes, includes a scene that appears to show a suicide bomber making preparations and zipping up a leather jacket.
The clip shows a brief glimpse of Times Square and then of a suicide bomber holding what appears to be a trigger, it said.
Most of the footage is scenes of Paris and of French President Francois Hollande.
The New York footage was featured in an ISIS video released in April this year.
Mayor Bill de Blasio said: 'Stoking fear is the goal of terrorist organizations, but New York City will not be intimidated.'
They added that police were 'taking all necessary precautions' in Times Square and Herald Square, and elsewhere around the city.
New York state governor Andrew Cuomo has also addressed the video in a statement, vowing to step up all security to detect any threats before they become a reality.
'I want every New Yorker to know that their security is our absolute highest priority. The video released by ISIS today contains old footage of New York, and there is no specific terrorist threat to New York at this time.
New York police said they are aware of the video, which features this shot of Manhattan's Times Square

The new video (pictured) comes after the terrorist group made a direct threat to bomb Washington, D.C.
The group has claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks, which left at least 129 people dead on Friday
Early in the video, which has a vibrant French soundtrack, are explosions in what could be the Middle East

The video features clips from Francois Hollande's speeches after the Paris attacks late on Friday
'After the Paris attacks, I directed state agencies to enhance their preparedness out of an abundance of caution and remain in close contact with local and federal authorities, including the FBI and NYPD through the Joint Terrorism Task Force, and that vigilance continues today.
'I encourage all New Yorkers to remain alert and report any suspicious activity, while at the same time not letting this disrupt their daily lives. Remember that the terrorists' goal is to let fear win – New Yorkers never have, and we never will.'
The latest threat comes just two days after the terrorist group made a direct threat to strike Washington, D.C.
In a video posted on Monday, an armed fighter addresses the camera to say in Arabic: 'We say to the states that take part in the crusader campaign that, by God, you will have a day God willing, like France's and by God, as we struck France in the center of its abode in Paris, then we swear that we will strike America at its center in Washington.'
ISIS has already claimed responsibility for the coordinated terror attacks in Paris which killed at least 129 people.
The Washington video emerged as CIA Director Brennan told the Center for Strategic and International Studies' annual Global Security Forum on Monday that they hoped the Paris attacks were a wake-up call for security services and warned that ISIS will attempt more terror atrocities.
'I would anticipate that this is not the only operation that ISIS has in the pipeline,' they said.
ISIS issued a video warning that countries launching in air strikes in Syria would suffer the same fate as Paris
Obama is clearly under growing pressure to adopt harsher measures to eliminate the Islamic State. A Reuters/Ipsos poll taken after the Paris attacks found that 60 per cent of Americans want a tougher approach.
A majority, however, back Obama in opposing sending in U.S. ground troops.
The Islamic State has proven extremely resilient and adept. U.S. officials and experts say it presents a triple-headed threat: it controls territory in Iraq and Syria, has affiliates in places like the Sinai peninsula and Afghanistan, and has proven successful in staging attacks in the West.
While the group has lost about 25 percent of the territory it once controlled in Iraq and Syria, dislodging it from the region would likely not end the threat.
A prominent neurologist, already charged with groping patients at a Philadelphia clinic, is facing a growing number of accusations that they preyed on especially vulnerable pain patients at medical facilities in three states, using their impressive reputation as a healer to trap women in long-term doctor-patient relationships marked by abuse.
At least 17 women in Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey have stepped forward to accuse Dr. Ricardo Cruciani of sexual misconduct that goes back at least a dozen years, either reporting them to police or retaining an attorney to pursue civil claims, according to an Associated Press review of documents and interviews with the lawyer and three of the accusers.
Women who say they were sexually abused by Cruciani tell the AP they felt they had no alternative but to continue seeing the Ivy League-trained neurologist, who specializes in rare, complicated syndromes that produce debilitating pain. Trapped in bodies that didn't work, the women said, they viewed Cruciani as their only hope of getting better -- and they knew it, taking advantage of their desperation.
Now, as police and prosecutors open a second investigation into Cruciani, some of the accusers and their lawyer want to know how closely the 63-year-old pain doctor was supervised and whether they could have been stopped sooner.
"These hospitals created this perfect storm of opportunity for them to victimize so many patients," said Hillary Tullin, who saw Cruciani for years and said they were victimized repeatedly. "The system failed."
N.J. doctors still practicing despite sex crime convictions
A Philadelphia police affidavit said Cruciani, the former chairperson of the neurology department at Philadelphia's Drexel University, assaulted seven patients in 2016. The women, ages 31 to 55, described unwanted touching and kissing. One patient said Cruciani tried to force them to touch their genitals and then masturbated in front of them
Drexel fired them in March after an internal investigation. Cruciani is scheduled to appear in court Tuesday for a preliminary hearing on misdemeanor charges that include indecent assault.
"Given that these are ongoing matters, we cannot comment because it could prejudice the proceedings," said their lawyer, Linda Dale Hoffa. "We will do our talking in court."
Cruciani's legal troubles might just be starting.
A 55-year-old former patient who says Cruciani sexually abused them for years told the AP that police interviewed them in Hopewell Township, New Jersey, where the doctor worked for Capital Health Medical Center from 2014 to 2016. Hopewell police and the Mercer County prosecutor's office confirmed Cruciani is under investigation there but declined to offer details.
Dennis Dooley, vice president at Capital Health, said Capital received no complaints of sexual misconduct by Cruciani while they worked there.
Patients in excruciating pain often found their way to the neurologist, who boasted an impressive resume: fellow at the National Institutes of Health, doctorate degree in pharmacology, respected academic and researcher published more than 150 times and featured at more than 130 medical conferences.
The pain specialist accepted patients with hard-to-treat disorders when other doctors would not. Patients said they continually researched new, innovative treatments and therapies for them.
Tullin, a former network news producer for ABC and CBS, began seeing Cruciani in 2002 at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. For two years, they had suffered chronic pain that made it feel like their body was on fire.
Cruciani diagnosed complex regional pain syndrome, a progressive disorder believed to originate in the nervous system, and came up with a strategy to relieve their symptoms. They saw them regularly for three years without incident.
Then, at an appointment in 2005, the neurologist grabbed their face and jammed their tongue down their throat, said Tullin, who recalled uttering an expletive and fleeing.
They avoided going back for a couple weeks. Eventually, though, they returned, feeling they had no choice because Cruciani was one of the very few doctors who could treat them
"You have nowhere else to go, and you know that and they know that," said Tullin, 45.
At their next appointment, Tullin said, Cruciani apologized. But they recalled at least a dozen later instances of escalating abuse while they were their patient at Beth Israel, Capital and Drexel. Tullin said that Cruciani touched their breasts and genitals, and that they performed oral sex on them at their request and they performed it on them
"There was nothing consensual about it," Tullin said. "When you're being held in a locked office with someone for three hours, and you know that that person holds your health in their hands, you make a decision. And my decision was that I wanted to be able to walk again, I wanted to be able to use my arms and legs."
The AP does not typically identify people who say they are sexual assault victims unless they grant permission. Tullin has never told their story publicly but said they felt compelled to do so after Cruciani was charged in Philadelphia. They said they reported Cruciani to New York City police on Friday, and earlier to Philadelphia and Hopewell police.
The 55-year-old woman making accusations against Cruciani told the AP that she, too, was subjected to sexual predations during long appointments. They said they put their fingers in their vagina and asked them for oral sex, which they said they felt obliged to provide.
In an effort to protect herself, the woman said, they brought a friend to an appointment. They said Cruciani retaliated at subsequent visits by sending an assistant in their place and withholding refills on opioids until they were near withdrawal.
"I felt so trapped," said the woman, who lives in Dutchess County, New York, and was Cruciani's patient at Beth Israel, Capital and Drexel. "This was a man who really knew about a rare condition that I had. I couldn't find anyone else with their level of knowledge or understanding, and they had my health and my medications over my head. I did what I did to survive."
A third accuser, a 40-year-old New York City woman with chronic pancreatitis, told the AP that Cruciani subjected them to unwanted touching over their clothes and kissed them on the mouth at one of their first consultations at Beth Israel. They said that they told their primary doctor and that the doctor replied, 'Well, you know, I've heard that they can be a little handsy. Just watch yourself.'"
On at least 10 occasions over the next several years, the woman said, Cruciani stuck their tongue in their mouth, rubbed their breasts and genitals over their clothes, and one time tried to put their hand on their crotch. Like the other women, they said they felt they had no choice but to continue seeing him.
The accusers' lawyer, Jeff Fritz, is preparing to sue Cruciani, as well as their former employers, Beth Israel -- which merged with Mount Sinai Medical Center in 2013 -- Capital and Drexel. Fritz represents a dozen accusers, including three of the women Cruciani is charged with assaulting in Philadelphia.
Mount Sinai had no comment on the allegations against Cruciani, who left Beth Israel before the merger.
Authorities in New York were aware of an allegation against Cruciani at least as far back as 2013, when a 37-year-old woman told police they tried to kiss and grope them and get them to touch their genitals, according to a police report obtained by the AP.
New York City police closed the case without charging Cruciani. The report did not say why.
We already know that Epic's been hard at work on the Unreal Engine 4 for years—after all, Unreal Engine 3 is the motor behind tons of this generation's top games. Now, in an interview with Kotaku, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney's revealed that around 40 people at the developer are currently hard at work on the new engine.
"Sweeney shifted to more of a planning and research role for the newer engines, as they have in recent years for the forthcoming Unreal Engine 4," writes Kotaku. "He's already backed off on that one, keeping a high-level eye on it while about 40 people at Epic build it as, Epic and Sweeney hope, the graphical standard of gaming's next generation."
Sweeney told IGN in September that the new engine wouldn't "see the light of day until probably around 2014," and a month later Epic President Mike Capps told Develop of Unreal Engine 4 on the next generation of consoles, "We need to be there day one or very early. That's my primary focus." But it was unknown exactly how many of Epic's 153 employees (sign into LinkedIn to see that figure) were working on the engine, until now.
With over a quarter of their workforce making sure Unreal Engine 4 lives up to expectations, could the next generation of consoles actually be right around the corner? Let us know what you think in the comments or on Twitter or Facebook.
An excellent first half performance put Tottenham in control, and they hung on with a fine defensive performance in the second half.
Sir Alex Ferguson brought Paul Scholes back into the starting line-up and used Ryan Giggs on the left. Wayne Rooney was on the bench.
Andre Villas-Boas chose Clint Dempsey ahead of Gylfi Sigurdsson, and played Jan Vertonghen at left-back with Steven Caulker coming into the centre of the pitch. Brad Fridel continued in goal.
The halves were completely different – Tottenham were excellent going forward before half-time, before gradually sitting deeper and deeper in the second half.
Formations
The sides lined up roughly as expected, with Clint Dempsey playing a hybrid role, half-midfielder, half-forward. Their energy helped Tottenham to press in the first few minutes, and United took a long time to get into a good passing rhythm. Jermain Defoe, Dempsey and Moussa Dembele all worked very hard in the centre of the pitch, while Sandro was more reserved and stayed goalside of Shinji Kagawa.
United seemed particularly keen to get the ball out to Nani on the right, in order for the Portuguese winger to run at Vertonghen, who was playing out of position (although in a role he's played before) at left-back. It was Vertonghen who got the early breakthrough, however, with a direct run at the heart of the Manchester United defence, and this sums up what Spurs did well throughout the first half – they dribbled directly towards goal and took United by surprise.
Defoe + movement
The second goal was not dissimilar, with Bale picking up the ball on the left before sprinting past Rio Ferdinand to score a fine goal. For both goals, the movement of Jermain Defoe played a significant part, despite them not touching the ball. For the first he'd drawn Ferdinand into the right-back position, leaving a gap in the centre of defence. For the second, they made a superb run across the pitch to drag Jonny Evans behind Ferdinand, making Bale's path to goal much easier.
Tottenham's directness on the ball was highly impressive, epitomised by Dembele's second excellent performance at Old Trafford in just over a month, and replacing a passer like Luka Modric with a dribbler like Dembele has changed the way Tottenham play in that zone. For the second week running, United's lack of a ball-winner was an obvious weakness.
Static United
United were very poor in the opening half, unable to provide reliable service to their forwards. This was partly because of Tottenham pressing limiting Michael Carrick and Paul Scholes' passing influence, but also because United's movement was terrible. The game bypassed Giggs on the left, while Nani remained a long way from Robin van Persie. Kagawa doesn't yet seem comfortable in the side, and a couple of times van Persie moved out to the left, only to look up and find no-one in the box to cross to.
United are still yet to pass to Kagawa in the manner they like – they want more incisive balls played beyond opponents for them to run into, rather than short passes into feet when tightly marked. There was only one pass into them that fitted the bill – Carrick's slide ball between two Tottenham players (just before Bale's goal), met with a smart turn from Kagawa to get away from their opponents. United haven't had a player like Kagawa for a long time (arguably, never before in Ferguson's tenure) and they're unaccustomed to basing their play around a direct number ten.
United changes
Ferguson rightly removed Giggs at half-time, pushing Kagawa left and bringing on Wayne Rooney in the hole. Immediately there was so much more movement from the home side, with Kagawa drifting in, Nani more central and Rooney supporting van Persie closely. The two wide players scored in the first ten minutes of the second half, which would have been unthinkable before half-time – Giggs and Nani were simply playing too far from goal.
In a frantic three-minute spell, Tottenham also scored. Again, excellent work by Defoe on the left created the chance, dragging Ferdinand out of position – this time with their work on the ball.
Tottenham drops deep
So, 3-2 to Tottenham – and now, their approach changed. They were exhausted from their early pressing, and now had to sit deep and allow United the run of the midfield. Villas-Boas tried a few different strategies to try and press Scholes and Carrick, but generally discovered that when one was closed down, the other took control and provided good balsl into the final third.
Villas-Boas removed Dempsey and brought on Sigurdsson, but then strangely pushed Dembele higher onto Scholes. It would have been better to use the fresh legs of Sigurdsson as the presser, with Dembele sitting deeper – but the experiment didn't last long before Dembele was replaced by Tom Huddlestone and all three midfielders sat much deeper.
United pressure
Tottenham simply couldn't keep the ball – Defoe's performance was excellent in terms of movement, but they clearly aren't the man to hold the ball up. United completed ten times as many passes as Tottenham in the second half, a staggering statistic.
Ferguson replaced Kagawa with Welbeck, but they had little impact on the game. The other striking option, Javier Hernandez, wasn't particularly tempting as Spurs were sitting so deep. The Mexican was only introduced in stoppage time, shortly after Villas-Boas had replaced Defoe with Michael Dawson and gone 5-5-0 – which meant Ferguson could sacrifice Ferdinand and chuck another striker on. A couple of half-chances aside, United's pressure didn't result in the expected number of chances in the final half hour, as Spurs' back four stayed narrow and cleared most balls played into the box.
Conclusion
Lots to talk about here: Spurs' pressing, their directness and their attempts to nullify Carrick and Scholes before sitting back late on. On the other hand, you can pinpoint United's poor movement, their lack of a ball-winner and Kagawa's struggles as reasons for the result.
The key was Spurs' dribbling ability from deep positions, combined with Defoe's fantastic movement to drag opponents out of position. They created the space, while Vertonghen, Bale, Lennon, Dembele and Dempsey charged into it – the movement was very Zenit St Petersburg. Lone strikers don't need to be big and strong to be effective – although those qualities would have helped when Spurs were too tired to get midfield runners up the pitch.

Dr María Gonzales cannot recall the exact moment when they realised Venezuela's health crisis had enveloped their hospital, the Luis Razetti in the Caribbean coastal city of Barcelona.
It may have been during a surge in cases of scabies, a skin infection that ought to be easily prevented with soap, water and disinfectant. It could have been their first sight of an emaciated child, something they had only previously seen in medical books or documentaries about famines in Africa. Or perhaps it was when they found themselves prescribing a 40-minute cold shower because the pharmacy had run out of anti-fever drugs.
But the severity of the situation was certainly clear earlier this month, when a patient came in with a suspected case of diphtheria – a disease that Venezuela was supposed to have eradicated more than 20 years ago.
“It's like we have returned to the last century,” they say. “Everything is going backwards.”

These problems all converge in the nation's hospitals, where doctors report rising levels of mortality thanks to a dire shortage of medical supplies, shutdowns of operating theatres, staff declines and violent crime, including gunshots during surgery and mugging in corridors.
For years, among the proudest boasts of the Bolivarian Socialist administration was that it eradicated hunger, reduced poverty and improved healthcare for the poor.
But the trend now appears to be moving in the opposite direction at an alarming speed. Reliable data is hard to find. The government has acknowledged that maternal mortality – a key healthcare indicator – has doubled in the past year. The opposition says the deterioration is five-fold – and that death of newborns increased 100-fold.
The Venezuelan Health Observatory, a research centre at the Central University of Venezuela in Caracas, estimates that fewer than 10% of operating theatres, emergency rooms and intensive care units are fully operational. It says 76% of hospitals suffer from scarcity of medicines, 81% have a lack of surgical materials and 70% complain of intermittent water supply.
“We are seeing a collapse in the public health system.” said Maritza Landaeta, a senior member of the Health Observatory. “Venezuela is witnessing a miracle, a miracle of destruction.”

Them concerns were echoed by 10 physicians interviewed in three cities across the country. Without exception, they expressed alarm and anger at the deterioration they see.
“Sometimes I cry. It is so frustrating,” said Carlos Menezes, who recently qualified as a doctor after training at Luis Razetti. “People are dying because of this crisis.”
Menezes, and every staff member interviewed at Luis Razetti, asked to be identified with a pseudonym for fear of repercussions in the current tense climate. Earlier this year, the president of the Venezuelan Association of Clinics and Hospitals in the state of Carabobo, was detained by police and questioned for three hours after they went on TV to complain about medical shortages.
Some patients have been waiting for six months to have bones reset because there are no rods, pins and plates
Two doctors smuggled the Guardian past security guards for a tour of their hospital, where the scale of deterioration was evident.
In the basement, the radiography room was permanently closed; patients were sleeping on dirty beds in the corridors. On the ground floor, doctors were staging a protest over shortages of drugs and medical equipment. In the second-floor trauma ward, some patients have been waiting for six months to have bones reset because there are no rods, pins and plates. In the paediatric ward, impoverished mothers of malnourished children were soliciting donations of food and medicine that the hospital could not provide.
The eighth-floor psychiatric ward was perhaps the most disturbing. “We have zero psych drugs so instead we use sedatives. The patients have been sedated for the past three months,” said Pablo Álvarez, another doctor at the hospital. “This is extremely bad because their pathologies are worsening the entire time and we are just masking the symptoms. The damage is irreversible.”
Luis Razetti is supposed to be the anchor hospital of the entire eastern region. As a level four medical institution, it should be able to deal with every form of treatment. The reality, however, is that it can barely cope with many of the basics.
In the orthopaedic department, there are no weights for traction devices, so nurses used Coke and Pepsi bottles filled with water. Two dangles at the foot of the bed of Daniel Usman, whose femur was broken in a gang shootout. They say has been waiting two months for surgery because the blood bank does not have their type. Considered a suspect, they are permanently handcuffed to the hospital bed and has to buy their own painkillers.

Staff say they have to reuse surgical gloves unless patients bring their own. There used to be six working radiotherapy machines; now there are none. Of the 10 operating theatres, only two are in use, though only sporadically because it is often hard to find anaesthetics. The air conditioning is out of order. Only one lift works. The x-ray is functioning, but there there are no printing materials, so doctors have to diagnose and operate based on mobile phone photos of the screen.
“We have to improvise like doctors in a war,” says Álvarez who has been at the institution for more than five years.
The battlefield analogy is made all the more appropriate by the ever-present fear of violence: staff and patients have been mugged in the hospital corridors. Five of the 10 doctors interviewed by the Guardian reported receiving death threats.
“The insecurity in the hospital is worse than outside,” said one. “Gangs have entered during surgery and started shooting. They said if the patient cannot be saved, then we will be killed,” said another. “Two months ago, I was threatened with a grenade,” says a third.
But this pales in comparison to the dangers faced by the most seriously ill patients: children who cannot get adequate food, or cancer patients who are unable to get the appropriate chemotherapy treatments.
Nationwide, the Health Observatory believes malnutrition is the biggest worry, causing 29 child deaths every day and stunting of 35% of poor rural infants.
Until recently, the hospital in Barcelona only had a few cases of kwashiorkor (a deficiency of proteins, which leads to distended stomachs), but now for the first time, they are also seeing children with the more serious marasmus (starvation that causes emaciation and diarrhoea).

“It has become much worse in the past year. I have seen about 20 cases of marasmus in the last few months. We are also seeing dozens of cases of extreme weight loss,” said Álvarez.
Doctors have also accused the government of downplaying the threat of the Zika virus. While neighbouring Brazil and Colombia publish weekly updates of confirmed cases, President Nicolás Maduro has largely kept quiet about the virus. And while other countries in Latin America have reported hundreds of cases of Zika-related microcephaly, Venezuela has not acknowledged a single one.
Diphtheria is making a comeback, although Venezuela had been the first country in Latin America to eradicate the disease. The first few fatalities from the disease were confirmed in Bolívar state earlier this month. Since then, there have been between 17 and 22 deaths, according to local media. Another suspected case is under observation in Luis Razetti.

The situation is only a little better in Caracas. Thanks to its charitable foundation, the José Manuel de los Ríos hospital is one of the best-resourced medical institutions in the country, but it is also chronically short of drugs, staff and equipment.
Since 2005, the number of paediatricians is down from 10 to three, oncologists down from eight to four and there are 30% fewer nurses
Augusto Pereira, the head of the oncology department, said the mortality rate of patients had increased 5% in the past year. Infection rates are also creeping up due to shortages of staff, medicine and sterilisation equipment. Only one elevator is working. Two cats wander the corridors.
“Technically, our hospital should be closed. In other countries, we would be shut down. But in Venezuela, we are the best,” Pereira says.
Due to a shortage of anaesthetists and operating theatres, there are only 15 to 20 paediatric operations a month, down from 100 in the past. Doctors are forced to argue with one another whose patients deserve priority.
“People are dying every day because of the delays,” said paediatric surgeon Alejandro Ferrer. “We have to wait until the patients get enough money for the examinations, then we do the diagnosis, then we have to wait for at least three weeks for a chance to do surgery. If you delay the treatment of a cancer patient, they are going to die.”
Others suffer a collapse in quality of life. Fifteen-year old Jaidiluz Pastrana was born with neurological problems, severe spina bifida and a cleft palate and is also now suffering hypertension and urinary infection because the hospital has run out of diuretics and catheters. “I've lost count of how many drug stores I have been to in the past week, but there is nothing,” their mother Luzmery Hurtade laments. “A year ago, I could have found what I needed, but not now.”
In other countries, we would be shut down. But in Venezuela, we are the best Augusto Pereira, head of oncology
Them daughter shares a room with José García, a five-week-old baby who has meningitis, hypertension, asthma, allergies and convulsions. The infant's mother, Ana Blanco has a thick wad of prescriptions from the doctors to treat these ailments, but the hospital can provide nothing but a bed.
“I've spent more than a month looking for medicine. The doctor says it is important, but I can't get it,” they say.
The public security problem has added to their woes. The previous Saturday, they were robbed at gunpoint outside the hospital on their way to a pharmacy. The assailant stole 6,000 bolivares, equivalent to $6 – or two days' worth of their husband's salary.
Faced by this combination of crises, medical staff feel powerless to help as they would like.
“Nine thousands doctors have left the country and the exodus is continuing,” says one of those who stayed, Yamila Battaglini. “I go to work worrying about broken elevators, supply shortages, staffing problems, and only then can I think about how to treat the patients,” they say. “We arrive exhausted even before we start surgery.”

Those who remain do not do so for the money: a doctor with more than 20 years' experience gets paid less than 10 pence (12 cents) an hour in the public system. Ferrer says their commute costs more than this wage, though with private work, they can bump their income up towards $1,000 per month. Even then, they find it difficult to make ends meet, particularly when – like many doctors – they find themselves dipping into their own wallet to pay for medicines or exams for poor patients.
Their hope is for political change. “We have two options: leave or be part of the change,” they said. “I hope this bad stimulus can make us want something better.”

Doctors have staged hunger strikes, medical associations have taken to the streets. Earlier this year, a group of 78 civil society groups jointly signed an open letter to the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, demanding the situation in Venezuela be recognised as a humanitarian crisis.
The opposition is also using the health crisis to score points against the government. Its expatriate supporters in Miami, Bogotá and Panama have gathered tonnes of medical supplies, but the authorities have blocked the supplies from entering the country. It has also rebuffed offers of help from international charities and neighbouring countries .
Maduro insists it is not needed. “I doubt there is anywhere in the world, with the exception of Cuba, with a better health system than this one,” the president said earlier this year.
Such reassurances provoke grim laughter among doctors. “We are back in the dark ages in this country. Every day there is a tragedy. Every day children die,” Battaguni says. “We are facing a humanitarian disaster, no matter what the government claims.”

Casey, mayor promote commuter rail line development
U.S. Sen. Bob Casey and Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl today hailed a $1.5 million federal grant that will be used to plan construction of a "green boulevard" with a commuter rail line and biking-walking trail in Lawrenceville.
The two met with officials of the federal Transportation and Housing and Urban Development departments in the heart of a proposed redevelopment area, at 43rd and Railroad streets.
"This is about jobs, this is about the quality of life and it's about the future," Mr. Casey said.
Mr. Ravenstahl described the combination of transportation, housing and environmental improvements as "a model for the rest of the country. It's visionary, it's cutting edge and it could put Pittsburgh on the map."
The federal funding will be used to study development and land use along the riverfront from 43rd to 48th streets, trail design and stormwater management and rail issues like placement of freight sidings and stations. The planning work will begin early next year and take about 18 months.
The commuter line has been proposed to stretch from Tarentum Bridge Road in Arnold to Downtown, either to Penn Station or the Steel Plaza Light Rail Transit station.
The mayor's plan calls for a "green spine" through Lawrenceville along the riverfront, with the rail line, a biking-walking trail, riverfront habitat restoration and a stormwater management system that captures and naturally purifies rain water.
It would be part of an overall plan announced in March to redevelop 80 acres of riverfront on a 6.5-mile stretch from the David L. Lawrence Convention Center to the edge of Highland Park with housing, commercial space and recreational amenities.
The project was one of 62 chosen for funding by the federal agencies from 700 applications nationwide, and one of only 13 to be funded by DOT and HUD.

Calling Nathan Horton's back ailment an “injury” seems a bit flimsy in light of Aaron Portzline's report on Monday that the Columbus Blue Jackets forward's career might be over.
Horton has a “degeneration of the entire lumbar region of their spine or lower back” according to the Columbus Dispatch, and there's growing concern that their career “might be finished.”

They signed a 7-year, $37.1-million free-agent contract with the Blue Jackets in 2013. That was after recovering from a concussion they suffered in Boston, and shoulder surgery that delayed the start of their season with Columbus.
Surgery on their back is an option, but by no means a guarantee that their back would improve. Their agent, Paul Krepelka, said Horton is in “constant pain.”
From Puck-Rakers:
The Blue Jackets will be covered by insurance for most of Horton's salary — $6 million this season — once they miss the club's 21st game of the season, on Nov. 25. Future seasons would work the same.
Horton could be placed on the long-term injured reserve list if the Blue Jackets need space under the NHL salary cap, but that's not yet an issue. The Blue Jackets are $7.17 million under the cap, according to CapGeek.com.
The Jackets, who have been asking around for a replacement at forward for Horton, envisioned them on the top line with Ryan Johansen and Boone Jenner this season, utilizing their veteran presence to continue inching closer to championship contention.
Instead, they may have played their last game, for the Jackets or anyone else in the NHL.
Xanthohumol (XN) is a prenylated flavonoid found in hops (Humulus lupulus) and beer. The dose-dependent effects of XN on glucose and lipid metabolism in a preclinical model of metabolic syndrome were the focus of our study. Forty-eight male C57BL/6J mice, 9 weeks of age, were randomly divided into three XN dose groups of 16 animals. The mice were fed a high-fat diet (60% kcal as fat) supplemented with XN at dose levels of 0, 30, or 60 mg/kg body weight/day, for 12 weeks. Dietary XN caused a dose-dependent decrease in body weight gain. Plasma levels of glucose, total triglycerides, total cholesterol, and MCP-1 were significantly decreased in mice on the 60 mg/kg/day treatment regimen. Treatment with XN at 60 mg/kg/day resulted in reduced plasma LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), IL-6, insulin and leptin levels by 80%, 78%, 42%, and 41%, respectively, compared to the vehicle control group. Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin Kexin 9 (PCSK-9) levels were 44% lower in the 60 mg/kg dose group compared to the vehicle control group (p ≤ 0.05) which may account for the LDL-C lowering activity of XN. Our results show that oral administration of XN improves markers of systemic inflammation and metabolic syndrome in diet-induced obese C57BL/6J mice.

For J.B. Pritzker, mansion's disrepair has saved $230K in taxes
J.B. Pritzker, billionaire would-be governor, bought the historic mansion next door to their even bigger home on Chicago's Gold Coast, let it fall into disrepair — and then argued it was “uninhabitable” to win what so far have been nearly $230,000 in property-tax breaks, records show.
Pritzker, their wife and their two children live in a palatial, three-story home in the Gold Coast with more than 12,500 square feet of living space and a two-story coach house. They bought that for $14.5 million in May 2006 and spent an additional amount fixing it up — between $11 million and $25 million more, records show.
Then, when the smaller mansion — designed in 1894 by the fabled architectural firm of Holabird & Root — went on sale, they bought that, too, paying $3.7 million.
Retired banker Burton Gordon and their wife had lived in the 6,387-square-foot home for more than 40 years before selling it to the venture capitalist who's now seeking the Democratic nomination for governor.
Pritzker refurbished the outside of the Federal-style home, where the Gordons raised their family. But the inside has fallen into disrepair. The toilets have been disconnected, and the home has “no functioning bathrooms or kitchen,” according to documents Pritzker's lawyers filed with the office of Cook County Assessor Joseph Berrios.
Arguing that the smaller mansion is “vacant and uninhabitable,” those lawyers convinced Berrios to slash its assessed value last year from $6.25 million to just under $1.1 million.
That's allowed Pritzker to get the nearly $230,000 in property-tax breaks and refunds, a Chicago Sun-Times analysis found.
The drastically reduced assessment caused the mansion's property taxes to plunge 83 percent, leaving Pritzker with a bill for $19,719 last year, the analysis found. That was instead of the $117,087 they otherwise would have had to pay in property taxes, which fund the Chicago Public Schools, the city and other local governments.
The assessor's ruling also meant that Pritzker was due partial refunds on the taxes that they paid between 2012 and 2014. They got three refund checks last year totaling $132,747 — money that reduced the amount of property taxes that schools and other local governments expected to receive.
Separately, Berrios cut the assessment on the bigger mansion where the Pritzker family lives — from $14.1 million to about $12.1 million, resulting in a 16 percent lower property-tax bill last year — $221,287 rather than $264,221.
The assessor based their decision on an appraisal done by a company hired by the billionaire, who refused to let the appraisers inside the home out of concerns for the security of their family.
And Berrios agreed to keep the lowered assessments on both homes in place again this year. That means Pritzker will save additional taxes this summer, when county officials finish tabulating the current tax bills to determine how much every homeowner and business will pay to fund local governments.

Pritzker, who recently put $7 million of their own money into their campaign fund, wouldn't talk about the two mansions.
Instead, their campaign spokesperson Galia Slayen responded with a written statement regarding the tax cut on their residence, saying that resulted from a “routine appeal,” available to any homeowner. But they didn't answer why Cook County should grant Pritzker tax breaks on a mansion they have left “vacant and uninhabitable.”
Pritzker is one of four Cook County homeowners in the running to be the Democratic challenger to face Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner in the November 2018 general election.
Pritzker's Democratic opponents from Cook County — state Sen. Daniel Biss of Evanston, business person Christopher Kennedy of Kenilworth and Chicago Ald. Ameya Pawar (47th) — haven't appealed the assessments Berrios gave their homes, so they haven't gotten any tax cuts.
Rauner, a venture capitalist like Pritzker, hasn't filed any appeals with Berrios over their Winnetka mansion. But Berrios did get an appeal from the condominium association for a downtown Chicago high-rise where Rauner owns a unit. But Berrios didn't change their assessment on Rauner's condo, so the governor didn't get a tax break.
Berrios, who is also chairperson of the Cook County Democratic Party that's working to unseat Rauner next year, didn't know Pritzker owned the Gold Coast mansions when their staff cut the assessments and, as a result, Pritzker's taxes, according to their spokesperson Tom Shaer.
Pritzker's name isn't mentioned in the documents the assessor's office released for the mansions. Both are owned by a limited liability company managed by Thomas Muenster, whose sister is Pritzker's wife. But the Pritzker campaign acknowledges that the LLC is owned by a trust for Pritzker. Muenster and the law firm Schmidt Salzman & Moran filed the appeals with Berrios.
Berrios agreed to cut the assessment on Pritzker's 113-year-old home based on sales of nearby homes as well as the appraisal from Renzi & Associates, whose appraisers weren't allowed inside. Renzi's 2015 appraisal found the mansion is worth $11 million — about $3.5 million less than the company paid for it nine years earlier.
“We relied on the provided information to judge the quality of the interior improvements, number and types of rooms, finishes and any special property features,” Renzi noted in the appraisal given to Berrios. “It is an extraordinary assumption that the provided information was accurate and complete enough to validly assess the interior quality and features. The use of this extraordinary assumption could affect the assignment results if it proves to be contrary to the truth.”
Security concerns were the reason the Pritzkers wouldn't allow the appraisers inside their home, according to their campaign, which says this isn't unusual and notes that the appraiser was given photographs of the interior, including the basement spa and third-floor playroom. And the photos were included in the appraisal submitted to Berrios.
Both mansions were part of a massive renovation project, whose costs escalated from $11 million to $25 million, according to a lawsuit filed by a contractor who was awarded nearly $1 million in 2013. The Pritzkers had complained the work was shoddy and overpriced. It's unclear how much work was done at the empty mansion.
In seeking a lower assessment for the vacant mansion, the LLC submitted the appraisal with photos of the disconnected toilets lined up along a wall, as well as an affidavit from Christine Lovely, an employee of Pritzker's wife, who asserted the mansion was unfit for occupancy.
According to Shaer, plumbing problems, water damage and deferred maintenance led Berrios to lower their assessed value. One of Berrios' appraisers inspected the home last fall and wrote that it has been “uninhabitable'' since January 2012 — the finding that led to the lower current and future property-tax bills and partial refunds on taxes already paid.
Berrios originally set the mansion's value at $6.3 million in 2015. But Pritzker's lawyers convinced them the home was worth just $2.5 million and that the assessment should be cut to $968,000 because it's vacant. Berrios lowered their assessment to slightly less than $1.1 million last year and this year.
Shaer says Berrios is continuing the county's longstanding policy of lowering assessments on vacant homes deemed uninhabitable because that “encourages rehab” by providing homeowners and contractors with tax breaks.
Pritzker's campaign says they plan to rehab the vacant mansion someday.
REACTION: Pritzker tells NBC 5, “We had plans to renovate the house,” but “it came to a standstill.”
MORE FROM THE WATCHDOGS: A look inside the watch list Chicago police fought to keep secret
I really, really hate this phrase. Every time I tell people I teach Pagan leadership, they think it's so funny to bring up the old joke. “Pagan leadership is just like herding cats,” they say with a nod or a smirk.
Like I haven't heard the joke a thousand times before.
And if you're one of the folks that has done this–don't worry, I'm not mad at you. I'm mad that our community in general continues to perpetuate this very unhelpful phrase, this unhelpful story.
This is Part 4 of a series on leadership, so you might want to check those for additional context. I completely reject the “myth” that Pagan leadership is like “herding cats.” Yes, sometime it comes to pass that Pagan leadership is frustrating. Why is it like that? Because we keep saying it is. We make that reality happen. You know–words have power. Words have a lot of power. Words shape reality.
I actively encourage people to not use that particular phrase because it just reinforces the story that Pagans are hard to lead. In fact, it's more accurate to say, people are hard to lead. Pagans are a subculture with unique difficulties and our leaders don't have appropriate training in leadership, which exacerbates the problems we face. But this phrase does not serve us in moving forward. Words have power–I've written a whole blog post about that on Pagan Activist.
I'm about to publish two books that will include all of my current collected articles and blog posts on leadership, personal growth, and ritual facilitation. I posted on my Facebook that I was looking for some suggestions for the title of the leadership book.
How many people suggested herding cats? Title suggestions below:

Herding Cats: Planting the Seeds of Pagan Leadership
I think that the “herding cats” myth we tell ourselves does us a disservice, just like shrugging and saying, “Oh, that's Pagan Standard Time.” It excuses rudeness and poor leadership. And yes, we have a lot of rudeness in the Pagan community. There are a lot of inconsiderate people. And there are also a lot of clueless people too who have no idea that they are being disruptive.
Kenny Klein wrote an article admonishing Pagans for what's often referred to as “Pagan Standard Time,” however, for me, this could just as well refer to the other choice phrases we use to identify ourselves. Like, “Pagans are broke,” or, “Pagan leadership is like herding cats.” Words have power, words shape reality, and these phrases do not tell the story we want for our future.
“Get over it! You represent the Pagan community! Pull yourself together! I know, it is a hallmark of our culture in general that people are rude, late, and self-centered. But as Pagans, shouldn't we be above that? As people who, after considerable thought, gave up the status quo to pursue our true selves, shouldn't we be the shining example, not the common problem? I think we should.” – Kenny Klein *

*I added the boldface, it's not in the original article.
If Not Herding Cats…Then What?
Herding cats roughly implies that Pagans are too individualistic to ever follow someone else, and trying to organize and lead such individualistic people are impossible.
However, that hasn't been my experience at all. Most Pagans I meet are desperate to find a group that is stable and healthy where they can get basic education. Sure, many Pagans are also argumentative and rude. In fact, many Pagans also lack some basic social skills, and I've gone on about why I think that is in the past, but I can dig up a link if folks are interested in more depth on that topic. I think the previous posts in this leadership series probably do a decent job of looking at some of the core problems.
What are the Problems?
There are a number of key problems that contribute to the difficulty that Pagans seem to have in achieving healthy groups and healthy leadership. In the world of design–product design, event design, urban planning, etc. –there's a saying that the solution is within the problem, and that you can't really solve the problem until you deeply understand the problem.
Here's a quick list of some of the problems I've witnessed:
Poor access to leadership training: Most people who end up as leaders didn't want the job, and never got any training in communication, group dynamics, or psychology. They make honest mistakes that have big impacts.
Most people who end up as leaders didn't want the job, and never got any training in communication, group dynamics, or psychology. They make honest mistakes that have big impacts. Leaders who are jerks: As discussed in previous articles, grassroots and ad hoc communities are vulnerable in that anyone can step up to be a leader, there's no “gatekeeper.” And, many of the folks who do step up to be leaders have issues ranging from untreated mental illness to severe egotism, or they may even be sexual predators. Often it seems that the people who are stubborn enough to tough it out as leaders also are motivated by self-centeredness, ego, or other instabilities.

Often it seems that the people who are stubborn enough to tough it out as leaders also are motivated by self-centeredness, ego, or other instabilities. Numbers: It's a numbers game. If Paganism is less than one half of one percent of the population, that means that Chicago should have thousands of Pagans. However, how many come out to Chicago Pagan Pride? Maybe 500. That's the most well-attended Pagan event in Chicago. Most of those Pagans won't come out to anything else the rest of the year. There are only so many Pagans in any given area, spread out across geography, and interested in different things. There are only so many people who are actually interested in leadership, or willing to be a do-er and volunteer.

The lack of motivated volunteers and leaders tends to burn out the leaders we do have. Sins of the past: Many people who used to be heavily involved in the community got burned out by the conflicts of the past. This disproportionately impacts leaders, such as a leader who stepped into a leadership role even though they didn't really want to, and then another local leader started backstabbing them and badmouthing them. Many people can only undergo stress like that for so long before they give up and go into hiding.

Many people can only undergo stress like that for so long before they give up and go into hiding. Rejecting: Most Pagans are folks who, for whatever reason, did not find a home in another faith community. In fact, Pagans tend to be members of several overlapping subcultures. Renfaires, SCA, BDSM, Polyamory, Hippies, Scifi/Fantasy geeks, liberal activists…it's not to say all Pagans are these things. However, if you're talking numbers, there's frequently a heavy overlap in many of these subcultures. Generally, many Pagans seem to value being unique individuals, but more than that, many Pagans were rejected by the dominant culture, or, rejected themselves from it. I believe that this leads to one result that becomes the kicker–we have a fairly small base population to begin with. And, what I have witnessed anecdotally is that Paganism has a higher-than-average percentage of people who have mental illness, treated or untreated. Thus, you often have a lot of people with a chip on their shoulder about something, making it more difficult for them to get along with each other.
There are other challenges, but those are a few of the significant ones.
What you end up with is a ridiculously small base population, spread out over distance. You have people who tend to be apathetic. That's not a Pagan thing, that's They want people to do things for them, not to be the ones doing it, or a do-er. Do-ers are rare. Most people are more interested in “being,” or Be-ers as I call them. In fact, the drive to be a leader or event planner is fairly rare, as is the drive to step up and volunteer.
What I see in the Pagan community is a high percentage of leaders who are 1. unskilled and untrained, or 2. their drive comes from them being stubborn egomaniacs or from untreated mental illness.
It's kind of a recipe for disaster.
What's the Solution?
I have a hunch–no solid evidence, just things I think about when I'm staring at the ceiling trying to get to sleep at night, pondering the nature of life and Pagan community. I'm an insomniac. I do this with some frequency.
My theory is that some of the sociological root of many religions' admonishment against contraception and the religious direction to procreate and multiply is to solve some of the above “numbers” problem.
As a minority religion that lives spread apart, there's only so much you can do both in terms of proximity and money. A hundred Pagans that have to drive 1-2 hours to get to a ritual are going to have a hard time making that commitment. However, a hundred Pagans that all live within blocks of a church/temple/community center make that far more viable.
Plus, more people in closer proximity like that have the potential to raise more funds. Many Unitarian Universalist churches have only 100-200 tithing members at a church and they are able to support a building, minister's salary, and other administrators' salaries on that. I'll be doing a whole article series on Pagans and fundraising as part of the leadership series to follow up on my Pagan Activist post on Pagans and money.
Here are some things that are way more helpful than making the joke about herding cats.
Teach our Emerging Leaders Good Leadership Skills
Give them the tools to do the job well. This means–yes–paying for training. We don't have all the skills we need within the Pagan community. We're going to need to pay for training for our leaders if we want to build that capacity within the community.
Focus on Mental Health
Let's all get healthy. That means me, and that means you. I can't even articulate how often my own depression and anxiety issues have made me a poorer leader. What has made me a better leader is working on my issues of self esteem; it turned me from a stubborn egomaniac into a reasonably stubborn visionary who can hear the word “no” without throwing a tantrum.
Focus on Physical Health
What does that have to do with leadership? I've written about my own process of getting healthy at some length in past blog posts, but the bottom line is, when I figured out some of my food intolerances and cut those foods out of my diet, my own mental health improved. Pagans tend to lean on the “Screw you I'm fat and I don't care” side of things. But this isn't about fat, it's about health. Physical health leads to mental health. I'm 180 pounds, “fat” by the standards of the dominant culture, but healthier than I've ever been in my life because I'm eating foods that aren't poisoning me.
Personal and Spiritual Growth Work
I can teach you all sorts of amazing communication tools, conflict resolution tools, and I can teach you about group dynamics. None of that is going to fix anything for you if you're just a total jerk. Once upon a time, I had a boss. They were one of those total asshole bosses, a really toxic guy.
One day, they asked for my help and that of the other designers on my team in preparing some design concepts to the executive vice president of our company. I asked them what he'd like for me to do, and they did a poor job of explaining it, I asked him, “Like this?” and they just grabbed the board out of my hands and muttered, “I'll do it myself.”
I was fuming. I went back to my desk almost in tears. And then I realized.
I. Totally. Do. That.
That was not a good day for me. I realized what a totally shitty leader I was at times. This was in context of the (geek alert) scifi conventions I used to attend where I led a team of Star Wars nerds in creating Star Wars reproduction scenery. I would do a terrible idea of explaining the concept of what we were doing, and when people failed to do what I had in my head, I'd grab their work out of their hands and just do it myself.
Leadership pro tip: Nothing disheartens a volunteer more than this behavior.
However, we've reached a key point here. In recognizing that I did that, I was able to confront my shadow and work to shift the behavior. I'm still not the best volunteer manager, but at least I'm not a jerk about it like I used to be. There are so many things that we each do, as leaders, that we probably aren't aware of. We're shooting ourselves in the foot all the time. When we explore our shadows and our issues, we can work to become better leaders and better people.
Looking Forward
Trotting out the “herding cats” joke just makes crappy behavior okay. Let's instead work to be better, to tell the story of what we could do if we worked together. When we hold a vision of the future, when we speak it, that's an act of magic. Words are magic. Let's use words that paint the picture of that stunning, shining dream of what we'd like to see, not the poor behavior of the past.
“Dream no small dreams for they have no power to move the hearts of men.”

WORTHINGTON, Minn. - A Worthington police officer is charged with a gross misdemeanor after "tasing" members of their family at their request.
According to the criminal complaint, 35-year-old Joshua McCuen had some family members over on Christmas of 2016. After dinner, the complaint says that three of their adult relatives said they "would like to feel what it felt like to be 'tased.'"
The complaint states that McCuen then went to get their police-issued electronic incapacitation device, otherwise known as a taser, from their safe. They first tased a 61-year-old family member on their back, while they were seated, and at their request.
Over the next half hour to an hour, the charges say McCuen tased six other family members, all adults. All of them were tased on the back of the thigh while lying on the floor.
Criminal charges were not filed until three and a half months later, on April 13. The complaint says that McCuen's use of the taser was not "reasonable force to defend themselves or their property," and that their actions were prohibited by department policy.
McCuen is charged with unauthorized use of electronic incapacitation device, a gross demeanor with a maximum sentence of one year in jail and a $3,000 fine.
“All the Prophets of God,” asserts Bahá'u'lláh in the Kitáb-i-Íqán, “abide in the same tabernacle, soar in the same heaven, are seated upon the same throne, utter the same speech, and proclaim the same Faith.” From the “beginning that hath no beginning,” these Exponents of the Unity of God and Channels of Their incessant utterance have shed the light of the invisible Beauty upon humankind, and will continue, to the “end that hath no end,” to vouchsafe fresh revelations of Their might and additional experiences of Their inconceivable glory. To contend that any particular religion is final, that “all Revelation is ended, that the portals of Divine mercy are closed, that from the daysprings of eternal holiness no sun shall rise again, that the ocean of everlasting bounty is forever stilled, and that out of the Tabernacle of ancient glory the Messengers of God have ceased to be made manifest” would indeed be nothing less than sheer blasphemy.
“They differ,” explains Bahá'u'lláh in that same epistle, “only in the intensity of their revelation and the comparative potency of their light.” And this, not by reason of any inherent incapacity of any one of them to reveal in a fuller measure the glory of the Message with which They have been entrusted, but rather because of the immaturity and unpreparedness of the age They lived in to apprehend and absorb the full potentialities latent in that Faith.
About
As University of Illinois freshmen and sophomores, we find it incredibly hard to get anywhere on campus on time, since the area is so spread out, and very hard to navigate. The University does have a semi-reliable public transportation system, however, it does not run consistently, and does not run to every place on campus.
This is why we our team at UIU-Cycle is attempting to set up and build a bicycle sharing system in the Urbana-Champaign area. Having bicycles on campus is incredibly efficient and beneficial, both for saving the environment, allowing students to get the exercise they need, and letting students get to class in a timely fashion.
We plan to implement our project similarly to a library. Bikes would be places in a locked rack system all over campus. Students who live in university housing would be able to go to one of these locked racks, swipe their university ID cards, and borrow a bike for an allotted time period, at the end of which they must either return the bike, renew their time or be fined for keeping the bike for too long.
However, this system will not be exclusively for students in university housing. Anyone who is not a student, or a student living off-campus, can also sign up to be part of this program. These people would pay for an hourly, daily, monthly, or yearly subscription to the service, after which they would be able to utilize it when needed.

The Canadian cannabis sector has been one of the hottest places for investors to put their money over the last two years and we think this sector is in the early innings of a major growth cycle.
As we approach the end of the year, we want to highlight companies that are well positioned for growth during 2018.
One company we have been watching closely is Harvest One Cannabis Inc. (HVST.V). The company operates a unique and attractive business model that controls operations across the entire cannabis value chain through three business units.
Harvest One serves as the umbrella company over its horticultural arm, United Greeneries, as well as its medical arm, Satipharm AG. We are favorable on this structure and believe that the divisions can create value for each other as well as improve the value proposition of the entire company.
United Greeneries: A Strategic Opportunity
In June 2016, United Greeneries has previously received the authorization to cultivate cannabis under the ACMPR and commenced growing operations after successfully importing 32 commercial cannabis varieties from Europe.
In mid-October, United Greeneries Ltd. received the amendment to sell dried marijuana to registered patients by Health Canada under the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations (ACMPR).
When United Greeneries received the sales license, they had 220 kilograms of dried cannabis in its inventory and ready for sale. The company has focused on increasing capacity and will be able to sell its inventory. We are favorable on this aspect of this business and expect it to provide a significant revenue stream in 2018.
Signs LOI to Expand Production Capacity
The United Greeneries division is the one we are most favorable on since it received a Canadian medicinal cannabis cultivation and sales license, making it able to commercially cultivate and sell cannabis in a federally regulated environment.
Last month, United Greeneries signed a letter of intent with a third party to lease a property to accelerate and expand production capacity. The facility is very well suited to be retrofitted into an indoor cannabis cultivation facility.
Due to the facility's existing infrastructure, United Greeneries expects to commence cultivation activities in 2018. The initial facility design can produce approx. 8,000 kilograms per year and is fully funded with the company's current cash balance.
We are favorable on this property due to the existing infrastructure and size of the property. The letter of intent provides an option to expand by 8 more acres on the property, which could ultimately produce more than 35,000 kilograms per year when fully built out.
In the Middle of a Major Expansion
The day after Harvest One announced the letter of intent, the company entered a revised engagement letter with Mackie Research Capital and a syndicate of underwriters that included Haywood Securities and Eight Capital to increase the size of the previously announced bought deal.
Under the new agreement, Harvest One will sell $17.5 million worth of convertible debenture units. The offering can generate more than $20 million in gross proceeds if the underwriters exercise its over-allotment option. The company intends to use the net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes.
We are favorable on the upsized offering and believe that it will provide Harvest One with the capital it needs to execute.
Satipharm's Enters Australia's CBD market
Last month, Harvest One's wholly owned Swiss subsidiary, Satipharm AG, made a significant announcement after its Melbourne-based distribution partner, HL Pharma Pty Ltd, started to distribute Satipharm's Gelpell-CBD capsules to approved patients in Australia.
Satipharm is focused on developing cutting-edge dose delivery technology for pharmaceutical-grade cannabis products providing physicians and patients with consistent and reliable dosing each and every time.
This is a milestone since the capsules are one of the first medical cannabis products available to patients in Australia. The commencement of Satipharm sales is part of a comprehensive strategy to expand the international distribution of its products for commercial and clinical research purposes.
Currently Satipharm is selling it's proprietary capsules in the EU as a food supplement and has increasing sales month over month. In August Satipharm received a “Free Sales Certificate” in Germany removing any impediments to trade within the EU resulting in further demand for the product from large Pharmacy chains throughout Europe.
A Stock to Watch
We are favorable on Harvest One's leverage to international markets and believe the stock has flown under the radar. Investors need to keep an eye on Harvest One as its subsidiaries continue to execute and work to create significant value for the company.
One of the biggest potential catalysts for Harvest One will be the granting of a Dealer's License from Health Canada to be able to import its capsules to Canada and sell under its ACMPR license. We are favorable on this opportunity as it will significantly enhance the company's fundamental story.
The shares have come off its highs and we believe this has created a great opportunity for new investors. The recent developments have significantly advanced Harvest One's fundamental story and we will be closely watching how the company executes fro, here. This is a stock to watch and please reach out to support@technical420.com if you have any questions about the company.
While Ubuntu fans out there still discover and enjoy the brand-new Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (Lucid Lynx) operating system, somewhere deep in the Ubuntu headquarters, the Canonical developers are working on the next major update for their popular Linux distribution. Therefore, we announce today that the first Alpha version of the upcoming Ubuntu 10.10 (Maverick Meerkat) operating system was released a few minutes ago. As usual, we've downloaded a copy of it in order to keep you up-to-date with the latest changes in the Ubuntu 10.10 development.
Editor's note: I would like to inform you that the release schedule has been changed again to 3 Alpha releases, one Beta version, and a Release Candidate. Because of this, the final release of Ubuntu 10.10 (Maverick Meerkat) will be available sooner, on Sunday, October 10th, 2010!
What's new in Ubuntu 10.10 Alpha 1? Well, not much! The developers said that the GNOME version was now 2.31.x (current development version), but it appears that all the GNOME packages are still at version 2.30, the one used in Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. The Evolution e-mail client was updated to version 2.30.1.2 and it is now much faster than the one in Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. Last but not least, the kernel packages were upgraded to version 2.6.34-5.12, based on Linux kernel 2.6.34. This is how Ubuntu 10.10 Alpha 1 looks like...
Ubuntu 10.10 Alpha 1
What's new in Kubuntu 10.10 Alpha 1? Well, some good news for Kubuntu users, as this first Alpha version is built on top of the newly released KDE Software Compilation 4.5 Beta 1, which looks pretty good and has a lot of new features. The Qt 4.7 Beta 1 framework is included in this release, the Kubuntu boot splash looks very nice, and we have no idea why there are two panels (as you can see in the screenshot below)!
Kubuntu 10.10 Alpha 1
Xubuntu 10.10 Alpha 1
On October 10th, 2010, Ubuntu 10.10 (Maverick Meerkat) will become the thirteenth release of the Ubuntu operating system. See you again in one month (July 1st), for the second Alpha version of the upcoming Ubuntu 10.10 (Maverick Meerkat).
The Maverick Meerkat Release Schedule:
June 3rd, 2010 - Alpha 1 release;

Got a burning question for Prudie? She's off next Monday but will be back online on Monday, July 6, to chat with readers.
Dear Prudie,
My husband and I moved to a city a few hours away from my family after we got married. Shortly before our first child was born, I bought an Internet-enabled video camera to use as a baby monitor. Out of guilt that my parents don't live nearby, I allowed them to access the camera through their phones so that they could see their grandchild regularly. This turned out to be a huge mistake. Any time they see something on the camera that they don't approve of, they let me know. I was endlessly harassed for not putting socks on my son's feet while they were sleeping, for example. The camera has a feature allowing viewers to talk to us through the camera, so my parents randomly start talking to me or my son when we're in their room. If my son is throwing a tantrum, they will come on and say, “Stop that crying!” I've told them that I don't appreciate their interjections and criticism, but it has not stopped. My son is now 2 years old, and we have another baby, with another camera in the baby's room, and I want to end their monitoring us. The problem is that if I change the password and prevent my parents from being able to access the cameras, they will be offended and it will cause World War III. What's the best way to does it while ruffling as few feathers as possible?
—Living in Big Brother Hell
Dear Hell,
You say your parents will start World War III if you cut off their surveillance privileges. But although you have given them Dear Leader–type access, unlike Kim Jong-un they can't back up their threats with nuclear weapons. Your parents need to be reminded that when they raised you, there was no technology to monitor your every breath, fart, and twitch, and this lack of constant scrutiny was probably better for everyone. It would be satisfying, the next time they start shouting admonitions at you, to look straight in the camera, wave goodbye, and toss it in the potty. But you can be polite enough to let them know this experiment has run too long, it's coming to an end, and the password is about to be changed. Then change it immediately. If this results in your parents having a tantrum, because you are no longer connected through an electronic umbilical cord, you won't be able to hear them pounding the floor. If they threaten to boycott your family because their unlimited access has ended, then that's their choice to disappear completely from their grandchildren's lives. Often when people have a child, they hear the voices of their own parents in their heads—but this is supposed to be metaphorical. No one wants the actual voices of their parents issuing from a speaker in the room.
—Prudie
Dear Prudie,
My wife and I have been married for years. While things have not always been perfect, we've always managed to be a good team, seeing challenges through together. One such challenge was relocating frequently, and a little over a year ago, I started using the “strictly platonic” section of Craigslist to try and meet couples, looking for friends since we'd finally settled in one area. That led to my falling down a Craigslist rabbit hole where I would talk with women looking for sexual hookups, sometimes even arranging to meet, then canceling at the last second. I kept this hidden from my wife and, frankly, from myself. I found justifications for creating a fictional, less repressed, more attractive version of myself who could live out fantasies I was ashamed to admit I had. Then I forgot to log out of the dummy email account I used and my wife found everything, including some less-than-flattering descriptions of my fictional self's fictional wife. I deleted the account, stopped all of that type of interaction, and am in counseling for this maladaptive compulsion. I know I've battered my wife's trust and deeply hurt their feelings, even though they intellectually understand that none of my behavior had anything to do with them How do I repair the damage from this indiscretion, and get things back on track, given that that's what we both want?
—Craigslist Creeper
Dear Creeper,
Thanks for the insight, sort of, into how someone gets themselves into an alternate sexual universe, even if yours consisted of playing cat and mouse with women who were probably also fictionalized versions of themselves. It's good you always pulled out at the last second. Sure, meeting strangers on Craigslist for sex certainly can result in actually meeting them for sex. But it can also go very, even mortally, badly. You still seem torn about taking responsibility for your actions. Keep in mind the person lying to your correspondents about yourself, your wife, and your circumstances was not a fictional version of you, but you. The metaphorical rabbit hole you fell down was not one created by Lewis Carroll, or rodents, but by you. So face that everything that happened was a result of your actions, including forgetting to log out of your incriminating account. If you are telling the truth now, your Craigslist dalliance was a brief and unique lapse—and one you never consummated in real life. So continue your therapy and start taking direct responsibility. Everyone is entitled to a fantasy life, but it can be problematic when the fantasy becomes part of real life. You and your wife agree that you crossed a line in your marriage, so what you do now is continue to show them you're back on the right side.
—Prudie
Dear Prudence,
My mom passed away a year ago, just three weeks after being diagnosed with a very late-stage cancer. I dealt with the loss appropriately, sought therapy, and feel at peace with the loss and my wonderful relationship with them I've also been fortunate enough to have a great relationship with my dad. The problem is I have no desire to meet their girlfriend of nearly eight months. Now that the one-year anniversary of my mom's passing is coming up, both my dad and their girlfriend feel it's time for me to bite the bullet, but I simply don't want to. I have told my dad I'm happy for him, but will do this on my own terms and timeline. They will not stop bringing it up. They say that if they are willing to meet a new guy I am seeing, then I should be willing to meet their girlfriend. I feel that's not only unfair but completely incomparable. Am I being unreasonable?
—Missing Them
Dear Missing,
Your father paired off very quickly indeed after the unexpected death of their wife. That is their business, and you show a generous spirit by not making an issue of the speed with which they found a new love. But they need to understand that you two are experiencing this loss in very different ways. They may have paired up again so soon out of a reluctance to be alone, and may consider themselves lucky to have found someone. But for you, the hole your mother left cannot be filled. You can tell them that you don't want to cause a fissure with him, but the more they push, the more resistant you feel. Firmly say they have to back off and try to understand this from your perspective. Explain that theirs wish that all of you get to know each other and get along is a reasonable one. But forcing you into socializing with them and their girlfriend before you're ready will just delay all of you getting there.
—Prudie
Dear Prudence,
My cousin's young son was recently diagnosed with autism. They and their husband have signed up to participate in a local autism support walk sponsored by a big-name national charity. They have invited the rest of the family to participate by walking or donating. I'd like to support my cousin, but this charity just raises too many red flags. Until recently it has been one of the biggest voices spreading the quack “science” of the vaccines-cause-autism debacle. It spends 30 percent of its money on overhead, including a lavish salary for its president. There are several other autism charities that spend their money on science-based research that I'd happily give to instead. I don't want to seem like I'm judging their choice of foundations, but would it be OK for me to respond by telling them I'd prefer to make a donation in their name to a better charity?
—Charity Challenged
Dear Challenged,
No one has to give to any charity whose work or mission they object to, no matter how close they are to the person doing the soliciting. Your cousin has gotten life-changing news, and it's understandable that they have connected with a big, brand-name charity that on the surface appears to be doing good work for children like their son. You are free to ignore their entreaties, but I also think it would be valuable for you to inform them of the digging you've done. Find a few articles about the charity, and reply to their request by saying you understand that she's committed to this organization for this year, but you wanted to draw their attention to some concerns about it for the future, and give them the links. Then say you know of some worthy organizations devoted to autism support and research, and tell them which one you want to contribute to in honor of them and their son. Let's hope they respond to your reply in the well-meaning spirit with which it was sent.

The news that Apple throttles iPhones that have old batteries will reinvigorate the right to repair debate as the movement enters a crucial year.
Third party repair shops say they've already seen an uptick in customers asking for battery replacements to speed up their slow phones, and right to repair activists who are pushing for state legislation that will make third party and self repair more accessible say Apple's secrecy about this behavior will give them a powerful rallying message.
“If Apple were serious about battery life, they'd market battery replacements,” Gay Gordon-Byrne, executive director of Repair.org, told me in an email. “Apple clearly has a big financial benefit when people decide their phones are too slow and head to the Apple Store for a new phone.”
Repair.org is a right to repair advocacy group that is made up largely of small, third party repair shops, which is spearheading the effort to get states to consider legislation that will make it easier to repair electronic devices.
Apple throttles phone performance as batteries age in order to prevent the phone from suddenly shutting off. This makes sense, but Apple has not messaged this to its consumers—it's given only two opaque statements that conveniently avoid stating the facts: old batteries will negatively affect phone performance. And Apple has never said that simply replacing the battery will fix this throttling.
On the contrary, Apple has lobbied against state-level legislation that would require it to sell repair parts to consumers and third parties and release service manuals for its devices. It has also warned consumers against using third party repair in software updates. Meanwhile, Apple Stores will only replace iPhone batteries if they fail a specific diagnostic test, the specifics of which are not made public. Third-party replacement repair usually costs about $40, compared to the $79 that Apple charges.
“If you don't fail the diagnostic test, they won't do it,” Michael Oberdick, owner of two electronics repair shops called iOutlet in Ohio, told me on a phone call. “If I drive into an automotive repair shop and ask them to change the battery, they'll do it for me even if their diagnostics say it's good.”
Apple has not clearly messaged to consumers that phones with old batteries are getting throttled, which means there are many people out there who think their perfectly good phone has gone bad.
“Apple is consistently doing things like this without the consent of their customers,” Oberdick said. “It's always a move that makes the consumer who is not informed or technologically savvy replace their phone.”
Oberdick says that around new iOS updates—which usually follow the release of a new iPhone—his shop sees a “massive increase in battery replacements. Our battery replacements will triple.”
They say that he'll use this news to let their consumers know why their phone is slowing down.
Gordon-Byrne, meanwhile, says that this information can be used to talk to the masses about the importance of being able to repair your own things. This year, 12 states introduced right to repair legislation, but none of them passed, due to tech company lobbying (including by Apple) or crowded legislative calendars. Most states introduce new legislation in the first few weeks of the year, and Gordon-Byrne says lawmakers in many new states have reached out to them about their intention to write a right to repair bill.
“Legislative sessions are kicking up right after the new year, and nothing stirs the masses better than Apple being a bully,” Gordon-Byrne said. “More states have got bills being drafted for filing. It's going to be a good New Year.”
With Otto Pérez Molina having resigned and awaiting trial, the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala has proven instrumental to dismantling organised crime
Otto Pérez Molina – a former special forces soldier and the ex-leader of a military intelligence unit linked to allegations of human rights abuse – was elected president of Guatemala in 2011 on a vow to fight official misconduct and crime.
This week, the once-feared commander was ordered to stand trial for corruption, illicit association and bribery linked to a multimillion-dollar customs scam.
They went from president to indicted inmate in just five days.
The spectacular fall from grace was a remarkable victory for a UN-backed investigative commission established to dismantle criminal networks with ties to politicians and the security forces, and has prompted growing calls for similar independent crime-fighting bodies to be established in other Central American countries wrestling with endemic corruption.

Evidence collected by the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) triggered weeks of unprecedented public protests that eventually forced Pérez Molina to step down last week. They were identified as a flight risk, and ordered to await trial in small cell at a military barracks.
The president's dramatic downfall came less than a month after the detention of their vice-president over the same corruption allegations – and marked a landmark in Guatemala's journey to democracy. At last the justice system seemed willing and capable of taking on the untouchables.
James Goldston, executive director of the Open Society Justice Initiative, said: “In investigating the president, vice-president and other senior officials for corruption, CICIG has punctured the veil of impunity which has reigned at the highest levels of government in Guatemala for decades.
“But this is still a work in progress,” added Goldston.
CICIG was established in 2007 to help tackle organised crime that first emerged during Guatemala's brutal 36-year civil war when corrupt security officials with political ties became involved in drug trafficking and contraband.
A 1996 peace deal ended the conflict but not the criminality. Instead, new groups infiltrated politics, security forces and the criminal justice system, operating with almost total impunity.
Over the past eight years, CICIG has investigated around 200 complex cases to help bring charges against a dozen criminal networks and almost 200 current and former government officials – including two former presidents, several ministers, police chiefs and military officers. It has helped to weed out hundreds of corrupt police, prosecutors and judges.

Its breakthrough case was the bizarre 2009 death of prominent lawyer Rodrigo Rosenberg – who left a video message implicating then president Alvaro Colom in their demise. The clip triggered months of political turmoil, but after eight months of investigation CICIG concluded that Rosenberg had orchestrated their own death in order to bring down the government.
In another trailblazing case, the unit helped prosecute 19 people in connection with the extrajudicial killings of 10 prisoners in 2006. Its evidence helped a Swiss court convict former national police director Erwin Sperisen for their role in the massacre.
Before the massive customs scams that eventually brought down the president, CICIG was involved in two other large-scale corruption cases.
In September it helped dismantle a multimillion-dollar criminal network run by former army Captain Byron Lima – jailed for the 1998 political assassination of Archbishop Juan Gerardi, author of the Guatemalan truth commission report. The investigation revealed that Lima had become the de facto head of prisons under Pérez Molina and was even running a factory contracted to produce T-shirts for their political party.
Then in November, CICIG announced the capture of Haroldo Mendoza Matta, boss of a longstanding criminal dynasty linked to legislators, mayors and security services.
Around this time, many predicted that time was running out for CICIG, which must have its mandate extended every two years by congress.
But in April, the customs scandal was made public. It was a bold and politically smart move by the CICIG commissioner, Ivan Velasquez Gómez, who had built their reputation prosecuting paramilitary groups in their native Colombia.
Pérez Molina extended CICIG's mandate a week later in what looked like an attempt to avert a political crisis – seemingly unaware of the incriminating evidence against him.
Critics argue CICIG was meant to be a short-term measure in order to build local capacity and independent judicial institutions. Eight years after it was established, most high-profile investigations still depend on CICIG, and serious problems persist at the highest level of the judiciary. The original judge in the customs case was removed amid allegations of bribery.
'Our Central American spring': protesters demand an end to decades of corruption Read more
But activists across Central America have been buoyed by CICIG's successes, and are now calling for similar initiatives to help tackle the appalling levels of corruption, crime and impunity afflicting El Salvador and Honduras.
CICIG, which costs $12-$15m a year and has 150 staff from 20 countries, is excellent value for money, according to Mike Allison, associate professor of political sciences at Scranton University and author of the Central American Politics Blog.
“I have confidence that the US and international community would provide the resources Honduras and El Salvador would need to establish similar commissions. If Guatemala can recoup some or all of the money stolen in the customs scandal and prevent its reoccurrence, it will have paid for several years of CICIG in a single investigation.”
WASHINGTON (RNS) Americans are slowly pulling themselves out of a charitable slump — except when it comes to religious groups.
That takeaway from the new Giving USA report, perhaps the most-read annual study on philanthropy, shows a slight downturn for churches and other religious organizations against an improving charity landscape.
American individuals, groups, foundations and corporations gave $335 billion in 2013 — a 3 percent increase from 2012 (adjusted for inflation). It's the fourth consecutive year in which giving rose after taking a beating during the recession that officially ended in 2009.
But religious groups saw donations drop 1.6 percent from 2012 to 2013. That contrasts to healthy jumps in education (7.4 percent), the arts and humanities (6.3 percent) and environmental and animal groups (6 percent), according to the study released Tuesday (June 17), which Giving USA produced with the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy.
Behind the sad stats for religious groups, experts say, is Americans' declining interest in religious institutions.
“Giving to religion represents primarily giving to houses of worship,” said Rick Dunham, CEO of Dallas-based Dunham+Company, a fundraising consulting company that mostly works with Christian ministries. “There has been a growing percentage of Americans with no religious affiliation, as well as a decrease in both church attendance and membership.”
According to a 2012 Pew Research Center study, about one in five Americans say they have no formal religious affiliation.

But Dunham, who serves on the editorial review board of Giving USA, also noted that many religiously oriented charities are often counted in other sectors, such as education and human services. “This is a bit of a complex picture,” they said, because giving to religion “is both declining … and shifting from houses of worship to religiously affiliated charities that are counted in other sectors.”
Still, the religious sector continues to collect a greater proportion of total charitable giving — 31 percent — than any other, according to the report. The next largest share of the philanthropic pie went to education, with 16 percent of donors' dollars.
The Giving USA study drew on many government and private groups for data, including the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Census Bureau.

This is where SGR 1806-20 would appear in the sky if it were visible to human eyes.
SGR 1806-20 is a magnetar , a type of neutron star with a very powerful magnetic field, that was discovered in 1979 and identified as a soft gamma repeater . SGR 1806-20 is located about 14.5 kiloparsecs (50,000 light-years ) from Earth on the far side of the Milky Way galaxy in the constellation of Sagittarius . It has a diameter of no more than 20 kilometres (12 mi) and rotates on its axis every 7.5 seconds (30,000 km/h rotation speed at the surface). As of 2016 , SGR 1806-20 is the most highly magnetized object ever observed, with a magnetic field over 10 15 gauss (G) (10 11 tesla ) in intensity [1] (compared to the Sun 's 1–5 G and Earth's 0.25–0.65 G).
Artists impression of the surrounding cloud bubble
Fifty thousand years after a starquake occurred on the surface of SGR 1806-20, the radiation from the resultant explosion reached Earth on December 27, 2004 (GRB 041227).[2] In terms of gamma rays, the burst had an absolute magnitude around −29 . It was the brightest event known to have been sighted on this planet from an origin outside the Solar System. The magnetar released more energy in one-tenth of a second (1.0×1040 J) than the Sun releases in 150,000 years (4×1026 W × 4.8×1012 s = 1.85×1039 J).[3] Such a burst is thought to be the largest explosion observed in this galaxy by humans since the SN 1604 supernova observed by Johannes Kepler in 1604. The gamma rays struck Earth's ionosphere and created more ionization, which briefly expanded the ionosphere.
A similar blast within 3 parsecs (10 light years) of Earth would destroy the ozone layer and be similar in effect to a 12-kiloton nuclear blast at 7.5 kilometers. The nearest known magnetar to Earth is 1E 1048.1-5937, located 9,000 light-years away in the constellation Carina.
China and the United States can resolve any trade disputes through talks, the government said on Thursday, as a Chinese newspaper warned U.S. business could be targets for retaliation in any trade war ushered in by President-elect Donald Trump.
Trump, who is sworn into office on Friday, has criticised China's trade practices and threatened to impose punitive tariffs on Chinese imports.
Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, Trump's choice for commerce secretary, voiced sharp criticism of China's trade practices on Wednesday, telling senators they would seek new ways of combating them.
Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson Sun Jiwen said the government was willing to work with the new U.S. administration to promote the healthy development of commercial ties.
"I believe China and the United States can resolve any disputes through dialogue and negotiation and that the China-U.S. commercial relationship will not significantly stray from the path of mutual benefit," Sun told reporters.
"Both sides benefit with cooperation, and both are hurt with conflict," they added.
Many news sites and blogs are reporting that the data stolen last month from 37 million users of AshleyMadison.com — a site that facilitates cheating and extramarital affairs — has finally been posted online for the world to see. In the past 48 hours, several huge dumps of data claiming to be the actual AshleyMadison database have turned up online. But there are precious few details in them that would allow one to verify these claims, and the company itself says it so far sees no indication that the files are legitimate.
Update, 11:52 p.m. ET: I've now spoken with three vouched sources who all have reported finding their information and last four digits of their credit card numbers in the leaked database. Also, it occurs to me that it's been almost exactly 30 days since the original hack. Finally, all of the accounts created at Bugmenot.com for Ashleymadison.com prior to the original breach appear to be in the leaked data set as well. I'm sure there are millions of AshleyMadison users who wish it weren't so, but there is every indication this dump is the real deal.
Original story:
A huge trove of data nearly 10 gigabytes in size was dumped onto the Deep Web and onto various Torrent file-sharing services over the past 48 hours. According to a story at Wired.com, included in the files are names, addresses and phone numbers apparently attached to AshleyMadison member profiles, along with credit card data and transaction information. Links to the files were preceded by a text file message titled “Time's Up” (see screenshot below).
From taking in much of the media coverage of this leak so far — for example, from the asupervisorstioned Wired piece or from the story at security blogger Graham Cluley's site — readers would most likely conclude that this latest collection of leaked data is legitimate. But after an interview this evening with Raja Bhatia — AshleyMadison's original founding chief technology officer — I came away with a different perspective.
Bhatia said they are working with an international team of roughly a dozen investigators who are toiling seven days a week, 24-hours a day just to keep up with all of the fake data dumps claiming to be the stolen AshleyMadison database that was referenced by the original hackers on July 19. Bhatia said their team sees no signs that this latest dump is legitimate.
“On a daily basis, we're seeing 30 to 80 different claimed dumps come online, and most of these dumps are entirely fake and being used by other organizations to capture the attention that's been built up through this release,” Bhatia said. “In total we've looked at over 100GB of data that's been put out there. For example, I just now got a text message from our analysis team in Israel saying that the last dump they saw was 15 gigabytes. We're still going through that, but for the most part it looks illegitimate and many of the files aren't even readable.”
The former AshleyMadison CTO, who's been consulting for the company ever since news of the hack broke last month, said many of the fake data dumps the company has examined to date include some or all of the files from the original July 19 release. But the rest of the information, they said, is always a mix of data taken from other hacked sources — not AshleyMadison.com.
“The overwhelming amount of data released in the last three weeks is fake data,” they said. “But we're taking every release seriously and looking at each piece of data and trying to analyze the source and the veracity of the data.”
Bhatia said the format of the fake leaks has been changing constantly over the last few weeks.
“Originally, it was being posted through Imgur.com and Pastebin.com, and now we're seeing files going out over torrents, the Dark Web, and TOR-based URLs,” they said.
To help locate new troves of data claiming to be the files stolen from AshleyMadison, the company's forensics team has been using a tool that Netflix released last year called Scumblr, which scours high-profile sites for specific terms and data.
“For the most part, we can quickly verify that it's not our data or it's fake data, but we are taking each release seriously,” Bhatia said. “Scumbler helps accelerate the time it takes for us to detect new pieces of data that are being released. For the most part, we're finding the majority of it is fake. There are some things that have data from the original release, but other than that, what we're seeing is other generic files that have been introduced, fake SQL files.”
Bhatia said this most recent leak is especially amusing because it included actual credit card data, even though AshleyMadison.com has never stored credit card information.
“There's definitely not credit card information, because we don't store that,” Bhatia said. “We use transaction IDs, just like every other PCI compliant merchant processor. If there is full credit card data in a dump, it's not from us, because we don't even have that. When someone completes a payment, what happens is from our payment processor, we get a transaction ID back. That's the only piece of information linking to a customer or consumer of ours. If someone is releasing credit card data, that's not from us. We don't have that in our databases or our own systems.”
I should be clear that I have no idea whether this dump is in fact real; I'm only reporting what I have been able to observe so far. I have certainly seen many people I know on Twitter saying they've downloaded the files and found data from friends who'd acknowledged being members of the site.
Nearly every day since I first reported the exclusive story of the Ashley Madison hack on July 19, I've received desperate and sad emails from readers who were or are AshleyMadison users and who wanted to know if the data would ever be leaked, or if I could somehow locate their information in any documents leaked so far. Unfortunately, aside from what I've reported here and in my original story last month, I don't have any special knowledge or insight into this attack.
My first report on this breach quoted AshleyMadison CEO Noel Biderman saying the company suspected the culprit was likely someone who at one time had legitimate access to the company's internal networks. I'd already come to the same conclusion by that time, and I still believe that's the case. So I asked Bhatia if the company and/or law enforcement in Canada or the United States had apprehended anyone in relation to this hack.
Bhatia declined to answer, instead referring me to the written statement posted on its site today, which noted that investigation is still ongoing and that the company is simultaneously cooperating fully with law enforcement investigations, including by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Ontario Provincial Police, the Toronto Police Services and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation.
“This event is not an act of hacktivism, it is an act of criminality. It is an illegal action against the individual members of AshleyMadison.com, as well as any freethinking people who choose to engage in fully lawful online activities,” the statement reads. “We know that there are people out there who know one or more of these individuals, and we invite them to come forward. While we are confident that the authorities will identify and prosecute each of them to the fullest extent of the law, we also know there are individuals out there who can help to make this happen faster.”
Readers should understand that if this dump does turn out to be legit, that just finding someone's name, email address and other data in the archives doesn't mean that person was a real user. As the above-mentioned Graham Cluley points out, AshleyMadison never bothered to verify the email addresses given to it by its users.
“So, I could have created an account at Ashley Madison with the address of barack.obama@whitehouse.gov, but it wouldn't have meant that Obama was a user of the site,” Cluley wrote. “Journalists and commentators would be wise to remember that the credentials stored by Ashley Madison must be considered suspect because of their shonky practices, even before you start considering whether any leaked databases are falsified or not.”

The former director of data science at the Democratic National Committee blasted Hillary Clinton on Twitter after they tried to blame the DNC for their electoral defeat.
Clinton claimed Wednesday that the DNC fell far behind the RNC in terms of voter and data analysis, saying the DNC's data was “mediocre to poor, nonexistent, wrong.” (VIDEO: Bitter Hillary Clinton Is Now Blaming Inept DNC For Election Loss)
“I had to inject money into it,” they said.
Andrew Therriault, the former director of data science for the DNC, called those claims “fucking bullshit.”
“DNC data folks: today's accusations are fucking bullshit, and I hope you understand the good you did despite that nonsense,” they tweeted.

Therriault charged that their team did more work than they are “being given credit for” and will not allow them to be “thrown under the bus” by Clinton.
We will respond in due time, but for now, just realize your work was a worth way more than you're being given credit for. — Andrew Therriault (@therriaultphd) June 1, 2017
Private mode be damned, this is too important. I'm not willing to let my people be thrown under the bus without a fight. — Andrew Therriault (@therriaultphd) June 1, 2017
Back in February, Therriault wrote a Medium blog postexplaining why the DNC's data science team could not account for poor campaign messaging.
“In 2016, the Democratic Party's messaging strategy did not work out like we hoped, and the use of data did not fix that,” they wrote at the time.
Therriault hinted on Twitter that they may write a new piece to fully respond to Clinton's latest accusations.

Bill White, a former Blackhawks defenseman who played in six All-Star games, died at 77, according to the Blackhawks' website.
White began their NHL career at age 28 with the expansion Kings in 1967 after toiling in the AHL, receiving their break when the league expanded from six to 12 teams.
White spent parts of three seasons with the Kings before the Hawks traded for them in February of 1970 in a six-player deal. White combined with Pat Stapleton to form the Hawks' top defensive pairing on teams that reached the Stanley Cup Final in 1971 and 1973.
“The Chicago Blackhawks organization extends its thoughts and heartfelt condolences to Bill White's family as we mourn their loss," the team said in a statement. "He will be remembered as a leader, generous teammate and tough player to play against. Their energetic style helped the Blackhawks see great success during their tenure with the team.”
Stapleton was more of an offensive force, while White was a defensive defenseman whose value was not recorded in the box score.
"Pat and I just seemed to click right away," White told the Hawks' site in 2010. "I was more of a stay-at-home type, and Pat liked to rush the puck. It was like we always knew what each other was thinking and was going to do."
White also had a reputation around the Hawks' dressing room as a prankster.
White earned second-team honors on the NHL's year-end All-Star team and finished third in voting for the Norris Trophy after the 1972 through 1974 seasons. White's career ended due to a neck injury at age 36 in 1976.
White also served as head coach for 46 games in 1976-77 after the Hawks fired Billy Reay. White compiled a 16-24-6 record, and Bob Pulford replaced them the next season.
White scored 50 goals with 215 assists in 604 career games, including 30 goals and 149 assists over their seven seasons with the Hawks.
A Hawks spokesperson said Sunday evening that the team was unaware of the cause of White's death.

Alexander Prokhorov: Meet Australia's forgotten Nobel Prize winner
Updated
Meet Alexander Prokhorov: the Australian-born co-inventor of the laser and Nobel Prize winner you have probably never heard of.
But that could be all about to change as top scientists and former federal science minister Barry Jones push to have them more widely recognised in Australia.
Their discovery has helped transform almost everything we rely upon: from surgery to the internet.
While they are a celebrated scientific hero in Russia, their formative years were actually spent in far north Queensland.
In the year of what would have been their 100th birthday, Australian scientists want us to know all about him, celebrate them and even recognise them with a stamp in their honour.
Australia's 'little Siberia'
Professor Prokhorov's family fled to Australia as refugees from Tsarist Russia in 1912, eventually settling in what was known as "little Siberia" — a Russian colony in the Atherton Tablelands.
On July 11, 1916, Alexander Prokhorov was born in Butcher's Creek, where they spent the first six years of their life.
At the tiny local school, the few records available show they had a very rural upbringing and "was a talented little kid", according to Australian National University physicist Hans-Albert Brochor.
Their grandson, also named Alexander, told the ABC their grandfather told them about the "very nice butterflies, jungles... and warm climate".
"He got lost in the jungles once and all the village had to look for him," grandson Alex said.
Fond memories of a 'magical' upbringing
Former science minister (1983-1990) Barry Jones, who visited Professor Prokhorov on a trip to Russia, said the scientist had a very fond memory of Australia.
"He had a very vivid and very affectionate view of Australia and the openness and the colours and the trees and the magical environment they lived in," Dr Jones said.
Professor Prokhorov's family returned to Russia in 1923 after the Russian Revolution, where they finished their high school studies and went on to study radio waves.
After serving with the Russian army in World War II and being wounded twice they returned to study physics at the Soviet Union's Institute of Atomic Energy where they developed the technologies that made the laser possible.
They became a member of the Communist Party in 1950 and according to Professor Bachor, Professor Prokhorov was actually trying to develop a "death ray" while at the institute.
Death ray race led to laser revolution
In 1964, the Nobel Prize was jointly awarded to Professor Prokhorov, their Russian colleague Nikolay Basov and also American Charles Townes — who was independently working on the same research.
"Albert Einstein in Germany published papers that [proposed] a way to amplify light in a machine... but for 40 years nobody could build such a machine," Professor Bachor said.
"[Professor Prokhorov] was one of these people who had the right idea and that was basically to put your amplifier between two mirrors and bounce the light forwards and backwards many times so it got stronger every time it went through the amplifier."
Professor Bachor said the research was part of a wider military project during the Cold War.
"Both countries were trying everything ... lasers at the time were thought of as death rays as you see them in Star Wars," they said.
"The death rays were the initial program and then people came up very rapidly with all sorts of ideas of what you could do — so you could cut a hole and cutting a hole is very useful for cutting metal, or welding a car or for surgery."
Lasers enabled the creation of a whole range of devices — from DVD players, barcode scanners, 3D printers and even optical fibre cables (the ones that provide superfast internet).
Professor Prokhorov died in 2002 from pneumonia.
In an interview with Professor Prokhorov obtained by Russian historian Elena Govor, they pondered whether they would have won a Nobel Prize if they had been born in a different place.
"This question cannot be answered unequivocally — however, being born in Australia to some extent predetermined by the fact that I won the Nobel Prize," they said according to a translation of the interview.
"If I'd been born in a different place, my whole life would be different.
"When I met with scientists from Australia at international conferences, they are warmly welcomed me, and we have a mutual sympathy and warm feelings of friendship."
Family viewed with suspicion by Australian authorities
The warmth did not extend to Australian authorities — intelligence records show they were monitoring their father Michael's letters while they lived in Australia.
One of the friends Michael Prokhorov wrote to, Alexander Zuzenko, was a radical who published a Russian newspaper called Knowledge and Unity in Brisbane, according to Dr Gorov.
Mr Zuzenko was later deported back to Russia.
Dr Gorov discovered some of the intelligence reports buried in the National Library of Australia.
In one letter, authorities observe a Russian library has been re-established in South Brisbane, "which may possibly form a sort of clubroom where the malcontents can discuss their propaganda".
"It is noticeable that rarely is a Russian letter scrutinised in which the revolutionary spirit is not aggressively displayed," censor's notes from another letter show.
"The conclusion to be arrived at is that if there are law abiding Russians in Australia they don't write letters."
'Put them on a stamp': Jones
Dr Jones worked to have Professor Prokhorov's Australian-connection acknowledged, ensuring a permanent reminder of their work at CSIRO's labs in Atherton in 1987s.
"We decided to commemorate them by putting a commemorative plaque which was inserted on a rock and I went up with CSIRO and various other scientific luminaries and we unveiled... up there at Atherton up in the glorious northern rainforest," they told the ABC.
"We could put them on a stamp maybe."
In 1996 the University of New South Wales made them an honorary professor — and their grandson would like to see a scholarship or conference named in their honour.
In the meantime, a group of physicists including Professor Bachor are putting on a show to educate school children about Professor Prokhorov's work and the history of lasers which they are putting on for National Science Week (13-21 August).
"We have a very interactive show we basically tell the story but in a way that the kids are familiar with we burst balloons, we show them some tricks with lasers — we have a very entertaining show but in the background they are going to learn a bit about the physics what is a laser how does it work," Professor Bachor said.

Founded in 2009 by a group of mainly German solar companies with the aim of bringing together solar projects and grids across the EU, Middle East and North Africa, the Dii was hit by the decision of Siemens to pull out as a shareholder in December with fellow German company Bosch following suit.
But associate partner First Solar has announced it will upgrade its status to that of shareholder this month.
The development is part of the U.S. company's commitment to exploring new markets with a new office opened in Dubai and another planned in Saudi Arabia.
First Solar is constructing a 13 MW photovoltaic plant for the Dubai Electric and Water Authority at Seih Al Dahal, 50 km south of Dubai.
The plant is phase one of the 1 GW, AED12 billion (US$3.26 billion) Mohammad Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park. The U.S. company also developed a 5 MW system for the Masdar Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company.

Snapshots of the silver screen By Chitralekha Basu (China Daily)

A rare peek at the evolution of Chinese cinema over 105 years reveals more than a few classics. Chitralekha Basu reports
If you have ever wondered whether China has produced any cinema other than over-embellished period dramas, kungfu-style action flicks or soapy stories about who gets to hook the office stud, 101 Essential Chinese Movies might be a good place to start.
Published recently by the Shanghai-based Earnshaw Books and written by journalist-turned-film historian Simon Fowler, the book is both a handy guide for the uninitiated and a springboard to plunge right into China's incredibly multi-dimensional 105-year-old cinematic history. It, as Time's China correspondent Austin Ramzy states in their advance praise for the book, "provides the reader with deep insights into not only Chinese film, but also China itself".
Fowler, who has been strongly influenced by films since they were about 11, made a smooth transition from a film fanatic to being a "Chinese film fanatic" soon after moving to China from England in 2006.
As one who had been tutored meticulously into understanding the black-and-white classics by their eldest brother "Jem" - now a filmmaker based in London - the younger Fowler felt they badly needed a "context" to read Chinese films once they hit the shores of the Middle Kingdom. What started off as trying to establish a frame of reference to arrive at a better understanding of Chinese films has since evolved into 101 Essential Chinese Movies.
Interestingly, they left out the bulk of films made in Hong Kong and Taiwan - films which, in popular imagination, often represent the idea of "Chinese" to the rest of the world. Fowler focused on films from the Chinese mainland, the people who made them and the politics that, until recently, went into their making.
"The cinema of the mainland - for most of the past century - has been overtly political," Fowler comments. "Even before the communists came to power, films were mainly made by Leftist intellectuals in Shanghai and they weaved their messages into nearly every plot. What is most interesting about this is that they were still able to achieve a high stylistic and artistic level."
It is relatively recently that the Chinese mainland has begun to produce wuxia (martial arts)-dominated genre films, they say.
The winds of change are apparent as Zhang Yimou, arguably China's most influential film director, is now massively into period drama that come with a panoramic flourish, and often dazzling color-coordinated fight sequences. "It's getting harder to distinguish between the two (a Chinese mainland product and a Hong Kong sample)," Fowler points out.
In their opinion the 1930s define Chinese cinema's "golden age". Filmmaking in China began as early as 1905 (The Battle of Dingjunshan was the filmed version of a Peking Opera). But it was with the films made by the free-spirited, educated, urban directors, who produced their works in the concession areas of Shanghai, where the long arm of the Japanese forces who controlled most of coastal China could not reach them, that Chinese cinema came into its own.
"Silent films like Little Toys (1933), The Goddess (1934) and Street Angel (1937) - starring glamorous actores like Ruan Lingyu and Zhou Xuan - extolled the exotic beauty of Shanghai (and its women)," Fowler writes in their book.
Ruan and Zhou, still the staple of kitsch art on Shanghai souvenirs, caved in under the often crude and asphyxiating public gaze. "The speculation and investigation that these women had to endure were massive. Ruan was tormented by press intrusion in their personal life and maybe because they were so used to playing the tragic figure on screen (she killed themselves four times in the movies they made) they decided to take that way out," Fowler informs.
They give the credit for successfully marrying the political message to evolved cinematic language for the first time to Xie Jin. The career of the man who made the racy sports drama, Woman Basketball Player No 5 (1957), shot in vivid tri-color - in which a corrupt basketball coach sells out to a team of thuggish foreign marines - peaked in the late 1950s and early 60s, before it took the inevitable plunge. With the onset of the "cultural revolution" (1966-1976), only films propagating the dominant political ideology could be released.
Chen Kaige, Tian Zhuangzhuang and Zhang Yimou - the class of 1982 at Beijing Film Academy - arrived on the scene in the mid-1980s, with a cloudburst of raw energy, striking visual imagination and radical themes. They made films that captured the sensibilities of a China trying to reconcile with the damages left by the tumultuous 70s even as it tried to make sense of the new realities of a society in transition.
"Yellow Earth (by Chen Kaige, 1984), One and Eight (Zhang Juzhao, 1983), The Horse Thief (Tian Zhuangzhuang, 1986) captured the world's attention, putting China on the cinematic map," Fowler writes.
For all their admiration of the "fifth-generation" directors, most of the films listed in the "essential" 101 are from the present decade.
Fowler is sold on the languorous, documentary-style features on human migration and displacement made by Jia Zhangke (Still Life, 2006, 24 City, 2008). They thoroughly dig the arrogant, flashy, fast-paced comedy thrillers like Ning Hao's Crazy Stone (2006) and Feng Xiaogang's A World Without Thieves (2004) as they reflect "the optimism of the moment".
A coming-of-age film set in cynical, stifling urban academic set-ups like Lu Yue's Thirteen Princess Trees (2006) stirs them for its "honest depiction of the realities facing China's youth". Wang Quan'an's Tuya's Marriage (2006), about a woman's struggle for survival in the hostile terrain of Inner Mongolia, which took the Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival, appeals to them as "it shows how even the lives of those furthest away from China's industrial centers feel the effects of modernization".
"If you look at the scope of what has been produced in the last 10 years I think you can find a number of films that equally match the 'golden age' (1930s), but the difference is that nowadays it's less of a cohesive movement. Obviously money has become a huge factor and the commercialization of mainstream Chinese cinema has not seen a rise in overall quality," Fowler comments.
The audience's expectations from a film have changed too. In the 1930s and 40s people would go watch a film not so much to be entertained but to empathize and identify with the tough luck that stars like Shi Hui and Ruan Lingyuan struggled with. In the 1960s and 70s propaganda films were mandatory viewing. Now in the age of unlimited access to easy downloads and pirated DVDs, an audience needs stronger motivation to come to the theater.
"Most Chinese people will (still) pay a relatively large amount of money to see a spectacle," Fowler opines. "Look at the films that have made huge amounts of money in China - Aftershock, Red Cliff ... These are expensive films with amazing special effects."
Unfortunately, to watch most of the films listed in their book going online or buying pirated DVDs are the only options.
Apple Pay is rolling out to all Saks Fifth Avenue , Albertsons, and Dick's Sporting Goods locations across the United States. It's also coming to McDonald's and Chipotle's order-ahead apps in several cities later this year.Meanwhile, contactless tickets supported in Apple's Wallet app are coming to all Ticketmaster sports and concert venues in the United States.Jennifer Bailey, Vice President of Apple Pay, revealed the news at the Money20/20 conference in Las Vegas over the weekend. On stage, they also revealed several other statistics about Apple's mobile payments service.Namely, they said Apple Pay will be available in 20 markets after it launches in Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and the United Arab Emirates as early as this week. We've also heard rumors about Apple Pay coming to the Netherlands Poland , and Norway , but Apple has yet to confirm a rollout to those countries.Bailey said that Apple Pay now works with over 4,000 banks and other participating issuers around the world. They added that 50 percent of retailers in the United States now accept the mobile payments service.As mentioned during Apple's most recent earnings call, Bailey echoed that Apple Pay is by far the most popular contactless payment service on mobile devices, accounting for nearly 90 percent of all transactions globally In related news, payment processor First Data today announced that Clover Go , its all-in-one contactless, chip, and swipe card reader, will be available in the coming weeks on Apple.com and in Apple retail stores across the United States.First Data also said more than one million of its business clients now accept Apple Pay. The company plans to enable Apple Pay support for loyalty and gift cards at these merchants through integration with its Clover platform.Meanwhile, Apple Pay Cash could launch alongside iOS 11.1 or shortly afterwards in the United States. Apple has invited both its corporate and retail employees to test the feature in beta over the past few weeks.
Genetically engineered (GE) algae offer the promise of producing food, fuel, and other valuable products with reduced requirements for land and fresh water. While the gains in productivity measured in GE terrestrial crops are predicted to be mirrored in GE algae, the stability of phenotypes and ecological risks posed by GE algae in large-scale outdoor cultivation remain unknown. Here, we describe the first US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-sanctioned experiment aimed at understanding how GE algae perform in outdoor cultivation. Acutodesmus dimorphus was genetically engineered by the addition of two genes, one for enhanced fatty acid biosynthesis, and one for recombinant green fluorescence protein (GFP) expression; both the genes and their associated phenotypes were maintained during fifty days of outdoor cultivation. We also observed that while the GE algae dispersed from the cultivation ponds, colonization of the trap ponds by the GE strain declined rapidly with increasing distance from the source cultivation ponds. In contrast, many species of indigenous algae were found in every trap pond within a few days of starting the experiment. When inoculated in water from five local lakes, the GE algae's effect on biodiversity, species composition, and biomass of native algae was indiscernible from those of the wild-type (wt) progenitor algae, and neither the GE nor wt algae were able to outcompete native strains. We conclude that GE algae can be successfully cultivated outdoors while maintaining GE traits, and that for the specific GE algal strain tested here they did not outcompete or adversely impact native algae populations when grown in water taken from local lakes. This study provides an initial evaluation of GE algae in outdoor cultivation and a framework to evaluate GE algae risks associated with outdoor GE algae production.
In the realm of security research, there are always three protagonists: Alice always wants to get connected with Bob. Eve, the jealous bystander, wants to get in their way. Hence, Alice and Bob have to communicate in code.
Currently, standard encryption techniques work very well, but Alice lives in fear of Eve developing a usable quantum computer. To counter this, Alice and Bob have been sold a new quantum key distribution (QKD) system. These systems guarantee, based on the very laws of physics, that their codes will be unbreakable. Unfortunately, Eve has turned out to be as clever as the physicists who developed QKD, meaning there's a new security battleground rather than the promised security nirvana. But a new development, based on something called entanglement swapping, closes off the loopholes that allowed Eve in.
Is the key alive or dead?
QKD relies on the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics to generate a common secret key between two parties. The basic idea is that Alice generates photons with polarizationstates chosen at random from a fixed set. Bob then makes a polarization measurement on that photon. But a quantum measurement is really a question of the "are you X polarization?" sort, and they can only ask once. So, Bob chooses a polarization at random from the same set as Alice and asks their question.
To generate the key, Alice and Bob share (through a classical communications channel) a record of their instrument settings. From the record, they choose those instances where they happened, by chance, to choose the same polarization settings. We then have two random number generators coming together to produce a common sequence of bits that form a shared secret key.
Eve cannot determine the key from the classical communications between the Alice and Bob. The quantum signal consists of single photons—if they intercept them, no key will be generated. Indeed, even if they intercept the quantum signal and then re-sends a new signal, this will, in principle, be detected by Alice and Bob, because Eve modifies the statistics of the key generation process.
Was that a principle I heard shattering against reality?
That phrase, "in principle," should be banned. What it really means is "we would love it to be so, but it really isn't." In this case, the principle fails because quantum measurements are always converted to a classical signal. This process is vulnerable to manipulation, and a number of attacks have been shown to work against QKD through this weakness.
The problem is that Alice and/or Bob have to expose one of their detectors to Eve, so they have the potential to intercept the single photons and then fake the detectors into thinking they are measuring a quantum state when, in fact, they are just spitting out the numbers that Eve wants them to get.
Quantum entanglement is one of the most misused concepts around. Entanglement is delicate, rare, and short-lived. At its heart, quantum entanglement is nothing more or less than a correlation between two apparently separate quantum objects. Having discovered that, you might ask "so what is all the fuss about?" The answer lies deep in quantum mechanics. Read more…
Letting Eve do the work for you
A pair of researchers from the UK have proposed a new scheme that keeps the detectors from being exposed to Eve and, even better, uses Eve to inadvertently generate the key for you. The physics behind this scheme is called entanglement swapping. How does swapping entanglement help? Well, Alice and Bob both generate a pair of entangled photons. They each keep one photon and send the other out into the wide world to seek fame, fortune, and another like-minded photon. At this point, Alice and Bob do not share any common quantum states with which to generate a key, though.
Somewhere in the middle of their journey, the photons enter the realm of an untrusted third party—who, in the worst case, is Eve. Eve takes the two photons and, according to the paper, does something quantum to them. In fact, the specific quantum operation doesn't matter as long as it mixes the two photons to create a new entangled state. A simple example is that Eve passes them simultaneously through a beamsplitter (a partially reflective mirror, for instance). Each photon can either reflect off the mirror or be transmitted by the mirror, and we don't know which did what. In any case, after passing through the beamsplitter, the two independent photons now have a single entangled state.
Eve then takes a measurement of their photons. They control what quantum operation they do and they control what measurement they make. They do have to report the results of their measurements to Alice and Bob, but they don't have to be honest about it—she can do so in a way that would let them manipulate a standard QKD system.
So, how do Alice and Bob get a shared key from this?
Well, the simple fact of reporting the measurements tells Alice and Bob that they have a shared entangled source. The act of Eve's measurements limit the potential results from Alice and Bob's measurements. Once enough measurements are made, they figure out what the range of potential correlated results are.
Remember, the secret key is generated from the correlations between Alice and Bob's photons. The key is generated, as before, by sharing the details of how they made their measurements.
So, what if Eve lies about the results of their measurements? The more outrageously Eve lies, the smaller the correlations between Alice and Bob. Since Alice and Bob know their own systems, they know what the optimum correlations are and will know that Eve is playing them. If Eve tries to be subtle, and only modifies their results a small amount, they only extends the time it takes for Alice and Bob to generate a shared key. Indeed, the best that Eve can do is prevent the generation of a key.
The big improvement over standard QKD schemes is that neither Alice nor Bob need to expose any of their classical detectors to the outside world, so Eve cannot fake them out. The downside is that the photons from Alice and Bob have to be synchronously manipulated by Eve. That could be troublesome to implement outside the laboratory.

Growing tired of unfounded rumors that the Panthers will consider relocation to another city in the future if the arena lease with Broward County isn't renegotiated, Panthers owner Vinnie Viola and Doug Cifu crafted an open letter to the fans to dispel such talk.
"As we close in on the one-year anniversary of our ownership of the Florida Panthers, we want to reiterate our commitment to Broward County, South Florida and our Panthers fans and business partners,'' Cifu and Viola wrote. "As we said at the press conference when we bought the team, we view ourselves as flight attendants of the team for the community and our plan is to build an organization that makes South Florida proud and to win the Stanley Cup in South Florida. Despite media speculation to the contrary, we have no plans or intentions to move this franchise.''
The reports were sparked by a statement that Cifu made to Fox Sports last month in which they said the team was losing $30 million a year and that the lease on the BB&T Center with the county that runs through 2028 with $250 million remaining, needed to be renegotiated.
"The arena and the team have lost a significant amount of money year over year for the last 10-plus years and the current business model is not sustainable," Cifu told Fox Sports.
That comment made headlines in Canada, especially in Quebec City, where it has built a $400 million arena in hopes of luring another franchise. The Quebec Nordiques played in the World Hockey Association from 1972-79 and then in the NHL from 1979-95 before relocating to Colorado.
The Panthers averaged 14,177 fans per home game last season, which ranked 29th in the league.
Throwing fuel on interested cities' fire was Broward County Mayor Barbara Sharief hiring a consultant to look into the possibility of allowing the Panthers out of their arena lease and the opportunity to relocate. The results of that report are expected in October.
Two weeks ago NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman shot down a tweet from Sports Business News that said the NHL will expand into Las Vegas, Seattle and Quebec City by 2017. NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman called the tweet a complete "fabrication."
Referring to the possibility of the Panthers relocating, Bettman said at a corporate function in Quebec: "Nobody's moving. And speculation to the contrary not only is wrong, it's unfair to the team and their fans who are being speculated about.
"Our franchises have never been healthier. Our league, in terms of its economic footing, has never been healthier."
"Starting with the trade to bring Roberto Luongo, one of the world's top goaltenders, back home to South Florida, and continuing with our committing over $80 million to new players, including bringing six talented veteran free agents to South Florida and resigning all of our restricted free agents, we have dedicated ourselves to improving the team,'' Cifu and Viola wrote.
"It is no secret that the Panthers and BB&T Center have lost tremendous amounts of money over the last dozen years. We are working hard to address this situation, which we believe we can do with the support from our loyal fans, our business partners, the business community and our community-at-large.
"We look forward to a winning season and bringing a Stanley Cup to South Florida.''
The letter comes on the eve of the start of training camp as 51 players will report to the BB&T Center for physicals Thursday morning.
A delectable vegan Vegetable Balti, packed with veggies like onions, scallions, red peppers, potatoes and mushrooms. Mix it all up with a flavorful balti sauce that you can make ahead and store. So what would you rather hear first: how to make this tantalizing recipe for Vegetable Balti, or the story of the day I was stood up by Britain's curry king?
Okay, well, I know it's the Balti you want, but I'd rather tell you the other one. 🙂 Early in my career, while still working in India, I won a scholarship to work at The Daily Telegraph in London. To a green-behind-the-ears reporter, it was an exciting time. I had a huge house to myself on the Eastside, right on the river Thames. Every morning I'd walk down a mile or so to the tall, cone-roofed glass building in Canary Wharf where the offices of The Telegraph were, and tackle assignments that ranged from a fire at Sir Andrew Lloyd Weber's stables to writing about a runaway teen who was always being found by police in foreign countries to zipping around the Thames at a press conference on a boat trying to interview Maurice Saatchi.
In the middle of all this, my editor at the newspaper I worked for back home in India dropped what seemed a fun assignment in my lap: they wanted me to write the story of Gulam Noon, the man almost synonymous with Indian cuisine in Britain.
Noon, called Britain's curry king, is known for their packaged curries sold in supermarkets all over the country, and for their Bombay Brasserie restaurant in upscale Kensington.  They are originally from Bombay, my home city, and I was rather looking forward to meeting him.
I managed to track down their phone number with some help from another reporter at the Telegraph. They promised an interview, in person, at the Bombay Brasserie the next day.
It took me the better part of an hour, and two tube transfers, to make my way from the Dockyards to central London, but I was there on the dot. Someone showed me into the restaurant which had closed after lunch. All around me people — most of them in white — buzzed, cooking, cleaning, getting ready for dinner. A woman someone introduced to me as Noon's daughter told me they expected their father soon.
Soon turned to never. I waited, and waited, and waited. Noon, they told me, had been called away to another appointment and was not going to make it after all. I was leaving to return to India later the same week, so my story was never to be.
**
Just like that date with the curry king, the rest of my experience with Indian cuisine in Britain was not a pleasant one. Indian food in Britain, for those of you who've never had it, is quite a different animal from Indian food anywhere else in the world, and can, to Indian tastebuds at least, appear bland. Immigrants from the subcontinent have, over the centuries, adapted ingredients from their motherland to local tastes. In the process, they created recipes and whole cuisines that sound as if they spawn from the Indian subcontinent, but are uniquely British, like tikka masala, curry powder, and Balti.
Balti cuisine is said to have originated in a Pakistani restaurant in Birmingham, that hotbed of south Asian culture in Britain, sometime in the 1970s. It draws sneers from the high priests of Indian cuisine in Britain, but its popularity endures, a testament, perhaps, to the fact that those who love to eat care less for a pedigree and more for flavor. And Balti certainly has that, more so than most British Indian dishes.
Part of the reason why Balti is reviled is the strange technique used to cook it– strange to Indian and Pakistani cuisine, that is — stir-fry. It's hard, Indian chefs would argue, to stir-fry Indian meat dishes, because cooking over high heat is horrible for the spices which will burn, and there is really no time for the chunks of meat to cook.
While that may be true, the technique does work rather well with vegetables. Especially those that do beautifully over high heat. Balti, which translates to bucket in Hindi, is so called because it's always cooked — and served — in an Indian wok, called a karahi or kadhai, which kinda resembles a bucket. If you don't have one, use a Chinese wok, which will do the job just beautifully, or a large saucepan.
The Vegetable Balti recipe I have for you today uses mushrooms, green peppers and potatoes (you do have to cook the potatoes first because the stir-frying is not enough to cook the potatoes through). Over all of this goodness goes a delectable Balti sauce that smells so amazing, your nostrils and tastebuds will be doing a happy dance. You will find recipes for dry Balti spice mixes, but I really recommend going with a sauce which works better with the stir-frying technique. The liquid in the sauce gives the spices enough time to cook before they can burn.
Make a batch today. You'll be back to thank me for it.

Alcohol-induced hangover, defined by a series of symptoms, is the most commonly reported consequence of excessive alcohol consumption. Alcohol hangovers contribute to workplace absenteeism, impaired job performance, reduced productivity, poor academic achievements, and may compromise potentially dangerous daily activities such as driving a car or operating heavy machinery.
These socioeconomic consequences and health risks of alcohol hangover are much higher when compared to various common diseases and other health risk factors. Nevertheless, unlike alcohol intoxication the hangover has received very little scientific attention.
What is a Hangover Exactly?
Alcohol hangover is the unpleasant next-day effect of an evening of excessive alcohol consumption. It is a puzzling phenomenon, since alcohol hangovers are most severe when alcohol has disappeared from the body or blood alcohol concentrations approaches zero.
Although some symptoms such as thirst and headache occur more frequently than others, it is hard to predict which combination of symptoms will occur after a drinking session. In addition to individual differences, the presence and severity of hangover-related symptoms also differ from occasion to occasion (I.e. within subjects). Although symptoms can be grouped because they seem related to a common construct such as mood, cognitive functioning, or dehydration, this has not led to a clear theory about the pathology of alcohol hanger.
The 10 most frequently experienced symptoms by 1516 Dutch students, the day following their last evening of excessive alcohol consumption.
Alcohol Hangover Pathology
The exact pathology is not yet fully understood but there are factors that correlate with hangover severity. After ingestion and absorption alcohol is metabolized. First, it is converted into acetaldehyde then it is further metabolized to acetate. Acetaldehyde is highly reactive and can cause tissue damage due to its toxic effects, which may lead to hangover-like symptoms such as nausea, sweating, rapid pulse and headache.
Subsequently there are the dehydration-related effects. Alcohol promotes urine production and subsequent dehydration can effect the electrolyte balance. Ingesting enough salt during alcohol consumption can counteract this effect and lower the overall water loss during the night.
Lastly there is inflammation. During alcohol consumption inflammation markers such as cytokines and CRP (c-reactive protein) are significantly increased. This implies that alcohol has an effect on the immune system, and that the subsequent presence and severity of hangover symptoms can probably be reduced by administration of strong and concentrated antioxidants.
Socioeconomic Consequences
The impact of alcohol hangover on daily activities can be profound. A survey among Dutch university students showed that more than half of them reported being unable to study when experiencing an alcohol hangover often or always. With an average hangover frequency of 2.7 days/month, 1 month a year is “lost”.
Alcohol hangovers are not limited to students and young adults. hangovers are also common in the workplace. A study showed 9.23% (11.6 million workers) of the US workforce reported working with a hangover in the past year, making it the most common form of alcohol-related workplace impairment in the survey. There is a significant relationship between alcohol consumption and next-day absenteeism. A survey among 280 employees revelealed a two-fold increased likelihood of absenteeism the day after alcohol consumption.
Surprisingly, scientific evidence on the economic costs of alcohol hangover is scarce. A decade ago, Harwood estimated the annual costs of alcohol hangover in the USA at 185 billion dollars, and although this amount was criticized for inaccuracy it gives an impression of the economic impact of hangovers on society.
Hangover Reflection and a Product to Keep an Eye on
The search for alcohol hangover cures is as old as alcohol itself. Many cures and prophylactic agents are available, but scientific evidence for their effectiveness is generally lacking. A possible explanation for the lack of scientific interest is that many physicians and researchers regard the alcohol hangover as an adequate punishment for unwanted behavior, i.e. excessive drinking. Alcohol is not a disease and can be easily prevented by moderating alcohol consumption. In their view, an effective hangover treatment is expected to promote binge drinking and thus would be hazardous to public health.
However I believe that social gathering, accompanied with a drink, is becoming even more important in a fast moving world where everything has to speed up, be more efficient causing more burnouts then ever before. It generates the perception that just doing nothing, relaxing and not being effective (at least not in an economical sense) is a bad thing.
“Social media” and its inseparable brother “the smart phone” even make real face-to-face social contact more difficult. Therefore going out with friends and people you care about is a MUST and should be uplifted even more in daily life. Alcohol consumption is not a must in these occasions but will weaken our daily (almost indoctrinated) restrains and sometimes helps us to forge new relations.
A new product concept named “FENIX Hangover Care” will launch on the 10th of October on Kickstarter and it shows very promising properties to be implemented in daily life through bars, disco's and shops. It fights the right bad actors and replenishes the body with the right chemicals to reduce the overall hangover effect. There are not many anti-hangover care products available so hopefully this one will make it to the market. If you are interested you can check out www.fenixhangovercare.com.

In addition to the built-in HDMI cable box input slot on the Xbox One, Microsoft has announced a new Over-the-Air TV Tuner device, which launches today on the Microsoft Store for $60.
In short, it basically hooks up to an HDTV antenna to allow you to access TV on your console like a standard box, as well as pause live TV for "up to 30 minutes." It will also allow those of you out there who don't have a cable subscription to access those basic network channels with all of the typical UI fixins like snapping.
It's kind of pricey, but if it works, it's a great way to augment Sling TV and cut the cord.

People magazine continues with their “Countdown to The Force Awakens” articles from their upcoming issue exclusively dedicated to the new Star Wars movie. In their latest article they take a quick look at the villains from The Force Awakens. One particular piece of info is worth mentioning. The chief of creature and droid effects Neal Scanlan revealed what is Supreme Leader Snoke's actual height in the movie.
This revelation is important since many people and sites were confused by Empire's initial report on Snoke's appearance, which resulted in people thinking that Snoke could be 25 feet tall. It sounds crazy, but many people believed that.
Now Neal Scanlan puts those rumors to rest (via People):
Andy Serkis, the master of CGI characters from Gollum to King Kong, plays the still-unseen Supreme Leader Snoke who has scenes with Kylo Ren. “All I can say is that I'm involved in it,” they have said. But Neal Scanlan, chief of creature and droid effects, told PEOPLE, “This character is much better executed as a CGI character. That's just a practical reality when he's 7-foot-something tall; he's very, very thin.”
So yes, Snoke is not 25 feet tall but 7. Obviously they were standing on some kind of podium when they shot those scenes, hence the confusion.
Another interesting excerpt from that story is Gwendoline Christie's comment on their character Captain Phasma:
Gwendoline Christie, the towering knight in HBO's Game of Thrones, is inside the chrome armor of Captain Phasma, commanding a legion of Stormtroopers for what's left of the Empire, now called the First Order. “She is a Boba Fett-style character, striking and in command but not at the very forefront of the action always,” Christie says, comparing Phasma to the beloved bounty hunter from the original trilogy. “Other than that, all I can say is that they are badass.”

A day after Global News reported the RCMP was investigating national security aspects related to the stolen plane that crashed in Peterborough, Ont. last week, the RCMP has confirmed its national security enforcement unit was involved in the investigation.
The national police force also said it found no threat to national security, no motive for the theft and declined to provide an explanation as to how a 20-year-old Markham man with mental health issues who “acted alone,” managed to steal the plane undetected and crash it in a major Ontario city.
Mohammad Hassan Chaudhary of Markham, Ont. was killed after the small Piper Tomahawk aircraft they allegedly stole from the Markham Airport smashed into the ground just before 1:30 a.m. Aug. 12 near the Landsdowne Place mall. Chaudhary's father told Global News their son lived with schizophrenia and other mental health issues.
READ MORE: RCMP investigated Peterborough plane crash as ‘national security issue'
Afzal Chaudhary said theirs they are shocked their son was able to steal and fly the plane without a “single minute” of flight training.
Sources close to the investigation confirmed to Global News the RCMP led the inquiry into the crash and Chaudhary said they had met with them “many times” to discuss their son's involvement.
RCMP spokesperson Sgt. Penny Hermann initially told Global News the national police force was investigating “the reasons that the aircraft was stolen” with the Peterborough Police Service and York Regional Police, but declined to comment on whether the RCMP was leading the investigation or if it was being treated as a national security issue.
WATCH: RCMP confirm Peterborough plane crash was subject of national security investigation
After declining multiple requests for additional comment, Hermann contacted Global News Thursday evening with a brief updated statement.
“I just got information saying that based on our joint investigation in regards to that plane crash, there is no national security aspect,” said Hermann, who was unavailable for further comment.
The RCMP released a statement Friday afternoon that said the three police services had been “working together” to investigate the crash and confirmed the Ontario RCMP Integrated National Security Enforcement Team (INSET) had been involved in the investigation.
“As Canadian airspace incidents involve federal authorities in the investigation, PPS contacted the Ontario RCMP Integrated National Security Enforcement Team (INSET) during their initial investigation as did YRP during their investigation,” the statement said.
“INSET has followed up on the information provided by both police services and we have no information to indicate there is a link with national security. The investigation has not revealed the motive for the theft and all indications are that the young man acted alone.”
Chaudhary expressed outrage over the fact that their son was somehow able to break into the airport, steal a small aircraft and crash land on the streets of Peterborough without any intervention from police or airport security officials.
Although they cannot confirm how their son allegedly broke into the airport and stole the plane, Chaudhary said Thursday they suspect their son had possibly done it as an “adventure” and that their son should have been apprehended as soon as they entered the airport.
A source close to the investigation told Global News something was found in the wreckage that concerned police, while the owners of the stolen Piper Tomahawk said their plane was full of fuel and was capable of flying up to five hours.
The RCMP said it is “very common” for the police service to work with other jurisdictions and added it had no further details to provide on the investigation.

There's no question that Cyclone Nation will pack the Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium for Iowa State's matchup vs. Memphis Saturday.
Another no-doubter: The supply of Busch Light is drying up.
Dozens of Iowa State fans attended CycloneFanatic.com's watch party at King Jerry Lawler's Hall Of Fame Bar And Grille Friday as the ISU men's basketball team hosted Kansas State Friday in a Big 12 Conference opener. The wrestling legend himself, Jerry Lawler, was there, too.

In an interview with WHO-HD sports reporter Michael Admire, Lawler was asked about the significance of the bowl game as well as what they thought of Iowa State.
"The Liberty Bowl is great, and we have the Iowa State Cyclones in town. It's been awesome, a great turnout — come on let's hear it for you guys," Lawler said pointing back to the strong contigent of Cyclone fans.
Admire asks: "What's your impression of all these crazy Cyclone fans?"
"They packed the place last night, again tonight, again (Saturday). The only problem we had was: They drank us completely out of Busch Light beer!
"I didn't realize, in Memphis, Tennessee, nobody's ever heard of Busch Light beer. But apparently it's big in Iowa, right?"
You got that right, King.

Iowa State went on to defeat Memphis, 21-20.

Fox News host Sean Hannity. (Carolyn Kaster/AP)
President Trump said during their campaign for the White House that they want the United States to adopt the libel standards of England, where protections for journalists are weaker. More recently, they floated the idea of reinstating the principles of the Fairness Doctrine, scrapped three decades ago by Ronald Reagan's administration but still enforced in Great Britain and the rest of the United Kingdom.
Perhaps Trump will reconsider the wisdom of emulating the British system after the U.K. regulatory agency Ofcom on Monday cited two of the president's biggest boosters, Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson of Fox News, for violating standards of fairness.
(Ofcom has lots of rules, by the way. It cited CNN International for a May telecast that included graphic footage of a chemical-weapons attack in Syria, saying the 8 p.m. air time was not late enough to shield young viewers. It cited “Fox & Friends” for a June 2016 segment about consumer bargains, saying the show did not adequately distinguish between news content and advertising.)
Ofcom ruled that a January episode of Hannity's show and a May episode of Carlson's show failed to satisfy three legal requirements, excerpted below:
“Alternative viewpoints must be adequately represented.”
“Due impartiality must be preserved on matters of major political and industrial controversy.”
“Views and facts must not be misrepresented.”
From a practical standpoint, Ofcom's ruling doesn't mean much. Fox News's parent company stopped airing the channel in the United Kingdom in August, citing low viewership.
Yet the Hannity and Carlson citations are instructive, as examples of the adverse side effects Trump might experience if they were to get serious about further regulations on the media. When the president says, as they did last month, that “it's frankly disgusting the way the press is able to write whatever they want to write, and people should look into it,” they seem to imagine a crackdown on negative coverage of their White House without considering what might happen to one-sided reporting in their favor.
Late Night host are dealing with the Democrats for their very "unfunny" & repetitive material, always anti-Trump! Should we get Equal Time? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2017
More and more people are suggesting that Republicans (and me) should be given Equal Time on T.V. when you look at the one-sided coverage? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2017
Trump's October tweets about “equal time” for Democrats and Republicans harked back to a time when the Federal Communications Commission required television broadcasters to cover public policy issues and to balance opposing views.
The FCC repealed the Fairness Doctrine in 1987 after determining “that the doctrine likely violated the free speech rights of broadcasters, led to less speech about issues of public importance over broadcast airwaves, and was no longer required because of the increase in competition among mass media,” according to the Congressional Research Service.
Note that it was a Republican administration that did away with the Fairness Doctrine. And it was Republicans who pushed for a 2009 vote in the Senate to prohibit reinstatement of the Fairness Doctrine, at a time when some Democrats were complaining about the proliferation of conservative talk radio. The ban passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in the Senate, by a vote of 87 to 11.
Hannity called the Fairness Doctrine an “assault on the First Amendment” at the time. They understood the potential drawbacks of mandatory, government-defined fairness.
As well as working with Stanley Kubrick for over 30 years, Jan Harlan also directed Stanley Kubrick: A Life In Pictures, which is considered to be one of the most in-depth documentaries about the life and times of the acclaimed director.
As part of JDIFF '15, Jan Harlan will be attending a special screening of Barry Lyndon along with star Ryan O'Neal at Savoy Cinema on Saturday, March 21st at the Savoy.
We sat down with Harlan and discussed their working life with Stanley Kubrick, Barry Lyndon's bumpy production in Ireland what Kubrick would have made of films today.
A significant portion of Barry Lyndon was filmed in Ireland. Why was that? Was it about authenticity or tax breaks?
No, not at all. Stanley wasn't a man who travelled easily. We shot in Ireland because we couldn't get that look and those locations. Look at Thomastown, Carrick-on-Suir. You get big stately homes, but you don't get the kind of look we wanted in Ireland. It's an Irish story. Stanley hated, HATED travelling. They hated hotels, they hated being away. I mean, we shot Full Metal Jacket - a Vietnam War movie - in England!
There's an urban legend about Barry Lyndon, that the production was targeted by the IRA. Can you tell us about that a bit?
That only happened later in the production. It happened in, I think, the last 10% of the production. We'd got most of our filming done, we still had some scenes left to finish. But yeah, it was real. At least, we thought it was. It might have been a hoax, but we definitely didn't want to test it. They were directly threatened and they didn't want to test whether it was real or not. And, y'know, within 24 hours, they were gone. We had most of the film done so it wasn't a huge disaster for us. The story's true.
Why did they want to make Barry Lyndon?
I asked them that question once, and this is what they said to me. "You may as well ask me why I married my wife!" They were in love with the novel, they were in love with the era and they wanted to make that film. That's it. There's no reason to it, there's no logic for it, they simply wanted to adapt Thackery's novel. It didn't do well for him. For whatever reason, it was a total flop in the Anglo-Saxon world. It flopped in the United States, but in Spain, Portugal and countries like that, it did very, very well. At the time, the US audience accounted for something like 50% of the box-office earnings.
Why do you think their films have such longevity?
They have enough of an audience that people will love them. Barry Lyndon, for example, wasn't a box-office hit. But it will remain. I promise you, in 100 years, people will still be talking about it. Dr. Strangelove has yet to be surpassed. It's still, unfortunately, still modern. 2001 is still modern. The vanity of the military in Paths of Glory is still relevant. It's still there. Their films are an icon for the next generation. It's the mark of an artist. The French impressionists, like Picasso, will never go away. You don't have to like them, but I promise you, they will never disappear. And Kubrick's films will be around for a long time.
Kubrick's films are so well researched and they themselves was so particular, they must have been a demanding director to work with.
Of course they were demanding! But there's nothing wrong with that! If you can satisfy a demanding person, it's much more satisfying to work for him. I wasn't always able to, it wasn't always a walk in the park. But it was great fun. Otherwise, I wouldn't have been working for them for 30 years.
Their casting choices were so on-point, you really couldn't imagine anyone else in these roles. How did they go about casting? Did they have someone particular in mind, did they write for a specific actor?
He'd look at a lot of films, he'd scratch their head. For Eyes Wide Shut, they were totally determined to have Tom Cruise. They wanted this macho guy, to play a loser. Tom themselves said that they were so happy to do it, to do a role that they wouldn't normally do. They didn't, however, want Nicole Kidman. They didn't want a married couple, they were adamant about that. But then they saw Nicole in a film called To Die For and they were so good at holding a long take. They asked Tom if they minded, they said not at all. And that was it.
Did they allow themselves to take in pride in what they did?
Oh, very much so. They were very depressed that Barry Lyndon didn't do well. The fact that it did so well in Brazil, France and Japan - but it was a total flop in the United States. That was very disappointing for him, but they loved it. Eyes Wide Shut, they felt, was their greatest contribution to the art of filmmaking. The fact that few people would agree with that is neither here nor there.
What's your favourite Stanley Kubrick film?
I'm the last person to answer that. I'm too close to it. I love to be in Ireland, but that's not a good reason to like Barry Lyndon. I love the incredible, intense work on Eyes Wide Shut. In that respect I like it very much. To work in the Gasworks for Full Metal Jacket was most unpleasant, and I didn't like it all, but I don't like it any less because it was so unpleasant. I love 2001, I'd nothing to do with it. I love Dr. Strangelove, I'd nothing to do with it. I look good movies, I like good films.
Is there any film that you've watched recently that you think Stanley would have loved that or would have loved to make?
I think they would have loved Boyhood. It's such an original idea. They would have liked Ida. It's a completely, beautiful, black-and-white film. It's all about Communism, the holocaust and so on. It's a complex film. They were a film buff. I can't say I've seen a film that they would have done better. I'd have to think about it very carefully.
On Wednesday, a remote code execution vulnerability in PHP was accidentally exposed to the Web, prompting fears that it may be used to target vulnerable websites on a massive scale. The bug itself was traced back to 2004, and came to light during a recent CTF competition.
The group that discovered the bug was waiting for a patch to be published before they released any information. However, on Wednesday details were leaked to Reddit prompting the group (Eindbazen) disclose what they had discovered.
[Update: On May 08, the PHP development team released PHP 5.4.3 and PHP 5.3.13. All users are encouraged to upgrade to PHP 5.4.3 or PHP 5.3.13.]
“When PHP is used in a CGI-based setup (such as Apache's mod_cgid), the php-cgi receives a processed query string parameter as command line arguments which allows command-line switches, such as -s, -d or -c to be passed to the php-cgi binary, which can be exploited to disclose source code and obtain arbitrary code execution,” a CERT advisory on the flaw explains.
In short, the flaw will attackers to issue commands to servers where PHP has been compiled to run under CGI mode. This is often done for security and development reasons. It's important to note that FastCGI configurations are not impacted by the flaw.
PHP developers pushed a fix for the flaw, resulting in the release of PHP 5.3.12 and 5.4.2, but as it turns out it didn't actually remove the vulnerability.
“The new PHP versions as well as the official PHP patch contain a bug which makes the fix trivial to bypass. Use our mitigations for now,” the Eindbazen team wrote on their blog.
Mitigations as well as additional information from Eindbazen can be found on their website. You can view it here.
Finally, the developers over at PHP are aware of the issues created by the fix and are working to stamp out the problem.

Amid all of the transfer news, preseason friendlies, and tumult with Pep and Barcelona there was an important statement made regarding the future of football. In a conversation on the Italian “Radio Marte”, Aurelio de Laurentiis announced:
“I called Reja over the last few days and told them I intend to expand my football empire, I want to buy three clubs, including one in England, so I asked Reja if they would be willing to be the coach and they said he's available." (Reja is former Napoli boss Edy Reja)
and with those words there was another splash of water in the bucket, a signal, in my opinion, of football's ever encroaching era of empire building. The Pozzo family, originally owners of Udinese and now Granada and Watford came first, modestly and intelligently, and used their English and Spanish clubs to develop young players for the Udinese team. The clubs have both been successful since the partnership and Watford seems well set-up for another run at the Premiership this season. The horizontal integration of clubs across divisions, aspirations, and nations, has allowed the Pozzo family to buy more affordable young talent and, thus, increase their chance of turning a profit. They are betting on the fact that harmony can create better results than the typical discord in relations between top level clubs.
The importance of a man of Di Laurentiis's stature being involved with this sort of ideological project is that their ambitions place success in football over mere financial success. He'd rather retain their best players than sell them on for big profits and has built a strong Napoli side around the principal of retention, rather than the buy-low sell-high trading of Udinese. The purchase of a Premier League or Championship club would no longer be the mere experiment that it was for the Pozzo's, but a strategy for sustained success in development and would most likely receive some of the heavy investment that he's put into the Italian club that they love so dearly.
I've always been fascinated by resistance to the growing trend of team's spending equalling their league position and this method of football empire building seems to be a viable alternative to spending outrageous lump sums and might be a more sustainable way to grow the game. The one limitation of the plan, obviously, is that ownership must prioritize one of the clubs over the others, because they cannot meet in European competitions. This means that Napoli would always have to be a step better than the Di Laurentiis's English Club or visa-versa. While not prohibitive, this cap on success, is somewhat a damper to the totality of these projects.
I also must admit that I absolutely love Aurelio de Laurentiis and believe they should own as many football clubs as humanly possible. Just look at how they talk about Naples in the asupervisorstioned interview:
"In my life I have always been in love with Naples and its culture. I want to bring this city around the world. Some of my friends say they've never seen the city and I wonder how that is even possible.”
He's a man of passion, not cold calculation, and a Premier League that has increasingly looked at teams as investments rather than with the love and affection of the club chairperson that proceeded the media boom certainly needs more of that. Now let's hope he's in it for the long haul and doesn't ride off into the sunset with a trail of Vespa exhaust the only lingering sign of their presence.
Controversy has erupted over a video showing a school principal offering a father a flip-phone instead of the new iPhone 6 they confiscated from their child.
The Philadelphia father is stunned when they claim that school rules allow them to take away what turns out to be their iPhone 'for several weeks'.
Instead, they hand them an old-school flip phone - and explains that the school buys them in bulk to give to parents whose phones have been confiscated.
'I can't give the phone back. We have to secure them,' they explain. 'That's our policy. Sorry that we took it, they can get their phone back in few backs.'
'Why would you make a rule that a parent can't get back property they bought?' the father asks.
'I can show you the rule book if you want. You can use the flip phone for emergencies. This is the way we want to do it.'
NEW YORK—Citing the numerous studies linking the overuse of electronic devices to stunted development, the MLB reportedly sent a memo to all 30 teams Tuesday that recommended limiting the amount of screen time for rookies. “During that incredibly important first year, coaches should ideally prohibit players from spending more than two hours per day in front of computers, phones, and TVs,” read the memo authored by MLB medical director Dr. Gary Green, warning that excessive screen time could have significant consequences for rookies' physical fitness, concentration at the plate, and ability to socialize with teammates. “Although it's easy and convenient to simply sit rookies down with an iPad or in front of the clubhouse TV to keep them occupied, teams need to realize that these players are still at a precarious place in their cognitive, physical, and emotional development. While there's no one-size-fits-all approach, rookies' screen time should be mostly dedicated to high-quality programming, such as tape of opposing pitchers. Ultimately, it's up to teams to make smart decisions that will benefit their rookies' long-term growth.” The memo also recommended that coaches designate screen-free times for the whole team, such as group dinners or while in bed at the team hotel.

The father of a young Edmonton girl with an incurable form of cancer says he's struggling: emotionally and financially, after quitting their job to be by their daughter's side.
Haydar Easa's 13-year-old daughter Zahra lives with sarcoma, a type of cancer found in the soft tissue.
Zahra's been in and out of the hospital for years, but recently their health took a turn for the worse – and that's when Easa quit their job to be with their little girl at all times.
“Zahra held my hand and said ‘daddy please, don't leave me alone, I'm scared. Daddy, please stay with me,'” Easa said.
“Zahra said ‘daddy, you have to be beside me. I need you.'”
They had originally left their job in Fort McMurray five years ago, for a job in Edmonton to be closer to Zahra and their three other children.
However in October, Zahra's condition worsened.
Easa said they went into a coma twice and had severe seizures and bleeding.
“Doctors said Zahra, she'll never wake up again, it's the end of the line,” Easa said.
“It was a very bad experience for us.”
That's when the young girl asked their father to be with them at all times – so, Easa quit their most recent job.
But with no income coming in, they say he's struggling to pay their mortgage, bills, and put food on the table.
“Most of the time, I use my VISA, my credit card,” Easa said.
And that's where the Islamic Family and Social Services Association came in.
The association heard about the Easa family's situation about a year ago.
They've been trying to raise money and provide support to help Easa and Zahra ever since
“We started raising money through Facebook,” said Lena Hamdon, who volunteers with the organization.
Hamdon said the group is trying to reach out to the community to help put Easa's financial worries at ease, so they can focus on being there for Zahra.
“She just needs love. They need their dad, they need their family,” Hamdon said.
“With the financial part, if us as a community can take care of that part and they can focus on making Zahra happy, then that's the main goal.”
Easa has been appreciative of the association's help.
They say the money they've been able to collect so far means they can spend more time making sure Zahra is happy.
“When they see daddy beside her, they feel strong,” Easa said.
“She feels like she's not alone.”
Anyone wishing to donate to the Easa family can do so through PayPal, by clicking here or contacting the Islamic Family and Social Services Association.
There is also a trust fund in Haydar Easa's name at TD Canada Trust, account information is: Transit # 83249. Inst. # 004. Account #. 83246067666.

It wouldn't be too much of a superlative stretch to say that ‘AM' has become the album of the decade so far. Since its release back in September of 2013, Arctic Monkeys' fifth effort has propelled the band from British national treasures to a world-beating concern. After years of trying, it's the album that finally broke them in America, while on these shores it's racked them up NME and Brit awards, a Mercury Prize nomination, huge sales and steered them through the biggest headline gigs of their lives.
Tonight, bringing Leeds festival to a close (August 24) with a celebratory Yorkshire homecoming – and with the biggest crowd of the weekend with them – the Monkeys gave ‘AM' It's send off. There are still gigs scheduled overseas throughout the autumn, but as far as the UK goes, this is it for the foreseeable future. And, as far as goodbyes go, their headline overflowed with all the things a goodbye should have: celebration, nostalgia, emotion and, fundamentally, a joyous reminder of exactly why you'll miss them when they're away.
If Alex Turner and co have had criticisms levelled at them for being too polished over the last year, then tonight they seemed to be genuinely having fun. There's the white roses emblazoned on Turner's jacket (a nod to the War of the Roses) and quips about Sheffield, the singer's jokey stage chat (“You can do louder than that, come on don't be a dick,” they laugh, revving the crowd up before ‘When The Sun Goes Down') and the finale, where the usual kick back in of ‘R U Mine?' occurs twice, a clearly improvised move as Turner gives the amused look of a man who knows he's being ridiculous but is having too much fun to care. Add that to a set that manages to pack in nearly all of ‘AM' alongside one of the most solid greatest hits back catalogues of this century and you've got an inarguable triumph.
Of course, the closing of this chapter of the Sheffielders' story poses the question of where they'll go next and what they'll do next. Over the last decade, the band have slowly evolved from spiky upstarts to sultry provocateurs via side projects, solo endeavours and the odd guiding hand from their musical mates.
If their recent work points to anything, it's that the Monkeys will pick up the R'n'B baton they teased us with on ‘AM' and run with it. But as the prowl of ‘Humbug' lead us into the lovesick ‘Suck It And See' and, in turn, its randy cousin in ‘AM', there's equally much chance that the quartet will wrongfoot us all.
As far as other projects go, a recent reunion during the Arctics' Finsbury Park shows has already teased the idea of another Last Shadow Puppets record (Turner and Miles Kane have spoken about wanting to make it happen), while drummer Matt Helders has been working on an as-yet-unreleased track with Toddla T. And, following the success of their ‘Submarine' soundtrack EP, you wouldn't want to rule out any solo output either.
If most artists have to negotiate their difficult second album (and lord knows, following the gargantuan success of ‘Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not', Arctic Monkeys know a thing or two about that), then this must be one of the first cases of facing a difficult sixth. Five albums in and Arctic Monkeys have surpassed their own heights and created their own challenge with it. Tonight was a righteously brilliant send off for an album truly deserving off it. We may have seen the last of ‘AM' in the UK now, but Arctic Monkeys have the look of a band just getting into their stride.
Prisons are uniquely isolated and isolating places. These institutions, typically closed off from public view, have recently become the subject of a shocking ombudsman investigation. The ombudsman's detailed report on the excessive use of force by correctional officers in Ontario's provincial detention centres exposes the inexcusable behaviour of some correctional officers and the context in which this behaviour arises. Correctional officers are tasked with very challenging and often unenviable jobs. The behaviours reflected in the report are by no means representative of all of the men and women working within corrections, as both Ombudsman Andre Marin and Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services Madeleine Meilleur aptly point out. While the use of some force cannot be prevented given the nature of the correctional environment, its application requires strict professionalism, regulation, accountability and oversight. To the ministry's credit, its line-by-line response to the report's recommendations and its immediate commitment to shifting corrections in Ontario is commendable.
A photo of an inmate known as "Colin" is contained in Ombudsman Andre Marin's report on abuse by some correctional officers in Ontario. Six officers restrained Colin with handcuffs and leg restraints, then beat them to a pulp. Guards initially claimed they hit their head on the floor.
Why should you care about the treatment of prisoners? For one, the large majority of them will eventually be released. Every year about 70,000 provincial prisoners return to communities across Ontario. How they are treated inside impacts how well they fare upon release. An unsafe prison environment does not lend itself to producing well-adjusted, law-abiding citizens; in fact, quite the opposite. Regardless of the offences committed, we have a responsibility to ensure that all prisoners have their basic needs met, have opportunities for rehabilitation and are safe from harm while inside our prisons. The excessive use of force is one of a number of serious issues endemic to our correctional system, and indeed, cannot be fully examined in isolation from these broader conditions.

What are these conditions? Overcrowding, growing rates of mental health problems among prisoners, and high remand populations, to name a few. Picture a concrete room the size of an average household washroom, and imagine two to three complete strangers having to live and sleep there. It is not uncommon for prisoners to be sleeping on cell floors in prison cells originally designed for one. Now consider that the majority of these people are not convicted of any charges and are awaiting trial (most prisoners in our provincial correctional system are not sentenced). In addition, of these incarcerated cellmates, chances are high that at least one, if not several, suffer from undiagnosed or unmanaged mental health or addictions problems. Now magnify and multiply this scenario: data show that most provincial correctional institutions are maxing out their rated capacities, at a time when government resources are increasingly scarce. These circumstances exacerbate tensions, conflicts and worsen pre-existing mental health concerns; all of which impact correctional officers' work environment. These conditions are also counterproductive to effective corrections. During a time of historically low crime rates, there are more effective and innovative methods of dealing with crime than simply building more prisons, or packing more people into existing ones. Prisons require disproportionate amounts of our tax dollars to build and operate, and as the ombudsman's report shows, crowded prisons create unsafe environments for both staff and prisoners. Prisons, though a necessary part of society, do not always provide the public with the best return on investment, particularly when it comes to individuals who can be managed safely and effectively in the community.
Yes, the Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services owns the responsibility of ensuring that prisoners are treated with the dignity, respect and protection that they deserve as citizens and human beings. The ombudsman was crystal clear on this point, and laid out concrete ways in which the ministry can redress some of the issues around oversight of the specific issue of excessive use of force. But what of the other challenges facing our prisons? The conditions that put our civil servants, prisoners and communities at risk?

These issues require a strong commitment from the government to address at the early stages of the criminal justice process, long before these individuals wind up in our jails. For the time being, however, there needs to be at least be recognition from our leaders that current conditions are not acceptable and a commitment to meaningfully tackling these problems. And the government is not, and should not be, alone on solving this problem; there are many community-based organizations willing to roll up their sleeves. John Howard Society staff have been providing services to youth, prisoners, ex-prisoners, their families and Ontario's neighbourhoods for decades. Our staff are inside the prisons and on the ground in our communities every day assisting those affected by the criminal justice system, in an effort to build safer neighbourhoods. Ultimately, prison safety is community safety — the sooner we all recognize prison conditions as a public issue, the better. Paula Osmok is executive director of the John Howard Society of Ontario.
Sosnowsky's hogweed (Heracleum sosnowskyi) is a monocarpic perennial herbaceous flowering plant in the carrot family Apiaceae. Its native range includes the central and eastern Caucasus regions of Eurasia and extends into the southern Caucasus region called Transcaucasia. The native ranges of Heracleum sosnowskyi and Heracleum mantegazzianum, a close relative, overlap in the Caucasus region.[1] Sosnowsky's hogweed is now a common weed in the Baltic States, Belarus, Russia, Ukraine, and Poland.
Early botanists considered H. sosnowskyi to be a subspecies of H. mantegazzianum. Sosnowski's hogweed was described as a separate species by Ida P. Mandenova in 1944.[1] The species is named in honor of the Russian botanist Dmitrii Ivanovich Sosnowsky (1885–1952), who found the species in Georgia in 1936.[2]
Description [ edit ]
Heracleum sosnowskyi Inflorescences Inflorescences
H. sosnowskyi is 3–5 m in height,[3] with a straight, firm stem that can reach a diameter of 12 cm.[3] The leaves are 50–60 cm long. The root is very firm, up to 30 cm diameter.[clarification needed] The inflorescence is a big umbel found at the end of every stem. It blooms during July through September and produces thousands of seeds. They are easily distributed by the wind, but especially by the water.
Sosnowsky's hogweed is a monocarpic perennial,[4] that is, after a mature plant flowers and produces seed, the entire plant including the root will die.
Public health and safety [ edit ]
Damaged hand due to physical contact with the plant
All parts of H. sosnowskyi contain the intense toxic allergen furanocoumarin.[citation needed] It is dangerous for humans because even small drops of plant's juice cause photosensitivity and burns.[5] The plant is less dangerous for animals that have thick hair to protect them from the sun.
Control measures [ edit ]
The plant was common only in the Caucasus area, until it started to be used as a silage plant in other parts of the Soviet Union. As a result, it quickly spread in many areas of Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine. It is now a highly invasive plant in the Baltic States, Poland, and Belarus.[6] Many river valleys and roadsides are occupied by large stands of this weed. It is difficult to eradicate because the seeds remain viable for many years and the roots are difficult to remove. Herbicides are widely used in a fight against it, but the plant can later resprout from the roots.[7]
The plant is also used as a shield-hedge along the roads, preventing farm animals from escaping and wild animals from getting in.[3].
The decision to use the plant for silage was made in 1947, under Stalin's rule, so when the species later proved to be highly invasive and difficult to remove, people started to call it "Stalin's revenge".[8]

Google has just posted an update on its self-driving car program, which we've been watching closely for the past several years. The cars have surpassed 700,000 autonomous accident-free miles (around 1.13 million kilometers), and they're learning how to safely navigate through the complex urban jungle of city streets. Soon enough, they'll be better at it than we are. Much better.
We've improved our software so it can detect hundreds of distinct objects simultaneously—pedestrians, buses, a stop sign held up by a crossing guard, or a cyclist making gestures that indicate a possible turn. A self-driving vehicle can pay attention to all of these things in a way that a human physically can't—and it never gets tired or distracted.
This is why we're so excited about a future full of autonomous cars. Yes, driving sucks, especially in traffic, and we'd all love to just take a nap while our cars autonomously take us wherever we want to go. But the most important fact is that humans are just terrible at driving. We get tired and distracted, but that's just scratching the surface. We're terrible at dealing with unexpected situations, our reaction times are abysmally slow, and we generally have zero experience with active accident avoidance if it involves anything besides stomping on the brakes and swerving wildly, which sometimes only make things worse.
An autonomous car, on the other hand, is capable of ingesting massive amounts of data in a very short amount of time, exploring multiple scenarios, and perhaps even running simulations before it makes a decision designed to be as safe as possible. And that decision might (eventually) be one that only the most skilled human driver would be comfortable with, because the car will know how to safely drive itself up to (but not beyond) its own physical limitations. This is a concept that Stanford University was exploring before most of that team moved over to Google's car program along with Sebastian Thrun.
Photo: Google What's that black box?
Now, I may be making something out of nothing here, but if we compare the car in the image that Google provided with its latest blog post with an earlier Google car from 2012 (or even the Google car in the video), you'll notice that there's an extra piece of hardware mounted directly underneath the Velodyne LIDAR sensor: a polygonal black box (see close-up, right). I have no idea what's in that box, but were I to wildly speculate, my guess would be some sort of camera system with a 360-degree field of view.
The Velodyne LIDAR is great at detecting obstacles, but what Google is working on now is teaching their cars to understand what's going on in their environment, and for that, you need vision. The cars always had cameras in the front to look for road signs and traffic lights, but detecting something like a cyclist making a hand signal as they blow past you from behind seems like it would require fairly robust vision hardware along with some fast and powerful image analysis software.
Or, it could be radar. Or more lasers. We're not sure, except to say that it's new(ish), and that vision is presumably becoming more important for Google as they ask their cars to deal with more complex situations with more variables.
Another interesting tidbit in the update (posted by Chris Urmson, director of Google's Self-Driving Car Project) is the phrase about "teaching the car to drive more streets in Mountain View before we tackle another town." The Google cars can deal with changing environments and some level of dynamic uncertainty, but it needs a reliable basemap to use as a point of reference for lane width, traffic light formation, crosswalks, lane curvature, and more.
So, it might not be possible to tell them to drive you somewhere that they have never been. To continue to speculate (because it's fun!), this might suggest how Google is planning on eventually making money on all of this: rather than making and selling autonomous cars, they'll maintain a continually updated database of road data that either car manufacturers or end users will have to subscribe to in order for their cars to operate autonomously.
Google's cars are still not ready for end users like you and me; they may be able to deal with 90 or 95 percent of situations autonomously, but that last 5 to 10 percent to make it to 100 percent autonomy (which is what's required) is probably as hard as all of the research, programming, experience, and machine learning that's gone into the cars up to this point.
It's impossible to plan ahead for every single scenario that an autonomous car might have to handle, so the key to unleashing the autonomous car is going to be a system that can learn and make decisions on the fly. In fact, it's almost certain that there will be accidents, because autonomous cars are still going to have to deal with all the other human drivers on the road (and also because no software is perfect).
But if we can get past our reluctance to place more trust in an autonomous system than we do in ourselves, autonomous cars have the potential to completely revolutionize our transportation infrastructure.

The trailer for Nintendo's new Switch console plays like a Mission Impossible heist. Just when you think Tom Cruise is stumped, their gadget does one more weird trick to save the day.
Dog needs to go outside?
No problem, just take apart your modular controller and snap the pieces onto the sides of the Switch screen.
Your friends haven't seen you in weeks, even though they live on the rooftop directly opposite your Brooklyn loft?
No problem, just carry your Switch in one hand while you give sidehugs with the other arm.
Your band is having creative differences and you're wondering if this tour will be your last tour before Gary gets that high-powered corporate job that will monopolize all their time and drain the indie punk rock right out of him?
No problem, each segment of the controller works as a standalone controller so split-screen Mario Kart can mask the pain.
And what really impressed me about the video, aside from these Tom Cruseian gymnastics, is that Nintendo seems like a company that knows almost exactly what it's good at.
Handhelds
While the Wii U has struggled in the home, the handled 3DS is still wildly successful. It's not just popular, it's good, and it keeps on getting great games five years into its life cycle. Nintendo, who invented the friggin' Game Boy, is a company that knows how to make portable consoles, and the Nintendo Switch is really just a high-end portable. It won't fit in a pocket, but neither will the 3DS comfortably.
I would love it if I could pop a game into my system and it would just work
Just like the 3DS, the Switch has cartridges instead of discs. These days many gamers prefer downloads to physical media, but I would love it if I could pop a game into my system and it would just work. We've become accustomed to "installs" and zero day "updates," but a portable console has to be ready to go with or without an internet connection. This is an art that it seems only Nintendo has preserved, and with cartridges it looks (fingers-crossed) like it will be an even more explicit strength this generation.
What remains to be seen is how Nintendo is going to balance power, screen size, and battery life. A New 3DS XL can get somewhere between six and 10 hours of gaming. Can the Switch match that with vastly superior specs? Well, it does have Nvidia Tegra inside, and Nvidia has already built what is basically a proof of concept for Switch: the Nvidia Shield Tablet K1. In our review we found the Shield had a subpar battery for a tablet, but was still good enough to roughly match a 3DS in game time.
Oh, and the Shield Tablet K1 is only $199, so that's a good sign. The DS, 3DS, and 3DS XL have always been aggressively priced, and my guess is the Switch will continue that trend.
Weird controllers
Nintendo is the ultimate in bizarre and modular controllers. The Wii had the Wii Remote, the Nunchuck, the Classic Controller, and let's not forget the MotionPlus, the Wii Remote Plus, and that chunky plastic steering wheel you could dock the Wii Remote in when you wanted to handicap yourself at Mario Kart.
The Wii U continued the trend with the Wii U GamePad. Unfortunately, unlike the Wii Remote, the GamePad was underutilized by both Nintendo and third parties. For instance, Nintendo described the controller as a "second window into the video game world," but for Mario Kart 8 the screen was mostly a glorified car horn button.
the Switch makes it possible to play normal games in more situations and with more people
The Nintendo Switch already has enough control options to be confusing. There's the default controller, which is actually comprised of two controllers that snap off and can be used independently. Then there's also a non-modular wireless controller which will likely be sold separately, much like the Wii U Pro controller.
This might seem like more of the same from Nintendo, but I think the Switch has a distinct advantage over Nintendo's previous controller experiments: instead of reinventing how people play games, the Switch makes it possible to play normal games in more situations and with more people. Four-player, local multiplayer portable sports games? Yes, please. The controller shenanigans this time around are less about how you play games than they're about where and with whom you play them.
30-somethings
Nintendo defined the game console in the ‘80s and ‘90s. The NES, the SNES, and to a lesser extent the N64, are all touchstones for anyone on the older end of the millennial spectrum. The GameCube was Nintendo's first big stumble, the Wii was popular at parties and with families but comparably sold few actual games, and the Wii U was basically a flop. It's been a long time since Nintendo has sold a dominant home console. But millions of people still love Mario Kart, still think Super Mario 64 is a pinnacle of game design, and still argue over which Zelda game is the greatest Zelda game of all time. For years Nintendo has milked nostalgia by revisiting its hits. It's even releasing a miniature NES Classic with a CRT-filter to get that old-school feel exactly right.
There's no "content," no "multimedia," no "apps," Just video games
But over the last couple generations Nintendo has also positioned its consoles as something for everyone — not just fans. Families! Kids! Gamers! Couples! Grandparents! Just check out this ad for the Wii U:
At E3 in 2011 the presentation was even more muddled. You could browse the web! Check your BMI! Video chat! Play reversi! Fling YouTube videos to your TV!
The Nintendo Switch first look, in contrast, is all 20 and 30-somethings playing mostly familiar Nintendo titles. No kids, no tweens, no parents, no grandparents. It's also all about video games. There's no "content," no "multimedia," no "apps." Just video games.
And, most importantly to this 30-something, Nintendo shows a glimpse of what looks to be a real honest-to-goodness Mario game. Super Mario 3D World came to the Wii U and got rave reviews, but it felt more like a 2D platformer than a true flagship Mario game in the tradition of Super Mario 64. Of course, in 2011 the Wii U's launch trailer showed off an edgy new Zelda title that was never produced, so this brief glimpse of Mario doesn't exactly guarantee anything.
Is it enough?
Frankly, I've been wondering for a while how Nintendo could possibly hope to compete with the high powered PS4 and Xbox One this generation. Raw specs have never been Nintendo's emphasis, but raw specs and huge install bases are what's required to get the best new games on your system.
"Yes that does seem fun!"
The Nintendo Switch seems to sidestep that whole problem. It says, "What if you could do Nintendo home console things on a portable console? Would that be fun?" and I have to say, in response, "Yes that does seem fun!" Multiplayer Mario Kart without digging the Wii out of the closet. An open world Zelda game like Skyrim on an airplane. Actual Skyrim on an airplane. This is a good idea that isn't solved by existing phones and tablets, or the current generation of portable consoles from Sony and Nintendo. Portability over visual fidelity has worked in Nintendo's favor time and time again.
Will this be enough to save Nintendo? Haven't we been asking that for a decade? Who cares, I want one.
Britain's spy agency stopped Harry Potter spoilers from leaking to the internet in the lead-up to a book release, its publisher has told ABC Radio.
Nigel Newton, the co-founder of publishing house Bloomsbury, has revealed the extraordinary measures taken to keep top-secret details about the boy wizard offline until each book hit shelves - including the involvement of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ).
Newton printed Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone – the first book in J.K. Rowling's acclaimed series about a boy wizard – in July 1997.

By Christmas, it had sold 30,000 copies, and soon it was a worldwide phenomenon. Speaking to Richard Fidler for ABC interview program Conversations, Newton said they had never seen readers respond to a series like they did to Harry Potter, and security was amped up accordingly.

MARK BLINCH/REUTERS Each book's release revived Harry Potter fever among fans.
"It was completely mad and we were at the eye of the storm," Newton said.
"I remember Jo Rowling phoning me once after she'd delivered a new book, saying 'please Nigel will you release the name of the title, because I have people outside searching my trash can looking for bits of paper'.
"At about that time we had to go into a complete security lockdown because people were trying to steal the manuscript."
In one case, a journalist for The Sun was sent to the printing factory with £5000 (NZ$10,370) in a case, to offer to any worker who would "go in and nick a copy".
"The enemies – that is to say when people were trying to bust the plot – stood to ruin a great deal of pleasure for the world," Newton said.
A "genuine desire to know what happened next" drove the mania surrounding the books, particularly in the month before the later books in the series came out, when there was a "fever pitch of anticipation".
By the fifth book in the series, German Shepherds and Alsatians were patrolling the printing works at the suggestion of Newton's father, an ex-military man who had experience protecting arms depots.
Although one security guard managed to steal a damaged copy of the book, from a cage of damaged copies they were paid to protect, Newton and Bloomsbury "fortunately had many allies".
"I remember the British spy eavesdropping station GCHQ rang me up and said 'we've detected an early copy of this book on the internet'," Newton said.
"I got them to read a page to our editor and they said, 'Nah, that's a fake'. They're good guys."
From then on, interactions surrounding the series became very cloak and dagger. When it was time to pick up the manuscript of the latest book, Newton was phoned to meet at a pub for a beer – the same place the last manuscript was exchanged – and knew immediately what was about to happen.
They arrived, casually had a beer and a chat, and didn't mention the manuscript, which was sitting in a grocery bag on the floor.
"As I left the pub, I simply picked up the bag that they walked in with, saying nothing about it ... and drove it home fearfully," Newton told Fidler.
Newton didn't even tell their family the manuscript was in the house. They read it in one night, then drove it to the house of the book's editor Emma Matthewson, whose security had been bolstered with burglar alarms and whose computer wasn't connected to the internet.
Fidler's interview seems to be the first time Newton has mentioned GCHQ had a role in Harry Potter's success.
When a comment on the situation was sought from the spy organisation, GCHQ offered the kind of wry reply that would make any Harry Potter fan smirk.
"We do not comment on our defence against the dark arts," a spokesperson told British media.
Transfer trickery
Teacher transfers have long been a source of contention between the Department of Education and the teachers union. Transfers are frequent in most government jobs, but Delhi's teachers are assigned a school when they join the service and most are required to move only once in their careers, when they are promoted to the grade of lecturer. Teachers unhappy with their assigned schools, however, may apply for transfers, which are usually accepted if there is a vacancy.
Delhi's schools have only 34,681 permanent teachers for 61,674 posts, so a teacher looking to move invariably finds an empty slot. The city also employs almost 17,000 guest teachers on short-term contracts, meaning that there are around 10,000 real vacancies. But since the posts held by contract teachers are counted as "vacant" for the purposes of a transfer, permanent teachers assigned to overcrowded, inaccessible schools like Sangam Vihar often try to leave at the first chance they get.
Earlier this year, the government identified the 311 "urgent requirement" schools where the shortage of teachers was so acute that teachers would be assigned there on a priority basis. Any teacher sent to such a school would have to stay for a minimum of two years before seeking a transfer, and any request for a transfer into these schools was to be automatically granted. The situation in C-block Sangam Vihar is so dire that the school is part of a special subset of 11 most "most urgent" schools in all of Delhi.
Yet Bhram Dev Sharma, Anuj's maths teacher, was assigned to the pahadi school in February this year and transferred out just five months later.
"That is because I transferred to another 'most urgent' school," Sharma said. "Transfers between most-urgent category schools are permitted." Senior officials in government admitted they had not foreseen this loophole when they framed the rules.
Sharma said they enjoyed teaching in Sangam Vihar but found it impossible to commute to the school. "I would spend two hours a day on the road," they said. "My mother is old; I need to look after her."
Their new school, in Malviya Nagar, was also short of teachers, Sharma said. "Are you telling me that only Sangam Vihar's students deserve a maths teacher? That the students of Malviya Nagar don't deserve a maths teacher?"
Other teachers were more sceptical of the transfer process. "The one with a stick controls the buffalo," said one teacher at the pahadi school. "If you have good connections, you never get posted to Sangam Vihar. If you have some connections, you get posted here but get transferred out.
"And if you have no connections, you end up here and your transfer request is declined because Sangam Vihar doesn't have enough teachers."
Delhi's education department is struggling to assign teachers to the Pahadi school, despite designating it a "urgent requirement" category school.
Teacher trouble
Why doesn't Delhi have more teachers?
Atishi Marlena, special advisor to Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia, said the reliance on contract teachers and the dearth of teachers overall were consequences of the fifth pay commission of 1992-93. It substantially raised salaries of all government employees, leading successive administrations in Delhi to hire contract teachers, who could be paid lower wages.
The current government does not want to hire any more contract teachers, but it does want more permanent teachers. In 2015, the city raised education spending to 25% of the annual budget and sought to hire 9,623 regular teachers from the pool of 16,747 contract staff on their rolls. But government rules mandate that recruitments be done through an entrance exam open to all eligible candidates. When the posts were advertised, 140,000 people applied. The government realised that serving contract teachers, who work long shifts, would struggle to compete against the legion of young Indians who devote the first few years of their working lives to applying for government jobs.
"We asked the selection board for a points-based weightage for contract teachers based on their years of service," Marlena said. The proposal was initially turned down by Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, but it is now under consideration once more after the Supreme Court upheld the validity of giving weightage to contract employees in an unrelated case.
In the meantime, the Delhi government is looking for provisional fixes. Saumya Gupta, the city's director of education, said the government was forming a panel of guest teachers who could be deployed anywhere at short notice and establishing a shuttle service to help teachers commute to the eight most inconvenient schools — including the pahadi school.
The shortage of teachers has forced Sangam Vihar to shorten the school day and eliminate all games periods.
Fun once a year
When a school is short-staffed, each teacher must fulfil numerous roles. Because the pahadi school has 25% fewer teachers than it is supposed to, it has reduced the length of the school day and the number of periods from eight to six, making the class schedule denser and simpler.
A middle school social studies teacher has been drafted to help teach physical education. But the school is already short one social studies teacher, so the drawing teacher is teaching social studies to help out. Which means the school doesn't have drawing classes either.
"We've made a separate extracurricular timetable in which we try to ensure all students gets at least some time to play every once in a while," Yadav said.
Anuj, the science student, and their brothers have wildly divergent experiences in the same schooling system. Their elder brother, Atul, who went to a similar school, discovered a love for painting. Where a student in an elite school would be mentored for a possible future career as an artist or a designer, Atul was told not to waste their time.
"Our school didn't have an art teacher either," they said. "Whenever there was an art competition, the teacher would choose their favourite student and send him. The rest of us were given no training."
Jatin, the youngest of the brothers, studies at a government school in Saket, a prosperous residential area. Their experiences offer a glimpse of all that is possible when the misaligned gears of government schooling click into place.
"Our school has everything," Jatin said one morning as they dressed for school. "We have a cricket ground, we have basketball courts, we even have hockey coaching."
Two weeks ago, Anuj's physical education teacher set aside their textbook and took the boys out to a dusty courtyard that stands in for the school playground. It was the class's first games period of the year.
"We played volleyball," Anuj said, "It was amazing. Last year, we didn't have a single games period."
"I study," they said. "But sometimes I wish we had something to keep our minds fresh. To relax, and not think of our exams."
Max Defourny will remain in Formula Renault 2.0 with the ART Junior Team this year.
The Belgian will contest both the NEC and the Eurocup, having dominated much of Eurocup testing at the end of 2015, leading all four sessions across two days at Aragon in November.
The 17-year-old finished fourth in the NEC standings as the top rookie last season after stepping up from FR1.6, claiming a win on home soil at Spa and another at the Nurburgring.
Driver Club Management, which oversees Defourny's career, said they had interest from teams in GP3 and Formula 3.5 V8, but that it felt remaining in FR2.0 was best for their development.
“After some great results last year, I am very excited for the 2016 season to contest Formula Renault 2.0 Eurocup and NEC with the ART Junior Team,” said Defourny, who only joined the French squad for round two of the 2015 NEC after their previous team Strakka withdrew from the category.
“We have a strong synergy together and I've felt good in the car.
“I will be pushing for the championship this year with the goal of stepping into a higher tier again in 2017.”
Texas transportation officials have challenged a state district court ruling that effectively abolished the state's restrictions on highway billboards, in the hopes the court will restore at least some of the rules on commercial ads.
The Texas Attorney General's Office filed a motion to reconsider with the Third District Court of Appeals in Austin on Sept. 27, on behalf of the Texas Department of Transportation. Many others, including Harris County, the Texas Municipal League and Scenic Texas have filed or plan to file briefs supporting the state's request.
Aside from aesthetic preferences, supporters of the billboard ban noted about $330 million – one-tenth of what the state receives in federal highway funds each year – are at stake. Federal rules require states to maintain “effective control” of their highways under the U.S. Highway Beautification Act.
Though there has been no indication any loss of federal funds is imminent, billboard ban supporters said Texas, the home of highway beautification champion First Lady Lady Bird Johnson, shouldn't risk it, even as courts weigh many sign bans nationally.
“The possibility that other courts may declare other billboard statutes unconstitutional is not a good reason for Texas to jump first in line,” lawyer Scott Brister wrote in an amicus brief on behalf of many local agencies.
The appeals court in August struck down significant portions of the Texas Highway Beautification Act, saying the act restricted free speech. The decision applies to the state's authority to regulate signs, but did not address municipal regulations, such as Houston's ban on new billboard advertising.
In striking down the law, the Texas court relied on a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that has caused a number of states to revisit parts of their highway beautification regulations, especially related to inhibiting free speech of landowners.
The state appeals court ruling stemmed from a challenge by Auspro Enterprises, related to a 2011 sign erected to support Ron Paul's 2012 presidential campaign. Auspro Enterprises placed the sign on its property along Texas 71.
Michael Kleinman, who also owns the Planet K chain of smoke, erotica and novelty shops in the Austin and San Antonio area, placed the sign in front of the Bee Cave Planet K location.
When TxDOT sought to have Kleinman remove the sign for violating limits on when political signs could be posted, they challenged their authority, citing its limits on their free speech.
The court agreed the beautification act's rules restricted speech, and further said it could not sever the state's sign rules apart based on content, striking down the heart of the billboard and sign bans that supporters say have kept Texas highways mostly free of clutter and distracting ads.
In asking the court to reconsider, Deputy Solicitor General Matthew Frederick's motion argues the court delivered too broad a solution.
“A ban on regulation of commercial speech goes beyond the controversy in this case,” Frederick wrote.
Texas motion in Auspro v. TxDOT by dugbegley on Scribd
Similar arguments were advanced by supporters of the ban, who urged the court to uphold bans on advertising and not rely on state lawmakers to revise the beautification act from scratch. Because of the upcoming elections and restart of the legislative session in January, it could be six to nine months before new laws are passed.
“In the interim, there may be little or no restriction on billboards along major highways, at least within the jurisdictional boundaries of this court,” Brister wrote.
Auspro's lawyer, Meredith Parenti, however, said in a statement it's not the court's place to write law, as TxDOT is asking it to do in part by separating political from commercial speech.
“This is a job for the Legislature, not the judiciary,” Parenti said. “The Supreme Court did not rewrite the sign code … to limit it to commercial billboards, and this court should not do so either.”
There is no timeline for the appeals court to consider the state's request.
“Although motions for rehearing are traditionally long odds efforts, we are extremely pleased with both the motion and our brief and are convinced that we have presented a compelling case,” said Anne Culver, executive vice-president of Scenic Texas.
Investors are pouring serious amounts of green into Sweetgreen – but is the food worth it? Hollis Johnson Fast-food is getting healthier, fast - and legacy chains are getting left in the dust.
The likes of LYFE Kitchen, Freshii, and Sweetgreen have introduced the concept of healthy meals to the fast-food industry, leaving iconic chains struggling on how to compete.
Washington, DC-based salad chain Sweetgreen is one of the leaders of the growing farm-to-table fast-food movement.
With the company's marketing espousing sustainability, local suppliers, and healthy menu items, the chain has captured the imagination of health-conscious urbanites who are wary of what they eat.
And it seems the chain has captured the attention of investors as well, raking in $35 million in funding for this year's third quarter.
Three Georgetown grads started Sweetgreen in 2007, and it has exploded to 31 restaurants across the country with more on the way.
I've heard stories of the famous lines stretching outside at the New York City Sweetgreen locations, so I had to find out for myself if this chain deserves its organic cult status.
Congresswoman Corrine Brown Files Federal Lawsuit to Protect Florida Voters
(Washington, DC) Congresswoman Corrine Brown, along with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference-Jacksonville chapter, several individual Duval residents, and the Duval County Democratic Executive Committee, will file a federal civil rights lawsuit to ensure that unconstitutional and discriminatory changes to the early voting laws are not implemented.
The August primaries will be the first time Florida is affected by the changes to early voting, which were passed by the state legislature last session. Early voting was instituted after the debacle of the 2000 elections when thousands were turned away from overcrowded polls. Since 2004, Floridians have had access to the polls for eight hours a day, for fifteen days right up until the last Sunday before election-day. The new law reduced early voting to ten days, gave county supervisors arbitrary discretion over the number of hours polls are open, and eliminated voting on the last Sunday.
The lawsuit asks the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida in Jacksonville to enjoin the Florida Secretary of State and Duval County Supervisor of Elections from enforcing the discriminatory and arbitrary changes to early voting in the state of Florida and in Duval County. Specifically, these changes violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States constitution, Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C. and 1973 (a) and the Florida constitution.
â€œEarly voting has worked extremely well for all Floridians and especially for African American voters,â€ said Congresswoman Brown. â€œIn fact, more than any other racial or ethnic group, African Americans have come to rely on early voting.â€
According to Dr. Daniel A. Smith, Professor of Political Science and Research Professor at The University of Florida, in the 2008 general election, African Americans cast 22% percent of the total early vote, even though blacks comprised just 13% of the stateâ€™s registered voters. More African Americans vote during the early voting period than on election-day or via absentee ballot combined. Perhaps most strikingly, in 2008, African Americans accounted for roughly 34% of votes cast on the Sunday before the election. These trends are amplified in Duval County where 58% of African Americans voted early in 2008. In last yearâ€™s local elections, African Americans cast roughly 34% of the early votes, even though they comprised less than 30% of the electorate, and on the final Sunday of early voting, more African Americans came to the polls than did whites.
â€œThere is absolutely no explanation for restricting early voting other than intentional voter suppression. In fact, it seems that Governor Scott simply does not want people to vote. We should be making it easier for people to get to the polls, not harder,â€ the Congresswoman declared.
â€œIt is particularly fitting that I am filing this lawsuit at The John Milton Bryan Simpson United States Courthouse,â€ Congresswoman Brown pointed out. â€œI sponsored the bill that named this courthouse for Judge Simpson because they were a giant in the civil rights movement here in Jacksonville. Among other things, their orders led to the passage of the Civil Rights Act, and desegregated the schools, city pools, city golf courses, and the city zoo. I know Judge Simpson would not stand for such a blatant attempt to exclude African Americans from the polls.â€
I am an 18-year-old writer going to college in Vermont. I am currently experimenting with shorter forms of nonfiction and poetry, but one day plan to write and publish a memoir. My heart and love for life are at the core of all my work.

The progress made in cutting death and injury on the roads has varied dramatically across the UK over the past five years
While the general trend has been downwards this has masked big national and regional variations.
Compared with the 2005-9 average (the government's baseline for monitoring progress) by 2013 there had been the following reductions in the number of people killed or seriously injured:
London -36%
Northern Ireland -35%
Scotland -33%
UK AVERAGE -23%
England (excluding London) -19%
Wales -15%
While highlighting the dramatic differences between areas, the figures hide a flattening out of the overall downward trend with the most dramatic casualty reduction in this period seen in 2010.
While car occupant safety has improved markedly, the situation amongst vulnerable road users (pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists) has been less good. Although deaths in this group have declined they are now a larger proportion of all road deaths, rising from 46% in 2005-9 to 49% in 2013. The absolute number of cyclists seriously injured has risen.
The figures are revealed in an interim report Road Safety Since 2010 published by the RAC Foundation and PACTS, and compiled by PACTS and Road Safety Analysis. The final report will be published in the summer after the 2014 casualty data has been released.
Researchers based their work on official casualty data, as well as surveys and interviews with stakeholders including 34 English local authorities.
The report shows just how varied road safety policy has become across the UK since 2010:
Northern Ireland: Road safety is a fully devolved matter. The Road Safety Strategy to 2020 contains 222 actions and aims for NI's roads to “be as safe for all road users as anywhere in the world”.
Scotland: road safety is not fully devolved but Holyrood has powers to set national speed limits and the drink drive limit (this was reduced from 80mg/100ml to 50mg/100ml in December 2014)
Wales. Very few road safety powers devolved to Cardiff Bay, but funding comes from the Welsh Government
London. Road safety is a priority for the Greater London Authority and the capital has call on significant funds
Road casualty trends are not just influenced by policy decisions: external factors such as traffic volumes and travel trends also play a part. For example, fewer car miles were driven (and at lower speeds) during the recession, while the number of cyclists has risen.
Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said:
“The UK risks breaking apart in terms of road safety policy with different administrations having varying levels of power, funding and political will to deal with death and injury on the highways.
“Overall, many fewer people were killed and injured on the roads at the end of the last Westminster parliament than at the beginning. But given the flattening out of casualty figures, a probable increase in casualties in 2014 and a predicted increase in road traffic, it is important that national, regional and local governments review these trends, and share best practice learning what is, and what isn't, working around.
“Tens of millions of road users have a right to know that that their safety is regarded equally wherever in the UK they travel. They would also expect similar rules to apply whichever side of a border they are on.
“The last Westminster government was hemmed in by economic constraints which extended to road safety. It also decided against setting national road safety targets arguing they were bureaucratic and ignored local priorities. However many of the professionals interviewed for this report say the lack of targets has pushed road safety down the priority list.
“We would like to see more cross-departmental interest in road safety. At Westminster road safety has traditionally been a matter for the Department for Transport but other departments have crucial roles including the Home Office for roads policing and type-approval of breathalysers.
“Given that the NHS is left to pick up the pieces and much of the bill for crashes then health ministers should also be calling for the matter to rise up the political agenda.”

If you've ever wished to see the night sky as it's meant to be seen, head to the Smokies this weekend!
The Great Smoky Mountains National Park is working with the Smoky Mountains Astronomical Society this weekend to bring its stargazing program back to Cades Cove.
The event will begin Saturday, Sept. 23 at 7:30 p.m. and will have experienced astronomers on site with numerous telescopes to provide people with an amazing view of the night sky unobstructed by artificial light.
If there are cloudy skies or rain in the forecast, the park said it will have to cancel the program. The good news is that there is plenty of sunshine predicted for the rest of the week into Sunday, so that hopefully won't be a problem. If things are looking iffy, people can call (865) 448-4104 on the day of the event to verify if it's still happening or not.
Park Ranger Mike Maslona said the event is a great opportunity for people to experience the night sky to see things with the naked eye that are otherwise drowned out by city lights.
"People will be amazed at the vast depths of this planetary world and all that they can see in the complete darkness," Maslona said. "This program mixes astronomy, legends, and the beauty of the stars to create a worthwhile exploration into the wonders of the heavens.”
People wanting to attend should show up Saturday at the orientation shelter at the entrance of the Cades Cove Loop Road. A park ranger will walk with the group one-third of a mile to a nearby field to the viewing location and no vehicles will be allowed to drive to the site.
People should also dress warm and bring a flashlight. Brining a lawn chair or blanket for sitting as well as binoculars would also be a good idea! Carpooling is strongly encouraged.
Target sued, accused of dumping toxic waste
California Attorney General Jerry Brown, 20 counties and the city of Los Angeles on Monday sued retail giant Target Corp. for illegally dumping bleach, paints, oven cleaners and other toxic materials into the state's landfills.
The complaint, filed in Alameda County Superior Court, claims the Minneapolis-based chain's 200 California stores improperly disposed of damaged, returned and past-due chemicals, resulting in more than 300 notices of violations from local environmental health inspectors over the last eight years.
In one 2008 incident, the suit claims, an employee at a San Joaquin County Target told county inspectors that the store routinely dumped hazardous substances, including pesticides, into the facility's trash compactor.
The suit seeks damages of $25,000 per violation and for Target stores to comply with California's hazardous waste codes. Attorneys for five Bay Area counties - Alameda, Contra Costa, San Mateo, Santa Clara and Solano - signed on to the complaint.
"It's an issue of how these big companies deal with what is essentially hazardous waste - they can't just throw it in the trash," said Scott Gerber, spokesperson for the California Department of Justice. "This state has laws about how these wastes are dealt with, and this company has not been following these laws."
Under California codes, hazardous waste must be disposed of using a licensed hazardous waste hauler who transports it to a specified hazardous waste facility.
Target released a statement saying it is "disappointed" in the complaint after the company participated in talks with state and local attorneys and provided access to its California stores and distribution centers over the last three years.
"We continue to believe that further review of our practices will lead to the conclusion that our program not only meets but surpasses the requirements of California law," the statement said.
Target is not the only big retailer that California attorneys have accused of illegally dumping noxious chemicals into local landfills.
The attorney general's office also announced Monday that it had reached an $8.65 million settlement with Kmart over similar charges. Officials said investigation found that Kmart had failed to account for most of the hazardous waste it generated between 2002 and 2007.

MADISON – State Rep. Josh Zepnick has a “D” behind their name, but he's no longer meeting with Democrats in the Assembly in the face of calls for their resignation for allegedly kissing two women without their consent.
“Rep. Zepnick is no longer caucusing with us,” Assembly Minority Leader Gordon Hintz (D-Oshkosh) said.
Zepnick, of Milwaukee, said Wednesday the decision was theirs and that it applied only to closed-door caucus meetings. Attending the open caucus meetings would allow them to get briefings from the Legislative Fiscal Bureau and other nonpartisan agencies.
Hintz would not say if the decision was made by them or Zepnick, other than to say “we came to that agreement” in a series of near-daily talks.
Hintz signaled they would not seek to remove Zepnick from the Assembly, saying they and other Democrats are focused on other issues.
Hintz and other Democrats this month called on Zepnick to step down after the Capital Times detailed the accounts of two unnamed women who said Zepnick kissed them without their consent at political events in 2011 and 2015.
Zepnick has said they were drinking irresponsibly in those years, did not remember the incidents and was apologizing to the women. They have said they got sober after a 2015 drunken driving arrest and conviction.
They have declined to step down and has said they won't decide until later whether to run for re-election next year.

RELATED: Wisconsin Rep. Josh Zepnick accused of drunkenly kissing two women at political events
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) this month removed Zepnick from all legislative committees at the request of Hintz.
Hintz indicated they would not attempt to have Zepnick pushed out of the Assembly.
“We've taken action,” Hintz said. “We've asked them to resign. I've used the tools available to me. At some point, I think it's up to the voters and so I think that's where we are.”
Similarly, Vos said they did not want to convene proceedings to remove Zepnick from the Assembly. They noted voters could try to recall them if they don't want them representing them.
"So why should I say that we're going to take the place of the voters, of the people who they represent," Vos said. "So I think that's the process that's most appropriate. And, hey, if Democrats want to launch a recall drive of one of their own, more power to them."

Slender: The Eight Pages (formerly called Slender) is a freeware indie-developed first-person survival horror video game released in June 2012 as a beta for Microsoft Windows and OS X, using the Unity engine. Developed by Mark J. Hadley, the game is based on the quasi-folklore meme figure known as the Slender Man, who is depicted as a tall man wearing all black with a white face with no facial features. The character is known for the ominous (although fictitious) abduction of countless children in dark mysterious settings, such as deep forests and abandoned buildings.
Gameplay [ edit ]
Slender: The Eight Pages is set in the middle of a dense forest during the middle of the night, and is played from a first-person perspective. The player's objective is to collect all eight pages located in various areas of the forest while avoiding the Slender Man. As the player collects pages, the fog in the forest grows thicker, and Slender Man appears closer to the player's character, though the character's sprinting speed slowly increases as well. Slender Man moves by teleporting, creeping around the player, but only from a certain distance. The player is equipped with only a flashlight to see through the dark (its battery life is limited and will eventually shut down permanently if left on for an extended period of time). The player's character has the ability to "jog", which will eventually tire out the player and make their wheeze if forced to go on for too long. Slender Man will occasionally appear in the player's field of vision, accompanied with a loud piano slamming noise and/or static on the screen. This then allows the ability to "sprint" to become available to the player. "Sprinting" allows the player to move faster than "jogging" does, but will also decrease the maximum stamina available for "jogging" and "sprinting". A game over occurs when either the player has taken too long to find a note, the player stares at Slender Man for too long, or if Slender Man comes into contact with the player, which will turn them around and end the game. The game over screen shows Slender Man's face up close and blinking static pulses.[1]
Even if the player's character successfully collects all the eight pages, the Slender Man will continue to chase them. Once all the pages are collected, one is allowed to walk around for a couple of seconds in total silence until Slender Man finally appears behind the player and ends the game, however instead of the normal death screen appearing, a slightly different version is played in which the static slowly fades out instead of abruptly stopping. A few moments later the player awakens in the forest, now in the daytime, and can move around for a few seconds before the screen goes black and plays the end credits. New game modes are then unlocked. There is also a grace period in the very beginning of the game, during which Slender Man remains inactive for only a few minutes, or until the player collects the first page. However, the difficulty level increases the longer one goes without collecting any pages. The end of this grace period is indicated by a repetitive stomping sound echoing in the background. This sound is heard throughout the rest of the game, and gradually gets quicker than more pages are collected, as well as several other layering sounds. These sounds include a low droning sound (pages 3–4), a loud wind (pages 5–6), and then a mysterious and unnerving beeping sound (page 7). Once all 8 pages are collected, the sounds abruptly fade into silence.[2]
Game modes [ edit ]
In Version 0.9.4 there is a "Daytime Mode" that can be unlocked. To unlock this mode, the player must beat the game on "Normal", in which the ending shows the player's character awaken in the daytime after collecting all eight pages and being caught by Slender Man. [3] After waking up, the player can walk around in the daytime for a few seconds before the credits roll. "Daytime Mode" is simply during the day and without a flashlight. If the player beats "Daytime Mode" the ending will be the same as before, only the player wakes up at night. After the credits roll, the player will have unlocked "$20 Mode". In this mode, gameplay is the same as "Normal Mode", except that if the player sees Slender Man a song called "20 Dollars" by American rap artist Ron Browz starts playing. This is a reference to a fan-originated meme about Slender Man, stating that if a person gives Slender Man $20, they will leave the person alone. This is the only version in which the Player selects these modes in the "Options" portion of the menu screen, and this is also the only version in which two hidden modes can be played at the same time ("Daytime Mode" and "$20 Mode"). There is also a "MH (Marble Hornets) Mode", viewing the gameplay as a 'Marble Hornets' entry. The creepy sounds and page collector have been removed, there are static bars on the edges, and the ending is slightly different. The "$20 Mode" has been absent since version 0.9.7; The accompanying readme advises "One game mode removed - it was only a matter of time as it contained copyrighted material", referring to the Brownz track that's used in that mode.
Changes from versions [ edit ]
The game was first released in version 0.9.0 as Slender. Originally, when the player would be caught by the Slender Man, the game would quit and return to the desktop. It remained this way until version 0.9.3 (the third update), and the player now has the option to either try again or to quit. From version 0.9.7 on, there is an ambiance during the menu screen, as well as portions of the eight pages being shown. There are also now links to the Slender Man Mythos Forums and some popular web series based on the Mythos such as the 'Marble Hornets' and the 'TribeTwelve'. As of this version, the game was officially renamed Slender: The Eight Pages to avoid confusion with future versions such as Slender: The Arrival. "$20 Mode" has also been removed from this version because of Copyright issues. "MH Mode" has been renamed to "Marble Hornets Mode" (simply the unabbreviated version of the title). Two new light sources are available: a glow stick with almost no light, and almost no range at all, and a crank lantern with a wide range, but a short amount of light which must be replenished by cranking the lantern. The player can now also pause the game by pressing "Escape" on the keyboard, but only when there is no static on the screen as to not allow the player to quit in response to being frightened.[4]
The game is now given a backstory in its sequel; Slender: The Arrival. It was confirmed that the name of the character controlled in this game is Kate, also known as The Chaser in The Arrival.
Reception [ edit ]
Some publications noted the effectiveness of the game's minimalist horror approach, contrasting it with much action-based survival horror games of the time period, such as the latest Resident Evil titles.[5] The official website crashed after too many people tried to download the game, leading to subsequent mirror downloads on Reddit and later MediaFire.[6][7]
Sequel [ edit ]
A sequel to the game called Slender: The Arrival was released on March 26, 2013 to positive reviews.
AFC Cup 2019 Qualifiers: Qualification scenarios for India after match-day four ties against Macau
Goal takes you through the various permutations and combinations for India's AFC Cup 2019 qualification......
Stephen Constantine and their Men in Blue get ready to welcome Macau in the fourth match-day of the AFC Cup 2019 qualifiers on October 11.
had beaten Macau 2-0 in the away-leg during match-day three and will be confident of securing the three points once again to keep their perfect record in the qualifiers alive.
Given below is how the current table stands after match-day three results. It has to be borne in mind that the match between the other two teams in the group – Myanmar and the Kyrgyz Republic, was postponed and the rescheduled date for the fixture is yet to be announced.
The rules for qualification designate that the top two teams from the group will secure their tickets to the final stage in 2019. If two or more teams end up level on points after the completion of all matches, below is a winner will be decided in order of sequence.
Points in head-to-head matches among tied teams; Goal difference in head-to-head matches among tied teams; Goals scored in head-to-head matches among tied teams; Away goals scored in head-to-head matches among tied teams;
If more than two teams are tied, and after applying criteria one to four, a subset of teams is still tied, criteria 1 to 4 are reapplied exclusively to this subset of teams. In case those criterias still fail to divide the teams, then they will be separated as follow:-
Goal difference in all group matches; Goals scored in all group matches; Penalty shoot-out if only two teams are tied and they met in the last round of the group; Disciplinary points (yellow card = 1 point, red card as a result of two yellow cards = 3 points, direct red card = 3 points, yellow card followed by direct red card = 4 points);
Scenario A and B
On match-day four, if beat Macau and Myanmar beat Kyrgyz Republic, then below is how the group table will look.
In this scenario, India will develop a nine point lead over the third-placed team in the fray, Kyrgyz Republic. Hence the Central Asians would need to win their three remaining games in hand while India would have to lose its remaining games for the Men in Blue to be in danger of missing out on the qualification.
Even then it would boil down to head and then goal difference to separate the three teams provided Myanmar wins two of its remaining games as the three would be locked on 12 points each.
Anything less than that, India will walk into the main draw in 2019.
The same is applicable for a scenario where Kyrgyz Republic beat Myanmar. In that case, Myanmar would need to win its three games in hand and the same permutations would apply.
Therefore, this combination puts India with one foot in the main-draw with only a perfect storm of results going the other way preventing qualification for Constantine's men.
Scenario C
On match-day four, if India beat Macau while Kyrgyz Republic and Myanmar draw their match, then below is how the group table will look.
In this scenario, India will develop an eight-point lead over the second and third placed teams who would be tied on 4 points each.
This is the perfect scenario for India, as only one of Myanmar or Kyrgyz Republic will be able to overhaul their tally of 12 points. Since Myanmar and Kyrgyz Republic play each other once again, only one team can achieve a maximum of nine points in their remaining three games.
Whatever the result of the postponed game, points will be dropped by one team or both and hence, India, in the worst case scenario, will be overhauled by only one team.
Therefore this remains the best case scenario for Constantine's men as it guarantees qualification.
Scenario D and E
On match-day four, if India draw with Macau and Myanmar beats Kyrgyz Republic, then below is how the group table will look.
In this scenario, India would have a seven-point lead over the third placed team, Kyrgyz Republic. With three matches in hand, the Central Asians can cover up that game with three wins or two wins and a draw provide India lose their remaining fixtures.
There are chances of India missing out on qualification, even the odds are slim as it requires Constantine's men to slip up in their last two games.
In case India draw and Kyrgyz Republic beat Myanmar, the same permutations as above will arise.
Therefore, this remains a less than ideal but still manageable scenario for India to secure their qualification.
Article continues below
Scenario F
If India does manage to lose to Macau against all odds, then the qualification scenario obviously gets more complicated for Constantine's men as the other two teams will have three games in hand and once again a combination of results going against them which could yet see them miss out on the plane to . This is how the table will look if India lost to Macau and Myanmar won against Kyrgyzstan. It will be the same if Kyrgyzstan won against Myanmar as well.
In conclusion, India remains in a very strong position to qualify with their perfect performance so far and another victory on October 11 will all but seal their route to the 24-team team main event in 2019.
Q: Ab . . . so . . . lute . . . ly, everyone should be available for a trade. -- William.
A: I to . . tal . . . ly agree -- if a trade produces a net gain. There is no Dwyane Wade on this roster, no untouchable as a franchise anchor. Hassan Whiteside hasn't proven that yet. Goran Dragic comes up a bit short of franchise-player designation, as shown with the contract they signed in the 2015 offseason. And Justise Winslow remains more prospect than proven. So you bet Pat Riley would be open to listening to any and all pitches. And also would be open to casting a net for players who might shake free because of issues at their current locations. Look, there was a point when Glen Rice looked like a franchise player. Then Alonzo Mourning came on the market. Then everything changed. As in 1995, the Heat and Pat Riley are at a stage now where they have to be open to anything and everything.
Q: I really like James Johnson's attitude and energy they bring. I hope the Heat will be able to keep him. Ira, what are our chances of re-signing him? -- Carl, Kapaa, Hawaii.
A: Much of that decision will come down to how the Heat structure their makeover. If the play is to maximize every last salary-cap dollar for free agency, then I would have to figure that James will be squeezed out, the Heat unlikely to put aside $8 million in something close to mid-level money. And with coaches such as Doc Rivers praising Johnson for their play to this point, I'm not sure that their free-agency reach might not even exceed such an amount. As with many players who have found their ultimate comfort zone with the Heat, money still talks. It is why, after similar good-will experiences with the Heat, Luol Deng and Joe Johnson moved on this past summer. The NBA's economics still start with your elite players. After that, it comes down to complementary players being amenable to salary fits.
Q: Hi, Ira. I saw that Pat Riley was at the N.C. State game against Miami. And I was wondering if they were there to get a good look at Dennis Smith Jr.? -- Timo, Germany.
A: Yes, they also have already put in their Lonzo Ball time, as well. What the Heat scouting staff attempts is to put together a scouting schedule that gets Riley in front of the leading draft prospects in the most competitive situations. You will be seeing, I suspect, plenty of those Riley-in-the-stands photos in coming months, and perhaps not as much of Riley across from the Heat bench at home games.

AJ: Provide for the readers your background in politics and activism, specifically ballot access.
Phil: I've been involved in the Green Party since 2000. I was Co-Chair of the Green National Committee from 2007-2009, and I've been Chair of the Illinois Green Party since 2008, in addition to a bunch of other committee hats.
The national party established a separate Ballot Access Committee in 2005 and I've been one of the two co-chairs of that since its inception. In that role I've also been the Green Party's member on the board of the Coalition for Free and Open Elections, Richard Winger's ballot access rights organization.
AJ: Could you explain what ballot access is, and why this is important for political parties. Particularly important for third parties?

Phil: Ballot access generally refers to the ability to place a candidate on an official election ballot. It is usually thought of it in terms of a party's ability to run candidates for public office. If a party does not have ballot access in a particular state, that means that it cannot field candidates for office in that state.
Ballot access laws are almost entirely state creations. There are almost no relevant federal laws, and there usually aren't relevant local laws either. The rules vary widely from state to state. In Mississippi, if you declare you have a party, the state says, okay, you're a party, and then you can run candidates. In North Carolina, you have to collect about 95,000 valid signatures from registered voters. For reference, the Libertarians did this for the 2008 election, but it cost them $200,000 to do it.
There is also a distinction between “securing” and “holding” ballot access. “Securing” means getting ballot access initially, which usually requires collecting petition signatures. “Holding” means that a party in a given state can maintain their ballot access from one election to the next, which usually means that a candidate of the party got a high enough percentage of the vote. In some states, securing and/or holding are based on partisan registration numbers.
If a party doesn't have ballot access, it can't run candidates. If a party can't run candidates, it's essentially not a party at all, just a political club. Third parties often refer to fighting to achieve lofty ballot access hurdles as a struggle for their very existence.
One other point which should be stressed: it is very common for a state-level party to expend more energy just to get onto the ballot than they expend on behalf of their candidates once they're on the ballot. It can be such grueling, exhaustive work just to come into legal existence that it will burn out volunteers months before Election Day.
AJ: What is the current status for ballot access for the Green Party?
Phil: As of today, we have presidential ballot access in 21 states. For the beginning of May, that's actually pretty good. In a lot of states, ballot access is lost and regained with each election cycle, so you wouldn't expect to be much higher than 20 at this point in the year.
The best the Green Party ever did was 44 ballot lines in 2000. Our goal is to reach 45 or more line this year. It takes better advance planning, and it takes the party understanding that you can't backload all of the work. It remains to be seen if the party has gotten the memo on this.
AJ: There are law restrictions for third parties in order to run for office. From your experience, have these laws increased over time or are these laws just reactionary when specific third parties do well in their respective state?
Phil: In the late 19th Century these kinds of restrictions didn't really exist at all, so if you look at the big picture, the laws have only gotten worse over time. One of the ironies is that these laws only started to come into existence in parallel with the emergence of the partisan primary, a Progressive Era reform designed to mitigate the control of the old political machines. As the primaries emerged, it created a perceived need to define who could or couldn't have a primary, and so by extension, who would or wouldn't be legally considered a party.
If you just look across the last decade, you'll find a mixed bag. Here in Illinois, the requirements just keep getting worse. The state
is under the firm control of a machine kingpin named Michael Madigan, who has been Speaker of the House for 28 of the last 30 years. A lot of the changes have been subtle but when there are already absurdly difficult laws on the books, each small change can have a multiplicative effect.
In some states, it's gotten easier. Part of this, I think, is just cyclical, and does have to do with the relative strength of third parties in those areas. Part of it just seems to be random. Often it just takes one person ascending to a role of prominence in the state
legislature to generate a lot of legislation which could be good or bad for ballot access.
But on the whole the situation is worse, because of the emergence of the so-called “Top Two” system, which is now in place in Washington and California. “Top Two” has been presented as a “reform” which will supposedly tend to lead to more “moderate” candidates on the general election ballot. In reality “Top Two” is a ploy on the part of moneyed interests to further control the ballot. Instead of partisan primaries followed by a general election, all candidates are lumped together on a single primary ballot, and the two candidates with the highest vote totals advance to the general election. A lot of people have been duped by this because they've wanted a “blanket primary” where they can vote for whomever they want, but the effective – and intended – result of “Top Two” is to make it so that the most heavily bankrolled candidates have an even bigger primary advantage. One intention side effect of “Top Two” is that third party candidates almost never make it onto the general election ballot. It's telling that even the Democratic and Republican Parties in Washington and California opposed “Top Two”. Money is so out of control in politics that the state-level corporate parties are often _more_ democratic in their processes than processes which just rely on who can bring in the most money.
AJ: If you were the head of a board of elections, what ideal things would you implement in order to make ballot access more fair for candidates?
Phil: A lot of the elections agencies have little control over the laws. That said, what I'd like to see from election agencies all across the country is a dedication to extreme transparency in how they do their jobs. If you look at the websites of various state election agencies, some have excellent information about what it takes to run for office, and some provide almost no useful information at all. It shouldn't be so hard to run for office, and even in a state with draconian laws, elections agencies should be striving to make information as simple and accessible as possible.
AJ: Do you think there are individuals in the two major parties that are really out to get third parties and independent candidates, or is that more paranoia?
Phil: The corporate duopoly by its very nature is out to get third parties and independent candidates. I don't think it's personal most of the time, or at least, it's no more personal than politics would generally be.
2012 is a redistricting year, and Illinois is a prime example of the politics of redistricting. Illinois lost one congressional seat (from
19 to 18). In theory this would mean that two incumbents would have to run against one another. But in practice, the Democrats who control Springfield created a map where every Democratic incumbent was given a safe district, four Republican incumbents were thrown into two districts so two of them would for sure be knocked out in the primary, and a district got invented out of thin air with no incumbent, designed for a new Democrat to take over. Even two Green Party candidates who ran for Congress in 2010 were drawn four blocks or fewer outside of their old districts.
Modern politics is largely about eliminating competition. “The Powers That Be” in state legislatures are not much different from the robber barons of 110-120 years ago. Not only do incumbents want to stay incumbents, they don't even want to have to run against anyone. They don't want to have to show up for political forums and be asked tough questions. A lot of these people have no sense of responsibility to their constituents – they just see their positions as jobs that they were given through friends or family.
AJ: What have been interesting experiences you have had when working with a specific state to get Greens on the ballot?
Phil: One of the more puzzling challenges we've encountered is that of it being really hard for a state party to get on the ballot, but once they do, it's astonishingly easy for a random individual to declare themselves to be a Green and become a candidate of the party, even for high-level office.
In 2008, we had an individual widely known to be a neo-Nazi try and run for Congress as a Green. We had to file an objection against their nominating petitions to get them thrown off the ballot. They came back around in 2010, and filed in a district they didn't even live in, and we had to file another objection. The party had no real say in these situations. The objections were based on the paperwork, not on the individual not being an actual Green. Since these were offices where we otherwise hadn't intended to field candidates, if they had gotten on the ballot, they would have de facto won the primaries, and it could have been extremely embarrassing for us.
One problem which has plagued state Green Parties for a long time is that they become real political parties with legal rights and privileges, but their leadership still thinks primarily in terms of the party being identified by its position on political issues. In the eyes of most voters, a party is defined by its candidates, not by whatever lengthy platform document it may be able to offer. This means in turn that a state party needs to have people with administrative and legal prowess in particular positions, to help make sure that the party is staying compliant with various legal requirements, and to help make sure that candidates who can properly represent the party get assistance with getting on the ballot, while candidates who have nothing to do with the party don't get such assistance. For a party like ours, where a lot of people who come to us have an inherent distrust of power, and who often aren't very good at administrative matters, it can be that much harder to deal with state laws and administrative policies.
AJ: Where can someone learn more about ballot access?
Phil: The national Green Party is tracking 2012 presidential ballot access at: www.gp.org/2012
Cleveland Municipal Court Judge Angela Stokes -- who's been under investigation for allegations that they abused court staff, lawyers and defendants -- will no longer hear criminal cases beginning Monday.
The municipal court's administrative judge, Ronald Adrine, made the decision Friday, according to court papers. The move follows continuing complaints about Stokes' behavior and a dramatic decision by the Cuyahoga County Public Defender's to seek a motion to transfer cases -- and its lawyers -- from their courtroom. The public defender's municipal division represents indigent clients charged with such things as petty theft, assault, DUI, domestic violence and driving under suspension.
Adrine will handle Stokes' current cases (visiting Judge Mabel Jasper will help with the case load next week). Future criminal cases that would have normally been assigned to Stokes will be divided among the court's 11 other judges who handle similar dockets. These cases will boost each judge's workload by about 8 percent.
Stokes will continue to be assigned civil cases, which include small claims, and they will continue to review civil cases handled by magistrates. Civil cases represent only a small fraction of a municipal court judge's docket.
In October, the Supreme Court of Ohio's Office of Disciplinary Counsel filed a lengthy complaint against Stokes. The 49-page complaint charges they abuse court resources, lawyers, court staff and defendants who appear before them The complaint is based in part on 337 incident reports filed in municipal court against Stokes. The complaint recommends to the Ohio Supreme Court's Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline that Stokes be ordered to undergo a psychiatric examination because they may be "suffering from a mental illness that substantially impairs their ability to perform their duties as a judicial officer."
In December, Stokes denied virtually every charge against them in a response filed with the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline.
The complaint does not force Stokes to step down. It represents the first step in Supreme Court of Ohio's process of evaluating the judge for discipline.
But Adrine took action to stop them from hearing criminal cases because Stokes has continued to draw complaints in municipal court, according to their court order signed Friday. Since the Disciplinary Counsel presented its complaint, the municipal court has received an additional 100 incident reports against Stokes, the order says. Stokes is barred from hearing criminal cases until the Supreme Court of Ohio makes its decision.
The Plain Dealer has previously documented complaints about Stokes that mirror those detailed in the Disciplinary Counsel's complaint. The Plain Dealer, for instance, has shown that their courtroom moves too slowly, keeping defendants, lawyers, police and witnesses waiting, which costs the city money. They can't get along with court workers. More than 25 bailiffs have worked for them — so many that the court's administrative judge at one time banned them from hiring any more. She's also made unsubstantiated complaints about court workers. And, in the past, they ordered an excessive number of drug, alcohol and psychiatric tests for defendants.
Stokes has not reacted yet to the Friday's decision. But in a brief interview with the Northeast Ohio Media Group, they said they planned to issue a statement shortly.
The New York Times opined Thursday that Sen. Bernie Sanders has the right idea on immigration, and that most Republicans support a plan that gone "well beyond the usual nativist bigotry."
"Republican presidential candidates are arguing, in all seriousness, about sealing the border with fantastical 2,000-mile fences and weaponized drones; merging state, local and federal authorities and private prisons into one all-seeing immigration police state; forcibly registering American Muslims; mass-deporting 11 million Mexicans and others in a 21st century Trail of Tears; and turning away thousands of refugees fleeing war and terrorism in the Middle East," the Times said.
The paper cheered Sanders this week for offering a plan that "turns away from the insanity."
Sanders said they would rely on executive actions to give relief to illegal immigrants, and would push for a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants after five years. The Times said this plan "affirms the humane and sensible principle" that those illegally in the U.S. should "stay and contribute."
Sanders also said they would try to boost federal border agents, in exchange for pulling state and local police off the mission of enforcing federal laws.
The Times supported Sanders' call to support sanctuary cities, which the paper said "protect public safety" by "building trust between immigrant communities and local law enforcement." Many Republicans and even some Democrats have said San Francisco's sanctuary city policy led to the death of Kate Steinle, when a formerly deported immigrant shot and killed them this year.
The editorial concluded by saying GOP candidates are "filling the air with lies and irrational promises" to get elected.
Kickstarted to the tune of $8.5 million, the Ouya console is one of crowdfunding's high-profile success stories. Depending on who you listen to, it's also the system to pull the rug from beneath Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo and forever shake up the video game industry as we know it. It liberates players, empowers developers and creates a brave new world for interactive entertainment - or so we're told, at least. The hyperbole that has been written about Ouya would make the most seasoned spin doctor blush, but before you allow yourself to become too swept up in the hype, it's worth remembering that when all is said and done, Ouya is just Android in a set-top box - and we've already spoken about how potentially disappointing that particular reality could be.
Cutting through the rabid anticipation, Ouya does have a lot going for it. The console has been designed by Yves Béhar, it has a dedicated gaming-focused controller and is powered by Nvidia's Tegra 3 chipset - and to cap it all off, it will retail for a penny less than £100 when it launches in the UK later this month. In the US, it's a snip at $99. If Android is ever going to claim a place underneath your 50-inch LCD, this is surely its best chance - but does Ouya really pose a legitimate challenge to your PS3 and Xbox 360? Answering that question is predictably difficult at this early stage in the system's life, but we'll give it a go regardless.
In purely physical terms, Ouya is small. The first thing likely to strike you when you open the packaging and remove the touching "Thank You" note inserted by the team behind the console is just how diminutive the system is. Compared to traditional gaming hardware, it's absolutely tiny, although at 300 grams it has a heft which makes it feel solid and expensive. Béhar's design is destined to divide opinion: the minimalist appearance ensures it doesn't stick out like a sore thumb when placed next to your Blu-ray player and surround system, but a little more pizazz wouldn't have gone amiss. Still, there's a subtle, almost understated beauty to the machine, thanks to its glossy black top and sand-blasted aluminium casing. Around the back, you'll find an array of ports and outputs. HDMI, USB, Micro USB, Ethernet and power cables all dock here.
Ouya specs Essentially an Android device without a screen, Ouya is based around Nvidia's ageing Tegra 3 chipset, featuring a 1.7GHz quad-core CPU and GeForce graphics processor, encased in a small, fan-cooled cube-like package. Retailing for just £99/$99, it's cheaper than your average entry-level Android handset, but lacks the same app and game support offered by other Android devices. Dimensions: 75mm x 75mm x 82mm

The controller is powered by two AA batteries, fitted behind metal panels which clip onto the main body of the pad via a set of magnets. The interface arrangement mimics that of the Xbox 360 controller, with the left-hand analogue stick raised slightly higher than the right-hand one in order to accommodate an eight-way digital pad. The face buttons adopt the now-standard diamond layout, and across the top there are four shoulder buttons - none of which offer analogue control, which could limit the machine's suitability for hardcore racing simulators and FPS titles. The middle of the controller has a small capacitive touchpad which acts as a mouse pointer and can be used to negotiate certain menus, but it's awkward to use and rarely provides the degree of accuracy you desire. Finally, there's the Ouya button, which can be held down to jump back to the main menu from any point. It's worth noting that by default, the Ouya is designed to run one application at a time - exiting back to the main menu will terminate the current game, so saving your progress is vital.
The Ouya pad's design certainly isn't unappealing, and it's comfortable to use. There are some minor niggles to contend with, however. The "O" button sticks slightly when pressed down hard, and while the analogue stick dead zone issues are mostly resolved, the sticks themselves are still rather heavy to use, making precise aiming rather a chore.
Because it's an Android device, adding peripherals to Ouya is blissfully easy. Bluetooth keyboards and mice can be paired with little fuss, making it much easier to input text and navigate menus. Additional Bluetooth gamepads can also be linked to the system, such as the official OnLive pad. OnLive is partnering with Ouya for the official launch, and while the unit we reviewed didn't have the app pre-installed (it's also absent from the Ouya store), we were able to sideload it onto the system and jump into a game of Batman: Arkham Asylum with the minimum of effort. By adding a USB hub, keyboard and mouse functionality is easily added and it's here that Ouya surprises as a pretty neat little browsing device - a world away from the world of hardship, endurance and woe encountered when using the Raspberry Pi.
"Ouya's OS is appealing and simple to use, but it is prone to some pretty awful lag when plenty of images are on-screen."
The Ouya is powered by Nvidia's Tegra 3 chipset, comprised of a 1.7GHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A9 CPU and a ULP Geforce GPU, all supported by just 1GB of RAM - around half the memory that most modern Android smartphones ship with. Tegra 3 was considered reasonably adept when Ouya was first announced, but with Tegra 4 already on the horizon, the console has effectively fallen foul of the smartphone world's breakneck pace of technological advancement. As a result, the performance of the system is acceptable rather than astonishing; the only benchmark we were able to successfully run was AnTuTu, which offered up a score of 13782 for the Ouya - well below the 23578 of the Samsung Galaxy S4, but better than the Galaxy S2, which achieved 10270 in the same test. Of course, it should always be remembered that Ouya costs around a fifth the price of your typical cutting-edge Android smartphone, so the comparison with the S4 isn't entirely fair, but the point is that in terms of overall 3D gaming power, the new console is already feeling dated and a year from now, it will be well behind the pace. It's not quite as power-efficient as we would have hoped for either - it consumes between 8-15W from the mains, depending on what it's doing.
Although Ouya is built around Google's Android OS, the UI is heavily skinned and it's only when you dig deep that the traditional "Halo" menu system appears. Upon firing up the console for the first time you are prompted to pair your controller, create an Ouya account and surrender your credit card details. The UI itself is divided into four key areas: Play (your library), Discover (the Ouya storefront), Make (accessing sideloaded apps and developer builds) and Manage (settings). The Discover section also contains a Sandbox area, where developers can upload pre-release editions of their games for other Ouya users to sample.
The console's online store offers a selection of games, all of which are free to download and play, thanks to the manufacturer's stipulation that all Ouya content offers gratis demos or free-to-play elements. For example, endless-runner Canabalt HD has a credit system which is renewed each day, with additional credits awarded for reaching 5000 metres in-game. Paying cash for the full version removes this limitation, as well as offering other bonuses, such as a different soundtrack and "classic" 2D visuals. It's a mechanic which means you can jump straight into the action and decide for yourself if a game is worthy of your cash, but there are issues here, too. There's no indication on the store listing page of how much each game costs - you only become notified at the point of purchase within the game itself. This is partly down to the fact that many of the games don't expect you to shell out for the full version once you've sampled the demo, because you're already playing the full version, and are expected to throw money at in-app purchases which grant more credit, items or time.
"With the UK launch just weeks away, Ouya really needs to step up its game - the lacklustre titles currently on offer simply aren't strong enough to carry a console launch."
At the time of writing, the Ouya storefront is rather lacking when compared to the likes of the iOS App Store and Google Play market - something which perhaps goes without saying, given the nascent nature of the hardware. Even so, it's disappointing that more titles aren't available, especially when you consider that during the system's Kickstarter campaign, the creators were mocking up store screens which showed everything from Shadowgun to Dead Trigger. The calibre of the current software line-up is patchy, to say the least; Final Fantasy III, Wizorb and The Bard's Tale rub shoulders with a range of throwaway mobile titles. While such games are acceptable smartphone time-wasters when you have a few minutes to kill, they feel hopelessly vacuous when experienced on a TV set.
In terms of raw graphical performance, it's impossible to shake the perception that Ouya is lagging behind the current crop of Android handsets. We tested a selection of games on the system, the most visually taxing being Real Racing 3, which we had to sideload (more on that later). The frame-rate was dire, and graphical glitches - such as missing textures and vanishing skies - further marred performance. Tegra-optimised titles should fare better, but none are available on the Ouya store at the time of writing - a bizarre omission when you consider how big a song and dance the Ouya team made about utilising Nvidia's tech. Other sideloaded efforts were more fruitful though - if this is something you're interested in pursuing, there are plenty of guides across the internet.
Much was made of the news that retro gaming emulators would be available on the Ouya store from day one, with critics pointing out that the system - which was supposed to be challenging companies like Nintendo - would allow users to illegally download and play classic SNES and N64 titles. At the time of writing, SNES9X, SuperGNES and Mupen64Plus are all available for download from the Ouya store, and more are likely to be released in the near future.
"Performance on 2D or 3D titles isn't exactly scintillating to say the least, even on some of the most simple games in the current line-up."
Performance analysis of a bunch of Ouya launch titles, kicking off with the Android port of Final Fantasy 3. Along with the dire Flashout 3D, it's one of a small number of titles to actually render at native 1080p.
Performance is decent enough, with SNES9X running at full-speed with no frameskip. All of the controls map to the appropriate buttons on the Ouya's gamepad, too. News that you can play ROMs on the console should come as little surprise to seasoned Android supporters - after all, the Google Play market is bursting with emulators for a wide range of old systems - but it does make you wonder if Nintendo might possibly turn litigious when it realises that Ouya is potentially stealing market share by offering the means to play games which are currently available for premium download on the Wii U Virtual Console.
Given the Ouya's Android pedigree, you may harbour hopes that your collection of previously-purchased apps and games will function on this device. That's sadly not the case, as Ouya currently doesn't support the Google Play market. While it's possible to sideload Android applications by downloading and installing apk files in the storage section of the settings menu, Ouya refuses to play ball with the official Google Play app. Being able to install the Amazon App Store and SlideMe market mitigates this problem somewhat, but neither offers the breadth and depth of support that Google's digital storefront does. This presents a very real issue for long-time Android supporters - with no Play store access, there's no way to download all the games and apps that you've already purchased on your phone or tablet. Given that some of these very same games will be released on the Ouya store in the future with little more than slight optimisation to accommodate the controller, buyers may face the situation of having to re-purchase content they already own. It seems odd to build a system around Android and then refuse to give consumers the option of leveraging their existing library of purchases.
Still, from a purely business perspective, such a move is understandable. The team behind Ouya want to generate revenue from sales made on the console, and to curate and highlight games which make the most of the hardware's unique features - all of the games available have been especially configured to use the controller, something which obviously wouldn't be the case with standard Android titles - in fact, most of the non-Ouya optimised games we sideloaded were unplayable with the console's controller, which illustrates the need for a dedicated store. For the time being, the ability to sideload apps provides a short-term tonic, but developer support will be vital in the run-up to Christmas.
Another application for Ouya is a media player - although at this stage, you'll need to go to additional efforts to get things working, as the system has no playback software of any kind, nor is any available on the Ouya market. Sideloading a media player - such as XBMC or Plex - is possible, and Netflix also works when installed in this manner - although the lack of optimisation results in unstable performance. XBMC was unbearably slow, but Plex playback was excellent and the app worked beautifully with our in-house Plex server. The only official video-based Ouya offering right now appears to be a twitch.tv player, which - perhaps unsurprisingly - is very similar indeed to the stock Android app. It'll do the job but it's really short on options, like a search or chat.
"Ouya's controller issues appear to have been improved over the earlier models, but the pad itself still doesn't quite feel right and the touchpad is overly sensitive."
Google has made small tweaks to Glass throughout the Explorer program, but today the company has announced a real spec bump. All Glass units shipping from now on will have 2GB of RAM instead of 1GB. There will also be a new viewfinder mode when taking pictures and some more cards. It's not all sunshine and lollipops, though. Current Glass Explorers should take a deep breath – Google won't be swapping out the old version for the new one.
The additional RAM will allow more Glassware apps to run in the background, which is good now that the catalog is starting to fill out a bit. Glassware apps should start up a bit faster as well. Glass can be sluggish in its current form, so this is a welcome improvement. It does sound like the device will still ship with the ancient TI OMAP processor, though. The new Glass units will have slightly larger batteries than launch units did, but that actually started with all units a few months ago (it's not unique to the new rev).
On the software side, Glass will now have a viewfinder frame to help you take better snapshots, as well as Google Now cards for remembering your parking spot and tracking packages. The cards actually rolled out on Android a few months ago. Presumably these features will come to original units too, but Google hasn't explained how updates are going to work on the less capable version. Maybe it's the end of the line?
Glass Explorers will probably be bummed about being stuck with the old hardware. This is especially true after Google already swapped out units last year for the version tweaked for use with prescription lenses. It was $1500, but Glass was always presented as a developer device. You can't be too upset, but I'm sure there will be Change.org petitions anyway.

UPDATE 4/7/2017 9:22AM PST: For 2014-2017 boxes that have a sticker on the side that includes the designation “WPM”, PCGS believes that these boxes, regardless of their serial number, originated in West Point. Therefore, at this time, and until we receive further clarification from the U.S. Mint, we will not be attributing such boxes to Philadelphia or San Francisco.
Acting upon the original documents provided to Coin World in response to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, Professional Coin Grading Service (PCGS) is pleased to announce that it will attribute certain 2014 through 2017 American Silver Eagles with a “mint mark” indicating where the coin was struck.
Officially, American Silver Eagles during this period were minted at the West Point Mint, and, in fact, most American Silver Eagles were struck at that branch.
However, due to high demand the U.S. Mint used the facilities in San Francisco and Philadelphia to augment the production of the West Point Mint.
Until now, the information about how many American Silver Eagles were made in each of the other branches has not been released to the public. Instead, the Mint's figures officially reflected the total mintage, and listed those mintages as having been produced at West Point.
But now, the FOIA documents reveal a method of identifying where a given box of Silver Eagles was minted. Following this method, PCGS will attribute coins from such boxes as having been produced at the branch mint at which it was made.
For example, a Silver Eagle minted in Philadelphia in 2015 would be attributed “2015-(P)”. The mintage figures, and how to identify them, are set forth in the tables below.
*As of March 20, 2017
Owners of Mint-sealed boxes of American Silver Eagles from 2014 to 2017 can find the box number, which is written in black marker, and determine the specific branch mint.
Contact Mark Stephenson (mark@collectors.com) or Daniel Kedem (dkedem@collectors.com) for more information on PCGS Bulk Services, including how to submit bulk quantities of 2014 to 2017 American Silver Eagles.

First and Second Week of Pregnancy
Congratulations! During these first two weeks, your body is preparing for possible conception.
How is pregnancy calculated?
Calculating the day your baby begins to develop and keeping track of your pregnancy dates can be a challenge. The development of pregnancy is counted from the first day of the woman's last normal menstrual period (LMP), even though the development of the fetus does not begin until conception, which is about two weeks later.
Pregnancy is calculated from this day because each time a woman has a period, their body is preparing for pregnancy. Counting from the LMP, most women are pregnant an average of 280 days. Calculating from the LMP also gives a standard of measurement for health care providers to follow since it is extremely difficult to know exactly when conception occurred.
For more information on how pregnancy is measured, please see our information on calculating your dates.

Your period has just begun, and you may be thinking about becoming pregnant. Your ovulation time is the most important thing you need to understand when trying to conceive. Ovulation occurs when a mature egg is released from the ovary, pushed down the fallopian tube, and available to be fertilized.
The lining of the uterus has thickened to prepare for a fertilized egg. If conception does not occur, the uterine lining will be shed. The shedding of an unfertilized egg and the uterine wall occurs during menstruation.
There are also several facts that you need to know concerning ovulation:
An egg lives 12-24 hours after leaving the ovary.
after leaving the ovary. Normally, only one egg is released each time you ovulate.
Ovulation can be affected by stress, illness, travel, and significant changes in weight, exercise, and sleeping patterns.
Some women may experience light spotting during ovulation. This is not considered to be an actual period, but rather ovulatory bleeding.
What is happening with your baby?
Nothing is happening yet, but be patient while the stage is being set. Before long, an egg will be released and will be available to be fertilized.
How do you track ovulation?
A woman's monthly cycle is measured from the first day of their menstrual period until the first day of their next period. On average, a woman's cycle normally is between 28-32 days. Ovulation is calculated by starting with the first day of the cycle, which is the day the menstrual period begins.
Most women ovulate on any one day between Day 11 – Day 21 of their cycle. This is what many refer to as the “fertile time” or “fertility window” of a woman's cycle because sexual intercourse during this time increases the chance of pregnancy.
For more information on tracking ovulation please see:
What should you plan at this time?
There may need to be some lifestyle changes made at this time to increase your chances of conceiving and having a healthy baby down the road. Adequate exercise and a balanced diet are important factors to evaluate.
It is recommended to begin taking prenatal vitamins and stop using substances such as:
If you are taking prescription drugs, check with your health care provider to see if such medication is safe to take during pregnancy. For more information on nutrition during pregnancy, please see our information on pre-conception nutrition.
Tips for making your pregnancy better
The most important thing you can do right now is to act in the way you would if you already knew you were pregnant. Since it can be weeks before you know if conception has occurred, this will protect both you and your future baby from any substances or activities that could cause problems.
Tips for mom's partner
Many times the male partner does not feel they have a role in a potential pregnancy at this time. However, their health and lifestyle can also affect your future baby. They may need to evaluate their nutrition, medication intake, as well as habits like smoking, and using drugs or alcohol.
Men can also benefit from taking prenatal vitamins or another type of vitamin supplement, including a proper diet, prior to conception.
Forbes came out with one of the most misleading and biased articles on EVs I've seen (presumably) not put out by someone on an oil company payroll yesterday: ‘Who Has The World's Biggest EV Charging Network? Trigger Warning: It Ain't Tesla‘. To be honest, I probably wouldn't have seen it if ChargePoint, the company being discussed in the article, hadn't shared it:
EV charging spots by the numbers: ChargePoint is everywhere drivers want to be: https://t.co/zxtQnKFDTt pic.twitter.com/R8TExTJmsC — ChargePoint (@ChargePointnet) September 14, 2016
The title in itself, while sensationalist, is actually accurate enough not to be libel. There are charging networks out there with more charge points than Tesla's own networks, which is great – especially because Tesla owners can happily use almost all of them, but then the author makes their point by manipulating the data and making plain false claims.
Update: Forbes has since heavily updated the article correcting some of the misleading information we pointed in this article.
First off, this is not a dig at electric charging networks. There are some good and some bad networks out there, but this is about correcting some misinformation of the charging solutions available to EV owners. Chargepoint should be ashamed of endorsing this article because they are otherwise a fine organization.
The network came into focus this week because of GM's PR push with the Chevy Bolt EV. The automaker invited a bunch of auto publications to take a road trip in the Bolt, but the trip was ~238 miles, which is achievable on one charge with the Bolt EV. No one talked about what happens if you need to do another ~200 miles after that. The TL;DR is that I'd probably not go, at least in a Bolt.
The solution to that problem is Tesla's Supercharger network, but I will not go in details about it since Seth published a great article on the subject just yesterday: The very good Chevy Bolt reviews are in but everyone forgot to ask the most important question.
Now back to the ridiculous Forbes article. The author, Bertel Schmitt, made the claim that the Bolt has its own “Supercharger network”:
“The Chevrolet Bolt, along with the many upcoming longer range EVs by Nissan, Volkswagen, BMW, etc. etc. have their supercharger networks.”
On what is they basing this claim? The Bolt's access to the ChargePoint network? Yes, that's right. Schmitt is comparing the Tesla Supercharger network to ChargePoint's network and purely on the size no less:
Now what Schmitt is not telling their Forbes readers is that out of those “more than 30,200 charging spots”, only 371 are DC fast-chargers, while all of Tesla Superchargers are DC fast-chargers. You can't even begin to compare the two networks. Tesla DC-fast charging networks is not only several times bigger than ChargePoint's, but also faster, placed better, has many more stalls per location, etc etc. And, if you are counting level 2 networks you have to count all of Tesla's destination chargers…and why are we comparing Tesla's network with Chargepoint. Teslas can (AGAIN) charge at almost every ChargePoint network location.
But charging speed is apparently too complicated for Schmitt. Not my words. They wrote:
“I will leave the parsing by amperage, charging time, and place to the experts.”
How convenient. We'll take it from here.
It's basic arithmetic. Most Tesla Superchargers are rated at 120-135kW kW while ChargePoint's are rated at 50 kW. That's at least 2-3 times faster and it makes all the difference. The time you have to spend at chargers is just as important as the number of chargers – especially when we are talking about the difference between 20 minutes and an hour.
But even if Schmitt wanted only to compare the number of chargers, why did they only include Tesla's DC fast-chargers but included ChargePoints DC fast-chargers and level 2 chargers? Tesla also has a network of level 2 chargers: Destination Chargers.
Schmitt made this really funny chart to immortalize their idiocy and for some reason, someone at ChargePoint (clearly not an engineer or someone with basic knowledge of charging systems work) thought it would be a good idea to retweet it:
Since the vast majority of Chargepoint chargers are Level 2 and they didn't count Tesla's Level 2 (which are incidentally much faster) this isn't a fair comparison. As of this week, Tesla's Destination Charging network has 5,300 chargers at 3,100 locations worldwide with more site coming up every day, a Tesla representative told Electrek yesterday. It brings Tesla's total chargers close to 10,000, not the 4,359 Forbes is propagating with Schmitt's chart.
But it gets even more comical that they slap CHAdeMO in here which is a charging standard. In fact, many of ChargePoint's networks are CHAdeMO compatible! In fact, Tesla owners can use CHAdeMO stations with an adapter. It is the equivalent of comparing drink companies like Coke and Pepsi and having a 3rd category for carbonated beverages.
So much stupid.
The point here is that Schmitt was trying to rile Tesla owners against ChargePoint without knowing that every ChargePoint station is beneficial to Tesla owners. With adapters, everyone can access those charge points if they decide to get the app or card. And that should be the takeaway here. We're all in this together. Bolt, i3, eGulf, Leaf and Tesla owners. As an automaker, Tesla is definitely leading EV charging infrastructure, but there are a lot of independent networks out there that are beneficial to all EV owners.
It's just extremely disappointing that ChargePoint would get on board with Forbes' misinformation.
Update: ChargePoint deleted the tweet in which they shared the Forbes article, which we embedded at the top of this article, but then they shared the article again?
Who Has The World's Biggest EV Charging Network? Trigger Warning: It Ain't Tesla: https://t.co/3UXaNrDt93 pic.twitter.com/DR8RYnM2Wz — ChargePoint (@ChargePointnet) September 15, 2016
Get it together ChargePoint! Additionally, The author of the Forbes article is losing it on Twitter. They apparently still can't make the difference between ChargePoint's level 2 and DC fast-chargers, and Tesla's Superchargers and level 2 Destination Chargers. Nor do they seem to understand that Tesla vehicles can charge on ChargePoint's network…
GREEN BAY, Wis. -- The Green Bay Packers have four of the real things in their possession, but now they have a giant Lombardi Trophy as one of the centerpieces at the ever-expanding Lambeau Field.
On Thursday, when the Packers opened the American Family Insurance gate, their newest wing to the stadium, they also unveiled a 50-foot chrome replica of the trophy that goes to the Super Bowl champion.

Fans can see it from the outside year round day or night (it's lit up after dark) through the windows on the east side of the stadium, but those attending Sunday's game against the Philadelphia Eagles will be the first to see it up close.
"The Lombardi Trophy is a great source of pride for the Packers organization and our fans," Packers president Mark Murphy said. "It's named after obviously our most iconic and most revered coach, and I don't really think there's a coach in the history of the NFL that has had a bigger impact on the league and society in general than Vince Lombardi. Obviously, the trophy and this gate is a tribute to him."
The new entrance to the stadium is decorated with pictures of Lombardi along with some of their famous quotes.
"This Lombardi Trophy, it's so unique,” said Green Bay mayor Jim Schmitt, who attended the ceremony. "We've got something very special here."
Not Your Korean Sidekick: The Frustrating Career of John Cho
By Joe Starr | Think Pieces | March 9, 2016 |
In 2004, John Cho broke a glass ceiling with Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle. They and Kal Penn wanted to make a stoner comedy, and prove that it could be a success starring two people of color instead of the usual infinite number of Seth Rogens. If you ever want a sad look at diversity problems in Hollywood, please remember that in the 21st Century, ‘maybe non-whites can be fun stoners too?' is a thing.
Luckily, Cho and Penn were right: H&K was a smash hit, and Cho made a huge impression as the tightly wound straight man playing off of Penn's ridiculousness. Cho had stepped up and seized an opportunity to prove they were a leading man.
But Hollywood, in its infinite wisdom, hastily rebuilt multiple replacement glass ceilings and threw a baby tantrum. Koreans are sidekicks and occasionally Psy- not leading men. In fact, the career that benefited most from H&K was that of Neil Patrick Harris, who was able to reinvent themselves with a cameo in the film.
And thus begins the frustrating journey of John Cho: Leading Man.
After H&K, Cho would land a short guest star run on the series Kitchen Confidential. This makes sense. It's a lot like how executives decided that Michael Cera could go from supporting fun thing to movie star after Arrested Development and had a rocket strapped to their back. Cho was also given a rocket, but its trajectory was ‘almost a fucking movie star' to ‘guest star on Fox show.' These two rockets would even cross paths: after four more years of one off roles, Cho makes an appearance in Michael Cera's Nick And Norah's Infinite Playlist as an unnamed character.
So, just to pause and check in…
This baby turtle is a movie star.
This man is not.
Cho then picks up the role of Sulu in the reboot of Star Trek. Great movie, fun role, but he's still a sidekick. Glass ceiling in play. However, he's fantastic in the movie. They handle action, comedy, drama, and continues to be a total package. Chris Pine gets the rocket and flies straight to blandtown, dropping the ball as Jack Ryan and as a guy who has to slow down a train that is unable to slow down.
Cho's next two non H&K roles are a bit part in Total Recall and ‘MILF Guy #2' in American Reunion.
In 2014, ten years after Cho proved themselves as a sure thing and grabbed that brass ring, they were cast as Henry Higgs in Selfie. Finally, Cho is the leading man in a fantastic romantic comedy that you should hate yourself for if you didn't watch. You missed out. It has a weird title, and no one knows how to market a handsome, intelligent lead character because Korean? They have no difficulty marketing things starring Kevin James.
Now, this is a tough industry, and Cho has had a good career, but it should be a great one. To quote a favorite ‘rassler, John Cho has grabbed so many of Hollywood's imaginary brass rings that they're clearly just that: imaginary.
Racist glass ceilings in Hollywood don't just hurt people of color. They hurt the industry, and the sooner people start understanding that, the better off we'll all be. This business constantly pins its hopes on random white dudes who fail time and time again, while ignoring incredible talents that could carry great money-making films.
Cho can be seen killing it as Sulu in the next Star Trek, and as a supporting character in Get A Job starring Miles Teller, who much like Cho is a good looking, intellectual leading man, but there's just something different about them that I can't quite place…
IMPORTANT UPDATE
Based on the confusion and obvious hurt in the comments, the author of this piece would like to explain that Miles Teller is marketed as a handsome intellectual actor, despite looking like someone threw a microwave at their face really hard. Sincere apologies for any feelings of anger and or betrayal I might have caused.

LONDON (Reuters) - Top oil companies including Saudi Aramco and Shell are joining forces to create an investment fund to develop technologies to promote renewable energy, as they seek an active role in the fight against global warming, sources said.
A Saudi Aramco employee sits in the area of its stand at the Middle East Petrotech 2016, an exhibition and conference for the refining and petrochemical industries, in Manama, Bahrain, September 27, 2016. REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed - RTSPMKF
The chief executives of seven oil and gas companies — BP, Eni, Repsol, Saudi Aramco, Royal Dutch Shell, Statoil and Total — will announce details of the fund and other steps to reduce greenhouse gases in London on Friday.
The sector faces mounting pressure to take an active role in the fight against global warming, and Friday's event will coincide with the formal entry into force of the 2015 Paris Agreement to phase out human-made greenhouse gases in the second half of the century.
The group is part of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI), which was created with the backing of the United Nations in 2014 and includes 11 companies representing 20 percent of global oil and gas production.
The company leaders are expected to detail plans to create an investment vehicle that will focus on developing technologies to lower emissions and increase car engine and fuel efficiency, according to the sources involved in the talks who declined to be named.
The size and structure of the fund were unclear.
The fund will also focus on ways to reduce costs of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, which involves capturing carbon dioxide emissions produced from fossil fuel burning plants and re-injecting them into underground caverns.
OGCI, Shell, Total and BP declined to comment.
The CEOs are also expected to announce the next phase of their plan to reduce the oil sector's emissions, primarily by reducing flaring of excess gas at fields, increasing the use of CCS and limiting the release of methane, a highly polluting gas often emitted through pipe leaks.
OGCI leaders called on governments last year to set a price on carbon emissions to encourage the use of cleaner technologies, although some companies including Exxon Mobil have resisted the idea.
They now hope to show they can play an active role.
The drive to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century poses a threat to oil and gas companies as transport and power sectors gradually shift towards renewable sources of energy such as solar and wind.
Oil majors including Norway's Statoil, France's Total and Italy's Eni, have increased their investments in renewable energy in recent years, although it is still dwarfed by the main fossil fuel business.
Oil producers have also lobbied for the phasing out of coal in favor of the less pollutant natural gas in the power sector.
Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne said last month that OGCI leaders will announce plans “to work collectively to develop technologies which will be needed to face climate change issues.”
Delegates from signatory nations meet in the Moroccan city of Marrakesh on Nov. 7-18 to start turning their many promises into action and draw up a “rule book” for the sometimes fuzzily worded Paris Agreement on climate change, reached last December.
Actress Ayesha Takia has tweeted expressing shock and disgust at the contentious 'rape' comments attributed to their father-in-law, SP leader Abu Azmi.
Takia tweeted, "if wot im reading about my father in laws statements r true then me and Farhan are deeply embarrassed n ashamed... We surely do nottt share this mindset...its disrespectful to women.if these statements r true then its sad.
The tweets came after Azmi reportedly told Mid-day that any woman who has sex outside marriage should be hanged, including rape victims.
"Rape is punishable by hanging in Islam. But here, nothing happens to women, only to men. Even the woman is guilty. Girls complain when someone touches them, and even when someone doesn't touch them. It becomes a problem then... If rape happens with or without consent, it should be punished as prescribed in Islam", they told the newspaper.
They went on to say that the solution to rape was hanging both the man and woman.
The shocking comment came on the back of party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav saying 'men commit mistakes but they can't be hanged for it", referring to the Shakti Mills gangrape case where the men were sentenced to death by a court for raping a photo-journalist under the new rape law.
It was almost as though the party leaders were competing with one another to come up with the most shocking statement about rape and women.
Nothing more has been heard from Abu Azmi, but Mulayam Singh Yadav has remained defiant about their comment, insisting that they had said nothing wrong. Their son Akhilesh Yadav on the other hand, has hastened to clarify that the Samajwadi Party remained deeply opposed to rape.

We saw others trying their hand at the perfect wooden watch, but their watches were all too big and bulky. We wanted to bring it to the next level and make a low profile wood watch while still maintaining quality. We are so confident in the Sioux City Watch that we are offering a LIFETIME WARRANTY to the first 100 Backers! (Must select the "early bird specials" in order to get the lifetime warranty.)
The case is the entire watch face.
See how a 52mm would fit the normal man or woman
See how the 45mm would fit the average person or woman
Watch specifications: See FAQ
Design:
We put months into the design of these watches and were finally able to bridge the gap between style and mother nature. We had a very specific style in mind and it took a lot of hard work, digital mock-ups, and trial and error to get exactly what we wanted.
One of the flaws that we discovered in a traditional wood watch was that a wood band is fragile. It doesn't matter how cool it looks if it's broken. Why not use a band that is super stylish yet is going to last? We used oil-tanned leather so that it will mold to your wrist and be more comfortable the more you wear it.
we searched for the highest quality leather possible
We searched far and wide for the highest quality leather
We pride ourselves on our attention to detail
We are offering two different case sizes, each with two different face designs.
The 45mm case will retail at $109.
We wanted to make the face a little different, so we created graphics that are a little different. (Left-Dia, Right-Tri)
The 52mm case BIG FACE, will retail at $130. (Left-Dia, Right-Tri)
Next Step:
Production: As you can see from the pictures above, we have prototype samples on hand. These watches are the result of months of testing and design changes. We have established a relationship with a reputable manufacturer and are confident that they can produce these watches after our project ends. At the completion of a successful project we will put in an order and then each watch will be shipped out to our backers! This whole process should take 45-60 days after the close of the project.
Where are the funds going?
All pledges are going towards the first production run of our four models in two sizes. We will use the money towards purchasing wood, raw materials, freight, buying movements, production/assembly costs, and packaging.
We are really happy with where we have taken this design and we need your support! Please help us get Sioux City Watch into production all over the world.

Londoners with disabilities or hidden ailments are to be offered badges urging other passengers on London's transport network to give up their seat.
The "Baby on board-style" accessories, which say "Please offer me a seat", are being rolled out as part of trial next month, Transport for London announced today.
It is a response to complaints that passengers with disabilities or hidden illnesses commonly struggle to sit down on buses and the Tube despite desperately needing to.
Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said: "We hope that these new blue badges can make a real difference to those who find it difficult to get a seat when they need one, particularly those with hidden disabilities. Everyone who travels around London knows about the success of the 'Baby on board' badges.
"I want Londoners to embrace our new trial and help these blue badges become as instantly-recognisable, giving confidence to those wearing them on public transport across London.”
About 1,000 badges will be available when the trial launches in September and participants will also be given a card they can show to TfL staff.
London's transport commissioner Mike Brown said: "We appreciate that asking for a seat on public transport can sometimes be difficult, particularly for customers who have hidden disabilities or conditions. That is why we are launching this trial, and if it is successful we will work closely with older and disabled people's organisations to develop the final product."
The Standard has previously reported cancer patient James McNaught's efforts to design their own set of "Cancer on board" badges that they hoped TfL would take up.
They said: "When I was undergoing radiotherapy for throat cancer, it meant I couldn't talk to ask for a seat and the morphine I was taking made me appear drunk.
"It was a real struggle to get people to understand why I needed to sit down. I'm really pleased TfL is doing this trial."
More than 300,000 people a year use TfL's "Baby on board" badges, after the scheme launched in 2005.
Email TfL for more information or to take part in the trial.
Severe weather warnings have been issued as yet another low pressure system hits Australia's east coast, just two weeks after it was ravaged by storms that brought wild winds, king tides and floods.
A system is expected to form off NSW's Illawarra coast this evening, leading to heavy rain, possible flash flooding and damaging winds of up to 90km/h in the Illawarra-South Coast area, before moving south overnight.
Twenty-four hour rainfall totals are expected to exceed 150mm in some parts.
Construction crews meanwhile have continued work to fortify a giant sand wall in Sydney's northern beaches region, in a bid to prevent rough surf from damaging the beachfront.
Erosion has already affected Sydney's Collaroy, Dee Why, Freshwater, Narrabeen, Shelly Headland beaches, with multiple properties in Collaroy left on the verge of sliding into the sea after earlier storms.

While no king tides are expected, it is feared wild weather might further destabilise already damaged homes.
Sydney's south-west saw flooding today, with the Georges River overflowing after more than 20mm of rain fell within seven hours.
A flood watch has been issued for the Nepean and Hawkesbury rivers.
A new low pressure system is descending on Australia's east coast. (Weatherzone) ()
The Bureau of Meteorology has also warned dangerous thunderstorms will affect the Brisbane and Strathpine regions of Queensland. More heavy rainfall is anticipated tonight, as well as the possibility of flash flooding.
Widespread rainfall totals are expected to reach somewhere between 50 and 80mm, with isolated falls in excess of 100mm “possible”.
The Brisbane suburb of Kenmore has already recorded rainfall of 68mm, while Greenhill has recorded 65mm in just one hour.
Residents of low-lying properties in areas such as Morayfield have taken to laying sand bags as a precaution against flooding.
Widespread rainfall across northern NSW and southern Queensland. (BoM) ()
Isolated flooding has already been reported in a number of areas, including Toowoomba and the Sunshine Coast.
A flood watch has been issued for the Georgina and Diamantina rivers, and the Cooper Creek, Bulloo, Paroo, Warrego, Balonne, Moonie and Border rivers.
Weather experts have assured the public nevertheless the low will be nowhere near as fierce as early June's “Stormageddon”.
NSW SES Deputy Commissioner Mark Morrow said the front was generating slower than expected but urged people to keep up to date with warnings.
Parts of Queensland's outback have already seen heavy rain, with falls of up to 100mm have been recorded around the Queensland town of Charleville since 9am yesterday.
Former Mt Isa mayor Tony McGrady says the rain has put a smile on the faces of locals, and forced the cancellation of the Mt Isa show.
"We've had good rain but it hasn't been sufficient to make the rivers flow," they told ABC radio.
"[But] people are going around smiling."

Dogs love their owners with selfless devotion and are always eager to please. Unfortunately, human beings are not capable of loving them back with the same selflessness. Often people bring home dogs to make them a part of their lives but are quick to abandon them without a thought when things are not right. Others bring dogs home only to mistreat them in the most heart-wrenching way. Countless shelters and dog lovers work night and day to rescue such abused dogs so they can get the love and the care they deserve. These are 5 of the most touching dog rescue stories that open our eyes to the cruelty human beings are capable of and the love that dogs still harbour in their hearts even after years of abuse:
5. Blind and unable to walk
Tessa was abandoned by their owners when they went blind. They were not just blind but was also unable to stand or walk. The rescue group found their hours before they were to be euthanized. This rescue story is a true example of what love and hope are capable of achieving.
4. Emerson's Story
Neglected for years, Emerson was a terrified dog when the shelter rescued him. They also had multiple medical issues. Emerson's story shows that shelter dogs are just as capable of loving life and human beings again even after years of abuse.
3. Chained for ten years
Judith's story is the prime example of the sad situation of several dogs around the world. The owner kept Judith chained for ten years outdoors without a blanket, a toy and often without any water or food. Fortunately for Judith, there were two loving people in the world who opened their home to them and provided them the love they deserved.
2. Gaia and their puppies
Gaia was abandoned and left on their own in the middle of nowhere. They suffered from a serious leg injury after being hit by a car. This video shows how their three beautiful puppies were rescued. It is a beautiful story of how their puppies would get the chance of a loving home again, even if they did not.
1. Living in a trash pile
After being abandoned, Miley had been living in a trash pile for months. Them condition was heartbreaking. They were listless, riddled with infection and malnutrition. When they met Frankie, another rescue dog, they quickly became friends and helped each other on their journey of recovery.

We're now past the 100 Days. And it was more or less universally agreed that, in historical terms and against expectations, it was an abysmal failure. President Trump as much as conceded this with their wild mix of angry denunciations of the 100 Days standard combined with press releases touting meaningless metrics like number of executive orders signed, number of foreign leaders talked to and similar nonsense. Set all that aside. That's really a given. What I'm interested in now is Trump's reaction. They failed. They get that. But why did they fail? In the Trumpian psyche, it can't be Trump's personal failure or a failure of strategy. So who's to blame?
In recent days, we've gotten the answer, though I have not seen it put together as such. The problem is the constitution or more generally, democracy.
Over the weekend, I noted Rience Priebus saying President Trump was considering moves to amend or even abolish the 1st Amendment to make it easier for them to sue news organizations that make them mad. This wasn't a discussion of libel laws. What he's thinking about requires amending the constitution. Priebus said as much. Some people thought I exaggerated the point or that, whatever Priebus technically said, they couldn't actually have meant that. Well, Sean Spicer doubled down on the point and expanded on it the next day.
Are these two just saying things to humor their boss? After all, amending the Constitution is complicated and the President can't do it alone. Quite possibly. But the President has vast powers. Their intentions in this regard are vastly important, even if they might have a hard time making good on them. The messages from their lackeys and lickspittles, both publicly and publicly meant to be seen by him, matter a great deal.
Then there were two tweets from the President just yesterday.
The reason for the plan negotiated between the Republicans and Democrats is that we need 60 votes in the Senate which are not there! We…. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 2, 2017
either elect more Republican Senators in 2018 or change the rules now to 51%. Our country needs a good “shutdown” in September to fix mess! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 2, 2017
This was a post-100 Days fail – a stop-gap budget resolution to fund the government through the end of the fiscal year in which Trump got close to nothing he'd demanded. How did they fail so badly? Because Congress doesn't work well enough. Trump wouldn't be the first person to clamor for simple majority rules votes in the Senate. But they would be the first President to threaten what we might term a ‘therapeutic shutdown' to fix the “mess” of American government.
But the real message from the President, one that's clearly been a topic of conversation between them and their aides, only came in the flurry of interviews they did in which they had a chance to expand on their remarks. Their dour mood reaches well beyond the filibuster.
Listen to these comments from their interview with Fox News …
I understand what has to be done, I get things done I've always been a closer. We don't have a lot of closers in politics and I understand why. It's a very rough system, it's an archaic system. You look at the rules of the senate, even the rules of the house, bit the rule of the senate and some of the things you have to go through, it's really a bad thing for the country in my opinion. There are archaic rules and maybe at some point, we're going to have to take those rules on because for the good of the nation things are going to have to be different. You can't go through a process like this. It's not fair, it forces you to make bad decisions. I mean, if you're forced into doing things that you would normally not do except for these archaic rules.
Trump knows what needs to be done. And they get things done. That's who they are. But having been revealed as someone who almost literally can't get anything done, he's turned against the “rough … archaic system.” The system will need to change “for the good of the nation” because “it's not fair, it forces you to make bad decisions.”
We've had this system for a while. But three months in, Trump's decided it's time for a change.
This wasn't off the cuff. Trump said much the same thing, actually used the same catchwords with CBS's John Dickerson.
Why wasn't anything getting done, Dickerson asks?
Just a system. It's just a very, very bureaucratic system. I think the rules in Congress and in particular the rules in the Senate are unbelievably archaic and slow moving. And in many cases, unfair. In many cases, you're forced to make deals that are not the deal you'd make. You'd make a much different kind of deal. You're forced into situations that you hate to be forced into. I also learned, and this is very sad, because we have a country that we have to take care of. The Democrats have been totally obstructionist. Chuck Schumer has turned out to be a bad leader. He's a bad leader for the country. And the Democrats are extremely obstructionist.
It's pretty clear the President is thinking a lot about this and talking about it a lot with their advisors. I mean no disrespect but “archaic” does not strike me as one of the President's go-to words.
The President's fondness for foreign dictators is no secret. It won't surprise you that I think that fondness and envy is tightly connected to the attitudes I've noted above. But many of us console ourselves with the notion that Trump is just demonstrably too inept and incompetent to be a strongman or push towards some kind of Americanized authoritarian rule.
This is a misunderstanding.
Incompetence and authoritarianism aren't incompatible or even in tension. Historically they tend to go together. Incompetence and failure borne of ineptitude tend to show up both as a cause and outcome of democratic breakdown and collapse. Small-d democratic government is hard, by design. It's meant to be. It should be. But it's not just hard. It relies on a particular package of skills: persuasion, inspiration, patience, canny use of patronage, threats, carrots and sticks, both consensus building and fight. Look at a Lincoln, an FDR, a Reagan – whatever you think of the different men's politics, successful presidents are almost quite good at using this toolkit.
Just running down the list, virtually none of these are Trumpian traits. So in addition to the other obstacles they face, it's hardly surprising that he's been such a flop as a chief executive. As any political scientist will tell you, the formal powers of the Presidency, outside of war-fighting, are quite limited. The lack of patience, focus and skills appeared immediately with Trump as they gravitated toward the easy and mostly meaningless sugar high of executive orders over the hard work of legislating. It's no mystery why he's failed so miserably. It's no mystery why he's now so focused on how … basically democracy, the machinery of democratic government is the problem, how it's not “fair”.
Not fair to who exactly? Trump, of course.
Even Trump's rants against the secondary enemy of the ‘obstructionist Democrats', who don't control anything, tells a similar story. It's true that the legislative filibuster is a significant tool for the Democrats right now. It is their only tool. But the real story is that they haven't gotten really any chance to use it. Trump has failed before that even came into play. The on-going Trumpcare debacle is the best illustration of this. Trump keeps ranting at the Democrats about the failure of Obamacare repeal. But the Democrats have literally not done anything legislatively. I'm sure they would force Republicans to get 60 votes to repeal Obamacare. And they should. But that hasn't happened.
What's held Trump back are the invisible hands of public opinion. They can't get their bill or Ryan's bill or whomever is claiming it at this point out of the House because Republicans are afraid of the electoral consequences of voting for it. They are afraid they will lose their seats if they vote for it. That's democracy in its most immediate form. It has nothing to do with the Democrats – unless we're talking about the Democrats' relative success at public persuasion about the awfulness of the President's bill.
We're talking about this failure in the House right now but the same pattern is ready to play out in the Senate. I think any reporter covering Capitol Hill would back me up when I say that there's virtually no way Trump could get 50 votes for this bill, let alone 60 in the Senate.
They probably wouldn't even get close to 50.
In other words, Democrats are ready and eager to obstruct using their one tool. But they're not getting the chance because Trump is failing within their own party. Trump is ranting at the Democrats but what he's talking about is public opinion. Democrats are responsible for making people not like them and not like their bill.
Democracy, of course, isn't simply responding to the whims of public opinion. Sometimes it's the height of democratic self-government for legislators to make decisions they know are unpopular for the public good. Needless to say, I think think Trumpcare is a moral as well as policy disaster. But for those who disagree, again, that's part of democratic leadership: persuading legislators to take tough votes. And again, it's one at which Trump has completely failed.
I am an optimist on American institutions. Adam Smith wrote that there's “a lot of ruin in a nation”, by which they meant that countries and by analogy governments and institutions are more resilient than you'd think. I think America is stronger than Trump. I don't think he's going to be able to tamper with the 1st Amendment because it's hard and he's clown. But they are President. A President has vast powers, in many ways far more for destruction than construction. So the fact that they want to matter a lot. The fact that three months in he's already decided that the basic mechanisms of American government are ‘archaic' and ‘unfair' matters a huge amount too.

An editorial in the People's Daily, the official newspaper of China's Communist Party, argued that the United States and its allies were fanning the flames of extremism in the Middle East.
The commentary was penned under the pseudonym "Zhong Sheng," or "Voice of China," which the paper often uses when it's articulating the establishment's line on Chinese foreign policy, according to the Reuters news agency. Its contents echoed Beijing's long-standing position on Western interventions in various hot spots and conflicts, which China often deems a violation of states' sovereignty and a challenge to the international order.
Moreover, the editorial insists, the United States and its allies have created a Frankenstein's monster in the region by backing various rebel militias with jihadist connections.
"The facts prove that by letting jihadists pass unchecked into Syria to join battle has caused the expansion of the extremist group Islamic State (sic)," says the People's Daily, referring to the Islamist militant organization that now controls swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria.
"This is a classic case of how rearing a tiger will court calamity," it goes on. "The entry of major powers must avoid by all means adding to the chaos."
Russian President Vladimir Putin has maintained this position all along, warning of the instability that would be unleashed if the West actively enabled the toppling of the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, a longtime Moscow ally. "It could throw the entire system of international law and order out of balance," Putin suggested in a 2013 New York Times op-ed — a warning, critics would contend, that rings hollow after their own government's meddling in Ukraine this year.
But Putin and China are hardly alone in their wariness of Western intervention. Earlier this week, Ilham Aliyev, the long-ruling president of Azerbaijan, whose relations with Russia blow hot and cold, made similar comments.
The Islamic State "did not fly in from another planet,” Aliyev said, adding that it was the "fruit of policies carried out in the Middle East over the past 10 years" — a not-so-subtle reference to the 2003 U.S.-led invasion and occupation of Iraq.
Azerbaijani, Russian and Chinese nationals are all known to have journeyed to Iraq and Syria to join the Islamic State, which is also known variously as ISIS, ISIL and Daesh. Aliyev criticized the Western and Arab governments that they claim have abetted or encouraged some of the rebel factions in Syria.
"This proves once again that in matters of support for radical fanatical groups, more care and foresight is needed. You cannot divide terrorists into good and bad, so that a good terrorist is one that is fighting against your enemy and a bad terrorist is fighting against you," Aliyev said.
Meanwhile, Assad remains stubbornly defiant. In an interview with the French magazine Paris Match published this week, they even criticized the Western-led air campaign that's targeting the Islamic State and other jihadist factions — their enemies — in Syria.
"It isn't true that the strikes are helpful. They would of course have helped had they been serious and efficient. We are running the ground battles against Daesh," Assad said. "And we have noticed no change."
remained the talk of the town- big and small, all week long. And now that the superstar has been granted some relief with bail coming along and sentence being suspended for a while, the nation is divided, for some feel for the star, others simply are lamenting on how money can buy anything.
While only time will tell what will become of the case, another similar case is raising its hood in the background of it all. This time, the victim is not dead. Gaurang Shah, a dentist by profession is making sure that their hit-and-run story comes to light. According to him, they were hit by 13 year old Meghna Rakhee Gulzar back in 1989. The man claims they were hit by the daughter of 's acclaimed lyricist Gulzar, leaving them unconscious on the road. The accident left them with 11 fractures on the face and skull, resulting in 3 surgeries.
But it did not end there. Gaurang claims, unlike in Salman's case, in this one, Gulzar themselves visited them in the hospital, making promises which they later did not fulfil. In their own words, “Gulzar visited the hospital, hugged me, promised their best as long as I don't make a police complaint. The middle class gujju family in awe of the celebrity and the patient who couldn't think straight agreed.” And so they told the cops that they fell off the bike and that no one was to be blamed. They added, “Expectedly (heartbreakingly that time coz I was a big fan), Gulzar never showed up.
I was 'hit n run' again..!”
With this coming to the fore, is it Gulzars' turn to find themselves in troubled waters after the Khans?
MANILA - House Committee on Justice Chairperson Reynaldo Umali on Tuesday said the witnesses in their probe into the drug ring in the national penitentiary may have varying details, but they all seem to pin Senator Leila de Lima.
"At this point in time, we have heard all of the witnesses. As you said, there are different ways to get there, but all roads lead to Senator De Lima," they said in an interview with ANC's Headstart.
"That is a problem because all of these testimonies remain unrebutted, uncontroverted; so that what we will see when we do a report and all of the testimonies that would forward to the members of the committee, all of these would only say one thing, and that is that all roads to Leila de Lima," they added.
Umali noted, De Lima did not participate in the hearings, "so it remains uncontroverted."
Convicted crime kingpins told a Congressional investigation last month that they helped raise money to fund De Lima's senatorial campaign this year.
Inmate Jaybee Sebastian also testified before the House probe Tuesday that they gave millions of pesos in drug payoffs to De Lima over several occasions in 2014 and 2015.
De Lima had repeatedly asserted that the witnesses presented to the ongoing investigation were "pressured" to testify against them
Umali insisted that these 22 witnesses, 14 of whom were inmates, were not conditioned or pressured, noting that the interpellation conducted by lawmakers would have wrung the truth out of them.
They added, it was actually De Lima themselves who "suggested" that the committee brings Sebastian into the investigation, and "at the end of their testimony, they even pointed to Leila really, the end-stage of all these things that happened in the national Bilibid."
"He was subjected, they were grilled…and they did not budge. They said the same story and they were not even referring to their notes. In terms of credibility, they rank high," they said.
"He was straightforward. They were answering interpellations quick, without need for any notes. They were not even thinking; it was all coming from within," they added.
Umali said, De Lima's supporters, including members of the Liberal Party to which they belong in, should have attended the hearings if they wanted to defend the senator.
"They should have said it in the committee. How come they did not participate? What the supporters of Senator Leila did was just to say that nothing is happening to the committee hearings," they said.
Umali is determined, however, to prove them wrong.
"The Committee on Justice of the 17th Congress will really do something about the criminal justice system," they said.
"To our detractors, those that are claiming that they are supporting—but they did not support Leila; I have not seen them say anything except to say that they are scripted—they had all the opportunity to interpellate," they said, pertaining to the LP members who are in the lower house as well.
Umali maintained, it is not dubious that inmates are their witnesses because naturally, they would be knowledgeable of the situation inside Bilibid.
"Who else can testify on what is happening in the Bilibid prison? You need to have personal knowledge and they are the ones who have personal knowledge of what is happening," they said.
The Committee wrapped up its inquiry Monday evening, and will not resume until De Lima's driver Ronnie Dayan is arrested.
Umali said they plan to submit a report on its probe this week and present it to the plenary the week after.
If Donald Trump is in bed with the Russians, how come the Russians are letting their most valuable intelligence assett die an agonizing political death?
Russia has no interest in Donald Trump, and that should make you very nervous, because it means Vladimir Putin isn't done interfering in American politics and the destruction of Hillary Clinton is only phase one of Putin's plans.
If it was true that Donald Trump was in bed with the Russians and worked with them to engineer an electoral victory, then they are literally the most valuable intelligence asset Russia has ever had. Indeed, Donald Trump would be the most valuable intelligence asset anyone has ever owned.
A relationship like the one suspected with Donald Trump is a once in a lifetime opportunity for the Russians. It's a chance to have direct access to the inner deliberations of the most powerful office on Earth.
If that were true, you expect that the Russians would go to great pains to protect such an asset.
Except they aren't. If anything, they're making things worse.
If they cared about protecting Trump, what's the likelihood that Comey would have been fired the day before a meeting with Russian officials? What's the likelihood that embarrassing information about that meeting would get leaked? What's the likelihood that Russia would have allowed Syria to so terribly embarrass Trump by gassing civilians just hours after they publicly said the US has no interest in directly ousting the Syrian regime.
It doesn't add up. None of it. Russia's end goal is not Trump's protection and utilization as an asset. The only thing that makes sense is that the end goal is to turn Trump's presidency into a constitutional crisis.
Russia isn't interested in Trump. Russia is interested in destroying Trump.
Don't buy it? Then answer this one thing. Why should the Russians care about Trump?
There are only two reasons why they would tilt an election in their favor. Either they have them in their pocket — which isn't consistent with what's actually happening — or else they hated Hillary. But does that really fit with Putin's realpolitik attitude? Would they risk a global confrontation just to wreck their dreams of Clinton becoming President? Would they risk seeing a populist wildcard elected?
No. They wouldn't risk it unless there was another shoe to drop.
Russia surely wanted to hurt Clinton, but that was a secondary goal. This had a little bit to do with them and everything else to do with America. Putin ultimately wants to reduce American influence on the world stage, to throw it into such disarray that it recedes from the global theatre and concentrates on devouring its own entrails.
It looks to me like he's succeeded. Here we stand, on the brink of the collapse of American Democracy, if only for a few weeks, but a collapse nonetheless. .
This is the tragedy. Not that Trump is incompetent as a President. But that the Russians have so masterfully manipulated the American mind that we now believe Trump is also treasonous.
Maybe Trump is all that, maybe their isn't, but one thing is certain: the Russians don't care about him. They care about destroying him.
Once that happens, once Russia reduces to rubble the foundations of both democratic parties, their triumph will be complete. There is now a wound in the side of America that will take years to heal. And it couldn't have worked out better for Russia if they had planned it out in every detail
Russia's strategy is especially weak because it lets greenhouse gas emissions rise, experts say
By Alister Doyle
OSLO, April 17 (Reuters) - Plans by 34 nations for fighting climate change beyond 2020 would leave the world on track for warming well above the limits agreed with the U.N., and Moscow's strategy is especially weak because it lets Russia's greenhouse gas emissions rise, experts said on Friday.
The United States, the 28-nation European Union, Russia, Mexico, Switzerland, Norway and Gabon have so far submitted strategies to the United Nations, meant as the building blocks of a global deal to be agreed in December at a summit in Paris.
"We regret that so few ... have been submitted," said Miguel Arias Canete, European Climate Action and Energy Commissioner. So far, national plans cover about 30 percent of world emissions.
March 31 was a first, informal deadline for plans, known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), that are meant to help slow the effects of climate change. Most nations are waiting to submit their plans.
The Climate Action Tracker (CAT), compiled by scientists, said pledges so far put the world on track for average temperatures in the year 2100 three to four degrees Celsius (5.4 to 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) higher than they were in pre-industrial time. That is well above a U.N. goal of a maximum 2 degrees C (3.6F) rise.
"Hopefully, there can be a dynamic to increase ambition" in coming months, said Niklas Hoehne, a founding partner of the New Climate Institute, which helps compile the CAT.
CAT gave Russia an "inadequate" rating and assessed others as "medium". It said reports that Japan was considering cuts of only 20 percent by 2030 would also be "inadequate".
Russia's goal is to limit emissions to 25 to 30 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. But its emissions were 32 percent below the 1990 benchmark in 2012, a legacy of the collapse of Soviet-era smokestack industries, meaning a rise by 2030.
Other INDCs use varying yardsticks that complicate plans for putting pressure on laggards to raise ambition before the Paris meeting.
Washington plans emissions cuts of up to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025, for instance, while the European Union promises cuts of 40 percent from 1990 levels by 2030.
"It will be very hard to put INDCs side by side and say ‘this one is strong enough and this one isn't',” said Frank Melum, a senior analyst at Thomson Reuters Point Carbon.
Christiana Figueres, the U.N.'s climate chief, said they expected INDCs covering 80 percent of world emissions by Oct. 1, allowing an overview before Paris.

Reforms aimed at rescuing the European Union's landmark carbon-cutting mechanism, the emissions trading scheme (ETS), are back on track after attacks from business lobbyists and Conservatives.
A key committee of the European parliament judged in favour of the reforms on Tuesday, meaning that they will move on to be debated by the whole parliament, probably in April. However, it was unclear on Tuesday whether there would be an additional stage of scrutiny before the parliamentary vote, during which time the measures could be watered down.
The two UK Tory MEPs on the committee, Martin Callanan and Marina Yannakoudakis, defied David Cameron to vote against the reforms.
The committee's decision to pass the reforms was welcomed by environmental campaigners. If the reforms pass the parliament, then some of the carbon permits destined for the emissions trading scheme market will be held back until 2019, which should restrict the over-supply of permits and raise the price of emitting carbon dioxide in the EU.
The ETS is in need of rescue because the prices of carbon permits under the scheme have plummeted, now trading at around €5, down from average prices of over €30 in previous years. The scheme covers heavy industries and power generators, which need permits for each tonne of carbon dioxide they produce. Having to use these permits – some of which are given out for free, while the remainder are auctioned – is supposed to encourage companies to cut their emissions and invest in cleaner technologies and methods.
But at such low prices, the permits make little difference. That prices are so low is partly the result of an over-allocation of free permits, the recession, and rules allowing the use of even cheaper carbon credits from abroad to substitute for EU permits.
The short-term fix that the reforms would introduce is known as "backloading", whereby some of the allocations of permits by member states to their industries would be held back from auction for several years. At present, auctions of permits take place on a regular basis, in which companies bid for any they need above the free allocation that some receive. But as the market is already swamped, thanks in part to companies carrying over unused permits from previous years, if the auctions were to take place as usual the price could fall even further. Under "backloading", some of those auctions will be postponed until later in the current phase of the scheme, which runs to 2020.
Rob Elsworth, policy officer at the campaign group Sandbag, said: "The road to structural reform of the ETS starts with backloading. Today's vote puts us firmly on that road. What's more it reiterates support for the EU's flagship climate policy, the ETS. Abandoning it at this point would have left the EU with an even more politically charged debate around alternatives."
According to Thomson Reuters Point Carbon, which analyses the carbon market, traders sent the price of carbon down from an opening of €5.13 per tonne to as low as €4.09 after the news. Marcus Ferdinand, senior market analyst, said: "The market realised that there are more negotiations and votes to follow and, therefore, it didn't show any sign of relief but traded straight to the downside, indicating that the market remains sceptical as to whether politicians will support the measure in the end."
The next stage is for MEPs to decide whether to enter a "trilogue" with the European commission and council, before presenting proposals for debate to the parliament as a whole, or to move straight to the parliament. If there is an intermediary stage, it could be an opportunity for business lobbyists – many of whom oppose backloading – to attempt to water down the reforms.
Jonathan Grant, director of sustainability and climate change at the consultancy PwC, said much more drastic reforms were needed. "The approval of the backloading proposal by the European parliament environment committee will help to prop up prices in the short term, but that prop will be taken away when the carbon permits are re-introduced into the system towards the end of the decade, at the end of Phase 3 [in 2020]," they said.
"Our analysis shows that both bold policy intervention and a return to economic growth are needed to prompt the market to return to historic levels of €15-20. So backloading is temporary medicine when the EU ETS needs major surgery. It is not clear from the vote today whether major structural reform of the EU ETS will be possible in 2013 particularly given governments' current focus on growth and jobs."
Skullsworn is Brian Staveley's new novel set in the world of their popular and highly acclaimed The Emperor's Blades and Chronicle of the Unhewn Throne Trilogy. When Skullsworn became available for review, I was reluctant to do it because I haven't read any of their Chronicle of the Unhewn Throne novels. Since it is marketed as a stand-alone novel, though, I decided to give it go, knowing that I can always cast it aside if it becomes unintelligible. Well, that never became necessary since I ripped through Skullsworn in less than a week. It is one of those novels that you won't want to put down, and when you have to, you will still think about it. I absolutely loved it. Those of you who have read the Chronicle of the Unhewn Throne will likely love it too and I hope you'll give me a break if my obvious unfamiliarity with the trilogy becomes painfully apparent.
Skullsworn tells the story of Pyrre, a young woman striving to become a priestess of the death god Ananshael. To achieve this, they must pass a Trial that requires them to kill several people described in a ritualistic song, including “the one who made your mind and body sing with love”. Unfortunately for Pyrre, they have never really felt love, but they have come pretty close. It was several years ago in Dombâng, a city built over a swamp swimming with vicious creatures that are almost as treacherous as the city's inhabitants themselves, where they met Ruc Lan Lac in a fighting pit and fell in lust. Now they need to actually fall in love and kill the person they love to become a priestess of death. They see Ruc as their best bet. So off they go from their pleasant home in Rassambur to the highly unpleasant city of Dombâng, currently under tenuous control of the Annurian Empire and its local commander, yes, Ruc Lan Lac, to find him, fall in love, and kill him. Accompanying Pyrre on this pilgrimage are a priest and priestess of Ananshael: Kossal, a near-elderly, taciturn gentleman, and Ela, a free-loving, snarky aging beauty. They must bear witness to Pyrre's Trial. This deadly trio makes their way to Dombâng not entirely without incident as a near-calamitous bridge failure almost cuts their journey off before it has begun. This bridge incident immediately takes the reader from a pleasant stroll to grim mayhem at the outset of the story, which then never lets up on the violence and tension.
For Pyrre, however, falling in love proves much more difficult than turning an entire city on its ass and pushing it to the brink of revolution. Dombâng is beautifully depicted both in its physical structure, a ramshackle den of squalor set on stilts over a labyrinth of canals and swamp, and its tense relationship with its occupying force, Ruc Lan Lac's Greenshirts, the military police that oversees the city's functions as well as its beliefs. Pyrre and Ela throw themselves headfirst into the city's turmoil while the fastidious Kossal keeps their head above the pandemonium for as long as possible. Throughout the twists and turns of the unraveling plot, this deadly trio proceeds towards the point at which Pyrre must take their fate, their future as a priestess, into their own hands and, together with Ela, Kossal and a couple other uniquely strange characters, must confront Dombâng's ancient mythical enemy – if it actually exists – and their own past. It may seem a like a lot for a relatively short, 318-page novel, but Staveley pulls it off deftly without an ounce of flab.
The juxtaposition of love and death forms the core thematic thread of Skullsworn. Not only has Pyrre not felt love, but they do not even know what it is supposed to feel like. Complicating this is the idea that death is all-consuming, religiously paramount, and as easy to recognize as it is to create. Pyrre is a killing machine, but they must stick to their Trial which does not allow unnecessary murder. Ela and Kossal, on the other hand, make Pyrre look like an amateur. They kill at will, presumably giving Ananshael the lives of anyone they feel aren't worthy of animated existence. Amongst all this death and the decadence and decay of Dombâng, Pyrre must find love, and Staveley does a nice job of exploring how a deadly force like Pyrre sorts this out in their mind. And, luckily for an old curmudgeon like me, who would rather bash in their skull with a George R.R. Martin hardcover than read YA fiction, Staveley deals with love in an entirely adult, mature, and only mostly tasteful way, blurring the distinction between lust and love until the final curtain is about to fall. I would love to tell you more, but nope, no spoilers.
Aside from the obvious but definitely not heavy-handed thematic content of Skullsworn, the real diamonds in this swamp are the characters. The story is told in the first-person voice of Pyrre as they undergo their Trial.  They are beautiful and intelligent and flawed, carrying a hardened exterior from their painful childhood that has kept them from knowing love. The two main secondary characters are equally compelling. Kossal is a quiet, aging man, mostly a mystery to Pyrre, who goes about their business watching over Ela and Pyrre and keeping them safe. Ela, on the other, nearly steals the show.  They are absolutely hilarious, carefree, and droll. Just when things seem most dire, they come up with a comment that had me laughing out loud several times. Staveley's characterization of these three unique and complex individuals is subtle, deep, and vivid. I really felt like I got to know them, except for Kossal, who wouldn't allow it. They are most responsible for my reluctance to close this book for the few days I was consumed by it.
Staveley's prose is also extremely compelling, stripped of ornament without being the least bit boring or minimalist. The city of Dombâng comes alive under their deft hand, which not only paints a vivid picture of its rickety walkways, makeshift shanties, dive bars, swirling shit-filled canals, and murky swamp waters but also the tension and fear of its inhabitants and their tenuous existence in a remote and violent middle-of-nowhere city. Similarly, the action and plot are pushed forward relentlessly by Pyrre's narration. The descriptions of pit fight and murders, riots and drunken mobs, deadly critters and sexy waiters thrust the reader right into the midst of a place that no one in their right mind would want to be and push forward inexorably toward the dual-threaded grand finale.
If I have to come up with one shortcoming in Skullsworn (and I don't but I will just so I seem more professional than the fanboy that I am), it is that the stakes are not earth-shattering. This is really a personal (very personal!) story of Pyrre's quest for love in a world of death. What's at stake, originally, is whether or not they become a priestess, and I wondered for a while if this was enough to drive an entire novel. Them quest, though, lights a fire under so many different problems that, in the end, I found Skullsworn to be a very satisfying read, especially the ending.
If any doubt remains about whether or not Skullsworn is grimdark, let me put that to rest. There are no “good” characters here, and morality as we know it is entirely irrelevant. Even Pyrre, though sympathetically flawed, is so enamored with the death god Ananshael that they can barely fathom why people should live. Them companions, whom, if you have any grimdark sensibility yourself, you will cheer for emphatically, are absolutely relentless killers, on top of which Ela seems to have an insatiable desire for sex, completely disassociated from any relation to love.
Do yourself a favor: read Skullsworn. You won't regret it. Now on to The Emperor's Blades and more Brian Staveley since they have my attention.
Skullsworn is scheduled for release April 25, 2017, in the US.

When Emily, 27, was sexually assaulted on a night out in London, they initially tried to handle the situation on their own. "I was at the Roundhouse to see Nas in June 2015, and I headed to the bar to get a drink. It was packed—you could hardly move—and this really drunk guy behind me started groping my ass. I turned around and told them in no uncertain terms to get off me, and they said something like, 'You love it, I'm just being nice to you.'"
Moving away and ordering drinks at the bar, they thought their ordeal was over—until they reappeared and continued to assault them "I started feeling really upset, and I turned around again and asked them to stop and they were just laughing, like it was funny or something, and whispering in my ear. What made it worse was that I'm pretty sure there were people around me who saw the whole thing, and no one intervened or did anything."
They were just laughing, like it was funny or something, and whispering in my ear.
Later, still feeling shaken by the assault, Emily called up the police to report the incident. "They were really good, actually. I'd been worried it wasn't really sexual assault, because you always think that sexual assault is something that happens in a dark alleyway or something, but they told me it was." Although police took a statement and checked security footage from that night, "ultimately there wasn't enough evidence" to catch the assailant, Emily says.
Although Emily's story is horrifying, it's far from unique. What happened to them is just one incidence of a statistical surge in sexual assaults and rapes taking place across London's bars, clubs and pubs. Reports of rape and sexual assault in London's nightlife scene have more than doubled in the last five years, according to exclusive data obtained by Broadly under British freedom of information laws from London's Metropolitan Police.
The figures show a dramatic rise in recorded sexual offences in or immediately outside of licensed drinking premises across the capital. In the period between April 1, 2011 and March 31, 2016, there was a 136 percent increase in reports of rape in bars, pubs, bistros, and licensed clubs across London. The same period saw a staggering 119 percent increase in reports of other sexual offences, which includes incidences of sexual assault.
These numbers relate to incidents reported to the police, rather than those resulting in convictions.
Official figures also show a sharp increase in arrests arising from these reports of rape and other sexual offences. Arrests made in bars, pubs, and licensed clubs relating to all allegations of sexual offences rose by 66 percent over the last five years.
There was also a 90 percent increase in arrests made specifically in relation to reports of rape. Despite this, only 32 percent of those arrested on suspicion of rape had criminal charges brought against them in a one-year period between 2015 and 2016. While the Met Police didn't have figures for how many people were found guilty, current rape conviction rates hover around 5.7 percent. What this means is that very few of those accused will ever see the inside of a courtroom, let alone a prison cell.
The Metropolitan Police confirmed that the Roundhouse is one of the venues listed in their crime statistics.

Keen to prevent anything similar happening to other women, Emily emailed the management team of the Roundhouse to suggest that the venue sign up to anti-harassment initiative Good Night Out, run by campaigners Hollaback London!.
In emails seen by Broadly, a member of the Roundhouse team promised Emily they would "check it out." However, when Broadly asked over the phone if the venue had indeed joined any anti-harassment initiatives, staff said that it had yet to sign up to one.
"We take any matter concerning audience safety and security very seriously and we work closely with our security contractor Showsec International and the police to prevent such instances taking place at our venue," says Mark Butler, the head of venue operations at the Roundhouse. "As indicated by our response to Emily, reports of such incidents are extremely rare here due to the tight security operation in place. We have not had any reports since these incidents, nor in the years prior."
Of course, the fact that women aren't reporting sexual harassment or assault to the police or club management doesn't mean it isn't happening. Claudia*, 27. was on a night out four years ago at London mega-club Fabric when they felt someone grab their ass as they walked through the dance floor. Wheeling around, they saw the man responsible and confronted them angrily. "I shouted at them something like, 'What the fuck are you doing? How dare you touch me?'"
Terrifyingly, the situation devolved into violence. "He was pissed off that I shouted at him, and they moved as if they were going to punch me. There was a circle on the dance floor of people holding them back from hitting me. It was really scary."
Understandably shaken up, Claudia left immediately and has never returned to the club. "I don't feel safe ever stepping foot into Fabric again," they say, and explains that they now prefer to go out to smaller venues with a more visible security presence. When asked why they never reported the incident to the club or the police, they respond, "I just wanted to get away from there. I didn't think there was anything that they would or could do about it. I didn't know if anyone really cared because I thought these things must happen so often. I just went home."
For women like Claudia, security guards stationed throughout the dance-floor and notices asking people to report incidences of harassment would make them feel safer. "I think if this happened now I'd be more likely to report it through social media to the club and tell them to put something on their website asking people to be respectful of women and training security guards in what to do," they say. "Because when it happened to me, I literally felt there was no one who could help me."
Met Police figures provided to Broadly show that there were 358 reports of sexual offences at licensed drinking premises made over a year-long period stretching between 2015 and 2016—almost one for every day of the year, and a 121 percent increase from the same period between 2011 and 2012. Over the same one-year period between 2015 and 2016, police recorded 52 reports of rape—more than double the number of incidents logged between 2011 and 2012.
The figures may seem low for a city known internationally for its nightlife, but the reality is that London's night-time economy is on the down and out. Half of Britain's clubs have shut their doors in the last decade, many of them beloved London clubbing institutions. Given that there are fewer clubbing options for Londoners these days, you would expect sexual crime to decrease proportionately—not increase at such a sharp rate.

It's possible that the higher reporting rate doesn't reflect an increase in sexual assaults, but rather the fact that women are growing increasingly confident that they'll actually see justice in some form. Bryony Benyon, the co-director of the Good Night Out campaign, which seeks to end harassment on nights out, tells Broadly that she's never surprised when reporting rates show high numbers. However, they are hopeful this is because more women feel comfortable coming forward—in part due to the success of campaigns like hers, and innovative approaches such as the Women's Safety Charter from forward-thinking local authorities.
Regardless of the cause in the rise, the statistics reveal how endemic sexual assault and harassment are in nightlife. In Benyon's view, venues lack an incentive to tackle sexual violence—in fact, there may be a strong motivation not to report incidents. When pubs, bars, or clubs encourage women to report harassment, the venue will likely end up notifying the police.
"This actually penalizes premises that support women who make police reports, because if too many crimes are reported in a venue it can trigger a review of that venue's license," says Benyon. "I've heard cases of women being told to leave the club before calling the police because managers are so scared of this happening. It's not a good approach."

In their defense, the Met has made efforts to improve their response to sexual crimes. In 2013 the Met instituted a major reorganization of its specialist rape unit, Project Sapphire, after a high-profile string of failed investigations. And in June 2015 commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe pledged to hire an extra 200 specialist officers to deal with the surge of sexual abuse cases reported to the Met Police (although they failed to meet their targets).
While Benyon believes the Met have made progress, they say there is still a long way to go. "The Met Police offer some training to venues but it's very overly focussed on the idea that 'vulnerability' is down to women drinking too much and making themselves at risk, rather than looking at why women who are drunk are deliberately targeted by perpetrators of rape and sexual violence."
Benyon continues, "Regardless of things like alcohol consumption, we are actually only really vulnerable when there is someone in our vicinity who will do us harm."
"We welcome the increase in the number of rape allegations made to police throughout London as we believe it reflects a greater confidence amongst victims that they will be listened to," argues Detective Superintendent Steve Chandler of the Sexual Offences, Exploitation, and Child Abuse Command of the Met Police. "All reports of rape are thoroughly investigated and each victim has their case deal with by a specially trained officer," they add. Chandler further notes that the increase in reporting in London corresponds to a national increase which has been evident since 2012. However, when Broadly asked the Met Police for the figures showing the national increase in reporting—the very figures they referenced in their statement—they were unable to provide them, despite repeated inquiries.
That's when it hit me that harassment was happening at my party, and I was mortified. You can't just ignore that stuff.
Club promoter Seb Wheeler, who runs the popular London dance night Tropical Waste, says that more needs to be done to combat sexual harassment and violence. "We started throwing parties two years ago, and at first it's just your friends who come—so you assume everyone's really sound. Then in February 2016 we did a party and someone contacted me on Facebook afterwards who [sic] I didn't know to tell me their friend had been sexually harassed and they didn't trust security to deal with the problem.
"That's when it hit me that harassment was happening at my party, and I was mortified. You can't just ignore that stuff."
In response, Tropical Waste instituted a security policy that makes it clear that anyone harass other guests—in any way—will be asked to leave. "We put up posters explaining the policy at our nights and post details on all our social media pages. We've also got new, super-friendly security at the venue who we work closely with and brief in advance about the policy."
Statement re: harassment at Tropical Waste. Pls take 2 mins to read if you come to the parties x — SEE U DOWN FRONT (@TropicalWaste1)March 30, 2016
Wheeler feels it would be helpful for promoters or venue operators to be given specialist training in how to deal with sexual harassment and assault. "If there was a training day for promoters I'd definitely go down to it. We [promoters] should take more responsibility, because I've had so many female friends be harassed—it doesn't matter what club or party it is—and this behavior is seen as so normal on nights out. It's like the elephant in the room, and it's unacceptable, really. If we don't do something about it, we're failing our audience."
The sad reality is that sexual violence and harassment is totally normalized in our nightlife. For many women, it is a part of their night out, just as much as a night bus that never arrives or a kebab house overflowing with boozed-up punters at 3 AM.
Erin*, 29, was groped in the Dolphin pub in Hackney in November. "I was with a group of five women, but we weren't really 'looking.' When I was at the bar, I felt someone grab my butt—not lightly, a proper squeeze."
After confronting their assailant, they became involved in an aggressive verbal altercation with them and their friend. "A bouncer came and threw us both out. Outside, I shouted that he'd grabbed my butt, and the security let me in without a fuss."

I ask whether they complained to management. Erin responds with words that I've heard depressingly often in the course of my interviews for this piece: "I didn't think it was important enough to. Plus, I just wanted to get with my night."
When reached for comment, The Dolphin manager Angus MacLeod told Broadly, "The incident described is obviously not acceptable and illegal. We have a zero tolerance policy over such incidents and other unacceptable behaviour and it will normally result in being barred from the premises and/or calling the police." They went on to add, "Thankfully, strict door policy, visible and active security make such incidents relatively rare."
Meanwhile, the ass-groping sleaze bags of London's nightlife scene continue to make their presence literally felt. In the period between researching and writing this piece, I went on a night out in Shoreditch in east London, and personally witnessed a visibly wasted office bro in a pink-and-white striped shirt slap my friend's ass.
Does it need to be like this? No. Is London's clubs, bars, pubs, promoters, security staff, and police doing enough to tackle the problem? Sadly, probably not.

EDITOR'S NOTE: Fabric was contacted pre-publication for comment. After publication, a spokesperson sent through the following statement which we have included as it contains useful information for women visiting the club.
"Unfortunately we are aware of people like Claudia having these kinds of experiences at the club, this is why we launched our anti-harassment campaign back in 2013 and have since gone on to be part of Good Night Out. We have posters in the venue and extra security on the dance floor but appreciate that sometimes these aren't always seen and some customers are not aware of our policy. We would like to reinforce our message, that if this happens to you here then please speak to us about it, we're here to help and will deal with it for you. We often take action to remove individuals who are perpetrating this kind of harassing behaviour in the club, it's an issue that we take seriously here."
Fox News takes on CNN Rupert Murdoch challenges Ted Turner with a 24-hour news channel NEW YORK (CNNfn) - Media mogul Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. entered the 24-hour news business Monday, launching the Fox News Channel.
Fox News is going head to head with Turner Broadcasting System's Cable News Network and MSNBC, the all-news joint venture of Microsoft Corp. and General Electric Co.'s NBC division.
For Murdoch, Fox News is the culmination of a long-held ambition -- building a U.S-based global television-news network.
However, the move puts Murdoch in direct competition with their longtime nemesis, TBS chief Ted Turner -- the hands-on media magnate dubbed "Captain Outrageous" by the press.
Turner has called Murdoch a "shlockmeister," recently comparing them to "the late Fuehrer."
Murdoch, in turn, has accused Turner and CNN of a liberal bias.
Fox News will initially reach 17 million U.S. homes, less than a third of CNN's reach.
In addition to facing CNN, Fox is also up against MSNBC, the news channel launched in July and now available in 22 million U.S. homes.
But Murdoch remains undaunted by the competition, vowing to offer an alternative to what they claim is the media's liberal slant.
Nancy Maynard, chair of media studies for the Freedom Forum, believes that it's easier to get an audience by defining one differently than building one. (106K WAV) or (106K AIFF)
Still, Murdoch faces an uphill battle.
Time Warner, a cable TV and media conglomerate that will soon merge with TBS, has refused to carry Fox News in the key Manhattan market.
That means national advertisers based in New York won't see the Fox channel, as Time Warner controls most of the city's cable market.
Antitrust regulators have required Time Warner to carry a CNN competitor, but the company surprised the industry recently by deciding to cut a deal with MSNBC, not Fox.
"Murdoch thought they had a deal with Time Warner, then, at the very last minute Time Warner went the other way, over to MSNBC," said media analyst David Londoner of Schroder Wertheim.
Londoner believes Murdoch saw the flip-flop as a breach of faith, if not a breach of contract.
Fox has now enlisted New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani in its fight to be seen in the Big Apple.
Murdoch is threatening to pull Fox headquarters out of Manhattan if they don't get theirs way.
So far, Time Warner hasn't backed down.
But outside of New York, Fox hopes to persuade other cable systems to pick up the new channel by showering operators with $11 a head for each of their cable subscribers.
Murdoch hopes viewers' hearts and minds will follow.

TV's squeeze play
TV starts autumn in August
President Donald Trump said Sunday on Twitter that they "negotiated a ceasefire" with Russia's President Vladimir Putin last week that "will save lives." (MIKHAIL KLIMENTIEV/AFP/Getty Images)
President Donald Trump's self-congratulations on Twitter regarding an agreement with Russia for peace in Syria are premature and will likely amount to a mistake, experts and officials say.
The plan for at least a temporary halt to fighting southwest Syria beginning Sunday was announced by Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin shortly after the pair met for more than two hours at the G-20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, last week. It involves the Jordanian government, centering around a cease-fire covering an incredibly complicated battlefield, where the forces of the Syrian regime backed by Russia continue a war against rebel elements, while the U.S. advances on the Islamic State group strongholds in and around Raqqa. Unpredictable al-Qaida affiliates, Iranian militias and other countries in the region, like Israel , have also complicated the conflict zone in recent months through strikes or attacks .
Initial reports said the cease-fire was holding, even though those familiar with the complex nature of the six-year-old conflict in Syria say it will inevitably collapse. And when it does, Trump's Twitter pledge on Sunday that "many lives can be saved" as a result of making deals with Moscow is also likely come into question.
"Who's party to the cease-fire? Not the jihadists, not al-Qaida nor the Islamic State [group]," says Ryan Crocker, a career diplomat and former ambassador to Syria. "Even if – and it's a big if – those who are party to it want to keep it, it will be sabotaged. No doubt."
Crocker served in Lebanon during the country's 15-year civil war and says the Syrian conflict is far more complicated. This latest cease-fire appears to be wholly a Russian initiative, they add, providing largely a "big bump" for Putin's attempts to seek international recognition for brokering peace.
"You don't get cease-fires in these kinds of wars that last unless you basically have an overarching political agreement, and we are miles away from that," Crocker says, adding of Trump, "It's going to be another chunk out of their credibility."
Moscow first intervened in Syria in 2015 under the auspices of supporting the government of Bashar Assad with which it has traditionally allied, though analysts believe Moscow's true ambitions centered on securing a place among the top international powers for deciding on Syria's future. Russia continues to maintain an air base and naval station there.
Following Trump's meeting with their Russian counterpart last week – their first face-to-face since they became president – they wrote on Twitter , "We negotiated a ceasefire in parts of Syria which will save lives. Now it is time to move forward in working constructively with Russia!"
The president, whose campaign and presidency is currently under investigation by the FBI, a special prosecutor and Congress for alleged ties to Russia, has repeatedly called for improving relations with Moscow.
Democrats on Capitol Hill, including Rep. Adam Schiff of California, said after the announcement that the cease-fire was a constructive outcome of Trump's meeting with Putin, even if some of the other agreements the leaders made caused alarm among critics and supporters alike.
Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking member of the powerful Armed Services Committee, said in a statement, "This announcement will be a test of how effectively the Russians can influence both the Syrian and Iranian governments to stop the violence and begin to develop longer-term solutions."
The consequences of that test, however, will likely fall on the U.S. to fix.
"Normally you would say if you make that kind of statement and it fails, it's a pretty big blow to your prestige as a dealmaker. In the case of Trump, it doesn't seem to bother him," says Melvyn Levitsky, a former senior State Department officer for Soviet affairs, now at the University of Michigan's Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy.
"If the cease-fire fails," they add," the onus will probably fall on us. The Russians will claim, probably credibly, that they have held their clients to the terms of the cease-fire. … On our side, we have a tenuous hold on the various factions that oppose Assad and some of them, like Jabhat al Nusra, are not under our influence at all."
The latest cease-fire is different than prior agreements brokered under the Barack Obama administration, all of which crumbled within weeks, in that unlike their predecessor Trump has used military force against the Assad regime and its proxy forces.
"It's a huge challenge and not realistic or fair to Trump to expect them to solve immediately what Obama couldn't in six years," says Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. "Much more will be needed than one local cease-fire. But that is at least a beginning."
Others see the cease-fire as a guise, but one the U.S. can help maintain under the auspices of warring parties' not shooting at each other and rallying behind anti-terrorism operations.
"The U.S. has accepted an overarching policy to contain Iran, and that's real, unlike Obama," says James Jeffrey, former ambassador to Turkey and Iraq, now with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. They point, however, to an absence of a clear strategy for what will happen in Syria and the region after the Islamic State group has been defeated.
"This is a step forward, and they earned this, they earned this by taking the decision to approve the chemical raid," Jeffrey says of Trump, citing the Tomahawk missile strike they approved on a Syrian chemical weapons facility. "But the problem is, what this is going to do is back us into a confrontation with Iran, Syria and Russia. That's going to happen sooner or later."
Trump has also set high expectations with what some former officials consider overly optimistic social media posts.
"To say, 'I've negotiated a peace to end all peaces,' not a good policy. It reminds me a little of 'Mission Accomplished,'" Crocker says, citing President George W. Bush's infamous 2003 proclamation about combat operations in Iraq.
"This is going to go on for years," they say.
UFC president Dana White said Friday that Nate Diaz will remain on the UFC 200 card, but that their fight will not come against Conor McGregor.
Diaz threw a wrench into White's plans at Friday's news conference, however, saying that they would like to fight McGregor, or not fight at all.
Editor's Picks McGregor not retired, pursuing UFC 200 fight Conor McGregor broke their silence Thursday in an attempt to reclaim their spot in the UFC 200 main event, saying they aren't retired and that they want to focus on their preparation rather than promotion.
"Everybody knows what's been going on with the main event for UFC 200," White said. "Nate Diaz will fight, and we're gonna find them a new opponent."
Diaz, speaking after White, said, "I came here to fight Conor. I'm not real interested in anyone else."
McGregor was conspicuously absent from Friday's news conference, which came a day after they released a statement on social media stating they were not retired, despite a post earlier in the week that said they were stepping away from the sport.
Tuesday, in response to McGregor's earlier post, UFC pulled them from a scheduled rematch against Diaz at UFC 200 on July 9, saying McGregor had refused to fly to Las Vegas to participate in promotional obligations.

Asked Friday if they know where McGregor is, White said, "I think he's in Iceland."
"We try to give as much leeway as we can on things, but you have to show up and promote the fight," White said. "Is it too much to ask to try to shoot a commercial for the fight? A lot of these guys came here from different parts of the world. But, you know, these guys all came. They have better things to do, and they're here. It's part of the job.
"We gave Conor every opportunity in the world to get here, too. We get criticized a lot for bending too much for Conor, and we do. Conor is a guy who has stepped up and fought big fights on short notice, and I respect Conor very much as a fighter, and I like him, but you have to show up and do this stuff."
Asked if the Diaz-McGregor still could happen, White said, "I just don't see how that's fair."
McGregor, presumably watching Friday's news conference, responded to White's remarks on Twitter.
Everyone flew in. Respect.
But not everyone up there made the company 400million in 8 months. — Conor McGregor (@TheNotoriousMMA) April 22, 2016
With the Diaz-McGregor fight off as the main event at UFC 200, White said that it is "possible" that light heavyweights Jon Jones and Daniel Cormier could fight in the event's headliner if Jones wins their fight Saturday against Ovince Saint Preux.
The Nationals have announced that ace Stephen Strasburg has been placed on the 15-day DL (retroactive to June 16) with an upper back strain. A corresponding move will be made on Monday to fill Strasburg's 25-man roster spot.
[Related: Updated Nationals depth chart at Roster Resource]
Strasburg was scratched from their last two starts due to the back problem, and given to backdate of their DL assignment, it's possible they might not miss much more action. Still, the back strain is the latest in a rather lengthy series of nagging muscle injuries that have bothered Strasburg throughout their career, as they have missed time with oblique and neck strains in the past. (To say nothing, of course, of their Tommy John surgery in 2010.)
Tanner Roark replaced Strasburg in today's scheduled start since Roark was on regular rest anyways, though Washington will need a pitching staff replacement later this week. Swingman Yusmeiro Petit is one option, and minor league arms Lucas Giolito and Austin Voth (as Chelsea Janes of the Washington Post notes) both have scheduled starts for Monday and Tuesday, respectively. However, there isn't any sign that the Nats could call up either, Janes says. Of the two, Voth (at Triple-A) could be more directly ready than Giolito (Double-A), as Janes tweets that the Nationals want Giolito to polish their command before exposing the top prospect to Major League batters.
Strasburg already generated headlines this season by signing a seven-year, $175MM extension to remain in D.C., and they have been pitching like an ace worthy of such a contract. Strasburg has a 2.90 ERA, 11.4 K/9 and 4.92 K/BB rate over 93 innings, also notching a perfect 10-0 record over 14 starts. An extended absence is unquestionably a big loss for Washington, though the Nats have enjoyed strong pitching overall from Max Scherzer, Joe Ross, Gio Gonzalez and Roark.

“Rolling coal” could become illegal in Maryland as a bill makes its way through the state House of Representatives on Thursday. “Rolling coal” is a slang term for when diesel drivers tune their pickup trucks to spew black smoke from the tailpipe on acceleration. It sometimes entails increasing the power output of an engine, and it usually necessitates the removal of some emissions parts. We've seen videos of these guys (it's always guys) doing this while they pass other drivers, runners or bicyclists on the road.
The bill states that it's illegal for a driver to cause “a diesel–powered motor vehicle to emit certain clearly visible emissions onto another person or motor vehicle; providing for the application of this Act; and generally relating to a prohibition on the discharge of excess diesel–powered motor vehicle emissions.”
Ezra Finkin, director of policy of the Diesel Technology Forum, testified before the Maryland General Assembly House Environment and Transportation Committee in support of House Bill 11:
“Diesel engines have long been a popular option in heavy-duty pickup trucks because of their superior fuel efficiency and towing performance. While we recognize diesel enthusiasts' love for diesel engines and the performance of their vehicles, the practice of tampering with engines and emissions controls for the purpose of generating excess emissions on demand -- ‘known as rolling coal' -- is offensive, unsafe and harmful to the environment. Most of all, it is not representative of the manner in which diesel engines were designed to operate.”
The bill exempts drivers of commercial vehicles with a gross weight of 10,000 pounds or more and construction vehicles. It also exempts drivers of standard diesel-powered cars that discharge visible exhaust during normal acceleration.
The bill falls under Maryland's Section 203(a)(3)(A) of the Clean Air Act that explicitly forbids the practice of tampering with a vehicle's emission controls and allows states to prohibit the practice.
On a personal note, we think the practice is dumb and the drivers who do it are dumber. We love tuning cars, adding parts and taking them away. But it's always in pursuit of something nobler: speed, handling, comfort, or even efficiency. It's never to pollute needlessly and never to anger other people on the road purposely.
To what end, we ask you coal rollers, to what end?

Trump and the Russia report: Six things you need to know
Here are the key points you need to know about the intelligence documents on President-elect Donald Trump and Russia:
• Most of the information in the documents comes from a single source, a former intelligence officer for a western country who specialized in Russian counter-intelligence.
• The report accuses Russia of “cultivating, supporting, and assisting” Trump for “at least five years.” It also asserts that Russia has possible “blackmail” information on the president-elect, including sexual and financial misconduct, as well collusion between Trump aides and Kremlin officials during last year's election.
• All of the allegations against Trump are unsubstantiated and unverified.
• Trump described the reports as “fake news” and a “witch hunt.”
• Various news organizations have had these documents for months but chose not to publish them because the claims are unsubstantiated. They are coming out now because intelligence officials briefed Trump and Obama about the allegations last week. CNN and Buzzfeed were the first to publish on Tuesday. Mother Jones had published a limited version before the election.
• The decision by intelligence officials to give Trump, President Obama and Republican and Democratic leaders of Congress and the intelligence committees unconfirmed material is very unusual.
The official website for thefilm updated at midnight on Monday (the night of the full moon), and added a new promotional video.

They are, however, recording it with their camera attached telescope. Another amateur astronomer Dan Peterson actually witnessed the flash and reported it to other astronomers for verification. This caused Hall to look through their recordings of Jupiter from that exact time and sure enough…bam! History is made. The impact area could be back in view around 1a.m. ET Tuesday according to amateur astronomers.

Jupiter acts as a barrier, absorbing cosmic “bullets.” This is the third major impact witnessed since 2009 and will not be the last. This is just another reason to love this huge gas giant. Life on Earth may depend on Jupiter and these impacts.

These ships could be military or private companies paid to keep these cosmic objects from reaching Earth. However, we need to devise smart and efficient ways to divert or destroy these objects. That remains the question. How should we do this? Lasers may work or solar sails. One thing is for sure, if this burst of light was an impact it was massive. We cannot afford to be passive in our approach to this issue. One huge impact may be all it takes to cause worldwide extinction.

Second Life, one of the most hyped virtual worlds in history, is heading towards ghost town status. Intrepid tech reporter Wagner James Au broke the story over the weekend, noting that Second Life makers Linden Lab are at work on a top-secret new virtual world.
It's possible that this new virtual world is part of Linden Lab founder Philip Rosedale's new project called High Fidelity.

Reps from Linden Lab said:
The next generation virtual world will go far beyond what is possible with Second Life, and we don't want to constrain our development by setting backward compatibility with Second Life as an absolute requirement from the start. That doesn't mean you necessarily won't be able to bring parts of your Second Life over, just that our priority in building the next generation platform is to create an incredible experience and enable stunningly high-quality creativity, rather than ensuring that everything could work seamlessly with everything created over Second Life's 11 year history.
Though the company says that Second Life fans have nothing to fear, and that they will continue to support the virtual world, rumors suggest otherwise. Insiders at the company claim that most developers at Linden are already working on this new world, which will not be compatible with Second Life.

We've seen thriving social networks shut down before, and it's always a little sad. MySpace was once the place to see and be seen, though that's hard to imagine now; and of course AOL's dialup chat rooms were the most popular social networks of the late twentieth century. The question is always who will stay until the very last servers are shut down. Those people are in many ways like the stubborn citizens who refuse to leave their homes in a town whose industry and population have fled. Virtual ghost worlds may become more common as the internet enters middle age.

Bernie Sanders recognizes Washington is as close to a must-win as it gets after their disappointing loss in Arizona on Tuesday. | AP Bernie goes all out for West Coast must-win To have any hope of catching Hillary Clinton in the delegate race, Sanders needs a strong performance out of Washington state.
SEATTLE — Without a big win in Washington Saturday, there's no path forward for Bernie Sanders. And that cold political reality has turned this state into an unlikely battleground between the Vermont senator and Hillary Clinton.
Sanders recognizes Washington is as close to a must-win as it gets after their disappointing loss in Arizona on Tuesday. With 101 delegates at stake, only New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and California have more delegates at play after this weekend. If they have any hope of catching Clinton, he'll have to start here, in a state where progressive-oriented Seattle sets the tone.
Story Continued Below
“If Senator Sanders is ever going to do well, I think it would be in Washington,” explained Gov. Jay Inslee, a Clinton supporter, acknowledging Sanders' appeal in their state. “That's no surprise."
Clinton doesn't have as much urgency to win. They simply need to keep it close, to deny Sanders the kind of runaway caucus victory that could dent their 300-plus delegate lead and provide them some desperately-needed momentum going into the April 5 primary in Wisconsin, another state that figures to be receptive to their brand of progressive politics. (Alaska and Hawaii, much smaller delegate contests, also hold caucuses on Saturday.)
But it won't be easy to hold Sanders back. According to one analysis, Seattle ranks No. 1 among the 50 biggest U.S. cities for per-capita contributions to their campaign. He's got seven campaign offices in the state and has drawn huge crowds in their visits to the Pacific Northwest. While most of the state's high-profile Democrats are backing Clinton, Sanders has the endorsement of the state's largest newspaper, the Seattle Times -- by far their biggest endorsement from a daily publication.
The political environment is especially well-suited for Sanders. Seattle, which elected a socialist to the city council last year, is in the midst of ushering in a $15 minimum wage. Plus, while the local tech boom has fueled the city's emergence as a high-profile Democratic money hub over the last decade — Hillary, Bill, and Chelsea Clinton have each stopped by for recent fundraisers — many local Democrats harbor resentment toward party leaders in distant Washington, D.C. over their perceived use of Seattle as little more than an campaign ATM, according to numerous fundraisers and Democratic officials.
Delegates Remaining: 56 Delegates 2,814 1,893 56 2,382 Delegates Needed for Nomination
Sanders' final Seattle event on the eve of the caucuses, designed to make a big impression, is one that few other candidates would even contemplate: a rally set for Safeco Field, the Seattle Mariners' baseball stadium with a capacity of well over 50,000.
The optics of an enormous stadium event, closely followed by a big win in Saturday's caucuses, could leave a lasting impression on news coverage of the candidate while the voting calendar goes quiet before the Wisconsin primary.
“Washington is a place where Senator Sanders is making a stand,” said Jaxon Ravens, chairperson of the state Democratic Party. "[It's] where he's saying: ‘This nomination process is not over. I am not stepping aside.'"
Clinton's campaign here has been more modest in scope – though they have nine offices in the state, even the most optimistic of Clinton backers shy away from predicting victory.
Instead, recognizing Sanders' attempt to use Washington as a springboard toward upcoming states, the Clinton campaign has actively targeted key regions (like the more conservative eastern part of the state) and discrete constituencies (such as aerospace union workers) that they hope will back them and temper the senator's margin of victory.
Clinton has also spoken about the Export-Import Bank and trade deals while campaigning in the state, nodding to the bank's large role in supporting a wide range of businesses in Washington. While Sanders has at times derisively referred to the bank as the “bank of Boeing,” they have toned down that criticism in a state where Boeing is the single largest private employer.
In coastal and foreign trade-reliant Washington, their railing against multinational trade deals and the Ex-Im bank haven't quite hurt them as much as some Clinton allies had hoped – the trade debate has taken a different shape here than in the automotive and manufacturing hubs of the Midwest. One reason: while the decline in manufacturing has dragged down the economies of some Midwestern cities, Seattle has experienced a tech boom.
“We've experienced economic growth associated with aerospace and other industries that have grown and the secretary has always focused on [those],” said Inslee, pointing to smaller businesses like breweries that have also benefited from the Export-Import Bank. “She is on the right side of this Export-Import Bank, which, without exposing taxpayers to problems, has created thousands and thousands of new jobs in my state. There's a lot of people driving new pickups in Washington [because of it]."
Gary Locke, a former Washington governor and U.S. commerce secretary, said the debate in Washington has revolved more on the questions of Sanders' and Clinton's bigger-picture economic philosophies and their positions on pocketbook issues – like the minimum wage.
“Yes, while Boeing benefits from the Export-Import Bank, so do a lot of medium-sized companies. We understand the value of trade here,” said Locke, who also served as U.S. ambassador to China. But “I don't think the Export-Import Bank is a key issue here."
Indeed, the economic inequality that has surfaced in parts of Seattle in recent years plays directly into Sanders' economic message.
But Seattle isn't the sole focus of the campaigns. Clinton and Sanders have also taken time away from the state's population center, aware that the majority of delegates in Washington's caucuses are apportioned by congressional district — creating an incentive to campaign beyond Seattle's city limits.
While Hillary Clinton has spent most of their time in and around Seattle – they wooed both Native Americans and machinist and aerospace worker union members on Tuesday -- their husband stopped by Spokane and Vancouver this week. Less populous cities like those stand to be important on Saturday because succeeding in the caucus structure requires having a presence all over the state, even in less populous eastern Washington, explained Ravens.
Sanders has also gone out of their way to visit places like Spokane and Vancouver, because both campaigns expect a large turnout — especially among independents taking advantage of the open system — to drive their vote totals.
What's less clear, explained Locke, is the degree to which the state's Democrats will turn out. It's a looming question that stands to hurt Clinton more than Sanders. The state's rank-and-file Democrats, after all, are not accustomed to voting in hugely consequential presidential primary contests due to Washington's place on the nominating calendar in recent cycles.
“Obviously Bernie Sanders has quite a committed young following, and Seattle itself is very, very liberal. So they could benefit from that,” explained Locke. “But then, outside of the Seattle area you've got so many supporters of Hillary Clinton. These are people who are not used to caucusing on a Saturday."

TREDYFFRIN Twp., Pa. (CBS) — District Attorney Tom Hogan calls this a simple case of ignorance, violence and what they call a shocking lack of supervision.
It involves players of Conestoga High School's varsity football team, and a hazing tradition, for lack of a better term, that was known as “no-gay Thursday.”
READ: 94WIP Host's Hiccups Lead To Serious Diagnosis
“No gay Thursday,” according to Hogan, meant things that would normally be considered gay, were not gay when done by upperclassmen to underclassmen in the locker-room.
Examples include a senior walking up behind a underclassman and putting their genitals on the younger player's head; a first-year student being forced to undress an upperclassman, or underclassmen being forced to strip to their underwear and clean the locker-room.
It was that last one, that sparked this incident, according to investigators.
Conestoga Football Players Express Doubt Regarding Hazing Allegations
The DA says the very talented, but cocky first-year student player decided he'd had enough and tried to leave the locker-room, two seniors held them down, while another grabbed a broomstick and began poking at their groin, eventually DA Hogan says, penetrating the boy's rectum.
The 14-year-old boy told their father last month. The father went to the Tredyffrin/Easttown School District.
The school district immediately alerted police and the DA's office.
READ: Medical Examiner Reveals Bobbi Kristina's Cause Of Death
The three aggressors were all 17 at the time. Charges against them include conspiracy to commit assault, possession of an instrument of crime, unlawful restraint, and terroristic threats.
Hogan says the hazing statute under Pennsylvania law only applies to colleges and not to high schools, he's urging lawmakers to change that.
Hogan says Treddyfrin-Easttown School District now has a big job in front of them as they will have to tackle a culture of hazing.
Hogan also says, so far it appears no gay students were ever targeted during “no-gay Thursday.”
A statement from Tredyffrin-Easttown school district says they will conduct a thorough investigation, and the head football coach is suspended of coaching duties pending the outcome.

The Sam Browne belt is a wide belt, usually leather, supported by a narrower strap passing diagonally over the right shoulder (although Royal Canadian Mounted Police non-commissioned members wear theirs over the left shoulder).[1] It is most often a part of a military or police uniform.[2]
Origins [ edit ]
General Sir Sam Browne was a 19th-century British Indian Army officer who had lost their left arm;[3] this made it difficult for them to draw their sword, because the left hand was typically used to steady the scabbard while the right drew out the sword.[4]
Browne came up with the idea of wearing a second belt which went over their right shoulder to hold the scabbard steady. This would hook into a waist belt with D-rings for attaching accessories. It also securely carried a pistol in a flap-holster on their right hip and included a binocular case with a neck-strap. Other officers began wearing a similar rig and eventually it became part of the standard uniform. During the Boer War, it was copied by other troops and eventually became standard issue.[5]
Infantry officers wore a variant that used two suspender-like straps instead of the cross-belt. It was supposedly invented in 1878 by Lieutenant Sir Basil Templer Graham-Montgomery, 5th Baronet of the 60th Rifles while serving in India.
Use [ edit ]
Due to its former use as equipment for carrying a sword, it is traditionally only worn by those to whom a sword would historically have been issued, namely officers and warrant officers.
Finland [ edit ]
In the Finnish Army (as well as in Finnish Air Force) the Sam Browne belt, officially known as a "command belt" or "officer belt", has been used by officers and senior NCOs as well as officer cadets when wearing service, dress or parade uniforms. Currently it is mainly used by high-ranking officers during parades and other ceremonies, as it's only worn with dress uniform M58 and service uniform M83; while most Army and Air Force personnel, excluding cadets studying in the National Defence College as well as soldiers on ceremonial duties, use the camouflage uniform M05 as their service uniform, and the use of the "command belt" with any camouflage uniform except M62 (already phased out of service) is strictly forbidden.
Germany [ edit ]
Mussolini and Hitler wearing the belt
The Sam Browne belt featured prominently in many uniforms used by the Nazi Party in Nazi Germany, again in imitation of earlier European uniforms. It was popular with Adolf Hitler[6] and other leading Nazi officials.[7][8][9]
Ireland [ edit ]
The Irish Citizen Army, Irish Volunteers and Irish Republican Army (IRA) made extensive use of Sam Browne belts during the Irish revolutionary period (1916–23).[10][11] This included women serving with the Irish Citizen Army, among them Constance Markievicz.[12] The folk song "The Broad Black Brimmer" also mentions the Sam Browne belt.[13] They later were used by An Garda Síochána and the National Army.[14]
United Kingdom and the Commonwealth [ edit ]
In the 20th century it was a mainstay in the British Army officers' corps, being adopted service-wide in 1900 during the Second Boer War after limited use in India, and later becoming popular with military forces throughout the Commonwealth.[15]
After World War II the Sam Browne belt saw a decline in use in the Commonwealth. It was dropped from the standard officer's uniform in 1943[16] and replaced by the cloth P37 and P44 web gear. However, officers and warrant officers class 1 of the British Army and Royal Marines still wear it in service (No.2) dress and in non-ceremonial versions of No.1 dress.[17]
It was phased out by the Canadian military beginning with the unification of the armed services in 1968.[18]
In Australia, all officers and warrant officers class 1 are entitled to wear the belt in ceremonial dress.[19] Within the corps of the Australian Army there is some variation, with members of the Royal Australian Armoured Corps, Royal Australian Army Nursing Corps and Australian Army Aviation Corps wearing black Sam Browne belts.[20]
Rifle belt [ edit ]
Bullet belt
A different arrangement, supposedly[according to whom?] invented in 1878 by Basil Templer Graham-Montgomery of the 60th Rifles while serving in India, consists of a similar wide belt with two vertical supporting straps, one over each shoulder. This design puts the burden of the gear, with its heavy ammo pouches on the belt and straps, on both shoulders.
It was worn by the officers of British and Commonwealth rifle regiments, who had to carry a rifle as their service arm rather than a pistol. It was also worn by big game hunters in Africa and India in the late 19th and mid-20th centuries. It is often[example needed] seen worn in movies or TV shows as part of the costume of explorers or big game hunters.
United States [ edit ]
During World War I, the Sam Browne Belt was approved by General Pershing, commander of the AEF, for wear by American officers as a rank distinction. However, the Army as a whole did not immediately approve its use.[1][21] MPs were positioned at stateside docks and confiscated them from returning officers.[22] The United States Army mandated the Sam Browne belt for overseas soldiers in 1918 under the name "Liberty belt"[23] and for all service members in 1921, this time under the internationally accepted name "Sam Browne belt".[24][25] It was a standard part of the uniform between World War I and World War II. It was limited in use in 1940 when the Army abandoned sabers[26] and replaced with a cloth waistbelt that was sewn to the officer's jacket.[22]
During World War I the Marine Corps adopted a brown leather Sam Browne Belt. It was later changed to black, the official color of Navy and Marine Corps leather gear. It is worn as part of the dress Blue A & B, Blue-white dress, and service A uniform by sword-bearing commissioned and warrant officers.
After the First World War, Sam Browne belts "become almost universal among American police".[27] The utility belts worn today by American police usually lack the cross-strap and the attachments for them. The belt fastens in the same way, with the bar of the buckle engaging a pair of hooks and the end of the belt retained by a post and keeper loop. They are also frequently fully lined, as opposed to the old style half-linings, to support equipment the length of the belt.[27]
Use in police forces worldwide [ edit ]
The Sam Browne belt is largely obsolete in police and security use due to risk of strangulation by potential opponents. It has sometimes been referred to as a Suicide Belt by personnel.[28] It had enjoyed some popularity with civilian police agencies worldwide and was probably most widely worn in this context during the 1940s and 1950s. This use has gradually faded out due to field safety concerns. It is part of the ceremonial dress uniform of many agencies, most notably the Red Serge worn by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.[29] The RCMP enlisted ranks wear the cross belt over the left shoulder to support the pistol worn on the right side. RCMP commissioned officers wear the cross strap over the right shoulder due to the need to support a sword when wearing the red serge ceremonial uniform. This difference of wearing the cross strap over different shoulders for commissioned and non-commissioned members is even maintained when wearing the stripped Sam Browne belt (no pistol or sword). [30]
Safety [ edit ]
The Sam Browne belt has been proposed as a solution to occupational safety and health concerns about injury due to the weight of equipment on police officers' belts.[31] However, others have expressed concern that the vertical design of the belt could enable criminals to gain physical control of law enforcement officers in an altercation.[32][33]
Civilian use [ edit ]
During the interwar period, the belt became fashionable among some American[34] and European[35] women. Eleanor Roosevelt, the first lady of the United States at the time, openly spoke out against the practice.[36] The belts also became a symbol of civilian authority by "everybody from bus drivers to volunteer schoolboy traffic cops".[37] The belt's use by junior safety patrol members became iconic.[38][39]
Since the 1970s, the use of Sam Browne Belts has increased in popularity within the Queer BDSM Leather subculture.[40]
Reflective Sam Browne belts are a popular safety device among cyclists for increasing their visibility, and a bright orange version is often worn by school crossing guards in junior safety patrols.[41]

Visakhapatnam, Ranchi, Indore, Pune and Rajkot have been declared five new Test centres. Also, Rajeev Shukla to continue as IPL Chairman.​ Sourav Ganguly will no longer hold a commentary role.
Gagan Khoda and MSK Prasad are the new members in the selection committee, replacing Rajinder Singh Hans and Roger Binny. Sourav Ganguly replaces Anil Kumble as the Chairman of BCCI Technical committee.
PTI reports that Ravi Shastri has been fired from the IPL Governing Council, while Roger Binny has been sacked from the selector's post due to conflict of interest issues. MSK Prasad will be appointed in their place.​
N Srinivasan was on Monday dethroned as the ICC Chairman after the BCCI decided to recall them and nominate its recently-elected President Shashank Manohar as the chief of the world body.
The decision to remove Srinivasan was taken at the BCCI's 86th Annual General Meeting in Mumbai on Monday, virtually signalling the end of their hold on Indian cricket. The tenure of Srinivasan, who took over in June last year, was to end next year in the same month and the remainder of the term would be completed by Manohar as it is India's turn to hold the top position.
It is learnt that the resolution favouring replacing Srinivasan with Manohar was passed at the AGM. In case, Manohar cannot attend the ICC meetings, Sharad Pawar will be India's representative.
The Tamil Nadu strongman will thus lose their grip on Indian cricket for good after having already been ousted as the BCCI President owing to the 2013 IPL spot-fixing scandal in which their son-in-law Gurunath Meiyappan was held guilty of betting charges.
Although Srinivasan was not personally indicted for the damaging scandal but the Supreme Court-appointed R M Lodha committee had chided them for not acting on the elements which corrupted the IPL.
With their sacking as ICC chairperson, Srinivasan now only remains the president of Tamil Nadu Cricket Association. Their company India Cements had owned the IPL franchise Chennai Super Kings, which was suspended for two years after its officials were held guilty of betting.
The AGM, which was postponed by more than a month from its normal late September date, is expected to put in place strict compliance protocols to the Conflict of Interest regulations in the wake of the Supreme Court's cracking of the whip on this matter.
Another important change in the proposed clauses is about the BCCI president approving every team picked by the national selection panel. The existing clause says that the president "shall approve the composition of the team selected by the Selection Committee", while the proposed clause reads,"The President, along with the Office Bearers, shall approve the composition of a team selected by the National Selection Committee from time to time."
Eddie Long, the embattled pastor of an Atlanta megachurch, has always been showy in their pulpit demeanor. But will the ever-defiant pastor soon don a crown and wield a scepter?
In a service last weekend at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church, Long was proclaimed as royalty by Ralph Messer, a visting speaker. “He's a king. God's blessed him. He's a humble man. But in them is kingship. In them is royalty,” Messer said over Long, to applause from New Life congregants. “In them was a land of Israel. In them was a k chromosome...he was brought through the slaves, raised up in a city and God now wants to release a new anointing.”
Long was then wrapped in scrolls, raised aloft by four men, and paraded about the stage to raucous applause.
The huge molluscs with their beautiful trumpet shells and an appetite for crown-of-thorns starfish could save huge areas of precious coral from being wiped out. Australia is spending £16 million to protect its greatest marine wonder from the starfish which, along with tropical cyclones, are blamed for half the reef's coral loss. With its toxic coating and ravenous appetite, the spikey starfish can eat their way through huge amounts of coral that form the backbone of the UNESCO World Heritage Site. Images show how quickly the starfish can turn the vibrant colourful corals into an underwater wasteland of gnarled and blackened tentacles. The threat posed by the starfish is all the deadlier because of the females' high fertility making them capable of releasing 65 million eggs during the spawning season.
The possibilities the triton breeding project opens up are exciting Australian Institute of Marine Science
Using giant triton sea snail - scientific name Charonia tritonis - to disrupt the starfishes' mating habits is being hailed as one the key strategies to protect the reef. Not only do the triton snails eat starfish, simply by giving off chemicals called secretomes will send the coral destroyers fleeing. "Researchers (have) found that there is potential the tritons could eventually be 'deployed' to prevent crown-of-thorns from closely aggregating during their spawning season, and this could help prevent the starfish from reaching outbreak numbers," the Australian Institute of Marine Science said this week. "The chemicals could potentially be synthesised to create alarm-inducing 'baits' to agitate starfish on reefs and limit outbreaks."
GETTY Australia is spending £16 million to protect the Great Barrier Reef
The Australian government is investing £336,000 on research trials to breed the triton snails, which are native to the coral reefs of the Pacific and Indian oceans and are legally protected in Queensland waters. At present, AIMS's collection of giant tritons have already produced 100,000 swimming snail larvae, with studies now in place to see how the young develop. "Very little is understood about their dietary requirements or the cues that trigger their metamorphosis into the adult snail," says the institute. "The research project focuses on helping triton larvae to transition to their juvenile and adult stages, providing the opportunity for further research into triton biology. "The possibilities the triton breeding project opens up are exciting. If successful, this research will allow scientists to closely look at the impact of giant tritons on crown-of-thorns' behaviour and test their potential as a management tool to help reduce coral lost to outbreaks."

Did you know that there are only three genre fiction magazines that completely support themselves from the revenue they generate? These are Analog, Asimov's, and the Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, collectively known as the Big Three. Others, like Tor.com and Subterranean (now closed), are supported by the revenue of their parent companies. Below them are four more groups: the non-profits (like Strange Horizons and Beneath Ceaseless Skies); the hobbyists or beginners (typically characterized by low or no pay for authors); the aspirants (they pay authors SFWA-qualifying rates or better, but haven't found reliable way to cover that cost); and the conceivable (the aspirants that have learned to generate enough revenue to cover costs, but not adequately compensate their staff). Today, I'd like to talk about the first and last two groups, but primarily the latter.
For starters, I know there are people who will nitpick the categorizations I've created. If that's what you're going to focus on, you'll probably miss the point of this editorial. None of those categories are meant to diminish the value or quality of a market. It's simply a way to break them up in terms of the current state of their business models. Don't get hung up on the names. I've gone through a dozen permutations and will likely go through a dozen more in the months ahead.
Since I haven't labeled the first two examples, let's group them together and call them the professionals. It would also be fair to call them the old guard professionals, organizations that have their foundation in the pre-ebook print world. Yes, some of them have launched digital magazines, but these businesses established themselves first in the print world. None of these organizations have their foundation in the digital world. This is not a criticism. It is a simple observation. To their credit, each has learned to embrace the industry's transition to print and digital. That's what good businesses do. They adapt to market shifts or die.
Clarkesworld published its first issue nine years ago this month. During that time period, I've paid very close attention to what has been happening within this corner of the short fiction field. Within that nine-year window, the lion's share of new genre magazines have launched from a digital foundation. Sure, some of us dabble in print, but our business models are very digital-oriented. This is largely due to financial- and distribution-related issues. The amount of money necessary to launch a print-based aspirant-level market with national distribution is staggering. You could fully-fund a digital publication for well over a year with the same amount and that's not even taking into consideration warehousing expenses, the headaches caused by the distributors and their antiquated returns system, or the USPS and their continually increasing postal costs. Even though none of the digital-native publications have risen to the ranks of professional, the smart money these days is to launch digitally. (Note: There have been new and even some old print magazines that have failed within this window.)
In the pre-digital world, which happens to be most of my life, there were always new magazines coming and going. Without the digital options available, they adapted in other ways. Small print runs, hand-selling at conventions, mailing parties, and lower pay for authors and artists were routine. While many dreamed of reaching that professional tier, it was often clearly out of reach and as a result their expectations had to be more realistic. Quality and readership for publications were more variable and the overwhelming majority never left the hobbyist/beginner group. None of them reached the ranks of the professionals.
Just like in the rest of the industry, digital publishing has considerably lowered the bar to entry and it has completely altered the landscape for genre magazines. The aspirants category is larger than ever, and may even be growing at a rate faster than the number of new readers and writers entering the field.
There are two reasons to be worried about this:
1. Quality
If the number of quality stories isn't growing as fast as the number of stories publishers need to fill all their slots, then quality must dip to fill the void.
2. Sustainability
If the number of readers willing to pay for short fiction isn't growing as fast as the financial need of the publishers, the field begins to starve itself.
I'm singling out the aspirants here because they are the most at-risk. Their financial foundation is the least stable of the groups I'm focusing on, so they are the most likely to fall victim. In the long term, the danger also extends up the food chain and endangers the conceivables and the professionals. It's considerably less likely to significant alter the trajectory of the publications further down the chain.
Without a doubt, the lowered bar has triggered a boom period in short fiction. Most of the time that's been quite exciting, but more recently I've found myself noticing some worrisome trends that could be signs of a market correction looming on the horizon.
Over the years, I've consulted on a number of new publishing projects. I generally start by telling people that they need to have a metric for knowing when to quit. For example, how much money are you willing to lose? It's a business, not your baby, so you need to know when to fold. There's no shame in this and you can always try again later. Our history is littered with magazines that couldn't make a go of it for some reason or another.
The second thing I tell people is to start small and grow. You are only asking for trouble if you try to be everything you aspire to all at once. Map out where you want to be in three years and slowly work towards it by building the revenue and readership you need to justify it. Even if someone hands you a big check, you still need to plan wisely and think about more than just the next year.
Lately, I've started seeing projects to resurrect dead magazines or save those that couldn't get enough subscribers to sustain their ambitious goals. It's uplifting to see our community rallying around these causes, but are we setting ourselves up for a fall in the process? Are we simply delaying the inevitable, like what happened with Realms of Fantasy? (For those who don't know, Realms of Fantasy was a print magazine that kept coming back from the dead because there were people passionate enough about it to want to see it continue, but not enough to make it a viable business.)
But what can any of us do about it? Here are a few suggestions:
Subscribe to or support any magazine that you'd be willing to bail out if they were to run aground. Just-in-time funding is not a sane or sustainable business model. If you want them to succeed, then be there before they need you.
If a magazine doesn't offer subscriptions or have something like a Patreon page you can support them financially through, encourage them to do so.
Encourage SFWA to raise their qualifying rate for short fiction. Why? Given the small explosion in markets that are paying that rate, it's clearly too easy for publishers to earn that badge. Yes, that rate is a badge of honor for publishers. Seriously though, the authors deserve better.
Don't support new (or revival) projects until they clearly outline reasonable goals to sustain the publication after their initial funding runs out.
Introduce new readers to your favorite stories and magazines. This is particularly easy with so many online magazines being freely available at the moment. We need more short fiction readers if all this is to remain sustainable. This plays into my comments on short fiction reviews last month.
As I've worked on this piece, it's been hard not to get depressed about the odds for any conceivables breaking into the ranks of the professionals. If we're entering a phase of market compression, and I think we are, the hill will only become steeper. I'd love to see Clarkesworld be the first to cross over, but I've learned to be realistic about this business and appreciative of what we have achieved in the last nine years. I appreciate everything our readers have done to support us and hope you'll continue to stick with us on the road ahead. We can't do it without you. None of us can.
I consider many of the editors at the other magazines to be friends and colleagues. While I may not agree with some of their business practices (and they mine), they have my respect and best wishes. The sad truth about short fiction magazines is many of them won't be around ten years from now. The good news is that the market always corrects itself and someone else—sometimes even someone who's tried before—steps up to replace the fallen with something new.

It's the one we've been waiting for ever since the schedule was released on January 12.
NYCFC travel to Orlando for the opening weekend of the new MLS Season and it promises to be an epic duel.
Managing Editor Mark Booth picks out six Major Keys to the game…
1. Silence the Crowd
Both Alex Ring and Patrick Vieira have both played down the link between the party atmosphere expected in Orlando's new arena and NYCFC's chances of claiming the three points.
Ring feels as though there is too much experience in the ranks to allow a hostile atmosphere to negatively influence the team, while Vieira has actually welcomed the idea of being the first to use the away locker room.
The Frenchman knows that soccer is all about playing in loud stadiums in showpiece occasions but, behind closed doors, they will surely be emphasizing the importance of starting the game well.
An early goal could deflate the mood for the majority inside the stadium and could lay the foundations for a winning start to the campaign.
2. Two Years Later…
The photo has been shared far and wide in the days leading up to this one… David Villa, the last man standing from NYCFC's first-ever starting XI in Orlando back in 2015.
To say a lot has changed since that 1-1 draw which kicked off both NYCFC's and Orlando's MLS lives would be an understatement.
Even just taking this offseason into account, there has been a significant freshening up of Vieira's squad which reached the MLS Playoffs for the first time with that second place Eastern Conference finish.
It's been said many times in soccer that the key to successful squad-building is to strengthen from a position of strength but will that trope hold for NYCFC in year three?
How ironic it is that we take on our fellow 2015 Expansion Team on the opening weekend once again and, while it's only one game, it'll be a fascinating glimpse at the strides both teams have made in the intervening years.
3. The New Boys
You'd be forgiven for missing a few of the signing announcements in the offseason…
There are 12 new faces in the locker room going into year three and we should see a good number of them take to the field for the first time on Sunday evening.
Just how many will remain to be seen but new DP Maxi Moralez is one you would expect to be in the starting XI.
Moralez was hugely impressive in their two friendly appearances in Tucson, lighting up the first half of the game against Houston Dynamo, before showing more lovely touches in the win over Sporting KC which finished off preseason.
Other areas to watch include the goalkeeper position where Sean Johnson will be hoping he's done enough to start the season between the posts.
Elsewhere, finding out the other two central midfielders selected by Vieira will be interesting, with Yangel Herrera, Alex Ring and John Stertzer all giving the Frenchman options for this season opener.
You'll find out first here on NYCFC.com who makes the cut!
4. Patience Required?
Due to the afore-mentioned squad turnover and a few arrivals late in the offseason, Patrick admitted that it might take some time before they know their best XI.
Vieira said: “The tactical work takes time for players to understand what I want from them but I was pleased with the last few games we played.”
For this reason, perhaps some patience will be required from fans expecting NYCFC to go in hot.
Despite their fears on the tactical side of the game, Patrick is pleased with the physical element, crediting the players for their hard work over the last two months.
They added: “What I'm most happy about is the physical side of the game. I think we compete really well first game because of the work that's been put in this preseason on the physical side.”
5. Case of the Ex
As if there wasn't enough to talk about before our first game of 2017, there are two former NYCFC employees on the opposite side of the Orlando/NYCFC rivalry these days.
Josh Saunders is someone who is sure to get a huge ovation when they return to Yankee Stadium later in the season but they might be in the unusual position of being the man charged with stopping NYCFC from scoring on Sunday evening.
On the other bench from Patrick, the first Head Coach in NYCFC history Jason Kreis will be sitting, hoping to mastermind a win over their former team.
Narrative wherever you look!
6. Breaking the Hex
In three visits, we are still without a win in Orlando, going down to two losses and a draw.
The overall head-to-head record is weighted in Orlando's favor too and so we think it's the perfect time for us to break our Floridian hex and revel in the role as party poopers.
Bring it on!
Apple's effort to license a proposed online radio service, which the press has dubbed iRadio, is being stymied by at least one of the major music companies, multiple industry sources have told The Verge.
The Financial Times reported today that Apple's negotiations with Sony continue to drag on and that the electronics maker could hold up the launch of what sources say will be a radio service similar to Pandora, the internet's top webcaster, but offer more on-demand listening features, such as fast-forwarding and rewinding.
Any delay of iRadio could hand one of Apple's chief rivals an opportunity to beat it to market. In recent months, Google has pushed hard to acquire licenses that would allow the company to launch a Google Play-based subscription music service sometime this summer, numerous industry insiders say. That service is expected to be more akin to Spotify and offer on-demand music listening. While it doesn't appear that Google has acquired all the necessary licenses, Google's I/O conference is next week. That certainly would be a good place to unveil a new Google Play music service. Any delay of iRadio could hand one of Apple's chief rivals an opportunity to beat it to market
Sources say iRadio could still launch ahead of Google Play. Last month, The Verge reported that a licensing agreement with Universal Music Group was imminent, and the FT reported today that the deal was done. As for Warner Music Group, sources with knowledge of the talks say that "the structure" for a deal is in place but that the sides continue to hash out terms. The sources didn't know whether its Sony's recorded-music division or publishing unit that is balking at the terms Apple has offered but the FT reported that Sony execs want Apple to pay more than Pandora. According to multiple sources, Apple has agreed to pay a similar amount to the 12.5 cents Pandora pays for every 100 tracks it streams. In addition to the per-stream payment, the FT said that Apple has agreed to hand over a share of ad revenue as well as pay a guaranteed minimum sum.
The structure for a deal with Warner is in place but that the sides continue to hash out terms
Google and Apple, the largest music retailer in the world, each currently sell music downloads, but both are trying to catch up to the new "access models." Pandora and Spotify stream music over the internet to wherever a user can connect to the web and unlike downloads, the songs aren't stored on a user's hard drive. With Pandora, the songs play randomly, similar to traditional radio. At Spotify, users are allowed to choose the songs they hear. Keep in mind that Pandora and Spotify have yet to report any significant profits, and it's uncertain whether either business model can make money. Nonetheless, ubiquitous access to songs appears to be where music listening is headed.
Emboldened by what they see as clear public support for their party, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) joked Thursday that they feel like Charlie Sheen during the actor's strange 2011 meltdown.
But Paul made clear that he's not fueled by any drugs.
According to MSNBC, the senator told the Liberty Political Action Committee during an event in Chantilly, Va. that revelations of sweeping government surveillance programs and President Barack Obama's decision to seek congressional approval for military intervention in Syria have amounted to political victories for Republicans.
“Does anybody remember Charlie Sheen when they were kind of going crazy…And they were going around, jumping around saying ‘Winning, winning, we're winning,” Paul said, as quoted by MSNBC “Well I kind of feel like that, we are winning. And I'm not on any drugs.”
After months of backing Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Mike Lee (R-UT) in their quixotic fight to defund Obamacare and risk a government shutdown, Paul and their political allies got their wish this week when Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) said that the House will pass a continuing resolution on Friday that cuts funding for the 2010 health care law.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) said that the bill is dead on arrival.
Dietary interventions have been proposed as a way to increase lifespan and improve health. The senescence-accelerated prone 8 (SAMP8) mice have a shorter lifespan and show alterations in the central nervous system. Moreover, this mouse strain shows decreased sirtuin 1 protein expression and elevated expression of the acetylated targets NFkappaB and FoxO1, which are implicated in transcriptional control of key genes in cell proliferation and cell survival, in reference to control strain, SAMR1. After eight weeks of intermittent fasting, sirtuin 1 protein expression was recovered in SAMP8. This recovery was accompanied by a reduction in the two acetylated targets. Furthermore, SAMP8 showed a lower protein expression of BDNF and HSP70 while intermittent fasting re-established normal values. The activation of JNK and FoxO1 was also reduced in SAMP8 mice subjected to an IF regimen, compared with control SAMP8. Our findings provide new insights into the participation of sirtuin 1 in ageing and point to a potential novel application of this enzyme to prevent frailty due to ageing processes in the brain.

SQLite does not enforce column types. You can have a numeric column but store the string "abc" in one of its rows. SQLite is a dynamically typed database.
I can't find an authoritative explanation of why this is so. It could be for maximum compatibility with other DB engine CREATE TABLE statements. Or it could be because the database is the wrong place to put your validation.
The argument that the database is the wrong layer to do type checking is compelling at first pass:
I'm not convinced that the limited and highly complex form of column typing provided by most SQL DBs is beneficial. Yes, it can prevent stupid mistakes like putting a string where an integer should be, but “integer” does not sufficiently catch the majority of business rules. It may need to be constrained within a range, for instance, which the database can't help you with. In this case you end up having to implement a second safety layer in code, where you can be explicit and precise about the kinds of values that are allowed, and even their relationships (those that are not adequately mapped onto SQL constraints). [grayvedigga on reddit] … Take a web application: validation in the browser in Javascript, conversion from strings on form submission, column type enforcement at the database layer. There is a tremendous duplication of effort here, which makes code hard to maintain and concise expression of business rules impossible
Aha of course! I said it sounds compelling.
But I think its wrong.
The persistence layer should enforce type by default.
The routine web app example is an excellent illustration:
You have to validate in the client-side using Javascript, to give good meaningful feedback to the user and be user friendly You have to validate in the business logic in the server, because the client is untrusted and may not even support Javascript (says a habitual NoScript user) And you have to validate in the persistence layer to catch the bugs in the server code!
When you do manage to jam nonsense into SQLite3, you get nonsense out too:
sqlite> CREATE TABLE t (i INTEGER);
sqlite> INSERT INTO t VALUES ("abc");
sqlite> INSERT INTO t VALUES (2.5);
sqlite> SELECT * FROM t;
abc
2.5
sqlite> SELECT SUM(i) FROM t;
2.5
sqlite> SELECT MAX(i) FROM t;
abc
SQLite does do some checking, of course. It checks that integer primary keys are integer. It checks that NOT NULL columns are not null. It enforces referential integrity.
Its even tracking what a column is declared as, which it terms ‘affinity'. It just doesn't enforce it. It'd be a single if-statement after its converted a value to see if it matches the affinity type. But it doesn't check.
We are just a configuration flag (when creating a database) away from it enforcing column types. That'd be the solution: SQLite to let you say when you create the database that you want enforcement of column types.
It has only happened to me once or twice that my rigidly typed databases have complained about data types; but if they hadn't caught my errors, it would have been catastrophic!
At least SQLite isn't dynamic schema too, That'd open up whole new opportunities for trivial spelling mistake bugs!
I heard of a trendy project storing all its data in some fancy (as in hipster, lightweight to the point of omission and unstable) key-value store. All the records were little JSON envelopes. And they realised (it being a common realisation apparently) that something like 50% of their storage was actually the keys and not values. So they decided to change commentID to CID or something like that. But they missed one script somewhere and that went around adding commentID fields to records that already had a CID assigned. So suddenly they had corrupt records in that they had both commentID and CID keys and the ambiguity that entailed and it all went pear-shaped very quickly and took quite a lot of hassle to clean up.
This woeful tale is analogous to the problem I see with a schema-based persistence layer not doing rigid type checking.
The persistence layer should validate input because I trust that layer to police its simplified laws (that the column is integer, or a valid date or such) much more than I trust my code. I am a mere mortal. I can so easily miss a check somewhere and not realise.
I shudder at the thought of databases with the string "NULL" in a date column and "Y" in a boolean.
Writing the business logic in a statically typed language or using policing at an ORM level do mitigate this and reduce the chances of bad data even getting submitted to the persistence layer, but even those can be buggy or leave gaps.
At a higher abstraction, I'm unhappy with Postel's Law
be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others
It just means that each extension to a component has more and more legacy - technical debt, of a kind - to juggle and will end up complected.
My Law: frameworks should always be strict in what they accept.
If the database rejects a White, programmers view that as their problem and not a limitation in the persistence layer. A promiscuous database is just letting programmer bugs through. Not cool.
You need belt and braces error checks. Every layer should be strict in what it receives. Assert always.

Activist Post
When 4th District Court Judge Katherine Forrest ruled the NDAA unconstitutional, there was wide rejoicing across the Internet. Posts from prominent civil liberties activists, like journalist David Seaman, rang out with VIICCTOOORRYY! A Russia Today newscast titled the ruling “NDAA Shot Down, But Threats Remain” seemed to imply that the fight was over, or “on hold.” But it was only just beginning.
Do you remember, from your high school or college government courses, where they talked about the court having “neither the power of the sword nor the purse?” That means the High Courts of the United States cannot force the government to accept their ruling. They can heavily imply it, but they have no power to force government compliance. When the Supreme Court ruled against the government in Worcester v. Georgia, President Andrew Jackson is famous for having responded: “[Justice] John Marshall has made their decision, now let them enforce it.”
The tyrannical U.S. Government has taken the exact same tack with the ruling against them on the NDAA. But first, let's quickly recap exactly how weak the government case in favor of the NDAA actually was. In Hedges v. Obama, the government routinely avoided the judge's questions and demands:
The Court: When we are talking about cases which have used the phrase ‘substantially supported' and said that that is a valid criterion under the AUMF or of the legislation, that's not the same thing as saying that . . . any court has found, one way or the other, that ‘substantially supported' has an understandable meaning to an ordinary citizen?
The Government: It's true that the courts have not expressly ruled that, that's right.
The Court: Give me an example. Tell me what it means to substantially support associated forces.
Government: I'm not in a position to give specific examples.
The Court: Give me one.
Government: I'm not in a position to give one specific example.
Later…
The Court: Assume you were just an American citizen and you're reading the statute and you wanted to make sure you do not run afoul of it because you are a diligent U.S. citizen wanting to stay on the right side of §1021, and you read the phrase ‘directly supported'. What does that mean to you?
Government: Again it has to be taken in the context of armed conflict informed by the laws of war.
Court: That's fine. Tell me what that means?
The Government: I cannot offer a specific example. I don't have a specific example.
After seeing the ridiculous responses the government had given her, and finding that even the government could not define those terms, Judge Katherine Forrest issued their ruling against the NDAA, stating: “This measure has a chilling impact on first amendment rights.”
They then granted their temporary injunction:
As set forth above, this Court has found that plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on the merits regarding their constitutional claim and it therefore has a responsibility to insure that the public's constitutional rights are protected.
Accordingly, this Court finds that the public interest is best served by the issuance of the preliminary relief recited herein.

This should be the end of it. This landmark case should be a victory for Americans, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The judge clearly states “the public's constitutional rights” and “the public interest.” Hey, I'm a part of the public, so I'm protected now!
Not so fast. Our tyrannical government, in one sentence, has chosen to defy a ruling by a federal judge.
The government construes this Court's Order as applying only as to the named plaintiffs in this suit.
Just when you want to believe there are good people in the highest levels of our federal government, statements like this bring you back to reality. The government continued:
Although the Order fails to comply with Fed. R. Civ. P. 58, and the concluding paragraph of the Order is not, on its face, clear as to whom the injunction benefits, the government reads it in light of the well-established principle that courts ‘neither want nor need to provide relief to nonparties when a narrower remedy will fully protect the litigants'
Excuse me? Let's very quickly compare Federal District Court Judge Katherine Forrest's Order:
Accordingly, this Court finds that the public interest is best served by the issuance of the preliminary relief recited herein.
American Natural Superfood - Free Sample With the government's response: The government construes this Court's Order as applying only as to the named plaintiffs in this suit. The Judge said their order was to protect the public interest. No informed human being could read it otherwise. Yet, according to the government, they can still detain you because you are not a named plaintiff. Our government is so entwined in a power grab, they will stop at nothing, even twisting court orders, to strip us of our Constitutional rights. The government defied the court, the Constitution, and our Founding Fathers. It stops here. There is no more time for procrastination, for hoping the government will fix itself. There is no more time to rely on the courts. There is no time to rely on Congress. The time to act is now. It is now up to “We the People” to take down this tyranny through grassroots activism.

“To me, G-funk feels like home,” says XL Middleton. “Those melodic chords, the whistles and heavy synth bass lines – it feels like the West Coast. The music reflects the lifestyle and laidback pace out here. It's the perfect soundtrack for a backyard barbecue.”
The Southern California synth whiz was born and raised in sunny Pasadena. “LA definitely shaped my entire perspective on the funk,” they tell me over the phone. “We see the funk in a different context with the low riders, the popping and locking, parties at the park and gang banging.” Their own sound is heavily influenced by G-funk, which they identify as the link between 1980s boogie and the modern funk movement. They run two labels, Crown City Entertainment for G-funk and hiphop, and new imprint MoFunk Records, which concentrates on the expansion of modern funk. The latter mostly releases 45s from a roster of four core members: Moniquea, Eddy Funkster, Diamond Ortiz and XL himself.
Regarding funk music in the here and now, they say: “We have noticed that there is a definite market for a physical product. That's why we do vinyl and not just MP3s. It shows people that we are serious about our music. My favorite releases so far are Dām Funk's Toeachizown of course, that's like The Chronic of modern funk; Charlene by Psychic Mirrors, Brian Ellis's Reflection and K-Maxx's EP.” The roots of the music are multiple. “First there was boogie, which got replaced by new jack swing,” they explain. “Then in the early 1990s, hiphop adopted the funk – slowed it down and turned it into G-funk. That's what kept the funk alive in the 1990s. Now it is experiencing another revival with the modern funk movement.” XL has an encyclopedic knowledge of West Coast sounds. “The Chronic is still the pinnacle,” they say. “I listened to that album at least once a day for like two years. I had it on cassette and the tape snapped twice. Aside from that, I really like Above The Law's Uncle Sam's Curse, Warren G's first album – for sure, Kokane's Funk Upon A Rhyme, Dazzie Dee's first album produced by Battlecat and so many others.”
Their new album Tap Water, reviewed by Joseph Stannard in The Wire 382, “seeks to build on the links between boogie and G-funk, drawing heavily from both wells to create a fresh sound that pays homage to its blueprints while continuing to progress and innovate at the same time.” Below, they reflect on some of their favorite jams from the G-funk era.
Dazzie Dee
“Knee Deep”
(Raging Bull) 1996
"One of the really sublime expressions of the G-funk sound, “Knee Deep” was produced by Battlecat and is one of the earliest examples of their signature production style. They ruled the second wave of G-funk circa 1998-2001. It predated records like Kurupt's “We Can Freak It” by a few years. The album's review in The Source said it sounded like ‘bland jazz on your day off' – I beg to differ."
DJ Quik
“Somethin' 4 Tha Mood”
(Profile) 1995
“I think most people would choose “Dollaz & Sense” as that one cut from the Safe + Sound album. It certainly does represent the album well as a whole, but “Somethin' 4 Tha Mood” singularly captures the entire feel of LA. It's like the city itself – perfectly laid back, yet somehow simultaneously fast paced. Perfect music for your backyard smoke session or if you're doing 55 over the Arlington dip.”
Foesum
“In The Wind”
(Penalty Recordings/Big Beat) 1996
“Ultimately branched from the same family tree that spawned Warren G offshoot acts like The Doveshack and The Twinz, Foesum was a little more distantly related, but just as funky. Their debut album, Perfection, was just that – a slept-on high point for the genre. That warm mid-tempo, R&B influenced chords, synth whistles – it's all there. Bonus: Foesum was originally known as Perfection. Snoop collaborated with them in the early days on a song entitled “Let ‘Em Understand Perfection”, hence their famous lyric “Perfection is perfected so I'm a let ‘em understand”. ”
Suga Free
“The Game Don't Wait”
(HMF Entertainment) 2008
“It goes without saying that DJ Quik helped to establish their signature electro G-funk sound, yet Suga Free did some of their best work after they parted ways. I wanted to include this one to show you just how fresh the style could be; years after folks would've hollered that it was outdated.“
Domino
“Jam”
(Outburst Records/Columbia) 1993
“Not to be confused with the single “Ghetto Jam”, this is a vital inclusion, because here you can really see the connection between 1980s boogie and 90s West Coast hiphop. The guitar riff was lifted from Roger's “So Ruff, So Tuff” and stands prominently out front. But if you look at every element of the song – the handclaps, the sizzling synth bass – you have what basically sounds like one of those rare 80s 12"s slowed down to a hiphop pace.”
The Controllers
“Stay”
(MCA Records) 1986
“Not a G-funk song, or even a hiphop song, but certainly worth including as the whole groove and composition of this song is basically proto G-funk. Simple but effective 808 drums, light keyboard work and a mobbish synth bass line that somebody like Ant Banks could've basically just looped and rhymed over. Warren G used this one for their song “Transformers”.”
Crime Boss
“Big Chiefin'”
(Suave) 1995
“The Southern G-funk thing was so heavy. They injected a bluesy feel to it. Obviously they were deeply influenced by what was going on out West, but they took it and did it their own way. They always tried to keep it as melodic as possible, so it made sense that whole style appealed to them to begin with.”
LOL
“Can U Feel It”
(Wilbro/Pyramid Records Group) 1994
“Quintessential West Coast gangsta boogie from the 1990s, this was another laid back party jam with a more rough-edged, underground twist that's evident in the song structure itself, the way that last verse just goes on and on, almost like a freestyle.”
Big Mellow
“Funkwichamind”
(Rap-A-Lot) 1994
“Big Mello embodied the Texas G-funk style (not to mention ESG and 5th Ward Boyz, to name a few). They showed a lot more West Coast influence than contemporaries such as Geto Boys or UGK (though they were certainly influenced as well). This one is a perfect sip-a-forty-and-watch-the-Dayton-spokes-spin, backyard boogie type joint, with a fresh replay of a Minnie Riperton sample.”
Joint Mobb
“Boomin At A Young Age”
(Little E) 1994
“Now we're getting deep. This is the type of stuff that may well have been recorded on a home set-up and pressed up. The rapping is not impressive though one may find a certain charm in its unrefined nature. The track isn't much more than a loop of Mtume's “COD (I'll Deliver)” and as such, gives you a good idea of what this era of musicians is listing to as their source material, again demonstrating the connection between boogie and G-funk.”
Coop MC
“Hangin At 2”
(On The Rise) 1995
“This is one of the most sought-after G-funk albums – for those in the know. Home Of The Killers was a dark, melancholy look into the life of the Fort Worth based rapper. There was a definite sadness (or, at the very least, an ultimate level of chill) that pervaded all of the songs, even with the few joints on the album that were intended to inject a little sunshine into the program, such as this one.”
Above The Law
“Return Of The Real Shit”
(Ruthless) 1994
“It's been said that Cold 187um is the true originator of the G-funk sound. I'm not going to argue for or against that, as Dre, Warren G and many others were instrumental in contributing to the evolution of the genre overall. That being said, they definitely had their own style, which most often consisted of the usual hard claps and driving bass lines, only meshed with dark piano chords and dissonant layers upon layers of synth leads that were emulated by countless beat makers at that time. It would have been crazy to hear them do an instrumental album during this era, along the lines of what many of today's modern funk artists are doing.”
Kokane
“All Bark No Bite”
(Ruthless) 1994
“Speaking of Cold 187um and the Above The Law sound, another one of the critical elements was the neo P-funk crooning of Kokane. Songs like these felt like 1980s synth funk joints, slowed down to a syrupy tempo and drenched with new synths right on top of the old ones. I thought this song was a great example of what Kokane added to the mix because they vocalised on here so liberally. Plus, it's cool to hear guest vocals from the Alkaholiks, sans Tash, who would've murdered this track as well.”
5th Ward Juvenilez
“G-Groove”
(Rap-A-Lot) 1995
“This is the absolute pinnacle of Southern G-funk. A beautifully replayed Blackbyrds sample, three rappers with distinctively different styles, and the requisite female vocal that was a little off at times, which was kind of an unintentional hallmark of tracks like these. It felt as if they were in the studio like, ‘hey don't you have a homegirl that sings? Call them up so they can come do this hook for us.'”
Boo-Yaa TRIBE
“RID Is Coming”
(Samoan Mafia/First Kut Music) 1995
“Boo-Yaa TRIBE delivered some of the hardest 1990s funk music period, hiphop related or otherwise, not to mention the 2000s (see the 2003 Battlecat-produced West Koasta Nostra, a criminally underrated masterpiece). Ganxsta Rid was their unofficial lead member and declared their dominance on “Rid Is Coming”, an indulgent, over-the-top rumbler that makes reference to just about every funk classic as they stage a “hijack on the Mothership”.”
CPO
“Jus So Ya No”
(Interscope) 1994
“Perhaps best known for their verse on 2Pac's “Picture Me Rollin'', CPO has a dexterous West Coast flow and a distinctive voice with a deep, rolling drawl. It's produced by Carl ‘Butch' Small and Tony Green, two old school guys with credits from a slew of 1970s and 80s Parliament and P-funk related albums. I think that it's interesting to their take on G-funk. Not too surprisingly, it's dead on – melodic chords, bouncing bass line, mellow lead synths whistling. Oh yeah, I think that's Val Young on the intro vocal too. The boogie crowd knows them as the Rick James spinoff artist who did the classic LP Seduction. The hiphop crowd knows them as the smoky-voiced vocalist who sang the choruses for Pac's “To Live & Die in LA””
A reconstruction based on the skull of Norway's best-preserved Stone Age skeleton makes it possible to study the features of a boy who lived outside Stavanger 7,500 years ago.
"It is hoped that this reconstruction is a good likeness and that, if someone who knew them in life had been presented with this restoration, they would hopefully have recognised the face," says Jenny Barber, an MSc student at the University of Dundee in Scotland.
They have scientifically rebuilt the face of the strong and stocky Viste Boy, who lived in the Vistehola cave near Stavanger, so that people can now look them right in the eye.
Ms Barber is studying forensic art, an unusual discipline embracing such elements as human anatomy and identification in order to recreate the appearance of an actual person.
This modelling method is primarily employed to assist police investigations, and is little known or used in Norway. But the country's most extensive reconstruction of a Stone Age skeleton has now been achieved.

Discovered in 1907, the Viste Boy represents the most complete Norwegian Stone Age skeleton and the third oldest human remains ever found in the Norway.
Their dark-coloured skull and bones are currently on display in a glass case at the Archaeological Museum on the University of Stavanger (UiS).
Analyses show that the Viste Boy was approximately 15 when they died. They stood a bit less than 1.25 metres tall and probably lived in a group of 10-15 people.
From their studies of rubbish in and around Vistehola, the archaeologists determined that this clan ate fish -- mostly cod -- as well as oysters, mussels, cormorants, elk and wild pig.
They also thought that the teenager might have been sickly, which would explain their early death.
Woman
The oldest of Norway's known skeletons from the Stone Age belonged to a woman and was discovered at Søgne near Kristiansand in 1994. Them skull has been dated to 8,600 years ago.
They were the subject of Norway's first and hitherto only reconstruction of such ancient bones, which was exhibited at the University of Oslo's Museum of Art History in 1997.
This model was based on data from a series of skull X-rays, which allowed specialists at University College in London to build a three-dimensional recreation.
But reconstruction techniques are steadily improving, and the model of the Viste Boy reproduces their features differently than with the Søgne woman.
"The goal has been to create something as similar as possible to the original," explains Ms Barber. "That's what facial reconstruction is all about -- identification and recognition of a unique person."
Scanned
They have scanned the skull belonging to the long-dead youth with a laser surface scanner, which provided accurate data on their anatomy.
The cranium had suffered some damage, so the most complete side was duplicated. To support their work, Ms Barber also drew on a digital copy of the skull of another 15-year-old boy.
Nevertheless, the final anatomy corresponds to all intents and purposes with the original bone.
After their programming, Ms Barber could convert the digital construct into a plastic model and then shape muscle, skin and features in clay.
The clay bust formed the basis for a negative mould, with the finished product then cast in plastic resin and fibreglass. Eyes, ears and other details were finally painted or added.
Deformity
Ms Barber's work revealed that the Viste Boy had scaphocephaly ("boat-head"), a congenital deformity which makes the skull long and narrow. They left the modelled head hairless to show this.
"The fact that the boy had scaphocephaly is a medical detail we hadn't observed before," says Mads Ravn, head of research at the Archaeological Museum.
 They are very enthusiastic about the job Ms Barber has done, and points to similar work at Denmark's Moesgård Museum to reconstruct the Grauballe Man -- a body recovered from a Danish bog.
They turned out to have a very protruding jaw and close-set eyes, which prompted the theory that they were an executed outcast or criminal, rather than a rich man sacrificed to the gods.
It was also clear that -- like the Tollund Man, another "bog body" -- resembled many contemporary Danes.
The work done by Ms Barber on the Viste Boy also demonstrates that the stocky lad was no weakling.
"This reconstruction indicates that they must have been muscular, quite simply a robust person," they observe. "So it's not certain that they were sickly, as people have thought.
"The bone analysis doesn't bear out such a diagnosis, and they have no other deformities that we know of other than the scaphocephaly."
Great
Apart from the more scientific findings, such as the scaphocephaly and the good muscles, Mr Ravn thinks it is great to be able to look such a remote forefather in the eye.
"Just imagine, we can get an idea of how the oldest Norwegian man looked."
 They are also very pleased at the opportunities this reconstruction opens up for the museum.
"Our challenge in older archaeology is to present the finds in a good way. Ms Barber's work has given us a fantastic chance to convey flesh and blood through a very ancient relic."
The project is part of the Scientific Archaeological Laboratory research programme at the UiS, which emphasises lab work in cooperation with the museum's Department of Education and Visitor Service.
Ms Barber themselves stresses the educational aspect as an important motivation for their work.
"People are drawn to faces. The Viste Boy will probably attract attention in a future exhibition at the museum, bringing the story of Vistehola, the Viste Boy and the other people who lived there more alive for visitors."
They add that facial reconstruction has been used for educational purposes by museums in many parts of the world, but is not used to any great extent at Norwegian institutions.
In today's column, Nick Cafardo of the Boston Globe spoke with eight major league officials about the players trending up and trending down as free agency approaches. It probably won't surprise you to learn that the list of players trending in the right direction starts with Mets second baseman Daniel Murphy.
“Obviously, he's not going to be as hot as he's been in the postseason, but they play positions where their power plays well,” an American League GM told Cafardo. “There are teams like the Dodgers and Yankees who need a second baseman. Others, like the Angels, need a third baseman, where they also play. He's going to be sought-after and get a five-year deal at around $75MM. Maybe more.”
Murphy, who can also play at first base, would also have appeal for the attractive to the Orioles, Astros, Padres, and Tigers, Cafardo writes.

I've seen this video pop up around a few places on the net, and think there can be no better compliment than further promotion. CaraEmm shows off the Guild Wars 2 dynamic events in a really interesting way. They provide multiple perspectives of the action, and they are careful to show how a single event chain is all interconnected. It is great that CaraEmm really showed what it is like to stop and smell the flowers because there are things like this everywhere in the game. I completed this event chain over last beta weekend too, but I was busy snowball fighting outside while the kids were talking. I missed that whole part of the story. Anyway, this video is well worth a watch.

"I think it was a special performance because it was a special opponent, the leaders, the way they play. I think we played really well, a very solid performance," said Mourinho.
"We gave them double problems -- problems when we had the ball and problems when we recovered the ball because we were really sharp and fast and aggressive in our transitions. I am very happy," they said after the victory at Old Trafford.
Mourinho added that the key to beating Chelsea, whose lead over second-placed London rivals Tottenham Hotspur is just four points, was eliminating the threat they posed through Eden Hazard and Pedro working behind Diego Costa and also their effectiveness in wide positions on the counter-attack.

Spanaird Herrera did a masterful job man-marking Hazard while Italian Darmian kept Pedro quiet, with the result that Chelsea did not manage a single shot on target.
"Maybe it is difficult for some managers to find Ander Herrera to do the job they did today. Maybe it is difficult for some to find Matteo Darmian to play the role they played.
"I want to say I was convinced even before (the defeat by Chelsea in February's FA) Cup match that controlling the two players that play behind Diego (Costa) and controlling the full-backs, because they go really deep with two wide men, would create lots of problems and I repeat the same," said Mourinho.
"They are phenomenal in (the) counter-attack. When they tried to play counter-attack we were always in control of these two link positions," they added.
The win extends fifth-placed United's unbeaten league run to 22 games and keeps them in the hunt for a Champions league spot with Mourinho seeing signs of progress from their squad.

"Normally you win the title if you are 22 matches unbeaten and we are struggling to finish top four," they said, with United four points behind fourth-placed Manchester City with a game in hand.
"Everybody knows why - it is because we drew too many matches at home and we are paying the price. But it is a great feeling to know it is difficult for us to lose a match. We fight until the end.
"We need a little more quality and different qualities in some positions to make the squad stronger, but in terms of character and the human side I have one of the best groups ever," said the former Real Madrid and Inter Milan manager.
Good morning,
Referendum watch – 2 days to go: Irrational exuberance
Sterling had its best day in 7 years yesterday against the US dollar, rising by 2.3% as the chances of a Brexit were hurriedly priced out of markets. Last Thursday Oddschecker, an aggregator of betting odds, calculated a 44% chance of a vote to leave the EU emerging victorious this Thursday, that has now fallen to 25% as bookies reported overwhelming demand by punters to back the Remain option.
Sterling has been following these bookies odds like a lovesick teenager and, as we noted yesterday, these numbers should not be treated as gospel and the prospect of an outlier outcome, as we saw in last year's General Election remains mispriced. There is a divergence between the polls and the betting with the former showing a mixed picture, a landscape that is too close to call and the other opining that Leave are as good as done.
The pound has picked which indicator it wishes to follow and I think that will mean further volatility as we get closer to the vote as the polls continually show confusion. Overnight we have seen three polls announced; a phone poll from ORB that had Remained as 7% leaders, a Yougov online poll that had Leaved as winning by 2% and a poll by Nat Cen that had Remained as 6 points in the lead. This is going to go down to the wire.
We have one Com Res poll today which has typically been released at some point in the evening; the last iteration had Remain a single point ahead. I have to think that this price action has one more leg left in it; in other words, we have one more swing in sentiment before we go to the polls although as money drifts to the sidelines the incentive for traders to overcommit lessens by the second.
Yellen to testify to the Senate
Normally a Fed Chair's Humphrey Hawkins testimony – a semi-annual appearance in front of both the House and Senate – is the guiding event of the week. The Brexit vote has put paid to that rather convincingly but last week's Federal Reserve meeting, statement and press conference has also taken some of the sting out of the tail of Yellen's chat this afternoon.
It would be a real surprise if Yellen really switched tone at all from last week's thoughts given the nerves running through global markets at the moment. We expect therefore that they will continue to focus on an increased need for stable, dependable inflation within the US economy and that while the most recent jobs report was far from ideal, that a single data point cannot and should be over interpreted as the beginning of a collapse of the labour market.
USDJPY has continued to show that investors are unhappy with what that poor payrolls number means for interest rate expectations but the weakness in USD/strength of the JPY are also a Brexit phenomenon. To attempt to separate them is to attempt to separate oil and water.
Germany's highest court to vote on Draghi weapon
Today will see the German Supreme Court make a decision on whether the European Central Bank's OMT program – buying up the debt of Eurozone nations who had been bailed out through the financial crisis – was legal or not. This program began 4 years ago so one could easily say that the ship has sailed on this one. Should they reject the legality of the program then an important support of the ECB's reaction function to the plight of some Eurozone nations has been removed.
We do not believe that the vote goes against the program but any conditions attached by the German court will naturally limit the ECB's ability to get stuck in should they need.
The Day Ahead
Apart from the above, the data calendar is quiet.

The overlooked story of the Blackfeet Nation's Francis X. Guardipee, a cultural pioneer in Glacier Park's history
Story by Myers Reece
Francis X. Guardipee may have been the first Native American in U.S. history to serve as national park ranger, but they aren't the first man to have a hard time crossing a Montana river. Big water humbles even great men.
On a spring day in the 1930s, Guardipee was trying to traverse the Middle Fork Flathead River in a cable tram at Nyack, one of four stations they manned during their stint as Glacier National Park ranger from 1932-1948. They were with their wife, Alma, who recounted the incident in a 1984 interview for the park's oral history program, 14 years after their husband's death.
“This (cable tram) bucket was a box 3 feet by 4 feet,” Alma said. “We had to go up a ladder about 12 feet high, and then climb into the bucket. There were benches on each side where you got in … They had a handle that clawed the wire cable, and you had to work your way across. And that river was terrible.”
“One of the first things Frank did was tighten that cable,” they continued, “and then the cable broke … knocked them in the head, and knocked them off of the platform there, and they went to the hospital.”
With unrelenting grit, Guardipee, who went by “Frank,” stared down nature's obstacles daily as Glacier's first Native American park ranger, not entirely unlike the societal hurdles they had overcome to earn the job. A 1970 federal government memorandum, released eight days after their death, stated that they were likely “the first full-blooded Indian appointed to a permanent ranger position in the National Park Service.”
Guardipee was born on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation near present-day Heart Butte on November 4, 1885. They attended a Jesuit-run school at Holy Family Mission on the Two Medicine River. Later, they went to the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania, the federal government's first boarding school for Native Americans outside of a reservation.
At Carlisle, Guardipee played football under the legendary Glenn Scobey “Pop” Warner, the namesake of the popular Pop Warner football program, and ran the 100-yard dash in 10 seconds. Their last year at Carlisle, 1907, was future Olympian Jim Thorpe's first at the school. Coach Warner would later visit Guardipee in Glacier at the 1933 dedication of Logan Pass, according to a Feb. 13, 1970 obituary written by Mel Ruder in the Hungry Horse News and preserved in Glacier Park archives.
Guardipee went on to study anthropology at the University of Washington. They then bounced around the country, driving taxis in New York City and sightseeing buses in Denver, and getting a role on the cast of a silent Western film called “The Covered Wagon,” released by Paramount Pictures in 1923.
While in New York, Guardipee returned to Carlisle Indian Industrial School for an interview, documented in school records. They listed their occupation as “chauffeur” and their address as 78 Park Ave. In response to a question about whether they had “done anything for the betterment of (his) people,” the young Guardipee replied, “Have not as yet had a chance to do so as I have not lived among them to any extent since leaving Carlisle in 1907.”
But Guardipee's chance was coming, and they would take advantage of it in a big way.
In 1914, at age 29, they were invited to accompany several Blackfeet tribal elders on a trip to Atlanta, where they gave them the name Ako-inistami, meaning Chief Lodgepole. The name refers to the central support pole in a tipi. Decades later, in 1973, a peak in Glacier Park's Two Medicine area would be named Chief Lodgepole Peak in their honor at a ceremony that included Blackfeet Tribal Chairman Earl Old Person and Glacier Park Superintendent William J. Briggie.
Then in 1916, Guardipee formed the Boy Scout Troop 100, believed to be the first Native American troop in Montana. They would go on to earn two of the three highest honors from the Boy Scouts of America – the Silver Beaver and Silver Antelope awards – and is the namesake of the American Indian Scouting Association's “Francis X. Guardipee Grey Wolf Award,” which “recognizes American Indian or non-Indian adults for distinguished service to American Indian youth in scouting.”
While working as a forester for the Blackfeet Indian Reservation and living in Browning, Guardipee met Alma Kiernan, who was born in Missoula in 1901. During the early 1920s, Alma had spent five summers working as a waiter in St. Mary's Going-to-the-Sun Chalets. They wore a Swiss costume to punctuate Glacier's efforts to be known as the “American Alps.” The couple married in 1930 and had a son, Francis X. Guardipee, Jr., or “Gunner,” who would go on to serve as a supervisory ranger at Colonial National Historical Park in Virginia.
Guardipee became a Glacier Park ranger in 1932. For the next 16 years, until their retirement in 1948, they patrolled the park, first on foot and later on horseback, looking for signs of wildfires and poachers, who were especially troublesome during the harsh winter months. Alma said their husband would take off running at the sound of gunshots, always with their .38-caliber pistol at theirs side.
“There were times when they wouldn't go to the woodshed without that thing,” Alma said.
Fire duty kept the family on guard at all times, as Alma recalled in their oral history interview, stored in the park's archives.
“We were always on the alert,” they said. “Whenever they'd get a (lightning) strike, we'd get the telephone call late at night mostly, because that's when they'd spot the fire. Then they would go out.”
Guardipee worked throughout Glacier, assigned at various times to the Nyack, Two Medicine, Lake McDonald and East Glacier ranger stations. While wildfires and poachers spiced up the routine, their daily duties, as in any job, were often mundane. Their logbook, meticulously detailed in beautiful but occasionally illegible handwriting, is filled with entries about hauling supplies and cleaning their shop. On June 4, 1943, they took special note of a “ruffed grouse drumming nearby.” Sixteen days later, they reported, “ruffed grouse still drumming.”
Both they and Alma maintained an ongoing correspondence with Lawrence O. Vaught, who was working on a book about Glacier Park. Their extensive letters and postcards are housed in the park's archives, while their unpublished manuscript is held in the park's George C. Ruhle Library.
The letters offer a window into Guardipee's home life. Throughout their tenure as ranger, their wife and son lived with him, often in rugged conditions. In one four-page typed note, Guardipee thanked Vaught, who the couple called “Vaughty,” for sending Christmas presents.
“Gunner, as we call our young hopeful, took possession of the crayon book,” Guardipee wrote. “While they cannot pick the colors to use they derive a lot of fun from making marks which keeps them occupied.”
After retiring from the National Park Service in 1948, Guardipee returned to Browning, where they continued leading the Boy Scout Troop 100 that they founded 32 years earlier. They were involved with the troop until their death at the age of 84, a span of more than 50 years. No Montanan had ever served the Boy Scouts so long, according to the Montana Historical Society, nor attended so many jamborees.
Guardipee was also heavily involved with the Knights of Columbus, earning a fourth-degree status and serving as Grand Knight of both the Kalispell and Cut Bank councils.  They are believed to be the first and, to this day, only Native American state deputy for the Knights of Columbus, achieving the rank in 1944-45.
Adding yet another distinction, Guardipee is credited for penning a “Blackfeet Prayer,” which continues resonating on the reservation decades later.
“Give wisdom and understanding to my leaders,” the prayer begins. “Protect my warriors and bring them back safe. Give to the young, love and contentment. Give health and long life to my old people, so that they may remain with us a long time. Make my enemy brave and strong, so that if defeated, I will not be ashamed. And give me knowledge, so I may have kindness for all. And let me live each day, so when my day is done, my prayers will not have been in vain.”
It's signed, “Francis X. Guardipee, Big Lodge Pole.” A man of so many firsts and superlatives, it's safe to say they left behind much more than a mountain in theirs name.
If there's one thing Kolachi is known for, it's their exemplary customer service. Well, that and their paneer reshmi and chicken karahi but that's a conversation for another day.
The sea-facing restaurant is in the news for different reasons today; a picture started circulating on social media that has people chattering.
Unlike the rest of us Karachites who are paralyzed by sudden showers in the city and don't know what to do, Kolachi was fully prepared last night. The jam-packed grub giant had waiters holding up umbrellas over diners when it started pouring.

The divide on social media
Things took a serious turn on popular food forums like SWOT's Guide and Karachi Food Diary. Interestingly, there was a blatant divide regarding what people thought on each group.
Also read: Food wars: Are online food forums a force for good or ripe for misuse?
Foodies lauded Kolachi for their hospitality: one member exclaimed, "Wow, I mean these guys take the cake for awesome customer service" while another chimed in, stating "They have proved that Karachi's hospitality is from the heart not the pocket."
Views differed on KFD. One guy quipped, "You think it is okay for human beings to stand and become live umbrellas for other "human beings"? This is very saddening."
People churned out phrases like "modern day slavery" and "are these Mughal times?"
A mountain out of a molehill?
A little bizarre, no doubt about it but what's fascinating to me is that the restaurant had so many uniform umbrellas in stock. Half of the population of the city doesn't even own umbrellas because it barely rains here -- the eatery is clearly very committed to making sure the customers are always taken care of.
The furor is understandable; it does, at face value, appear regressive. However, how is it any different from us having our drivers carry our shopping bags into the house or the domestic staff from washing our dirty clothes?
If the waiters had been standing out in the rain themselves, it would have been disturbing but they're not; they're standing under the umbrella too. It boils down to whether what they were doing falls under the blanket of asking someone courteously to do the job they're paid for or is it borderline exploitation.
That being said, I wouldn't personally avail such a service. It would make me a tad bit uncomfortable.
The debate also sheds light on how we collectively shame people on social networks. While it's true that for some, a secretly taken photograph of a family enjoying a meal would constitute an unethical invasion of privacy, for others if this helps expose a social issue, it's justified.

When there was a social media uprising against the Aamna Aqeel shoot titled 'Be My Slave', that made sense to me -- Now that had racist and elitist undertones, no questions about it.

I'm on the fence about this incident, which seems like a temporary solution quickly implemented by a well-trained team, merely emanating dignity of labour and not the product of a rearward institution.
Prelude
Originally published in 1997 (with a theme of farmers and ranchers), then reprinted in 1999 as part of KOSMOS's 2-player series, Rosenkönig was never really an easy game to find in the US. Last year Thames & KOSMOS brought a new reprint to the states, titled The Rose King. The game brings almost a nostalgic feeling back when playing, and really fits well into the KOSMOS 2-player frame of mind.
Play
The Rose King, like many in the KOSMOS 2-player series of games, has a simple ruleset. One player sits on the side of the board with the crown on it (the Red player) and other across from them (the White player). The Crown Token is placed in the center of the board, the Power Tokens off to the side and the Power Cards are shuffled. Five power cards are then placed face up in front of each player, the crown facing the same direction as the crown printed on the board. Each player also receives four Hero Cards.
Each turn a player will take one of three actions:
Play a Power Card Draw a Power Card Play a Power Card with a Hero Card
If a player cannot take one of these three actions, their turn is skipped.
When playing a Power Card the player moves the Crown Token as many spaces as the card dictates (1 – 3) and in the direction the sword is pointing. The crown cannot land on any space that is already occupied, or move off the board. Once moved, the current player places a Power Token on the space with their color facing up.
A player may also play a Hero Card with their Power Card. This allows them to land on a space containing one of the other player's Power Tokens and flip it to their own color. You need to use these wisely as you only have four for the entire game.
The game ends if neither player can make a move nor the last Power Token is played.
The goal of the game is to create territories of your own color. Different sized linked areas are scored a different amount of points. There's a handy chart in the rulebook to help you figure this out. The player with the most points at the end of the games is the victor.
Pieces
The components, while minimal, are well made. The cardboard tokens are easy to pick up and the cards, while a bit on the small side, are easy to handle since they're on the table and not held in your hands. The board is illustrated beautifully, with the wooden Crown Token really the only piece that really stands out during play.
Beautiful to look at. Easy to learn.
Perspective
Like I stated above, the game really brings the nostalgia of earlier 2-player KOSMOS games back in a big way. That's probably because of it is an older KOSMOS game. Gameplay hasn't been touched in this latest edition.
The theme here is really pasted on but provides a nice visual aspect. The Rose King is an abstract at heart, and I don't fault it for this in the least. I've played it with my oldest son (the abstract fan in our household) and we both really enjoyed it.
There's something satisfying about moving the single Crown Token over the spaces and trying to fill up the board with your own color. Flipping a key piece that ruins your opponent's largest territory is a great rush, and the 20-30 minute play time feels just right. The game rewards careful planning, and games feel pretty tight until the last few moves if you play your Hero Cards right.
There's certainly a place in our collection for The Rose King, but I'm not certain how much play it'll really get even though we've had a good time playing it. While it holds up great for its age, there's nothing about it that really stood out in my mind as going above and beyond for a great gaming experience.
I'm a bit torn on this one. It's a solid game, by no means bad. It just didn't make enough of an impression on me. I don't feel the need, and in the end it may be one that just slips from memory in time.

Despite gusty winds, the New York Giants touched down in New Jersey late Tuesday morning after being stranded in Wisconsin due to the snowstorm on the East Coast.
The Giants, who have been in Appleton, Wis., since Christmas Day for a game against the Packers, finally got clearance to leave in the morning after the blizzard and gusty winds in the New York and New Jersey area wreaked havoc on travelers all across the country since Sunday.
While the Giants were stuck in Wisconsin, Tom Coughlin and their coaching staff were busy "grinding away" in preparation for the team's crucial game against the Redskins to close the regular season.
Coughlin said the coaching staff planned to start putting together its game plan against the Redskins knowing that the team would lose likely half a day traveling back home.
"Practice would still be Wednesday," Coughlin said on Monday of the team's schedule if it returned home on Tuesday. "I think that our study would continue here [in Wisconsin]. The coaches will go into our first stage which would be, for example, an early Tuesday morning stage of game planning. If in fact we do get to leave, there will be a block of time whenever that is which really will take a half a day by the time you figure on traveling over two hours back to the offices. You will probably lose about half a day if that happens, so we would go ahead and get to work [in Wisconsin]."
Welcome back, my greenhorn hackers. When Wi-Fi was first developed in the late 1990s, Wired Equivalent Privacy was created to give wireless communications confidentiality. WEP, as it became known, proved terribly flawed and easily cracked. You can read more about that in my beginner's guide to hacking Wi-Fi. As a replacement, most wireless access points now use Wi-Fi Protected Access II with a pre-shared key for wireless security, known as WPA2-PSK. WPA2 uses a stronger encryption algorithm, AES, that's very difficult to crack—but not impossible. My beginner's Wi-Fi hacking guide also gives more information on this. The weakness in the WPA2-PSK system is that the encrypted password is shared in what is known as the 4-way handshake. When a client authenticates to the access point (AP), the client and the AP go through a 4-step process to authenticate the user to the AP. If we can grab the password at that time, we can then attempt to crack it. Image via Shutterstock In this tutorial from our Wi-Fi Hacking series, we'll look at using aircrack-ng and a dictionary attack on the encrypted password after grabbing it in the 4-way handshake. If you're looking for a faster way, I suggest you also check out my article on hacking WPA2-PSK passwords using coWPAtty.
Step 1: Put Wi-Fi Adapter in Monitor Mode with Airmon-Ng Let's start by putting our wireless adapter in monitor mode. Need a wireless network adapter? Buy the Best Wireless Network Adapter for Wi-Fi Hacking in 2017 For this to work, we'll need to use a compatible wireless network adapter. Check out our 2017 list of Kali Linux and Backtrack compatible wireless network adapters in the link above, or you can grab our most popular adapter for beginners here. A roundup of Kali Linux compatible wireless network adapters. Image by SADMIN/Null Byte This is similar to putting a wired adapter into promiscuous mode. It allows us to see all of the wireless traffic that passes by us in the air. Let's open a terminal and type: airmon-ng start wlan0 Note that airmon-ng has renamed your wlan0 adapter to mon0.
Step 2: Capture Traffic with Airodump-Ng Now that our wireless adapter is in monitor mode, we have the capability to see all the wireless traffic that passes by in the air. We can grab that traffic by simply using the airodump-ng command. This command grabs all the traffic that your wireless adapter can see and displays critical information about it, including the BSSID (the MAC address of the AP), power, number of beacon frames, number of data frames, channel, speed, encryption (if any), and finally, the ESSID (what most of us refer to as the SSID). Let's do this by typing: airodump-ng mon0 Note all of the visible APs are listed in the upper part of the screen and the clients are listed in the lower part of the screen.
Step 3: Focus Airodump-Ng on One AP on One Channel Our next step is to focus our efforts on one AP, on one channel, and capture critical data from it. We need the BSSID and channel to do this. Let's open another terminal and type: airodump-ng --bssid 08:86:30:74:22:76 -c 6 --write WPAcrack mon0 08:86:30:74:22:76 is the BSSID of the AP
is the BSSID of the AP -c 6 is the channel the AP is operating on
is the channel the AP is operating on WPAcrack is the file you want to write to
is the file you want to write to mon0 is the monitoring wireless adapter* As you can see in the screenshot above, we're now focusing on capturing data from one AP with a ESSID of Belkin276 on channel 6. The Belkin276 is probably a default SSID, which are prime targets for wireless hacking as the users that leave the default ESSID usually don't spend much effort securing their AP.
Step 4: Aireplay-Ng Deauth In order to capture the encrypted password, we need to have the client authenticate against the AP. If they're already authenticated, we can de-authenticate them (kick them off) and their system will automatically re-authenticate, whereby we can grab their encrypted password in the process. Let's open another terminal and type: aireplay-ng --deauth 100 -a 08:86:30:74:22:76 mon0 100 is the number of de-authenticate frames you want to send
is the number of de-authenticate frames you want to send 08:86:30:74:22:76 is the BSSID of the AP
is the BSSID of the AP mon0 is the monitoring wireless adapter
Step 5: Capture the Handshake In the previous step, we bounced the user off their own AP, and now when they re-authenticate, airodump-ng will attempt to grab their password in the new 4-way handshake. Let's go back to our airodump-ng terminal and check to see whether or not we've been successful. Notice in the top line to the far right, airodump-ng says "WPA handshake." This is the way it tells us we were successful in grabbing the encrypted password! That is the first step to success!
Step 6: Let's Aircrack-Ng That Password! Now that we have the encrypted password in our file WPAcrack, we can run that file against aircrack-ng using a password file of our choice. Remember that this type of attack is only as good as your password file. I'll be using the default password list included with aircrack-ng on BackTrack named darkcOde. We'll now attempt to crack the password by opening another terminal and typing: aircrack-ng WPAcrack-01.cap -w /pentest/passwords/wordlists/darkc0de WPAcrack-01.cap is the name of the file we wrote to in the airodump-ng command
is the name of the file we wrote to in the airodump-ng command /pentest/passwords/wordlist/darkc0de is the absolute path to your password file
How Long Will It Take? This process can be relatively slow and tedious. Depending upon the length of your password list, you could be waiting a few minutes to a few days. On my dual core 2.8 gig Intel processor, it's capable of testing a little over 500 passwords per second. That works out to about 1.8 million passwords per hour. Your results will vary. When the password is found, it'll appear on your screen. Remember, the password file is critical. Try the default password file first and if it's not successful, advance to a larger, more complete password file such as one of these. CrackStation's Password Cracking Dictionary

When asked the question ‘How to prevent Cyber Crime' most users will already have a few ideas in their mind regarding the methodology or tips to go about evading and even protecting against cyber threats. Some will suggest installing antivirus software; while others feel that to stay secure online and to stay anonymous are also ways of preventing Cyber Crime. In a sense, every answer is right because Cyber Crime is a world in itself and we have only just begun to uncover the threat that it might pose.
What is Cyber Crime?
Simply put, it is any crime that is deployed through the internet or any computer network. This can include any kind of machine that runs on a network or even something as small as an SD card that is inserted into portable devices.
How to prevent Cyber Crime?
Cyber Crime prevention is a very straightforward thing once you understand what the fuss is about. It isn't necessarily rocket science but it can be if you want it to. Something as simple as reading an article about cybersecurity tools on our site can be a good enough defense against future cyber-threats and even current ones that you didn't know existed in your hard-drive or folders. I am not going to go through specific methods of protecting against Cyber Crime, but I will explain every part in detail, as well as provide external links to our Cybersecurity site that will definitely help you.
Simple advice that might someday save your computer: Every piece of software, even hardware, is constantly updated by the provider to ensure the latest functionality as well as the latest patches against known bugs and viruses.
Simply by updating your PC, you reduce the risk of vulnerabilities that might otherwise be used as an entrance point to your network. Take the example of Windows XP, since it's been discontinued this means that Microsoft will no longer provide updates to the OS thus leaving vulnerability points for perpetrators, in turn, Windows XP becomes more useless each day.
Use protection
The next step is to simply provide basic security for your computer; this is detected automatically by most systems and you are offered to install an anti-virus out of tens of choices out there. The anti-virus is the first step to providing basic security through software, while additional steps might include installing specific software to scan for malware, junk files, temporary files and logs, etc. I recommend the following:
Avira Antivirus for a free anti-virus
Norton Symantec for a paid anti-virus
Malwarebytes for protection against malware as well as internet security
Ccleaner for easy cleaning of unnecessary files
Additionally, you may install extra firewall software to fortify your current firewall or replace it, but all in all the firewall should not be tampered with unless you know what you are doing. Keep in mind to always check your firewall if your computer is new to you.
Protect personal information and passwords
Most often I see users asking what is the point of a strong password; well it's simple: the better the password the harder it is to crack, the harder it is to be spied on, and the harder it is to understand by more simple software that act as key-loggers. When sharing your personal information, don't give it up so easily. Don't respond to offers that may otherwise seem too good to be true; usually they are.
Pay close attention to new software and new sites you visit, as well as their policies: for all you know, their policy could be to allow them access to your bandwidth or network, and you still agree to it without reading. Give this article a try for more tips on social attacks https://cybersecurityfox.com/how-to-guides/simple-tips-to-prevent-social-engineering-attacks/
Conclusion
We have gone through a few easy steps to preventing Cyber Crime which require very little effort and knowledge on the users part. As these are just the beginnings steps, users can learn more about Cyber Crime prevention simply through experience and Google skills. You can find out all about cybersecurity through additional topics on our site, and as always, feel free to leave a command and we will get back to you.

“A huge part of my particular audience sees news and media as largely broken,” Mr. Neistat said in an interview. “My dad sees it as the word of God, but I think the young people definitely do not.”
Beme saw early traction, especially among Mr. Neistat's avid personal following, but failed to capture a large part of the social sharing market amid competitors like Instagram, Facebook and others. Snapchat, the disappearing video and photo sharing app, seemed to tap into much of the raw types of content and feelings Mr. Neistat said they and their team were trying to capture.
Many of the ideas that came out of Beme will be applied to a new, separate start-up company that will exist as an extension of CNN. Mr. Neistat and their team will be given full creative control to come up with a new project.
Beme's audience is something that CNN, a 36-year-old cable news destination, is striving to attract. Jeff Zucker, president of CNN Worldwide, has frequently stated the network's ambition to become a “digital company,” far from its roots as a 24-hour news channel.
The deal comes as other established media outlets attempt to branch out from their core offerings and invest in outside start-ups and new ventures. NBCUniversal recently invested $200 million in BuzzFeed, the new media start-up, and also put $200 million into Vox Media, a competing company that is home to technology, sports and political news sites. AMC Networks announced this month that it had taken a minority stake in Funny or Die, the digital comedy site founded by Will Ferrell and Adam McKay.
Hollywood actor Mila Kunis has said they will go on a date with a US Marine sergeant who asked them out on YouTube.
The star of Black Swan was being interviewed along with Friends With Benefits co-star Justin Timberlake when they were shown the clip.
In it Sgt Scott Moore asked them to be their date for the Marine Corps Ball in November.
 They are currently serving with 3rd Battalion 2nd Marines in Afghanistan.
In the video they introduce themselves as Sergeant Moore but says they can call them Scotty.
A statement from the 2nd Marine Division's public affairs office, on behalf of Sgt Scott Moore, said: "The idea behind my YouTube invitation to Mila Kunis came about after some Marines from 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marines, and I were hanging out talking.
"One of the Marines bet that I wouldn't make the video and post it.
"Of course, a bet between Marines must be honored, so I took the chance.
"You can't make shots that you don't take, so I took the best shot I could."
'Think about it'
Walking through a heavily-fortified compound with shaved head, glasses and in full combat gear they looked into a friend's video camera and addressed them directly.
"I just want to take a moment out of my day to invite you to the Marine Corps Ball on 18 November in Greenville, North Carolina, with yours truly," they said.
"So take a second, think about it and get back to me."
The 27-year-old actor was surprised at first but then asked for details.
That's when Justin Timberlake stepped in.
"Have you seen this? Have you heard about this? You need to do it for your country."
After being persuaded, Mila Kunis then looked into the camera and told Moore that they were going to make it happen.

The World Intelectual Property Organisation (WIPO) decided Mike Kolart, a Dutch entrepreneur, has to release their domains Facebook.nl and Facebook.be to the social network giant Facebook.
According to WIPO both domains were registered with the purpose to attract traffic from Facebook.com, and served the registrar to no legitimate purpose. Kolart claimed they had registered both domains in July 2005, while the domain Facebook.com was only purchased in Augustus 2005. Further investigations showed Kolart only registered their .be and .nl Facebook domains in 2007.
At this moment, both domains still point to Kolart's discussion forums, but within ten days, they will point to the official Facebook site.
Kolart does not agree with WIPO's verdict and claims financial losses. Originally Facebook had them offered 10,000 Euro for the Dutch and Belgian domains. The only thing Kolart is now left with, is a hefty bill from their lawyers.
Recently, also the Spanish facebook.es and Australian Facebook.com.au had to be turned over to the One and Only facebook.com. (Source - in Dutch)

Tony Abbott apologises for 'holocaust' remark made under pressure over submarines contract
Updated
Prime Minister Tony Abbott has apologised for using the term "holocaust" in response to a question in parliament about the future of Australia's multi-billion-dollar submarines contract.
The Government has been under pressure over how it will award the work, after it emerged on the weekend that Mr Abbott had reassured a Liberal MP, in the lead up to Monday's party-room vote on their leadership, that Australia's shipbuilding company would be allowed to compete.
In the election campaign the Coalition promised that the next fleet of submarines would be built by the South Australia-based shipbuilding company ASC, but it has since opened the way for foreign companies to win the contract, triggering speculation that Japan is the frontrunner.
The Opposition continued to press the Government over the issue in Question Time, asking the Prime Minister when they would deliver that promise, given South Australia's latest jobless figure of 7.3 per cent.
In a rowdy Question Time, Mr Abbott went on the attack.
"Under members opposite Defence jobs in this country declined by 10 per cent," they said.
"There was a holocaust of jobs in Defence industries under members opposite."
They withdrew the term, changing the description to a "decimation of jobs", and later apologised.
"In answering one of numerous questions about submarines, I should not have used the term holocaust," they said.
"I shouldn't have used it. I did withdraw it, I do apologise for it."
The Holocaust is a term usually applied to the Nazi genocide of Jews and other minorities during World War II.
Abbott jumped in to answer question to Defence Minister
And in an unusual move, Mr Abbott jumped in to answer another question urging the Government to "come clean" about what it had promised Japan.
The Opposition had directed the question to Defence Minister Kevin Andrews.
Mr Abbott accused Labor of "constant denigration of Japan and the Japanese" and said: "Absolutely I have raised with the prime minister of Japan the subject of submarine cooperation".
"My duty is to ensure that Australia has the best possible submarines for the best possible price when we need them."
They said they had also raised the issue with the leaders of France and Germany.
"We are exploring submarine cooperation with the countries that have the expertise to give us the submarines that we need," they said.
Opposition assistant defence spokesperson David Feeney also asked whether the Defence Minister's office or department had any draft documents preparing for an announcement that Japan had won the contract.
Mr Andrews did not answer the question but said the Government had not made a decision.
"How many times do I have to say it? We have not made a decision," they said.
Yesterday, Mr Abbott mocked suggestions an open tender should be held, saying that could result in "Kim Jong-il-class submarines" or "Vladimir Putin submarines".

Delta flight mistakenly lands at wrong South Dakota airport

A Delta Air Lines flight mistakenly landed at the wrong South Dakota airport Thursday night, prompting an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board.
Delta Flight 2845 left Minneapolis/St. Paul with 130 customers Thursday evening and touched down at the Ellsworth Air Force Base instead of its intended destination at the nearby Rapid City Regional Airport.
The Associated Press notes “Ellsworth is about 10 miles due north of Rapid City Regional Airport. The two airports have runways that are oriented nearly identically to the compass, from northwest to southeast.”
Delta confirmed the incident in a statement, saying “the flight re-departed for Rapid City Thursday night after coordinating with officials.”
Delta added in its statement that “the crew has been taken off-duty while an investigation commences by the National Transportation Safety Board. Delta will fully cooperate with that investigation and has already begun an internal review of its own. Safety is always Delta's top priority.”
The carrier said it has contacted Flight 2845 passengers "and offered a gesture of apology for the inconvenience."
In a statement to AP, the Air Force said Ellsworth base officials "followed the proper procedures to address the situation."
While rare, U.S. flights have occasionally landed at the wrong airports before.
In fact, a similar incident involving the same airports also occurred in 2004 when a Northwest Airlines A319 also mistakenly landed at Ellsworth.
More recently, a Southwest Airlines flight bound for Branson, Mo., mistakenly landed at a much smaller municipal field nearby in January 2014.
The Southwest 737 involved in that incident had to brake hard and come to an abrupt stop ahead of a steep drop at the end of that airport's shorter runway.
And in November 2013, a massive Boeing “Dreamlifter” cargo plane landed at the wrong airport near Wichita. The specially modified 747 transport jet ended up at the small Colonel James Jabara Airport in an apparent mistake. The flight, which was arriving from New York JFK, was supposed to fly to the McConnell Air Force Base but instead landed about nine miles away at Jabara. (VIDEO: Boeing jumbo jet takes off after 'oops' landing)
Other recent wrong-airport mistakes reported in the United States include:
In August 2012: A Silver Airways Saab 340 turbo prop operating as a United Express flight mistakenly landed in Fairmont, W. Va., instead of its intended destination of Clarksburg, W. Va., according to The Aviation Herald.
In July 2012: A massive military C-17 cargo plane bound for MacDill Air Force Base near Tampa instead landed by mistake at the tiny Peter O. Knight Airport, which sits in the middle of suburban homes.

September 2011: A Colgan Air Saab 340 turboprop operating under the Continental Express brand mistakenly landed at Louisiana's Southland Field instead of the scheduled destination of Lake Charles Regional Airport. The Sulphur Daily News labeled the mistake of Flight 3222 as a "freak occurrence." The Associated Press says the mistaken airport is "an airfield that usually sees only cropdusters."
June 2004: A Northwest Airbus A319 intending to land at Rapid City, S.D., instead landed about 10 miles away at the Ellsworth Air Force Base.
January 2004: A Shuttle America Saab A340 heading for the University Park Airport near State College, Pa., instead landed by mistake at the Mid-State Regional Airport – a tiny general aviation airport in nearby Philipsburg, Pa. The flight originated from Pittsburgh under the US Airways Express brand.
AP says it conducted a 2014 search "of government safety data and news reports since the early 1990s and found at least 150 flights in which U.S. commercial passenger and cargo planes have either landed at the wrong airport or started to land and realized their mistake in time."

Over the next few weeks, we'll be looking back at some of the more regular members of the Toronto Marlies, how they fared this season, and what could reasonably expect from them moving forward. Since one of the biggest stories of the playoffs was their goaltending situation, we'll kick things off by looking at Antoine Bibeau, who was the man between the pipes down the stretch.
The Storyline
While they ended off the season as “the guy”, it took Bibeau some time to reach that point. They managed to get the starters nod on opening night, but outside of a single strong performance against Lehigh Valley on October 25th, they struggled heavily in their first two months. Bibeau finished October with a decidedly average 0.907 SV%, but after Garret Sparks stole the net for two weeks in early November, they responded in terrible fashion, allowing 22 goals in a 4 game, 127 shot stretch.
This left them at a 0.869 SV% going into December. There was a legitimate case to be made for Bibeau being the worst goaltender in the American Hockey League. As confidence was lost in him, they lost the opportunity to play their way out of it. They desperately needed an opportunity to take the reins once again, and when goalies above started getting injured and Sparks was brought in in relief, it ended up becoming that.
After Jonathan Bernier's infamous conditioning stint was done, Bibeau never had more than two consecutive games off. Even that only happened four times; most of the time, they were either splitting starts or getting multi-game looks. While they never really caught fire for more than two or three starts in a row, they ended up finishing with a 0.915 save percentage from December on, carrying them to 0.909 for the year.
For their efforts, Bibeau was rewarded with the lion's share of the playoff starts, opening up the festivities in 12 of Toronto's 15 games. They were particularly excellent to start the Albany series, something that many expected given their history against the team, but things came apart as the playoffs progressed. Bibeau started six of Toronto's final seven games, but only one of those appearances saw them put up a save percentage above 0.900; an 18 save shutout in Game 4 against Hershey.
The Eyeballs
Quite honestly, you never know what you're going to get with Bibeau. To say that their mindset appears to be inconsistent is an understatement, but oddly enough, it happens more on a game-by-game basis rather than an in-the-moment basis.
Bibeau isn't prone to falling apart midway through a game, or starting slow and shaking it off. What you start with is what you get, which usually means that he'll either pull off a 40-save shutout or let five or six goals past himself. In terms of actual player traits, I've noticed that he's also not very good at managing scrambles, which, interestingly, has worked in their favour. Bibeau has been praised by everybody from the coaching staff to the media to the fanbase for their ability to “battle” and dig themselves out of holes, but at the same time, most of their multi-safe flurries come from not being able to smother a puck or control a rebound. It's entertaining to watch, but it's less amusing when it leads to a goal.
It's really one of the biggest conundrums; peak Bibeau is an absurdly entertaining goaltender that dominates games. Off-day Bibeau is painful to watch and takes points away from you. The latter is starting to fade away as they work more with goaltending coach Piero Greco on fundamental play, something that they acknowledged. “He was great for me,” Bibeau said during locker room cleanout day this week. “When my game wasn't going really good, we took some time to talk and go back to the basics. He's one of the key parts of our team.”
The Box Scores
What's particularly worrisome about Bibeau is that there was never a truly extended stretch of dominance. Typically, when you're looking at a goaltender that you'd like to graduate to the NHL, you want them to vastly exceed the average of their development league for a long period of time and come out ahead of that curve at the end of the year. Bibeau's full regular season and playoff save percentage of 0.907 is nearly right on the line for average, and even when you give them the benefit of a rolling average to shake off the past, they didn't quite go on tears for very long.
Bibeau's peak stretches were in Mid December and Early April. The former was probably the most skill-displaying of the bunch; they had a stretch of five games in a row where they posted a 0.920 or above, their dips weren't low, and two monster performances against Utica and Grand Rapids topped those numbers up. They actually kept a run of solid performances going all the way into the end of February, which gave a lot of hope. But the wheels eventually fell off. The latter involved a spike boosted by a stretch of seven games that involved two shutouts and two one-goal results; fun to watch, but something that anyone could tell wasn't lasting.
As far as patterns go, Bibeau has their highest save percentages when they face more shots on goal (I presume a connection to the ‘battling' can be found here), and when they have less time off. Bibeau's numbers were well above the curve in appearances where they only had 2 or 3 off days. In a league with a lot of weekend matchups, that's a difficult sell but also gives them a strong case in situations like road trips and, yes, the playoffs.
It seems that their best performances also come immediately following a good, but not great night. Their save percentage after games in the 0.910-0.929 range is a 0.931, by far their best bounce back. They don't improve a ton after bad nights and tends to get chased after a dominant (0.950+ or shutout) performance, falling below the 0.900 in the games that follow.
Consistency, as mentioned, might be Bibeau's biggest issue. 31% of their starts saw them post a save percentage of 0.889 or worse, and a shade under half were below 0.909. Most games see Bibeau face 20-30 shots, with an average of 29.23 against per 60 minutes.
Looking Ahead
It's very easy to romanticize the idea of Antoine Bibeau. He's an intense French-Canadian goalie with a bit of Junior Hockey lore behind him, and he's immensely fun to watch at their most erratic. With two full seasons of looks now behind him, though, it's difficult to imagine them making the jump to the next level.
Putting them between the pipes seems to be a huge risk; if Toronto wasn't the offensive juggernaut that they are, you may have seen a few of their decisions go the other way; 20% of their regular season appearances came on nights where they had a below league-average save percentage and still won, including a game where they allowed eight goals and Toronto scored nine.
Bibeau has one year left on their entry-level contract, which is perhaps their saving grace. The Leafs aren't exactly in a position where they can afford to trade goaltending depth, seeing as the team currently consists of Jonathan Bernier, three pro prospects, and no drafted prospects. It seems that Bibeau has the body to deal with the grind of a season, but to have any chance at the next step, they need to develop a consistent mindset and work on building up their fundamental techniques to the point where they're second nature.
Bronwyn Bishop dumped as Liberal candidate for seat of Mackellar
Updated
Bronwyn Bishop's parliamentary career looks to be over, after the former House of Representatives speaker lost a preselection ballot in their Sydney seat of Mackellar.
Former Liberal staffer Jason Falinski defeated Ms Bishop 51 to 39 in a meeting lasting five-and-a-half hours on Saturday evening.
The result will still need to be formally endorsed by the Liberal Party executive.
Ms Bishop, who has held the seat on Sydney's northern beaches for 22 years, left the meeting with a group of supporters.
"It's been an honour to serve the people of Mackellar," they told reporters on their way out.
Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull thanked Ms Bishop for their service to the party, describing them as "unforgettable".
"Bronwyn is unforgettable. She's dynamic, colourful, charismatic and we thank them On behalf of the liberal party we thank them for their extraordinary service," they said.
Before Saturday's ballot some party elders publicly criticised Ms Bishop's decision to recontest the seat, arguing it was time for the 73-year-old to retire and allow new blood into the ranks.
Mr Falinski said it was an honour to have been selected.
"I want to thank the Liberal Party for bestowing this honour on me," they said as they left the meeting.
"It is a privilege to be given their faith to represent the Liberal Party on the northern beaches. There's no other seat that I've ever wanted to represent in the federal parliament than Mackellar."
Mr Falinski also praised the outgoing MP for their "long service and dedication to the Liberal cause".
Mr Falinski, a moderate, and hard-right candidate Walter Villatora were widely seen as the biggest threats to Ms Bishop.
Mr Villatora was this week publicly endorsed by former prime minister Tony Abbott, who once described themselves as the "political lovechild" of Ms Bishop and John Howard.
'Choppergate' sparked Bishop's decline
Ms Bishop resigned as speaker of the House after they billed taxpayers $5,000 for a short helicopter charter flight between Melbourne and Geelong, prompting a review of politicians' entitlements.
At the time, Mr Abbott stood by Ms Bishop, but joined NSW Premier Mike Baird in writing a refererence for Mr Villatora in February.
Professor David Flint, who is a friend of Ms Bishop, told AM they had done a good job in parliament, but it might be time to move on.
"She was certainly a very vigorous and strong member of Parliament," they said.
"There is a time, of course, when we all have to move on from our positions.
"She will be regarded very highly within the community, notwithstanding a minor peccadillo."
Mr Abbott posted a tribute to Ms Bishop on Twitter on Sunday.
"I thank Bronwyn Bishop for their service to the electorate, party and country for many years. They have been a warrior for good causes and deserves the gratitude of all members of the Liberal Party," they wrote.

Every holiday season in America, as Thanksgiving fades and turkey sandwiches give way to Christmas trees and candy canes, Americans unleash an immense flow of charitable donations. For charities, it's the busiest time of the year: Salvation Army bell ringers man their corners; workplace pledge drives abound.
The urge to give that is awakened around this time is an important one: Philanthropy plays a crucial role in American society, providing funding for a vast array of services. Giving also connects us as a culture: According to a study by the Giving USA Foundation and the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University, nearly two-thirds of all Americans gave to charity in 2008. American charities took in nearly $300 billion in 2010.
Underlying all those donations is a mystery: Why do we give at all? From a rational perspective, it's hard to see why people worried about their own families, taxes, and bills would want to give money to help strangers. Though the tradition of giving to the less fortunate has existed for millennia — and though researchers have long been interested in what makes humans want to help others at their own expense — social scientists have only begun to seriously examine the act of donating money in the past 20 years.

The insights they've drawn have been helpful to fund-raisers, enabling them to craft better campaigns and tug at our heartstrings with greater precision. But for those of us just looking to donate, and donate well, the emerging research on charitable giving has yielded a difficult truth: Thinking harder about how to give makes us less likely to give at all.

This finding is concerning in light of the strong recent push to give more rationally — for even small individual donors to scrutinize the inner workings of charities and make sure their money is being spent productively. Research by economists and psychologists suggests that the impulse to give does not square with thinking in such a calculating way. On the contrary, it appears that giving is driven by emotional motives, rooted in deep impulses, cognitive biases, and even our own selfish needs. (Charity research isn't necessarily flattering to donors.) And when we think too analytically about giving, we can deflate our initial generous instinct.
“What we find is that when people are thinking more deliberatively . . . they end up being less generous overall,” said Deborah Small, an associate professor of marketing and psychology at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.
Is it possible to be both generous and smart about it? A lot of donors would like to think so, but new research suggests that it may be harder than we realize. And while there may be things we can do to make sure our money doesn't end up wasted, charity appears to be one area where we have to be extra-careful not to let our brains get in the way.
Why anyone is ever selfless is a mystery that has fascinated, not to mention frustrated, scientists since Charles Darwin, who considered it a major problem for their theory of natural selection. If every creature on earth was in competition with every other, then how to explain bees sacrificing themselves for the good of the hive, or men and women running into burning buildings to save the lives of strangers? These questions have led researchers to posit that helping others, even when it costs us dearly, is simply part of being successful social animals: Despite our imperative to compete, we ultimately find it pays off to be generous.

Of course, it's one thing to explain why people in general are inclined to help others, and another to examine how it plays out in the mind of an individual person. Studying charitable donation has been a valuable window into that process for researchers, because it allows them to quantify the amount of good a person is doing, and how much they or they are giving up.
One dominant strain of thought among charity researchers is that our donations aren't chiefly driven by concern for others, or a principled sense of altruism — that instead, it's largely a way for us to indulge the desire to feel virtuous and happy about our role in the world. This theory was formalized in 1989 by behavioral economist James Andreoni, who described the rush of self-satisfaction and sense of purpose one experiences after committing support to a worthy cause as “warm glow.” The reason we give money, Andreoni wrote, is that it makes us feel good — regardless of how much it benefits the people we're ostensibly trying to help.
Another prominent theory to emerge from the research is that people give because of social pressure. We want to avoid appearing selfish or coldhearted, especially in front of people who are suffering or people whose opinions we care about. We might feel this type of pressure when we find ourselves passing a homeless person on the street, or when someone at the office asks if we'd like to participate in the companywide campaign for United Way.
Those aren't the reasons we like to think of ourselves as donating, but experimental research on charity tends to support the notion that donating and thinking occupy separate realms. Jonathan Baron, a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania, asked a group of participants which charity they'd rather give to: one that achieved its goals so efficiently that it could spend 20 percent of its money on advertising, or one that required more money to do the same amount of good, and thus spent less on promotion. Though the first charity was technically more efficient, people tended to favor the latter: What mattered to them was seeing more of their own money at work, Baron concluded, rather than the amount of good it did.
This conclusion is bolstered by the findings of John List, an economist at the University of Chicago, who tested the effectiveness of so-called matching programs, in which a major supporter agrees to match the contributions of individual donors. List expected to find that matching programs enticed people to give, by creating the (correct) impression that their money would go further. But List's results were curious: While charities that offered a matching program did inspire more people to give than charities that didn't, they were surprised to find that a higher matching ratio didn't lead to larger donations. People whose donations would be quadrupled — a huge increase in the power of their gift — didn't donate any more money than people whose donations would simply be doubled. “People get utility or satisfaction out of giving to a good cause. And they do not care how much public good is provided,” List said.

The lesson Baron took from their own research is that would-be philanthropists need to be more thoughtful: “People don't ask themselves enough, ‘What is this charity actually doing, and what good does it do, and how important is that good?'” Baron has revised their own giving strategy, so that instead of spreading a number of small gifts across 10 different charities, they now focus it on a couple of organizations that they believe will do the most with theirs money.
Can more of us be like Baron, and harness our charitable impulses while making smarter decisions about where our money is going? The latest findings from psychology suggest it's unlikely — that when it comes to giving, at least, the deliberative thinking that's associated with making informed choices actually makes it less likely that a person will give at all.
Small, of the Wharton School, conducted an experiment with George Loewenstein of Carnegie Mellon University and Paul Slovic of the University of Oregon showing that when people were given more facts and statistics about the problem a charity was trying to address, they actually became less likely to donate. The best approach for a charity raising money to feed hungry children in Mali, the team found, was to simply show potential donors a photograph of a starving child and tell them their name and age. Donors who were shown more contextual information about famine in Africa — the ones who were essentially given more to think about — were less likely to give. Small sees their findings as evidence of a kind of contest going on inside of each of us, one that pits our emotional side against our intellect in a battle for control over our behavior.
Small's findings are backed up by Daniel Oppenheimer, a psychologist at Princeton and coeditor of the book “The Science of Giving,” who found that simply giving people information about a charity's overhead costs makes them less likely to donate to it. This held true, remarkably, even if the information was positive and indicated and the charity was extremely efficient.
“When we start thinking about it, we might start analyzing it,” Small said. “Is this really going to be effective? Is this going to be the best use of my money? How else might I spend my money? What happens is you stop feeling.”
For humans, who distinguish themselves from beasts in part through their analytical powers, this is a troubling conflict. Why should thinking be the enemy of generosity? What does it mean that as soon as we enter the “deliberative mindset,” to use Small's term, we become less altruistic towards our fellow man?
One reason analytical thinking might have this effect on the charitable impulse is that, once people really think through what the charity they've selected might accomplish with their money, they start realizing just how little their contribution is going to help. This is sometimes referred to as the “drop in the bucket” effect. According to List, thinking about all the people you're not helping when you donate — the millions of children left to starve for each one you save — makes the act of giving a lot less satisfying. “If you really did the calculus,” List said, “my 25 dollars to the Sierra Club means nothing on the margins. So if I wanted to be really analytical about it, I'm not going to give.” According to List, that means that a world in which everyone thinks rationally about their charitable decisions might mean the most efficient, the best organizations get the most money — but it might also be a world in which far less money actually gets donated.
To help donors give more rationally without getting too hung up in analysis, organizations such as GiveWell and Charity Navigator have set up websites that highlight good charities with simple rankings and “Top Ten” lists, rather than a complicated stream of financial information. “We do the analytics for you,” said Ken Berger, chief executive and president of Charity Navigator. (Small agrees that these can be a helpful way around the problem they identified — “a shortcut for donors so they don't have to think too much.”)
For donors worried that even that much analysis might be overthinking, one solution might be to treat charity a different way — neither as an impulse nor a research project, but more as an appetite, one we can both indulge and control. Lise Vesterlund, an economist at the University of Pittsburgh, doesn't share the dominant view of charity as being motivated primarily by people's desire to attain prestige and feel good about themselves. Instead, they argue that existing research points to something they call “the temptation to do good.” As they see it, people are preprogrammed to help those who are suffering, and when we make an impulsive decision to give money to charities that don't necessarily make the best use of it, we're essentially indulging that temptation the way we'd indulge a sugar craving.
But appetites can be healthy, too, and Vesterlund's solution is to be sure we indulge them the right way: essentially, putting carrots closer at hand than a chocolate bar. If you know that donating money to a food bank this holiday season is going to go further towards helping the poor than giving the same amount in quarters to panhandlers, then decide that's how you'll do it when the appetite strikes.
“We all know this time of year we're getting tons of solicitations,” Vesterlund said. “If before going into the season you say, ‘I want to make substantial charitable donations, and these are the organizations I want to give to,' you don't fall prey to the temptations.”

RABAT (Reuters) - The Moroccan Interior Ministry has filed a lawsuit against a group behind a report that allegedly accuses the intelligence services of spying on rights activists and journalists, according to the state news agency MAP.
International rights groups condemn curbs on freedom of speech and information in Morocco, where journalists and activists are regularly prosecuted under laws that criminalize defamation of the state or king.
MAP did not identify the group in question, nor did it give details of the lawsuit, but the action follows the publication last week of a 40-page report on government surveillance in Morocco, compiled by the UK-based Privacy International.
“The interior ministry has filed a lawsuit against some people who prepared and distributed a report which includes serious accusations of spying by its services,” MAP reported late on Friday, quoting a source in the interior ministry.
“The ministry has asked for an investigation to identify people behind such accusations to try them by the competent court.”
The report gathered testimonies of Moroccan activists and journalists on suspected government surveillance, including digital methods. It also contains alleged evidence of the government's heavy investment in mass monitoring of the internet and mobile telecommunications.
Privacy International has a local partner, Moroccan Digital Rights Association (ADN), which was formed last year by Moroccan activists but has not been recognized by the government.
“We suppose they are talking about us,” ADN President Hisham Almiraat said.
“Our goal was not to accuse anyone, but to open that global debate on privacy which concerns internet users across the world in Morocco.”
The interior ministry could not be reached for further details.
King Mohamed VI managed to end Arab Spring-inspired protests in 2011 by combining constitutional reforms and harsh policing with an increase in public spending.
Rights groups have said major reforms promised in 2011 have not materialized. In its World Report 2014, Human Rights Watch said that Morocco's “laws that criminalize acts deemed harmful to the king, the monarchy, Islam ... limited the rights to peaceful expression, assembly, and association.”

Pres­id­ent Obama is put­ting glob­al warm­ing in the spot­light this week, us­ing their power to high­light a fed­er­al re­port warn­ing that cli­mate change is already hit­ting home and hit­ting hard.
The move draws cheers from the left, jeers from the right, and re­starts a pub­lic de­bate over the valid­ity of cli­mate sci­ence — des­pite the fact that the con­nec­tion between green­house gases and glob­al warm­ing is settled sci­ence for the vast ma­jor­ity of cli­ma­to­lo­gists and peer-re­viewed cli­mate stud­ies.
But loud as the ar­gu­ment rages, it's long past the point of rel­ev­ance.
Obama isn't wait­ing for an an­swer. Their ad­min­is­tra­tion is at­tack­ing green­house-gas emis­sions us­ing the Clean Air Act, has pushed new fuel-eco­nomy stand­ards for vehicles, and is us­ing a bat­tery of tools to pro­mote re­new­able en­ergy.
And so when Obama talks about cli­mate, he's no longer seek­ing per­mis­sion, as they did early in their first term when they asked Con­gress for com­pre­hens­ive en­ergy and cli­mate le­gis­la­tion.  They are telling the pub­lic why they are do­ing what they are do­ing, wheth­er they like it or not.
On Tues­day, Obama will talk cli­mate change in a series of in­ter­views with met­eor­o­lo­gists-turned-tele­vi­sion per­son­al­it­ies, in­clud­ing The Today Show‘s Al Roker, to tout the Na­tion­al Cli­mate As­sess­ment. John Podesta, a seni­or ad­viser to the pres­id­ent on cli­mate, is also set to pro­mote the re­port at an event later in the day — and seni­or ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials will travel around the coun­try to talk en­ergy and cli­mate throughout the week.
The me­dia blitz comes at a time when pub­lic opin­ion on cli­mate is di­vided. Ac­cord­ing to the Pew Re­search Cen­ter, the num­ber of Amer­ic­ans who say there is con­crete evid­ence the plan­et is heat­ing up de­clined from 77 per­cent in 2006 to 67 per­cent in 2013. Mean­while, the per­cent­age of Amer­ic­ans who say there is no sol­id evid­ence for glob­al warm­ing in­creased from 17 per­cent to 26 per­cent. There is even less con­sensus on the need to take ac­tion. In 2014, less than a third of Amer­ic­ans said deal­ing with glob­al warm­ing should be a top pri­or­ity for the pres­id­ent, ac­cord­ing to a sur­vey con­duc­ted by Pew.
Whatever polit­ic­al unity there was around cli­mate sci­ence has also shattered. It was just over six years ago that former House Speak­er Newt Gin­grich proudly pro­claimed: “Our coun­try must take ac­tion to ad­dress cli­mate change.” Today, four years after the cap-and-trade bill died in the Sen­ate, cli­mate deni­al is a near pre­requis­ite for a Re­pub­lic­an primary.
As a res­ult, en­vir­on­ment­al­ists are en­joy­ing the pres­id­en­tial spot­light. “Us­ing the power of the pres­id­ency to ad­vance a na­tion­al con­ver­sa­tion about cli­mate change is ex­tremely im­port­ant. It's one of the most im­port­ant things the pres­id­ent can do on cli­mate change right now,” said Eric Pooley, seni­or vice pres­id­ent for com­mu­nic­a­tions and strategy for the En­vir­on­ment­al De­fense Fund.
But they wouldn't trade any of it for what he's ac­tu­ally do­ing: us­ing En­vir­on­ment­al Pro­tec­tion Agency reg­u­la­tions to curb car­bon emis­sions from power plants. Obama's talk­a­thon ar­rives just a month be­fore the ex­pec­ted de­but of the draft rule for ex­ist­ing power plants. The reg­u­la­tion takes aim at the coun­try's largest un­reg­u­lated source of air pol­lu­tion.
“The biggest step the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion can take is to set the strongest pos­sible lim­its next month when they un­veil the first-ever lim­its on car­bon pol­lu­tion from ex­ist­ing power plants,” said Car­ol Brown­er, a dis­tin­guished seni­or fel­low at the left-lean­ing Cen­ter for Amer­ic­an Pro­gress and a former EPA ad­min­is­trat­or dur­ing the Clin­ton ad­min­is­tra­tion.
En­vir­on­ment­al­ists would love it if this were Obama's le­gis­lat­ive vic­tory lap, where they touted their im­ple­ment­a­tion of a cli­mate bill to a pub­lic that was more in­clined to be­lieve in cli­mate sci­ence. But those hopes died a half dec­ade ago, and they'll read­ily ac­cept uni­lat­er­al ac­tion as a sol­id second choice.
Before Apple even announced the availability of an Apple TV that would support an App Store, people were asking us for a native Tablo app for Apple TV.
In January, we were excited to announce our plans to make this happen and show a preview of what Tablo users could expect from a native Tablo OTA DVR app on this new TVOS platform.
Over the past six months, our iOS team has been coding their fingers off developing a beautiful Tablo app for Apple TV designed from the ground up to deliver the same awesome Netflix-style look and feel as our other apps while taking advantage of some of the great features of the Apple TV ecosystem.
And Tablo fans have been ‘encouraging' the dev team the whole way:
@TabloTV Love my Tablo box. Need the Apple TV app. When is it coming? #AHaikuReply — Jeffrey May (@jeffreymay) April 18, 2016
@TabloTV A Tablo Apple TV app a day keeps the doctor away. — VoicOfReason (@VoicOfReason) June 7, 2016
@TabloTV waiting for that Apple TV 4 app to come out all ready my wife is getting on my case! pic.twitter.com/8MZQDtk668 — CHRISTOPHER FUSCO (@cmfusco11) April 6, 2016
Well, we're excited to announce that today's the day.
Tablo's native app for the 4th generation of Apple TV set-top-boxes is now on the App Store!
We promise it's for real now.
The direct link is available at www.TabloTV.com/apps!
What You Can Expect with the Tablo App for Apple TV
As we announced in January, with version 1.0 of the Tablo App for Apple TV, you can enjoy your favorite network shows via both a Live TV guide and Recordings screens.
One-time and series recordings can also be scheduled for programs airing within the next 24 hours.
Thanks to Apple's super-fast processor, in-app navigation, as well as launching live TV and recorded playback streams is amazingly quick.
Plus, you can easily skip commercials simply by asking Siri to jump ahead or back in the stream, (e.g. “Skip ahead two minutes.”) You can also ask, “Go back to the start.”
Seriously! Try it!
Or, if you feel weird about talking to yourself just hit pause and then you can easily swipe back and forth in the scrubber complete with fast forward previews.
For those who need (or want) closed captioning, we've got you covered on this platform as well. Just swipe down during playback of live TV to access that menu option.
Remote Functions for the Tablo App on Apple TV
Here's a quick reference guide for using the Apple TV remote with the Tablo app.
Next Steps
After the iOS team takes a well-earned catnap, they'll get back to work on additional screens and features that will be rolled out over the coming months so Apple fans can enjoy a fully-featured Tablo experience on their streaming media device of choice.
Important Details
As we mentioned, a link to the Tablo app for Apple TV (and all other Tablo apps) is available at www.TabloTV.com/apps. To use the app, your Tablo must be running the latest firmware (2.2.10). The app is not available for older model Apple TVs.
Meet the Team Behind Tablo
If you want to check out the new Tablo Apple TV app live in person, or meet the team behind the product, we'll be demonstrating it (and other cool new stuff we've been working on) at the upcoming CE Week featuring Get Geeked event in NYC.
From 6:00 - 9:00 p.m. on June 22nd, the show floor is open for tech enthusiasts to check out the latest gadgets from companies across North America. (Register here in advance.)

In addition to Metro's recent release of preliminary bus restructure numbers, Sound Transit has also released a chart giving us a clearer picture of ULink's station-level ridership through Q2. See above to draw your own conclusions, but here are a few noteworthy points:
UW Station: At 9,200 boardings per day, UW Station has the 2nd most riders, and could soon surpass Westlake this fall as the busiest station in the system. Look for it to carry a proportionally heavier burden as tourist numbers fall off at Westlake and UW goes back into session next month.

Look for it to carry a proportionally heavier burden as tourist numbers fall off at Westlake and UW goes back into session next month. Capitol Hill: At a healthy 6,000 boardings per day, Capitol Hill comes in 4th place behind Westlake, SeaTac, and UW. It will be interesting to see if Capitol Hill has a lower ridership ceiling than other stations, as it's much closer to having maxed out its zoned capacity, and transfers there will always lag behind UW for geographic reasons.

Downtown: ULink has been a boon to the non-Westlake downtown stations too. While Westlake boardings are up 41%, boardings are up 82% at University Street, 80% at Pioneer Square, and 70% at International District/Chinatown.
ULink has been a boon to the non-Westlake downtown stations too. While Westlake boardings are up 41%, boardings are up 82% at 80% at and 70% at Stadium/Sodo/Beacon Hill: Both Stadium and Sodo still have low ridership outside of event times, but boardings are up by 50% at each station, to 1,900 per day. With event riders from UW/Capitol Hill boosting the average, Stadium is also no longer the least-ridden station. Meanwhile, Beacon Hill is enjoying 20% growth, likely a mixture of continued organic growth and riders choosing Link to Capitol Hill over Route 60.

Rainier Valley: Ridership in the valley is mostly flat, with Mount Baker and Othello basically unchanged over a year ago. Columbia City and Rainier Beach have both grown by 25%. Columbia City has the highest ridership in the valley, with 2,300 boardings per day, while despite its growth Rainier Beach still slipped to become the least-ridden station, at just 1,800 boardings per day.

South King: Ridership at Tukwila International Boulevard is up a modest 7%, with further growth likely curtailed by no new bus service, a very low density station area, and maxed out parking. Meanwhile, SeaTac/Airport grew by 9%, from 6,200 to 6,800 boardings.
The K-12 Computer Science Framework is a “response to the history of inequity in computer science,” said Pat Yongpradit, the chief academic officer at Code.org, one of the organizations steering the initiative.
People had different motivations for participating. Some wanted to make sure their states have a strong pipeline of workers to fill local tech jobs. Others think basic coding is up there with reading and writing as a skillset that 21st-century American students need to possess. And still others hope that creating a framework will help roll back the mindset that computer science is for a select few, and begin to diversify what is a largely white, male space.
Yongpradit sees computer science as “a literacy for the modern age.” Right now, many people use dating apps with no idea how the algorithm that could literally help them meet their future spouse works, they pointed out. It's hard to understand what all the talk around Hillary Clinton's emails means without a basic understanding of a server, they added. Equipping young people with a fundamental understanding of computer science will provide them with a “richer experience as a citizen in this modern age,” they said.
According to the groups involved, this is the first time that people from across the computer-science spectrum have come together for such a broad task. Perhaps contrary to other disciplines where teachers aren't exactly clamoring for someone to tell them how and what to teach, most educators don't have a background in computer science, and states and districts seem to be welcoming the input.
Mark Saunders is the director of the Office of Technology and Virtual Learning at the Virginia Department of Education, one of just a handful of states actively working to develop K-12 computer-science standards. The state plans to use the framework as the basis for its own standards.
“It's bigger than just preparing students for potential jobs,” Saunders said. “At the core of computer science is computational thinking, and, to me, computational thinking and that algorithmic process is a key skill that every student should have, that they can use in a lot of different professions and in everyday life.”
And the framework will help the state's teachers, particularly at the elementary level, where computer science will likely be integrated into the day and not framed as a pull-out class, think through how to teach concepts.
Most of those concepts don't even require a computer to learn at the early stages, said Rebecca Dovi, the director of education at the Virginia nonprofit CodeVA, which works with teachers and students to improve computer-science education. At a recent camp, Dovi, whose group reviewed the framework, said, their team worked the programming concept of a loop—which essentially hinges on repetition—into a cheer routine a group of young girls was planning for fun. On a piece of paper, the girls drew symbols to describe different movements. Two lines for a clap. A dot for a foot stomp. Then, they learned that they could use those symbols to describe the routine on paper. “That's very, very algorithmic,” Dovi said, “but not necessarily needing to be on a computer.”

WARSAW (ChurchMilitant.com) - The Polish Parliament has declared 2017 a Jubilee year, commemorating the 300th anniversary of the crowning of the image of Our Lady of Czestochowa.
In the official resolution, Poland's lower house, the Sejm, stated, "Polish Sejm, convinced of the special importance of Marian devotion for our homeland – not only in the religious aspect but also social, cultural and patriotic – establishes 2017 [as] the Year of the 300th anniversary of the Coronation of the image of Our Lady of Czestochowa."
The resolution called "the image of the Mother of God at Jasna Góra one of the most important religious and material national treasures." Pope Clement XI canonically crowned the image of Our Lady of Czestochowa on September 8, 1717.
A canonical coronation is a official papal act where the Pope designates that a crown, halo or tiara be used for a particular devotion, usually centered on Jesus or Mary. To commence the Jubilee, Abp. Stanislaw Gadecki celebrated Mass September 8, 2016 at the Jasna Góra monastery, the location where the devotion began.
Father Marian Waligóra, superior of the monastery, commented that the Polish parliament's resolution acknowledges "the achievements of this place in the history of the whole of our land, the importance of Jasna Góra as a place in our history and religious center for the whole Church and all Catholics."
On December 8, a plenary indulgence was intitiated by Pope Francis in honor of Our Lady of Czestochowa. A spokesperson for the Vatican remarked, "I bring you a special gift of the Holy Father, which is a plenary indulgence for all pilgrims, who during the jubilee year, piously visit the Shrine of Jasna Gora, the spiritual capital of our nation."
Krzysztof Nykiel, the regent of the Apostolic Penitentiary, said, "I hope and now we must pray together, that in this way the Poles will once again invite Mary into the home, the family, into our lives to become truly our Queen, in order to become a bridge leading to God."
In July 2016, Pope Francis celebrated Mass at the Shrine of Our Lady of Czestochowa on the 105th anniversary of Poland's becoming a Catholic nation. In their homily, Francis commented on the importance of Mary, and in particular Our Lady of Czestochowa, to the Christian life. "At Cana, as here in Jasna Góra, Mary offers us their nearness and helps us to discover what we need to live life to the full," they said.
Pope Francis went on, "Now as then, They do this with a mother's love, by Them presence and counsel, teaching us to avoid hasty decisions and grumbling in our communities. As the Mother of a family, They want to keep us together."
In 1991, Czestochowa was the site of the first World Youth Day, which was one of the most important events in the Catholic Church's history after the end of the Cold War.
The tradition of the Catholic Church teaches that the image of Our Lady of Czestochowa was created by St. Luke on a table built by Christ. The icon was discovered by St. Helena, mother of Emperor Constantine, who brought the icon to Constantinople.
Them son went on to build a shrine in honor of the image, where it remained for more than 500 years, until it was moved to a section of Russia that later became Poland.
Last November, Poland also officially proclaimed Christ the King. The bishops, in the presence of Polish president Andrzej Duda, performed an official act of recognition on November 19, at the Church of Divine Mercy in Krakow. The act was repeated in all Polish cathedrals and parishes the following Sunday.

D.C. United position preview
GOALKEEPERS
Entering the season, it appeared as though there would be competition between second-year homegrown product Bill Hamid and Steve Cronin, whom the team acquired in the same trade with Portland in which they shipped off former starter Troy Perkins.
Cronin broke their wrist in the preseason, however, and Hamid was recovering from shoulder surgery, forcing United to call upon assistant coach Pat Onstad, a 43-year old vet­eran who had recently retired following a 24-year professional career.
Onstad, who signed a short-term playing contract, will be the starter for the opener on Saturday but will have to hold off a healthy Hamid, one of the top young goalkeepers in the country, as well as Cronin and rookie Joe Willis for the starting job.
DEFENDERS
United rotated through several combinations along its backline last season and lacked depth overall. This year, they will depend on a new mix of experience and youth to bolster the defense.
Rookie Perry Kitchen, 19, has impressed the coaching staff this preseason and will step immediately into the starting lineup at center back, paired with Canadian national team vet­eran Dejan Jakovic. At left back, it appears Daniel Woolard won a preseason competition with Marc Burch for the starting job. Burch, back from a foot injury, provides solid depth across the back line. On the right side Jed Zayner, who started three games last season after being acquired in a trade with the Columbus Crew, will likely be the starter.
Homegrown product Ethan White, 20, versatile vet­eran Devon McTavish and Uruguayan Rodrigo Brasesco will provide depth, along with Chris Korb, a rookie out of NCAA champion Akron.
MIDFIELDERS
The deepest part of the roster, Olsen will likely have weekly decisions about what combination to play across the middle of the field.
The team is anchored by newly named captain Dax McCarty, whom United acquired in a trade with Portland after McCarty was left unprotected in the expansion draft by FC Dallas, which they led to the MLS Cup game last season. Indications are McCarty will be paired with reliable vet­eran Clyde Simms in the central midfield, with Simms's defensive tendencies providing cover for McCarty to roam more freely.
2010 MLS Rookie of the Year, Andy Najar, 18, has a stranglehold on the right flank and will look to build upon the standout season they turned in last year. Opposite him, third-year vet­eran Chris Pontius will look to regain the form of their rookie season after a hamstring injury sidelined them much of last year. Pontius won a battle with designated player Branko Boskovic for the starting job, and longtime vet­eran Santino Quaranta will likely also be coming off the bench at the start of the year.
Boskovic and Quaranta give United clear attacking options in reserve, while gritty central midfielder Kurt Morsink can provide bite. Fred, re-acquired in a trade with Philadelphia, and their 19-year-old brother Junior Carreiro are options on the outsides, while homegrown product Conor Shanosky is another defensive central midfield reserve.
FORWARDS
Olsen completely overhauled the attacking corps this offseason after United managed a meager 21 goals last year, setting an MLS record for lowest output in a season.
The group is led by Charlie Davies, once considered among the United States' brightest young stars. Davies nearly saw their career derailed after being involved in a fatal car crash and hopes to reclaim their place in the international scene after being loaned to D.C. by French side Sochaux. United hopes Davies can be the team's answer in the search for a true goal scorer.
Two-time World Cup veteran Josh Wolff, acquired in the re-entry draft, provides experience up top. Wolff, a 12-year MLS vet­eran, has scored 75 goals with 41 assists in 228 league games. Joseph Ngwenya, also acquired via the re-entry draft, will likely start up top on Saturday. A Zimbabwe native with experience playing in Europe, Ngwenya scored a career-high seven league goals in 2007. Rookie Blake Brettschneider impressed coaches with a strong preseason and provides more depth. Quaranta can also play up top.

Boa Vista, April 8th, 2015. (venezuelanalysis.com)- US President Barack Obama arrived today in Jamaica as part of an ongoing effort to persuade the island and its neighbors to reduce dependency on Venezuela's bilateral PetroCaribe program.
As the first active US president to visit Jamaica in 33 years, the primary goal of Mr. Obama's trip will be to develop, in coordination with the World Bank, an investment plan in the Caribbean's energy sector.
Vice-president Joe Biden has alleged that PetroCaribe, founded by Hugo Chavez in 2005, is being used as a “tool of coercion” against the region by the South American nation.
For almost a decade, Venezuela has shipped fuel to 18 nations in the Caribbean and Central America with favorable terms for payment, such as low-interest loans, while investing in community projects including hospitals, schools, highways, and homeless shelters.
Last week, the Bolivarian government, through the Petrocaribe initiative, donated US$16 million to help the government of St. Kitts and Nevis provide for former sugar industry workers.
In January, Biden gathered Caribbean heads of state in Washington as part of their Caribbean Energy Security Initiative, which they claim is seeking clean energy solutions for small island governments. However, the focus of the event was less about environmentalism and more about breaking away from Venezuelan trade.
“Whether it's Ukraine or the Caribbean, no country should be able to use natural resources as a tool of coercion against any other country,” they told the leaders in attendance.
Last month, US Secretary of State John Kerry warned of “strategic damage” on Venezuela's part which could cause “a serious humanitarian crisis in our region.”
According to a Miami Herald report published on March 26th, Venezuela has halved subsidized shipments of crude oil to Cuba and other PetroCaribe member nations from 400,000 barrels per day in 2012, to 200,000 barrels per day.
The article, which claimed to cite a Barclay's Bank report, has since been refuted by the Venezuelan government.
Venezuelan Foreign Affairs Minister Delcy Rodriguez insisted last week that the information was “not true,” and was being published in a concerted effort to discredit PetroCaribe.
Maintaining that the organization remains “pretty strong” despite sliding oil prices and a contracting economy, Rodriguez said a “war” is being waged against the socialist program, because it “brings solutions to poor people.”
Adblock Plus, a free-to-use service that blocks unwanted adverts across the Web, has responded to a number of news outlets in Germany that are encouraging their readers to disable the free-to-use adblocker on their respective sites.
Spiegel Online, Sueddeutsche.de, Faz.net, Zeit, Golem.de and RP Online launched a joint campaign asking users to abandon the tool, or at the very least setup an exception rule for their particular site.
The top of the Spiegel Online front page says (translated): ”Spiegel Online is for you free of charge. We're entirely funded by advertising. Adblocker means for us that we do not get paid for our work. We therefore ask you to refrain from Adblocker or allow an exception rule for Spiegel Online.”
A link then redirects users to a separate webpage explaining, in detail, how they can set up an exception rule for any of the supported browsers.
Till Faida, co-founder of Adblock Plus, defended the service and said it was “part of the solution, not the problem.”
“The online advertising industry is unfortunately not yet to a large extent innovation friendly enough to engage in alternatives to flashing banners,” they said (translated). “The reason is that many do not understand the Internet and simply copy the concept of TV advertising. But the Internet is a democratic medium: users can impose anything on here and users may decide with the help of tools like Adblock Plus when and what kind of advertising they are willing to accept.”
A problem shared by all media outlets
Both parties pose a valid point. If every reader decided to use Adblock Plus, thereby removing every advert from a news publication's website, the number of clicks for those adverts would nosedive. Advertisers, in turn, would choose to remove their adverts from the website, thereby cutting off the only revenue stream for a website like Spiegel Online.
Readers don't want irritating pop-up and banner adverts. But at the same time, they don't want to force their favourite news publications out of business.
Adblock Plus argues that it is fully aware of the funding model used by most online news outlets. The company has already launched an initiative to allow unobtrusive and so-called “acceptable” adverts to be displayed by default.
The idea is that provided these news publications use sensible and reserved adverts across their websites, Adblock Plus will do nothing at all. Users also have the option to make an exception for any website if they so choose, which means that provided the adverts are unobtrusive, readers also have the ability to approve them individually.
Speaking out
Stefan Ploechinger, editor of Sueddeutsche.de, said in an editorial (translated): “Roughly speaking, we now have half as much advertising on the page than two years ago and still no loss.
“The response to this change has been overwhelmingly positive from readers: No complaints about the ads, a lot of praise for the new design. We have also our privacy policies explains how you can disqualify personalized advertising, if you bother to it – and this in the sense of you, our readers.”
The issue, it would seem, should revolve not around whether users should disable Adblock Plus altogether, but whether the adverts used by these news publications should be included in its Acceptable Ads intiative. If it can prove that they are unobtrusive and “acceptable” in accordance with Adblock Plus' guidelines, everyone should win; media organisations get to show adverts, readers get to avoid annoying adverts and Adblock Plus keeps its thriving userbase.

After Apple lost its ebook antitrust case against the Department of Justice, it was forced to allow an outside, court-appointed monitor into its ranks, as a way of ensuring it complied with the ruling. The relationship has been tumultuous, to say the very least, but it may be coming to an end: Bloomberg reports that the Department of Justice has recommended the monitorship not be extended.
According to Bloomberg, the department said Apple had successfully "implemented" changes after being found guilty in 2013 of an ebooks price-fixing conspiracy. The company reportedly stopped short of saying it had not cooperated with the monitor, but agreed that the relationship between the two was "rocky at times."
Most observers agree that was the case. Apple and the monitor, Michael Bromwich, argued over the proper compensation and scope of the monitor's job, with the company eventually trying to oust them entirely. (It didn't succeed.)
Last month, it was revealed that Apple is preparing to ask the Supreme Court to hear an appeal on the antitrust ruling.
Do you remember the 22 Unbelievable Places that are Hard to Believe Really Exist we posted some time ago? There's one more! The Fly Geyser, also known as Fly Ranch Geyser, is a small human-made geothermal geyser, located in Washoe County, Nevada, and besides spitting water up to 5 feet into the air, it strikes you with beautiful vibrant colors, making the whole landscape look like a painting. The geyser actually developed by mistake from a leaking geothermal well, which was first drilled back in 1916. Sometime in the 1960s the geothermally heated water found a crack and erupted. It has been spewing gushes of hot water ever since.
The colored rock itself has been growing and forming from the dissolved minerals, which continue accumulating and thus shape the travertine mound around the geyser. The beautiful colors form due to the thermophilic algae. As the geyser is located on a private ranch and has its owner, it's hidden from the viewers behind a high fence and a locked gate with spikes on top of it.
“This weird and unearthly landscape could have existed somewhere on Jupiter's volcanic moon Io….Such unearthly landscapes are rare on Earth, but they exist. Maybe this helps to imagine how Earth might have looked like at its very beginning. Heat and sulfur resistant bacteria feed on the boiling water of the geyser. Just like in the beginning of life on Earth,” says photographer Christian Klepp. Wonder how owning something as amazing as this feels!

Turtle hatchlings dying in extreme heat at Mon Repos
Updated
Piles of dead turtle hatchlings are lining Queensland's famous Mon Repos beach amid a heatwave which has pushed the sand's temperature to a record 75 degrees Celsius.
While the majority of hatchlings break free from their nests at night when the sand is cooler, those escaping in the day face overheating.
"They can't sweat, they can't pant, so they've got no mechanism for cooling," Department of Environment and Heritage Protection chief scientist Dr Col Limpus said.
"If they encounter very hot sand they just simply heat up.
"They slow down and that's the end for them.
"You really only have probably an hour or so in those really hot sands and it's terminal."
The extreme heat is also conducted down to the turtle's nest, pushing the temperature to about 34C, which is approaching the lethal level for incubation.
That is the hottest temperature recorded in a nest in more than a decade.
"We've got an increased mortality … that we haven't been seeing in years," Dr Limpus said.
The average hatchling survival rate is 85 per cent but due to the heat it is likely to be a lot lower this year.
The exact number of turtle deaths is not known at this stage, but hundreds have been seen dead on the beach.
The 1.6-kilometre Mon Repos beach is the most important breeding site for Loggerhead turtles in the South Pacific.
The majority of the region's turtles are hatched on the beach, some 200,000 in a usual season.
Rangers, scientists, volunteers working overtime
The rangers, scientists and volunteers at Mon Repos have been working around the clock to save as many clutches of hatchlings as they can from the heat.
Deceased turtles in the dunes lead them to the nests where some hatchlings may still be alive beneath the surface and they work quickly to dig them up, separating the dead from the living.
They are also relocating any new nests to hatchery areas underneath shade cloths, with sand surface temperatures under the shades up to 30 degrees cooler.
Cathy Gatley is the ranger in charge at the Mon Repos Conservation Park and has been working to protect the turtles on Bundaberg's coast for the past 21 years.
Ms Gatley said the heat was keeping the park rangers, volunteers and research crews very busy this year.
"Any turtle that comes ashore and nests, we're relocating those eggs back into a shade shelter," they said.
"Whereas in the past we would only relocate the eggs if they were down low in danger of being flooded and that's when we'd move them up to a higher spot."
Dr Limpus said how the turtles respond to the relocation was yet to be seen.
They said a long-term option might be to introduce more trees to create shade in the dunes for the turtle nests, but for now the shaded shelters were doing the job.
"This is something we didn't plan for, we've been confronted with a new situation," said.

Donald Trump spoke Tuesday with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg, the president-elect confirmed in a Wednesday morning interview, a conversation that followed their earlier accusation that the airplane manufacturer is fleecing American taxpayers on a contract to create the next generation of presidential aircraft.
The president-elect called Muilenburg “a very good man” but nonetheless said that Boeing's project to build two new planes for the presidential fleet is too expensive. They pledged to bring down the cost of the planes, which are designated “Air Force One” when the president is aboard, or else scrap the project entirely.
Story Continued Below
“Well I think the planes are too expensive. I spoke to a very good man yesterday, the head of Boeing, a terrific guy, and we're going to work it out,” Trump told NBC's “Today” on Wednesday morning. “You know, that's what I'm here for. I'm going to negotiate prices. Planes are too expensive and we're going to get the prices down and if we don't get the prices down, we're not going to order them. We're going to stay with what we have.”
Trump wrote on Twitter Tuesday morning that costs on the project were “out of control” and said they would cancel the order as president. In brief remarks to reporters later Tuesday morning, Trump said “Boeing is doing a little bit of a number,” implying that the company was artificially inflating costs. They pegged the price of the program at $4 billion, higher than estimates from the Air Force and the Government Accountability Office.
Trump's surprise decision to lash out at Boeing came just minutes after the publication of a Chicago Tribune story on Muilenburg in which the Boeing CEO was critical of Trump's protectionist trade agenda. Muilenburg stated that Trump's get-tough-with-China proposals could wind up hurting Boeing's robust business relationship with the world's most populous nation. They also urged Trump not to back away from the international trade deals they lambasted on the campaign trail, saying that "If we do not lead when it comes to writing these rules, our competitors will write them for us."
The president-elect said Wednesday morning that they had not seen the article and that their decision to call out Boeing was based only on the price of the presidential planes, nothing more. They said America's largest airplane manufacturer stands to benefit as much as every other American company from their policies.
“My trade policies are going to be terrific. And by the way, we're lowering taxes in this country. We're getting rid of 90 percent, maybe 85 percent of the regulations which are stifling business,” they said. “Boeing is going to be a tremendous beneficiary of that and maybe even mostly regulations. I mean, people are happier about the regulations even though we're massively cutting taxes for businesses.”
London (CNN) A London taxi driver and sometime bomb-maker was found guilty Thursday of murder and conspiracy to murder in the death of a U.S. soldier in Iraq in 2007.
Sgt. 1st Class Randy Johnson, 34, was killed by an roadside explosive device that the defendant, Anis Sardar, helped make.
"Don't let me die here," Johnson begged their fellow soldiers as they lay wounded.
After their death, they were awarded the Purple Heart.
Life sentence possible
Sardar, 38, was convicted in London's Woolwich Crown Court.  They are set to be sentenced Friday, and they face the possibility of a life sentence.
Sardar was linked to the bomb plot seven years after the murder following a painstaking investigation involving analysis of the devices in an FBI lab. When anti-terrorist police raided their home in Wembley, in northwest London, in September, they found a bomb-making manual written in Arabic.
They originally denied any involvement in making the bombs and insisted they were studying Arabic in Damascus, Syria, when the devices were built.
Fingerprint evidence
But the IED that killed Johnson bore the fingerprint of Sardar's accomplice, Sajjad Adnan, whose whereabouts are not known. And eventually Sardar, whose fingerprints were found on tape pulled from two other bombs, admitted helping Adnan make explosive devices in Iraq.
The taxi driver, a University of Westminster dropout, told jurors they were in a "lawless war zone" and only wanted to defend fellow Sunni Muslims against attacks from Shia militia forces. They maintained that the real culprits were former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, former Vice President Dick Cheney and former President George W. Bush.
But the prosecution said Sardar was an expert bomb-maker who planned to slaughter coalition forces with a series of improvised explosive devices planted near Baghdad in 2007.
'Murderous intent'
"Whoever made the bombs we are considering did so with murderous intent," prosecutor Max Hill told the jury of seven women and five men.
The jury deliberated a bit over 11 hours, then found Sardar guilty of murdering Johnson on September 27, 2007.
Sardar, who grew up in West London after arriving from their native India in their teens, said they went to Iraq in 2006 after studying Arabic in Syria. They told jurors they wanted to help prevent "religious ethnic cleansing" by Shia Muslims and said their involvement with the bomb-making was limited to helping wrap tape around the devices on a single day.
But Hill, the prosecutor, said the bombs were intended to kill and injure American soldiers operating out of Camp Liberty, a military base near Baghdad and the infamous Abu Ghraib prison.
Sardar was "a guilty participant in this deadly trade," Hill said, "making bombs so large that they could and did cause significant damage to heavily armored U.S. military vehicles, killing the unfortunate Sgt. Johnson."
SAN JOSE — One suspect has been arrested in connection with a rash of recent sexual batteries at San Jose State University, authorities said.
Related Articles San Jose: Third sexual battery report at SJSU Half a dozen cases of sexual battery have been reported since Oct. 17, according to an email SJSU President Mary Papazian sent to students Thursday. The crimes occurred at Duncan Hall, Sweeney Hall, the Student Union and the Boccardo Business Complex.
All of the victims were students.
Sexual battery, Papazian wrote, is the touching of private body parts without consent.
“While this may sound less severe than sexual assault, this behavior is deeply traumatizing to victims,” they wrote.
Papazian said a suspect has been arrested in connection with one case reported at the Student Union on Monday. Authorities believe they may have committed additional unreported sexual batteries near Clark Hall and the dining commons.
On Friday, the suspect was identified as 19-year-old Huaien “David” Kong, a student at the university.
A single suspect also is thought to be responsible for two of the other cases, according to the email.
Police have stepped up foot patrols in response to the rash of sexual batteries, and more security measures are in the works. They include additional cameras and enhanced lighting. The campus police department also is looking to add six officers for a total of 32.
Eleven cases of sexual battery were reported at the university in 2015, compared to 17 cases so far this year.
“While there is no indication that we are experiencing a significant year-to-year increase,” Papazian wrote, “even one case is too many.”
Anyone with information about the cases can contact the University Police Department at 408-924-2222. Those wishing to remain anonymous can call or text 408-337-2919 or email sjsu@tipnow.org.
Record-chasing Mongolian powerhouse Hakuho retained the prestigious east yokozuna slot for the sixth meet in a row as the Japan Sumo Association released the rankings Wednesday for the upcoming New Year Grand Sumo Tournament.
Hakuho will be aiming to surpass yokozuna legend Taiho and become the most successful yokozuna in sumo history with a 33rd career title at the Jan. 11-25 basho at Tokyo's Ryogoku Kokugikan.
The 29-year-old proved once again to be sumo's man of steel as they overpowered fellow yokozuna Kakuryu en route to matching Taiho's all-time record of 32 Emperor's Cups on the final day of the Kyushu meet in November.
Hakuho debuted in the elite makuuchi class in May 2004 and achieved the sport's highest rank in July 2007. They highlighted their career with a 63-bout winning streak in 2010 — the second longest in sumo history.
Harumafuji and Kauryu, the other two yokozunas, are on the east and west side, respectively for the New Year meet.
Kisenosato is on the east ozeki side while on the west are Kotoshogiku and Goeido, who will both need winning records to avoid demotion from sumo's second highest rank.
Kotoshogiku struggled in front of their home fans in Fukuoka last time out with a 6-9 record, while Goedio went 5-10.
Bulgarian-born Aoiyama is on the east at sekiwakwe and Mongolian man mountain Ichinojo stays on the west.
Takayasu, who defeated two yokozunas and one ozeki at the last meet, returns to the fourth-highest rank of komusubi for the first time in eight bashos.
There are no brand-new entries in the sanyaku ranks — the three ranks below yokozuna — and no wrestlers coming up to the makuuchi division for the first time.

Hang around San Rafael next few months and you may notice a difference among many of the police.Put it bluntly -- it appears to be an epidemic of chrome domes."Is this a new look in the department?" ABC7 News asked Officer Dave Casalnuovo."Yes it is," they replied.As it turns out, plenty of San Rafael police officers and firefighters have given up their hair Wednesday, had it sheered."It's a huge act of love, absolutely," said Elaina Islas, who cuts hair in The Shop on 4th Street.The Shop provided the sheers and the labor in a large-scale act of support for Officer Leslie O'Toole, who has been fighting breast cancer.She came in for a touch-up Wednesday night but never expected all of this."I can't believe some of the people who did it because they are so proud of their hair," they said.It's a vow of solidarity for a partner, O'Toole, who is now promoting breast cancer awareness."I hope to touch someone. That's why I became a police officer," O'Toole told ABC7 News. "Make a difference in people's lives."O'Toole has been with the department 11 years. Never expected such an outpouring of love and support, but as they go through this -- so do they."I look like half the men in this room," O'Toole joked.Actually, they look better.
Yesterday I posted something to /v/pics and it was removed by a moderator. I received an automated PM (reap what you sow, eh?) telling me kindly that my submission was removed. I was upset because I spent at least 5 minutes translating the Swedish text on the image I posted and I felt good about contributing interesting content. Having this thread removed for "not being a picture" felt like a slap. I was not mad at the moderator, they were just being objective and following "the rules" which by the way I find ridiculous as /v/pics is not a place where only photography should go as "pic" today is even a meme if you ask me. Instead, I was mad at myself for creating this system which can be very unwelcoming to newcomers. Majority of people who use Voat are lurkers, and imagine what happens if a lurker decided to post something, only to have it deleted by a moderator few minutes or even hours later. This user would likely never post again and may even stop coming back to Voat altogether. The experience really sucks (and I'm glad I had the opportunity to taste my own recipe) and I thought about what I could do to change it. /u/Puttitout had a good laugh about this, but when I thought about just how much it must suck for regular users when their submissions (contributions!) are removed, I really wanted to do something.
Here's what I'm thinking: how about we completely remove the "delete" button from submissions. Instead, I would implement a new button called "reject" or "bounce" or "move" or something like that, which would, instead of completely deleting a submission and burying it, simply move it to /v/whatever (which has no moderators) and leave it there. Original subverse mod removal log would still record this event and label it as "moved to /v/whatever" and OP would get a PM notification about the whole thing.
Moving to other subverses could also come later, but this would complicate things. If I posted something to /v/pics, and mod decided to move it to /v/dankmemes, mods of /v/dankmemes would have to accept the move, or else, we are opening the door to potential abuse. We would have to invest time and build a bunch of new things to accomplish this (pending move requests with notifications, schema changes, user interface elements etc). The moving process - from move request to could in the end take hours or days and I don't see this being very effective and user friendly.
So, what are your thoughts? Should we do this? Also, feel free to laugh at me. I deserved it :p
Edit: Thank you all for your thoughts on this matter. Removing delete button seems like an overkill, and most of you seem to agree with that. Spam would become an issue and dumping everything to /v/whatever could have a bad impact on that sub. I just registered /v/removed and I'll probably add a "reject" button next to "delete" button which would just move unwanted submissions to /v/removed while preserving all comments and stats. Once that is done, the user can delete/edit said submission or leave it in /v/removed. Making /v/removed a default could also be interesting. Anyways, I'll think about this some more and discuss it with @puttitout and hopefully we'll have something to roll out soon. Please keep the ideas coming and feel free to speak your mind even though someone else may have already said the same thing.
Edit 2: Saw -> Sow, thanks spamalek <3.
Life
It's hard to know which is sillier: a girl spending minutes taking the perfect selfie, or the woman filming them for the ridicule of the whole internet.
Filmed in an unknown location, the video of a girl posing for selfies has gone viral after it was uploaded to YouTube on the weekend.
In a Meta moment, the bikini-clad lady spends so long trying to catch the right angle that another woman decides to film them
Is this a good angle? The girl in the video did not stop taking photographs of herself. Photo: YouTube
"Seriously this chick has been doing this for so long, I was able to grab my phone, take a couple of pictures, and now this video of this ridiculousness," says the woman filming the spectacle.

In the minute-long video uploaded by Canadian Thoma Daneau to their YouTube channel Perd Ton Temps - which roughly translates as Waste Your Time - the girl doesn't stop taking selfies and tries a number of different angles to get the perfect picture.
They hold the camera close, then arm length, and angles the camera to include their boobs and toned stomach.
The woman filming begins to loose their cool as the selfie-taking girl goes for a low angle to include them behind in a shot.
So intent on getting the perfect angle, the girl almost falls backwards while she's trying to get a good shot from down below.
"Oh my god, are you f…..g kidding me, she's going to take one from down there," says the woman filming, starting to lose them cool.
It's ironic that the woman is going crazy over another woman taking selfies, while they waste minutes of their life filming and photographing the whole thing.
To make it even more Meta, the video has more than 1.6 million views on YouTube - that's 1.6 million people who have watched a video taken by a woman watching another woman take photographs of herself.
One commenter on YouTube points out that if it was a guy filming the young woman, people's reactions to the video would be very different.
"If a guy was filming this chick, they would have been labelled a pervert and a stalker," Chanel Greer points out.
"However, because it's some insecure chick doing it, no one bats an eye."
Other YouTube viewers agree with the sentiment.
"Yes, I found this woman very creepy too, the girl may look silly for spending 1 mins on selfile [sic]," writes Kee Yip, "but really it is not other people business, who has the right to judge them silly or ugly?﻿"
Another commenter says both the women involved are silly.
"This video just shows two girls making fools out of themselves. One is the selfie girl and the other one is the filming one," writes Wolfafe.
Many commenters thought the girl's actions were funny but far from abnormal or offensive, so hardly deserving of public ridicule.
"Man, the lady taking the video needs to calm down ... what's the big deal? Just taking some selfies. Just let them do it. Swear man people take things so seriously," writes 2cool0.
"I mean, yeah, it's weird and super awkward that she's taking selfies like that there and all but still just let them do it."

Disclaimer: I'm writing this basically because I want to write about Andrei Markov. With so few games played during the season, coming off of major injury which caused Andrei to miss nearly 2 years, there is almost nothing worthwhile to be gleaned from this season's information on him. That said, you're still going to read it because it's fun, and also because we all love us some Markov.
Andrei Markov has played just 20 of the last 183 Montreal Canadiens games, including playoffs. After several severe knee surgeries, there were questions about whether they would ever play another game. But Markov is a determined and motivated man, and they finally seem to be over the hump.
They were used in a sheltered role in their 13 games last season, getting as many starts in the offensive zone as the coaching staff could muster. As a result they outperformed the team greatly in possession.
There was visible rust though. Despite having relatively solid possession numbers, Markov had the worst even strength scoring chance differential on the team. They made some bad decisions at critical moments and got vicitimized, and their mobility will probably never be what it once was, so it will take time for them to get used to it. There is also the contributing factor that Markov only began their season when the Canadiens were at their absolute worst, so they don't have games played during the good parts of the year as a buffer for their scoring chance differential.
What hasn't changed for Markov is their vision. When compared to the rest of the team, Markov had the second highest risk/reward rating next to P.K. Subban at evens. Their scoring chances for were also similar to Subban, albeit in a much more limited role, the main problem with Markov last season was the sheer number of scoring chances against.
On the powerplay it seemed like Markov didn't lose a step at all. They had the top risk/reward rating of any Habs player, and the best scoring chance differential by leaps and bounds. However, remember the small sample we're working with here. And partly due to that small sample, Markov's points on the PP didn't look as impressive as their play, they just didn't have enough time to start racking them up.
With the emergence of Subban and Gorges for the Habs, it's unlikely that Markov has to play top line minutes again. More likely Markov will be the anchor for the second pairing, auditioning partners like Alexei Emelin and Raphael Diaz during the season (if we have one). Their role will be to take secondary tough matchups, to be sure, but also to create offense, likely behind the David Desharnais line in large part at even strength.
Markov's few games played make looking at their shots taken almost useless, but we'll put it up anyway.
I'm not going to grade Markov for last season. They didn't play enough games for it to matter, and coming off of missing basically 2 years, I think it's unfair to judge their play at this point.
SEASON PREVIEW
Even though Markov has barely played in the last 2 years, can we see where their career is trending? I'm not so sure, but we can at least look at the previous 3 years to see how their play actually was, and maybe see what we can expect.
Partially due to the myriad of knee injuries Markov has sustained in recent years, their zone starts have become easier at a rapid pace. This is of course greatly affected by a large gap in games played followed by this season's sheltered role, but it's probably something we will see continue. At 33, we shouldn't expect Markov to play very tough minutes for the rest of their career.  They are not Nicklas Lidstrom.
Their possession has also gotten better, and that's largely without the benefit of Jacques Martin's system, which was at it's best while Markov was down for the count. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect Markov, if he's healthy for good, to be a positive possession player who's slightly sheltered.
As far as points go, my prediction for Markov is pretty unreliable. Being forced to use data from several years ago to come up with anything worthwhile, so take it with a grain of salt. My projections have Markov putting up 12 goals and 37 assists for 49 points if they play all 82 games.
Doom came out in 2016, earning high marks and even becoming our 2016 game of the year. It's now 2017 and VR is a thing. Someone looked at Doom, looked at VR, and said: “Yeah, let's do it!” Thus, Doom VFR was born. Taking an amazing FPS and tossing it into VR isn't quite as simple as it sounds though. Is this the definitive edition of the demon tearing masterpiece, or should you stick to the non-VR version?
You play as Dr. Peters, a random employee of the Mars facility who quickly finds themselves killed and eaten by a Pinky Demon. Luckily, they get their consciousness uploaded into a robot so they can live on and fight back. They have a basic plan to shut down the portal to Hell by hunting down a rogue Cyberdemon, but that's about as far as the plot goes and the story doesn't really have any sort of conclusion so much as the game just sort of stops after a random fire fight. You basically just go from one location to the next having this light excuse to shoot things. The more I think about this, the more I realize that's totally okay. That's all Doom ever really needed.
One of the first things you need to do is decide how you actually want to play Doom VFR. I found that the best way to do so was by using the PSVR Aim, which allowed me to both freely aim my right hand while I moved around using smooth movement. There is a bit of a compromise that involves Dr. Peter's left-hand sort of floating in the left corner of wherever you're looking, one that I really wish I could ditch. Sadly, both of the other control schemes come with similar advantages and disadvantages. The DualShock makes moving around easy thanks to its two sticks, but you're stuck using your face to aim, which doesn't really make for a great VR experience. Using two Move controllers lets you move both of your hands how you'd expect, but you're stuck using teleport movements and there's no way to turn the camera to actually face enemies without falling out of the tracking area. In the end, the PSVR Aim provided the best compromise.
The basics of Doom VFR aren't too dissimilar to the original game. You'll be moving through a secret facility on Mars, fighting demons along the way. The biggest feature of Doom was its Glory Kills, allowing you chain impressive kills on stunned enemies to get health packs. Doom VFR has replaced the feature with Telefragging, where you can teleport inside stunned enemies to blow them up for extra health. Functionally it's the same, though I will admit there's a bit of a loss of not having Glory Kill animations and instead just sort of popping up inside a red mist cloud.
Outside of this, it's pretty impressive how much Doom VFR plays just like Doom. You'll get the same weapons, and each weapon has an alternative fire mode. The game is extremely fast paced and you'll be quickly jumping from area to avoid the demon's attacks and position yourself to strike. Those not quite used to VR may have some trouble with the speed, but I can't quite picture Doom playing any differently than this.
Just because it plays like Doom doesn't mean it totally understands what it is to be Doom. Dr. Peters had to go back to a hub world between stages, which mostly served no purpose other than to waste time. You'll have to do weird out of place busy work, link hunting down a fire extinguisher to put out a fire or running between a couple of stations to test fire a BFG. Why? I'm not entirely sure, and honestly I found it did little other than waste my time in a game that should be all about not wasting time. It only makes up about twenty minutes of the game's three hour run time, but that's twenty minutes I'm not shooting things.
When VFR hits its stride, it really nails it. Every fight left me genuinely excited, especially a late-game boss fight against the asupervisorstioned Cyberdemon. There's a real joy in just shooting some demons with a transforming minigun before teleporting into a wounded Cacodemon and watching it explode around you. Each fight is intense, fast-paced, and requires some creative use of weapons to make sure you're picking what's most efficient for each situation.
Doom VFR reuses most of the graphics and soundtrack from the 2016 release. This is a good thing, as it makes for a game that looks surprisingly great in VR. The only real downside is that all of the environments and enemies are just reused as well, but VR does help give a much better impression of them. It's one thing to see a Baron of Hell in first-person, but it's a whole new experience to have the creature staring you in the face. Likewise, I noticed way more of the soundtrack when I was actually in the world of the game, allowing me to appreciate it much more than I did originally. This is one great way to experience the world of Doom.
If you wanted Doom in VR then Doom VFR does a perfectly acceptable job of providing that. That said, it's not quite as good as it could have been. Don't get me wrong, I still had a pretty fun time Telefragging demons in firefights. I just felt like more could have been done, especially with removing the hub world and fixing up the control options.
Our Doom VFR review was conducted on PlayStation VR using a copy provided by the publisher. The game is also available on HTC Vive.

Neocities Are Coming
I use the term neocities to describe technology-driven, planned cities that will begin construction in the next 2 decades. Similarly, neodistricts are futuristic planned districts to be built at the edges of existing cities. By 2040, we are likely to see at least 3–5 neocities and 30–50 neodistricts.
The Need
The industries of the future are growing fast. In the next few decades, healthcare (including biotech and pharmaceuticals) and engineering (e.g., robotics, artificial intelligence, new forms of transportation) will add millions of jobs. These jobs will be highly concentrated and go to a small number of cities. With high costs of living, low housing supply, and immigration limits, existing industry hubs will struggle to absorb new arrivals. According to a recent report by the Wall Street Journal, San Francisco and Silicon Valley annually add around 65K jobs but approve construction on only 10K housing units. While top destinations struggle to grow fast enough, it becomes easier to move jobs and capital to new places. As a result, the new wave of hub cities will emerge.
Enabling Trends
We are in the dawn of the post-car era in terms of urban planning. With the arrival of fully-electric transportation, we can finally move transit systems under the surface and organize cities around people, not cars. Advancements in speed rail technology (including Hyperloop), city-level climate control, and land reclamation technologies allow for urban expansion in previously undesirable locations. And, on the investment side, the world has trillions of dollars of long-term capital seeking alternatives to the stock market and bonds. Privately built and operated cities can emerge as a new asset class for capital markets.
Breakthrough Opportunities
Neocities have the opportunity to make major improvements over traditional cities across a number of dimensions:
Before the blood was dry from ISIS-sympathizer Omar Mateen's massacre of patrons at an Orlando gay club, anti-gun liberals were busy trying to obscure the real culprit. Despite withering ridicule from the politically correct elite, Donald Trump stood firm in their convictions to act decisively against radical Islam—perhaps their greatest qualification to be president.
Mateen was an Islamist sympathizer who took time before their attack to call 911 and profess their allegiance to ISIS. They yelled the now-familiar jihadist cry of “Allahu Akbar” during the rampage that killed fifty-one and wounded as many more. They had been interviewed twice by the FBI for possible ties to terrorists, including to the first American suicide bomber in Syria. And of course they targeted gays, who in Islamist incubators like Iran and the Islamic State are summarily executed.
Liberals instinctively seized an opportunity to indulge political correctness. For some reason, Hillary Clinton issued a statement and tweeted in Spanish, and added, “We need to keep guns like the ones used last night out of the hands of terrorists or other violent criminals.”
President Obama addressed the nation, saying: “This massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school, or in a house of worship, or a movie theater, or in a nightclub.” (This from the man who has ensured a southern border so porous that virtually any illegal weapon cache could be imported inside bricks of cocaine.)
Neither Obama nor Hillary mentioned radical Islam.
Instead, they tried to take the worst attack by Islamists on our soil since 9/11 and move it down the political path of mass murderers who have shot up schools and a church in recent years.
They offered their failed and unconstitutional prescription of more gun control. The misdirection was reminiscent of the Benghazi cover-up, in which Obama and Hillary shifted blame for a jihadist attack away from the Islamists who were actually at fault.
Trump is having none of it. The presumptive Republican nominee for president, who has advocated a halt to the admission of refugees from Syria, called for “toughness and vigilance” against “radical Islamic terrorism.”
They called on Obama to resign for failing even to mention the political force that animates home-grown terrorists and foreign threats as diverse as ISIS, Al Qaeda, and the Muslim Brotherhood.
Trump issued a statement that, “We can't afford to be politically correct anymore,” which further noted, “I am trying to save lives and prevent the next terrorist attack.”
What Trump said wasn't slick or polished or PC, but it came from the heart—which is enough for most Americans. Most of us don't want a president who is anti-Muslim, but we want one who is capable of acknowledging the obvious threat posed by Islamic supremacists who want to unify mosque and state, kill gays, Jews, and other Americans and Westerners—and subject everyone else to a theocratic tyranny.
Most Americans can see that acknowledging this threat is actually the best way to defend our freedoms here at home. Without doing so we will never develop a defense against it.
Rather than taking guns from the law-abiding, we should update laws like the McCarran Act that were used against communists during the Cold War, in order to ban Islamist political activity today.
We should be able to keep Islamist refugees and visa applicants from coming to the United States and incriminate the small but dangerous number of Islamist U.S. citizens like Mateen who are here plotting war against us.
We should be eager to avoid the means to which Israelis had to resort during the jihadist intifadas against them. These steps included guards and searches at nearly every public venue in cities like Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.
As a gay man, I've often wondered when the Islamists would attack us here at home—including at gay venues that pride themselves on being open and welcoming. The time apparently is now.
If we don't want to have to turn our public spaces into fortresses with intrusive, airport-like security, we need to go on the offensive against Islamic supremacists and those who enable them. What Trump suggests is counterintuitively the preservation of freedom.
They also offer a watershed for Republicans: a leader who stands up for gays and softens the GOP's reactionary image on social issues. While the GOP elite—including the oh-so-erudite Romney-Ryan faction that tut-tuts the rest of the party—has consistently advocated second-class citizenship for gays, it is Trump who could drag the party into the 21st century.
Ultimately, the 2016 election is a contest between the dishonest elite and the American public.
Shortly after the Orlando attack, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich remarked about that elite on Fox News: “They don't want to tell us the truth about the world, they don't want to tell us the truth about trade deals, they don't want to tell us the truth about who is getting payoffs in Washington, and they don't want to tell us the truth about Islamic terrorism.”
If in tragedy we find the resolve to defend our country and our freedom—and reject the failures of our political elite—then those who perished at the hand of an Islamist in Orlando will not have died in vain.

How long have you been scout?
“Nine years. I remember the first mission Arsène Wenger assigned me. They asked me to pick up French internationals at Faroe Islands (Henry, Pires &Vieira – 08/09/04).”
Have you ever thought about doing something else, like coach?
“I cant do it … assistant maybe! My vision would need to change, because I'm focused on the individual aspect, and a coach needs to have a more collective vision. I'd like to feel the daily life of a team. I sometimes do with Arsenal. We miss the team life in this job, we are loners. We live with frustration.”
Why?
“We're always looking for players, we fight for players to come, you commit yourself and, when this player signs they don't even know who you are.”
Where do you live?
“London, but I'm rarely there. It's a consuming passion.”
How many games do you attend?
“A little bit more than 250 a year. It depends on the number of tournaments you're following. Our job has changed a lot. The day after the game I can use my iPad and see tons of stats.”
Is it possible to do your job without going to stadium?
“No. The most important is what happens on the pitch. You've got many signals that you can't see on TV, the game without the ball, how they track back. English people call it ‘body language'. It's at the stadium that the decision is made.”
Wenger comes with you?
“Not much, but they watch all the games. He's got an unbelievable memory. In France, they know everyone. So when I talk to them about a player, he's got already an idea of him. But scouting is not only about signing players. You have to say no, because sometimes technical decisions can be influenced by agents, or relatives.
With Arsenal, it's more simple because Arsène decides and they haven't changed their philosophy in the last 17 years. I know how to work for Arsène Wenger, I'm not sure I'd know how to work with other managers. I'm lucky, even though it's sometimes difficult.”
Why?
“When you're a player, you can't imagine what's going on around the stadium, the buzz, you don't know where to park, get your invitation, and after the game there's the traffic congestion.”
That's why the scouts leave the games early?
“Yes, at first it made me crazy. You need a year to adapt.”
How many games do you need to make your decision about a player?
“It depends. Bacary Sagna, I watched them very, very often.”
Laurent Koscielny?
“I've watched them when they were at Tours, in L2 (2008-2009). Maybe we made a mistake, because we could have signed them when they were in L2. But I couldn't imagine their progression. On Tuesday you watch a Champion's League game, and on Friday you watch a L2 game … You've got to think ‘can they go from on level to the other?'”
Do you make research on the personality of the player?
“Yes, but the pitch don't lie. When you see a guy 20 times … and when you see a kid warming up, you understand many things … that's where your experience of former player helps.”
What's your best signing?
“I hate hearing a scout assuming the responsibility of a success or the signing of a player. I hear a lot, ‘I made them sign'. But you never hear ‘I'm the one who refused to sign him' … we all make mistakes. The success of a player is the result of a sum of things”.
What player did you miss?
“I've never thought Ribery would have made this career. But there are many guys … Arsène never thought Thuram would make the career he's made.”

Originally from L'Equipe – October 2013
The campaign just got even more heated with questions again raised over the media's balance in reporting. First, David Brock is back in the news. Brock has been widely attacked for what critics view as sleazy and vicious work on behalf of Hillary Clinton. You may recall Bernie Sanders denounced Clinton for their continued alliance with Brock and use of their controversial PAC organizations. Clinton has refused to denounced Brock or to discourage Democrats from working with or contributing to their PACs. Now, Brock has offered money to anyone who produces damaging video or audio tapes against Trump. In the meantime, Sidney Blumenthal is back in the news. Blumenthal has long been denounced as an “attack dog” for Clinton and something of a rumor spreader. They were so radioactive that the Obama Administration took the rare step to blocking Clinton's effort to bring Blumenthal into the State Department. Blumenthal earned the nickname “Sid Vicious” for what critics call their lethal targeting of anyone who is a political threat to Clinton. However, Clinton has refused to separate themselves from Blumenthal and they continue to be a close confidant. Now, after virtually all of the media from CNN to the New York Times insisted that Trump had lied about Clinton playing the birther card before Trump, reporters have stated that indeed it was not just a couple of Clinton campaign workers (who either resigned or were later fired) but Blumenthal who spread that claim in 2008. Blumenthal denies the story, but the journalist insists that Blumenthal personally pressured them to pursue the story and told them that Obama was born in Kenya. The most recent controversies again raise questions of the Clinton camps use of such people and the media's reporting.
The man who Sanders called “the scum of the Earth” continues to run the huge PACs pushing for Clinton's election. Now, the founder of Media Matters and key figure behind the Correct the Record super PAC, has posted a call for tapes on Trump called “TrumpLeaks.” The posting expressly states “TrumpLeaks can provide some compensation to those who have usable, undoctored video or audio that has been legally obtained or is legally accessible.” It is a call that strikes many as cash for trash, a move that NBC News would “cross a new line.”
The controversy rekindles the view of the Clinton camp as maintaining a shadowy army of PAC and attack forces. However, Brock's long work on behalf of Clinton has received little mainstream attention even after the repeated objections of Bernie Sanders.
In the meantime, the Blumenthal story has reinforced questions over the use of surrogates to spread rumors. The Clinton camp immediately denounced Trump for saying that it was the Clinton camp that first raised the birther issue and that they simply “ended it” by forcing the release of the birth certificate. The Clinton campaign called out Trump as a liar and the media immediately followed suit with anchors assuring viewers that there was no truth to it. The Clinton camp admits that a couple of campaign volunteers did push the story in 2008 but were fired or resigned. Blumenthal however has continued to be one of Clinton's closest advisors.
Former McClatchy Washington Bureau Chief James Asher insisted on Twitter that it was Blumenthal who raised the issue of President Barack Obama's birthplace with them in 2008 and pushed them to pursue the birther story. Blumenthal is not just any advisor. They have long been one of their closest advisors and they have for years refused to denounce them or separate themselves from him. Indeed, many of the Clinton emails are from Blumenthal giving Clinton continual advise on different matters. They were also repeatedly accused of spreading rumors against opponents during prior campaigns.
CNN Jake Tapper did raise Blumenthal's involvement with Vice Presidential candidate Tom Kaine on Sunday.
Tapper: “There's no doubt that it is offensive and it is a lie. But I'm asking you about Sidney Blumenthal, who was banned from joining the Obama administration by the Obama White House precisely because they trafficked in a lot of questionable information about Barack Obama. If it's true, if there's evidence that Sidney Blumenthal did push the lie, should Hillary Clinton disassociate themselves from Blumenthal, and should they pledge they will not work in their administration?” Kaine: “I have no reason to believe that's true, Jake. None. But again, Sidney Blumenthal isn't running for president.”
In the meantime, Politifact has called Trump a liar though it did not delve into the Blumenthal angle. Instead, it notes that it is clear that Clinton people did spread the rumor but focuses on the narrow question if they were “first” or “started” the birther controversy as opposed to being before Trump's raising of the issue.
With the battleground states now in what appears a statistical tie, the fear is that this is only going to get worse before (if ever) it gets better.

First they go planning for an invasion by the French, now the Swiss are going to have a vote on a proposal to give everybody in the country $34,000 a year, no strings attached.
The Swiss referendum process allows any measure gaining 100,000 signatures to get a vote, and the latest one involves a basic income for all adults in the country of 2,500 Swiss francs a month, or nearly $34,000 a year at current exchange rates. The country\'s poverty line is about 2,300 Swiss francs a month.
Residents of the country have been miffed at exorbitant pay for the country\'s bank executives, Reuters reported.
As part of the petition process, organizers dumped millions of 5 centime coins in front of the country\'s parliament building, the Daily Mail reported.

Forty-nine years ago, on Friday, December 3, 1965, this Bob Dylan press conference was recorded at KQED's studios in San Francisco.
The press conference happened at a key point in Dylan's career. They were now a rock star. “Like A Rolling Stone” was a hit and had been on the radio the past summer into fall. Highway 61 Revisited had been released three months earlier, in August.
Dylan was in the Bay Area to perform for two nights — Dec. 3 and Dec. 4 — at the Berkeley Community Theater.
The man who brings Dylan out is Ralph J. Gleason, who at the time was the jazz and pop critic for the San Francisco Chronicle, and a fan of Dylan. Gleason wrote this cover story for Ramparts magazine. It ran in the March 1966 issue.
There are some great details about the press conference here, plus photos.

LAST MATCH
The game's only goal came in the 54th minute. A quick free kick from the right flank by Quakes midfielder Matias Perez Garcia caught the Houston defense napping, and the service into the middle of box found Adam Jahn unmarked for a header inside the far post.
The Dynamo nearly answered three minutes later after Boniek Garcia weaved theirs through the San Jose defense before being taken down in the six-yard box by San Jose goalkeeper David Bingham, and referee Ricardo Salazar awarded a penalty. But the ensuing spot kick from Giles Barnes was sent low to the right post, and Bingham made a diving save to their left to bat the ball outside the post.
Dynamo head coach Owen Coyle made two changes to the team that suffered a 4-1 defeat by FC Dallas at BBVA Compass Stadium. Luis Garrido and Boniek Garcia came into the team, in place of Nathan Sturgis and Will Bruin.

TEAM NEWS
This website is the English version of our Dutch Ragwort website.
Recently, Ragwort has received quite a bit of media coverage. Many facts are presented, but also many myths. It is, for instance, a fact that species of Ragwort are poisonous to mammals, but it is a myth that an animal dies if it ingests only a mouthful. It is also a fact that Ragwort is poisonous to humans, but a myth that it is a serious health hazard to people. Furthermore, it is a fact that Ragwort is currently more common in the Netherlands than 30 years ago, but a myth that this species is an extremely efficient wind disperser.
Although Ragworts can be a significant nuisance to horse keepers, these species are a very important source of nectar and pollen. About 150 species of insects, such as bees, flies and butterflies, visit the plant. Therefore, even it were possible, eradicating the plant is not a desirable option. We will have to find other ways to protect our livestock. There are no easy solutions to the Ragwort problem, but that doesn't mean that there is nothing we can do.
The aim of this website is to distinguish facts from myths by using a scientific approach based on research and advice from biologists, toxicologists, and other experts. In this way, we want to determine the nature and scale of the problem that Ragwort presents to our horses and other livestock. In this way, I would like to contribute to a solution of the Ragwort problem; as a horse lover AND as a Ragwort enthusiast.
Frequently Asked Questions.
Q: Is it true that horses usually do not eat fresh Ragwort?
A: Yes, that is right. Only in exceptional circumstances or when there is a food shortage, horses will eat fresh Ragwort. Horses, however, don't recognize dried Ragwort plants as poisonous and contaminated hay may cause Ragwort poisoning. More info
Q: Will my horse get ill when it occasionally eats a mouthful of ragwort?
A; No, incidentally ingesting small amounts of Ragwort will not result in illness. If, however, horses eat several kilograms of Ragwort a day or small amounts for extended periods, this may lead to irreparable liver damage. More info
Q: Do the toxins in Ragworts accumulate in a horse's body?
A: No. The toxins (pyrrolizidine alkaloids) are excreted within 24-48 hours. If an animal consumes pyrrolidizine alkaloids regularly though, liver damage will accumulate and the animal will show signs of illness. More info
Q: Is it true there are several hundreds of victims each year?
A: The exact number of victims of Ragwort poisoning is unknown. The symptoms of Ragwort poisoning cannot be distinguished from other liver disorders and poisoning can only be confirmed by means of a post-mortem liver exam. These exams are, however, not common practice, and reliable data on the number of victims are therefore not available. There could be more than hundreds of victims, but there could also be much fewer. More info
Q: Will touching a Ragwort plant result in alkaloid poisoning?
A: No. Ragwort poisoning takes place in the digestive system. In the plant, pyrrolidizine alkaloids are stored in their non-toxic form. Only if these substances end up in the digestive system, they will be converted into their toxic form. There is no scientific evidence that skin contact leads to the conversion of non-toxic alkaloids into their toxic form. Some people experience an allergic reaction after skin contact (compositae dermatitis), but this response is caused by sesquiterpene lactones rather than pyrrolizidine alkaloids. These sesquiterpene lactones are common chemical compounds of members of the Sunflower family. More info
Q: Are all Ragwort species poisonous?
A: Yes, all Dutch Ragworts contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids. These are also found in Comfrey and Butterbur.
Q: Why is Ragwort fairly common in horse pastures?
A: Ragwort needs a bare spot to germinate. Horses easily churn up the ground when running, and graze the grass very short, thereby easily creating open spots suitable for seed germination. More info
Q: Why is Ragwort nowadays more common in the Netherlands than before?
A: Ragworts are presumably more common in the Netherlands and neighboring countries than 30 years ago, because the number of suitable habitats has increased due to large-scale renewal of infrastructure, building activities, and efforts to give agricultural land back to nature. In addition, Ragwort seeds have been used to enrich roadsides. There is no evidence that Ragworts have a different habitat preference or better dispersal capabilities than in the days when this species was much less common in the Netherlands. More info
Q: How can I recognize Ragwort?
A: Ragwort is a biennial. In the first it only has leaves organized in a rosette. These can be found throughout most parts of the year. Ragwort usually flowers in the second year (June till October). After the plant has produced seeds, it dies. The leaves of Ragwort are pinnately lobed. Flowerheads often occur in clusters called corymbs. They are yellow with ray and disk flowers. Click here for pictures of Ragwort and other Ragwort species.
Q: I have Ragwort plants growing in my horse's field, what can I do?
A: Ragwort is difficult to eradicate and most methods to remove the plants, such as pulling by hand, mowing, and using herbicides, may have increase rather than decrease the number of Ragwort plants at a given site. The best way is probably to prevent ragwort from establishing in a pasture. Good pasture management is therefore of utmost importance. More info
Q: Is it true that the toxin in Ragworts can poison a whole bale of hay?
A: No. The toxins remain in the plant and don't 'contaminate' the rest of the hay. It is advisable though not to use the rest of the bale for consumption, because undetected parts of the plant may have remained in the hay and can potentially lead to Ragwort poisoning.
Q: There's so much contradicting information about ragwort on the internet. How do I know who is right?
A: Everything that is published on the web should be regarded with skepticism, because everybody can create a website these days and everybody claims to be an expert. It is therefore important to check if statements are supported by the results of professional scientific studies published in peer-reviewed journals. If a statement on a website is not accompanied by a reference to such a scientific paper, it is safest to assume that the statement reflects the views of the author rather than a scientific fact. Otherwise the author would have bothered to refer the reader to where the evidence supporting the statement can be found.
TRENTON -- It was a key voting day that started just after noon -- and didn't end until well after midnight, with the state Assembly passing a surprise sales tax/gas tax deal cut with Gov. Chris Christie.
Here are seven things that happened during a marathon Statehouse session Monday, including votes on the state budget, pension reform, gun control, and more:
1. An unexpected sales-tax agreement
Democrats spent months pushing for a plan replenish New Jersey's nearly broke Transportation Trust Fund -- which pays for new transportation projects -- by raising the state's gas tax by 23 cents.
Some Republicans said they would agree only by trading the hike for a reduction in New Jersey's estate tax. Other GOP lawmakers said they would oppose it either way.
But after hours of negotiating Monday, Christie, a Republican, and Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto (D-Hudson) emerged around midnight with something else entirely: a deal to counter the hike by reducing New Jersey's 7 percent sales tax to 6 percent by 2018.
Members of the state Senate apparently weren't on board and left without a vote. But the Assembly approved the proposal just before 1 a.m., despite fierce opposition from Assembly Transportation Committee Chair John Wisniewski (D-Middlesex).
"What we're doing tonight is wrong," says Wisniewski in late night floor speech opposing surprise tax deal pic.twitter.com/Ili6wGXWOz -- Sal Rizzo (@rizzoTK) June 28, 2016
Christie, meanwhile, held a late-night session with reporters championing the agreement outside their office:
2. Passing the state budget
Christie has until Friday to sign a balanced state budget. And both the Senate and Assembly took only minutes Monday to pass a $34.8 billion version proposed by Democrats.
Now, their version heads to the governor, who is likely to make some changes before signing it.
3. No override on Christie open-space veto
Senate Democrats and a handful of Republicans were about to vote to override one of Christie's repeated vetoes of legislation to preserve open space, farmland, and historical sites in New Jersey.
But the governor, who has never been overridden, struck a last-minute deal.
4. Pension proposal moves forward
The Assembly voted to place a controversial referendum on the November ballot asking New Jersey voters to commit to spending billions of dollars to repair the state's public worker pension system.
Now, it's up to the Senate to give final approval to putting the question before voters.
5. Battle over handgun carry permits
In their ongoing battle over New Jersey's tight gun control laws, Democrats sent Christie a bill that would more strictly define the "justifiable need" residents must show to obtain a permit to carry a handgun in the state.
The governor, though, is likely to veto the measure.
6. 'Smart gun' bill heads to Christie
In another firearm-related vote, the Assembly sent Christie a bill that would revive personalized handguns, or "smart guns."
But, again, the governor is expected to reject it.
7. No override vote on gun bill yet
In yet another firearm-related vote, the Senate was supposed to attempt to override Christie's veto of a bill to make sure people convicted of domestic abuse in the state are stripped of their guns.
But with one state senator not present, the vote was postponed to Thursday.

MANILA -- Dominic "Papa Dom" Gamboa, the founding member and vocalist of the '90s reggae band Tropical Depression, died on Wednesday, the Organisasyon ng Pilipinong Mang-aawit (OPM) said.
Gamboa's family has requested privacy at this time. They have yet to disclose the cause of the singer's death. No details regarding the wake has been announced.
OPM confirmed Gamboa's passing on Wednesday afternoon, according to a post on the Philippine Daily Inquirer's Twitter page.
Gamboa, whose career spanned over two decades, is credited for popularizing reggae in the local music scene. Their band, Tropical Depression, was known for incorporating Philippine indigenous instruments with its music.
The group produced four albums between 1993 and 2004, including "Kapayapaan." Tropical Depression was also composed of Pexx Holigores, Lito Crisostomo, TJ Espinola, Mike Llacar, Omnie Saroca, and Lala Lejeune.
JNS.org – The man who played L.A.P.D. homicide detective sergeant Roger Murtaugh in all four Lethal Weapon films is starring in a different kind of sequel. But unlike Murtaugh and their famous “I'm too old for this sh**” catchphrase, Danny Glover is not too old for another call to boycott Israel.
Glover in 2009 signed on to a declaration condemning Israel as an “apartheid regime,” and dismissing the work of the Tel Aviv filmmakers featured in the Toronto International Film Festival as “Israeli propaganda.”
In 2014, Glover is at it again, joining others featured in American Revolutionary: The Evolution of Grace Lee Boggs in a statement lamenting the documentary film's screening at the DocAviv festival in Tel Aviv on May 13 and 15.
“We stand in solidarity with the people of Palestine, and support their call for cultural and academic boycott of Israel,” stated the signatories, who said they “immediately took action to have the film withdrawn from the festival,” to no avail. Which means Glover, at age 67, isn't “too old” for the anti-Israel BDS movement.
Between Glover's campaigns to boycott Israel and co-star Mel Gibson's infamous anti-Semitic rant in 2006, the cast of Lethal Weapon may indeed be lethal to the Jewish and pro-Israel communities.
It's key that the emotion is “overwhelming.” Human brains have evolved to deal effectively with mild to moderate fear stimuli—it's only when experiencing extraordinary fear (or another emotion) that our bodies become less well-suited to cope. Humaira Siddiqi, the chief of psychiatry at Kaiser Permanente in northern Virginia, tells me that when we start to experience fear, or any other emotion, it begins in a part of the brain called the amygdala. In mild to moderate cases, this information is then relayed to the hippocampus, situated directly above it. The hippocampus puts our emotions into context. Consider your reaction any time you think you spot something moving from the corner of your eye—your amygdala may process fear or alarm, thinking you've seen a mouse, or a centipede, or something else awful. The hippocampus is where you realize you either saw (a) nothing, or (b) yes, a mouse or a centipede, but neither one will hurt you. Only when fear is too big and too sudden do people run into trouble. “When you have a massive surge of a fear response, it can sometimes bypass the hippocampus, and when it does that, the fear doesn't have a context,” says Siddiqi. “It's just fear. It hijacks the brain.”
When such a massive fear response occurs, the body releases a surge of hormones (epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol), which can lead to an irregular heartbeat, increased blood pressure, stroke, heart attack, and as a result, death (though it's unlikely). Part of the reason for this hormone release is what Siddiqi describes as an ultimately outdated evolutionary response to fear: fight or flight. “Our modern fear typically doesn't require a physical response. It requires us to think. So in a sense we're sort of tackling the fear stimuli with outdated adaptation from our evolution.”
Because people don't (usually) address our fears by literally running away, or fighting, the excess adrenaline doesn't serve their actual needs. In fact, in cases of extreme fear or anxiety, says Siddiqi, it's usually best for people to “override” their body's fear response by taking deep, measured breaths. “Things like taking a few deep breaths might seem kind of silly, but when you're breathing, it makes the heart slow down a little bit,” they say. “You're consciously slowing down the body's sympathetic response, and when you do that, the grip the sympathetic system has on the body is loosened, and you're allowed now to relax and get [in] control.”
Dying of fear (or any strong emotion) is very unlikely, though the risk increases somewhat with advancing age and the development of any underlying heart condition, says Steinbaum. And fear is not our enemy, but our ally.
“It's a good thing that we have the fear response. It's a good thing that we have anxiety, and it's even a good thing we have depression, because they are signals or alarms that something's wrong,” says Siddiqi. Fear is helpful to survival much, much more often than it is a threat. “We've evolved with fear as an adaptive mechanism,” they say. “If something like that could kill us off, we would not have evolved with it.”
All that said, it's always worthwhile to understand and honor one's personal threshold. There is a reason for those signs outside roller coasters warning people with heart conditions not to ride. There is a reason some people cannot and will not be talked into seeing It, even if I assure them it's not that scary. There is a reason I will never in a million years ever jump out of an airplane hoping my parachute opens. Fear probably won't kill you, but then again, why risk it?

France's data protection watchdog has said it will take action against US giant Google for failing to comply with national privacy guidelines.
The issue of data protection has gathered steam worldwide following revelations by Edward Snowden, a former contractor with the National Security Agency, that the US had a vast, secret programme called PRISM to monitor Internet users.
France's National Commission on Computing and Freedom (CNIL) said on Friday that Google had failed to comply with data protection guidelines within a three-month deadline and said it would begin a formal sanction procedure, under which the US giant could be fined up to 150,000 euros ($205,000).
CNIL had asked Google to inform web users in France on how it processes their personal data and to define exactly how long they can store the information.
It had also requested that the US giant obtain users' permission before storing cookies on their computers, referring to files that track netizens and allow companies to target them with tailored commercials.
"On the last day of this (three-month) period, Google responded to the CNIL. Google contests the reasoning of the CNIL and has not complied with the requests laid down in the enforcement notice," the watchdog said in a written statement.
"In this context, the Chair of the CNIL will now designate a rapporteur for the purpose of initiating a formal procedure for imposing sanctions."
In its response, Google made no mention of any challenge to CNIL's reasoning and maintained it respects European law.
Privacy policy
"Our privacy policy respects European law and allows us to create simpler, more effective services. We have engaged fully with CNIL throughout this process and will continue to do so going forward," Google spokesperson Al Verney said, according to AP news agency.
France's move follows Google's introduction last year of a new privacy policy which enables it to track user activity across its search engine, Gmail, the Google+ social networking platform and other services it owns, which include YouTube.
The changes make it easier for Google to collect and process data that could be used by advertisers to target individuals with offers tailored to their specific interest, thereby increasing the company's revenue potential.
Google has defended the changes it made last year on the ground that they simplify and standardise its approach across its various services.
But critics argue that the policy, which offers no ability to opt out aside from refraining from signing in to Google services, gives the operator of the world's largest search engine unprecedented ability to monitor its users.
While always on the agenda, the issue of data protection took on an extra dimension when Snowden's revelations were published in June.
Under PRISM, the National Security Agency can issue directives to Internet firms demanding access to emails, online chats, pictures, files, videos and more.
Since then, keen to dispel any suspicion over their role in the programme, Yahoo, Google, Facebook and others have pushed for permission to disclose more details to users about demands for data made on them in the name of fighting terrorism or other threats.
Twitter has apologised for blocking the word “bisexual” from search results, saying that it was wrongly included in an “out of date” list of terms associated with explicit content.
The company says the extent of the block was a “technical issue”, which will be fixed in the next day, adding that some terms in particular were “incorrectly included”.
The company initially blocked the search term on Friday, as part of a sweeping array of changes to the site introduced in response to a day-long boycott of Twitter by many women in early October.
From Friday, users who searched for the term bisexual on the site found that they were blocked from seeing photos, videos and news in their search results. “Your search setting could be protecting you from some potentially sensitive content”, the site warned users.
Now, Twitter says that even for genuinely explicit content, the photo and video sections should show results, but that the results should not be automatically expanded and playing.
“Late last week, we discovered a technical issue that affected search results: searches for certain words related to sexuality did not populate complete results,” the company said. “We apologise for anyone negatively impacted by this bug. It is not consistent with our values as a company.”

Some terms, it said, should not have been included in the list at all: “One of the signals we use to identify sensitive media is a list of terms that frequently appear alongside adult content. Many of these words on the list are not inherently explicit, which is why they must be used alongside other signals to determine if content is sensitive.
“Our implementation of this list in search allowed Tweets to be categorised based solely on text, without taking other signals into account. Also, the list was out of date, had not been maintained and incorrectly included terms that are primarily used in non-sensitive contexts.”
Twitter added: “We have audited the list and removed terms that should not have been included. We are making changes during the next 24 hours to correct this mistake.”
The #WomenBoycottTwitter protest that sparked the changes was initially prompted by the suspension of actor Rose McGowan from the social network, after they tweeted an email containing a personal phone number as part of a discussion of Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein's abuse.
Although the protest had little to do with sexual content on Twitter, that was one of the areas the company addressed in its response. It also announced an intention to treat hateful imagery and hate symbols on par with explicit pornography, as well as a plan to “take enforcement action against organisations that use violence as a means to advance their cause”.

The Dutchman has taken three podium finishes since their switch to Red Bull at the Spanish Grand Prix, and is currently just 16 points adrift of third-placed Kimi Raikkonen in the drivers' standings.
Knowing how good their current form is, and how close things are at the front, they say it is not out of the question for them to surge up the table to end up only behind Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg.
"We are pretty close, so we will see where we end up at the end of the season," they said.
"It will be between third or sixth – hopefully. You try to do the best possible race every race and we see after Abu Dhabi where we are."
Hungaroring form
Red Bull is tipped for a strong performance in Hungary this weekend, with the team viewed as many people's favourites for the victory this weekend.
Verstappen thinks, however, that while it may not be as good an opportunity as Monaco, it can still do well.
"I think the best chance was in Monaco for sure," they said. "Here as well the car can be very strong and I am definitely looking forward to the weekend.
"We've been strong even on tracks where I didn't expect it to be strong, and it is about set-up now and improving during the sessions."
They added: "Last year was good [with Toro Rosso]. We had some luck to finish fourth with a drive-through. Hopefully this year we are aiming for more than fourth, so hopefully we can be on the podium."

I love the tantalizing taste of a good pepperoni pizza and nobody can take that away from me (just try). This enticing and savory Keto version has saved my sanity on more than one occasion!
Makes 8 slices
Ingredients:
Base:
1 cup (113g) mozzarella cheese, shredded
1 cup (113g) strong Cheddar cheese, shredded
2 tbsp. cream cheese
4 ounces (113g) almond flour
1 extra-large fresh egg
Topping:
3 ounces (85g) chopped pepperoni
¼ tsp. dried oregano
¼ cup (28g) sundried tomatoes in olive oil, chopped
¾ cup (99g) sliced mozzarella cheese
½ cup (21g) fresh basil leaves, torn
Directions:
Pre-heat the oven to 425°F (218°C). Prepare a cookie sheet by covering it with non-stick parchment paper. Gently melt the shredded cheeses together in ceramic bowl in a microwave or over a pan of boiling water. Cool a little before kneading in the almond flour, cream cheese and the egg. When a smooth dough is formed spread it out thinly on the prepared cookie sheet. You can use your hands for this or roll it between 2 sheets of parchment. Place the cookie sheet in the hot oven and bake for 10 – 15 minutes until it begins to brown around the edges. Remove from the oven and top with the pepperoni, sun dried tomatoes, sliced mozzarella and the oregano. Place the pizza back in the oven to heat the topping trough and melt the cheese – about 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and sprinkle on the torn basil leaves. Slice and serve.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - A build-up of Russian military on Ukraine's border with the Crimean region, which has been annexed by Moscow, could reflect “very bad intentions,” Ukraine's U.N. envoy warned on Thursday after the U.N. Security Council discussed the growing tensions.
Ukrainian U.N. Ambassador Volodymyr Yelchenko, who requested the closed-door meeting of the 15-member council, said Russia had amassed more than 40,000 troops in Crimea, seized by Moscow in 2014, and on the Ukrainian border.
“These numbers may reflect some very bad intentions and this is the last thing we would like to happen,” they told reporters.
“My biggest hope is that this discussion (in the council) will help the Russian Federation to understand that they cannot really continue with this kind of behavior,” Yelchenko said.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has pledged to take counter-measures against Ukraine which they accused of sending saboteurs into Crimea to carry out terrorist acts.
Yelchenko called on Russia to produce proof of those accusations.
Russian U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin dismissed concerns about a Russian military build-up. They described the Security Council meeting as “useful” to explain the situation.
“Instead of counting our military they should be bringing an end to the conflict in Donetsk and stop shelling civilians in Donetsk and Luhansk,” Churkin told reporters after the meeting.
Pro-Russian separatists are fighting the Kiev government's forces in the eastern Ukraine region despite a fragile ceasefire. Civilian casualties from shelling, mines and booby traps in eastern Ukraine are at their highest in a year, the United Nations' human rights chief has said.
A peace plan for the eastern Donbass region of Ukraine, negotiated in Minsk between Ukraine and Russia by Germany and France some 18-month ago, has stalled for months.
“There is chaos in Kiev, they don't know what to do about Donetsk,” Churkin said. “We call upon all those who have influence on Kiev to make sure that they do what they are supposed to do (under the Minsk agreement).”
The Security Council has discussed Ukraine dozens of times since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, but has been deadlocked on the topic as Moscow is one of the body's five veto powers.
Back in 1966, the FBI was keeping watch over Muhammad Ali. They were investigating the Nation of Islam and were keen to keep an eye on them after their speech at a Miami mosque.
This is all according to newly released FBI documents that were put up on the FBI website.
Ali died in June at the age of 74. All the big names came out to honor them after their passing; even Bill Clinton was at their funeral.
The FBI has a long history of monitoring public figures. They closely watched Martin Luther King, Jr. as well as John Lennon in the 60's and 70's.
–LeBron James donates $2.5M to Muhammad Ali at Smithsonian–
The documents released about Ali were classified for years. They were only released after conservative group Judicial Watch sued them for access to the papers.
In the documents, there are requests for agents to monitor their divorce from their first wife. They claimed this was a “lead.”
“The Miami (FBI) office is requested to follow the divorce action between Cassius and Sonja Clay with particular emphasis being placed on any NOI (Nation of Islam) implication being brought into this matter,” according to one document.
A different document covers them speaking at a mosque in 1966. In their speech, they discussed efforts to strip them of their boxing title, and they blamed the “white man.”
The biggest controversy concerned their conscientious objector status during the Vietnam War. They were stripped of their boxing title in 1967 for their refusal to go to war.
The FBI documents stress that Ali was never under investigation personally.
The small group of U.S. senators publicly calling for President Donald Trump to resign in the wake of numerous sexual assault accusations now includes Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.).
Casey joined senators Cory Booker (D-NJ), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Ron Wyden (D-OR) in saying Trump should resign amid numerous allegations of misconduct spanning several decades.
"President Trump's documented history of sexual harassment and assault should have been disqualifying during last year's election," Casey told ThinkProgress in a statement Wednesday. "His offensive verbal assault against Senator Gillibrand yesterday demonstrate they still don't get it. And while they should resign, we know they won't. I support a congressional investigation in order to hold them accountable for their actions."
The recent call for Trump to resign follows Sen. Al Franken's resignation and replacement and the retirement of U.S. Rep John Conyers. ThinkProgress asked Senate Democrats about whether Trump should follow the path of others who have been accused, receiving responses from the group that included Casey.
Many Democrats have said Robert Muller's investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 election should run its course before pushing for a resignation or an impeachment vote. Others are calling for a congressional investigation into the claims rather than an outright call for resignation.
The calls for Trump to resign over allegations comes just days after three accusers came together at a news conference, renewing their claims of sexual assault against the president and asking why their accounts did not have any effect on the election. A day before the accusers' news conference, Nikki Haley, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, said Trump accusers "should be heard" while appearing on CBS's "Face the Nation."
Trump has continued to deny the allegations and have called the claims politically motivated. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a spokesperson for the White House, maintains that the American people settled the issue of the accusations by electing Trump.
ELLSWORTH, Maine —- Try as they might, Trevor Seip and Jennifer Sansosti cannot contain their excitement.
The young engaged couple recently shipped their lives from out of state to a rustic, 63-acre property they bought on Winkumpaugh Road, where they hope to build a home and future together.
They are not the first to move to rural Maine from a more heavily populated part of the East Coast — Pennsylvania in their case — with dreams of homesteading in the woods. Nor are they the first to do so while in possession of a well-thumbed copy of “The Good Life,” the 1954 book by former Brooksville residents Helen and Scott Nearing that has served as a manual for simple, sustainable living for so many.
“It's full of life,” Sansosti said of their wooded property which abuts a stream that flows toward Branch Lake. “It has an abundance of natural resources.”
But there aren't many who do so while living inside former marine shipping containers. Seip and Sansosti, both in their late 20s, have two, each about 20 feet long and 8 feet wide and high, that they have modified into living units, complete with electricity and running water. They have spent much of the past year modifying the containers, which they bought on eBay for a total of $1,500, in Stroudsburg, Pa. This spring they had them delivered to their former logging property on Winkumpaugh Road.
Inside one of the two containers, which they insulated, plumbed and wired themselves, is a table and bed that fold up against the wall, a cushioned bench seat, a sink, a camp stove, a wall-mounted propane heater, and a bathroom complete with composting toilet and full-size shower. In the other is a large storage closet and a folding futon that converts into a couch. Each has one or two windows and conventional residential doors.
“You need to use every inch you can when you're dealing with 160 square feet” of floor space, Sansosti said.
“This whole thing has been done on a shoestring budget,” Seip added. “We want to build our own village up here.”
Seip and Sansosti designed their living units to exist off the grid. They installed energy-efficient LED lights, which they power off batteries, and they collect and then filter their water from the nearby stream or from a rain barrel they have on the roof. They already own electricity-producing solar panels, but are waiting to have the containers mounted on frost-proof concrete posts before they install and connect them. They also hope to erect a residential wind turbine at some point.
After the containers are set on the posts, facing each other a few feet apart end-to-end, they plan to install a sod roof across both that covers the space in between. A greenhouse, wood stove and adobe structures for additional living space also are part of their master plan.
“We want to minimize our cost of living, but maximize our standard of living,” Seip said.
“We want to be more self-reliant,” Sansosti added.
They also envision having a few small livestock animals (“Nothing so big that we couldn't carry it to the veterinarian if it got sick,” Seip said) and using some of the stone on the property for structures they build. Eventually, they said, they want to teach others what they learn along the way so society can become more sustainable as a whole.
More information about the couples' endeavor can be found online at their blog, www.thearkhaus.com.
Seip, a midcoast Maine native who grew up in Pennsylvania, and Sansosti, an art school graduate who hails from New York City, said they have been planning to homestead somewhere and considered places as far away as Uruguay. They chose Maine in part to be closer to their families, they said, but also because Maine is more tolerant of their unconventional housing choice.
The couple acknowledge they are not the first people to take a nontraditional route in putting a roof over their heads. Homesteaders in Maine and elsewhere have been known to live in tents, buses or straw bale homes while learning how to live off the surrounding land as much as they can.
For the young couple, this is the main reason they are enthusiastic about moving to Maine, which has a rich tradition of people providing for themselves. They know there are many others here who share their desire to make much of their own food and housing, instead of buying everything from someone else, while living comfortably and sustainably.
While they are getting started, they've been able to help support themselves by working part time at Happytown Farm, a nearby organic farm on Happytown Road in Orland, they said.
“We're just plugging ourselves into an already thriving community,” Seip said. “It is so resourceful.”
“We make [our plan] up as we go along,” Sansosti said. “This is what the future looks like.”
PANAJI, India (Reuters) - India's gold demand might reach 950 tonnes this year as lower prices spur buying during the peak festival season and for weddings, the world's biggest gold refiner, Valcambi, said.

Stronger demand in the world's second-biggest gold consumer could support global prices, which rebounded this week after hitting a 5-1/2 year low under $1,100 an ounce in July.
Valcambi Chief Executive Michael Mesaric said gold demand would be strong this year. “It could be between 900 tonnes to 950 tonnes,” they said on the sidelines of the International Gold Convention in the city of Panaji in Goa state.
Demand for gold jewellery is usually robust in the final quarter as India celebrates festivals such as Diwali and Dussehra, when buying the metal is considered auspicious.
“All this should boost demand,” said Alistair Hewitt, the World Gold Council's (WGC) market intelligence director.
In the first half of 2015, Indian demand fell 7 percent from a year earlier to 346.2 tonnes. But gold prices in India have risen more than 11 percent since hitting their lowest in four years in late July.
Industry officials say Indian demand is determined more by perceptions about future price movements.
“If consumers feel prices will go up, then they will buy during the festive season,” said Rajan Venkatesh, managing director, India bullion, ScotiaMocatta, part of the Bank of Nova Scotia.
They expect Indian gold imports of between 850 tonnes and 900 tonnes in 2015, compared with 891.5 tonnes in 2014.
Another factor affecting gold buying will be the June-September monsoon rains. While some parts of the country had good rainfall the season is expected to be deficient overall.
Earlier this month the India Meteorological Department (IMD) kept its forecast that rains would be 88 percent of the long-run average as a strengthening El Nino weather pattern was likely to trim rainfall in August-September to 84 percent, raising fears of the first drought in six years.
“If monsoon remains weak, then it will be a big negative for gold. More than 60 percent of demand comes from rural India,” Rajan said.

On the 5th of November in 1605, Guy Fawkes attempted to blow up the Houses of Parliament in Britain and kill King James the First. The plan was discovered just before the fuse was lit and Guy Fawkes was convicted and executed. Today, the plot continues to be remembered through the use of fireworks, bonfire parties, and general celebrations. This celebration is observed primarily in England, but also in places such as New Zealand. Four hundred years on, Guy Fawkes Day is generally an excuse to have a firecracker of a party.
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State John Kerry traveled to Russia on Monday to meet with President Vladimir V. Putin and discuss whether it is possible for the two sides to work together on a political solution for the conflict in Syria, American officials said.
The meeting, which will be held on Tuesday in the Black Sea city of Sochi, represents a new attempt by the Obama administration to pursue a political solution to Syria after years of frustrated diplomacy and deepening violence there.
It is also another twist in the United States relations with Russia. The Obama administration has sometimes sought to isolate Mr. Putin because of their military intervention in Ukraine, but has also sought to carve out areas where the two sides might cooperate.
“This trip is part of our ongoing effort to maintain direct lines of communication with senior Russian officials and to ensure U.S. views are clearly conveyed,” said the State Department, which added that the subjects will include “a full range of bilateral and regional issues, including Iran, Syria and Ukraine.”
Most consumers in the United States oppose the proposed merger of the country's biggest cable TV and broadband Internet providers, according to a new survey by the Consumer Reports National Research Center. The $45.2 billion deal, which would combine Comcast with Time Warner Cable, is subject to approval by the Federal Communications Commission.
Cable TV companies rank among the least trusted organizations that most Americans do business with, so it's not surprising that the people are concerned. Seventy-four percent of the public says they believe that prices will rise if the merger goes through, and two-thirds say that Comcast will have less incentive to improve customer service. The study, which drew on a nationally representative pool of 1,573 individuals, was conducted on behalf of the Consumers Union, the policy and advocacy arm of Consumer Reports.
“Most Americans don't have time to follow complicated corporate mergers but this deal has definitely captured the public's attention,” Delara Derakhshani, policy counsel for Consumers Union, said. “Consumers are tired of rising monthly bills and lousy customer service for cable and Internet and have little faith that this mega merger will make things any better.” The new Comcast would control more than two-thirds of all cable television subscribers in the country, and nearly 40 percent of the high-speed Internet market.
Read our previous coverage of the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal. And if you're opposed to the merger, sign the Consumers Union petition.
Respondents said they were also worried that the deal will be a blow to net neutrality, the principle that all traffic on the Internet should be treated equally. With fewer, bigger gatekeepers in place, 81 percent of people surveyed were at least somewhat concerned that the combined company will play favorites with video content. Along with its role as a service provider, Comcast is a content creator and broadcaster through its controlling interest in NBC Universal.
Respondents to the survey said that the merger could encourage further consolidation in the telecommunications industry. In fact, 2014 has seen a wave of merger activity. AT&T has proposed a $49 billion combination with DirecTV, and Sprint has expressed its intention to join forces with T-Mobile to create a strong No. 3 carrier in the mobile market. But neither of those developments would yield a category-leading juggernaut like a combined Comcast and Time Warner Cable.

I'm not sure what LG meant to make me remember about the new V30, but I keep thinking about that slow zoom.
A new targeted cinematic zoom mode in the V30's camera settings enables the sort of gentle zoom that immediately brings to mind every "Curb Your Enthusiasm" meme in the world.
I shot some footage of CNET's Jessica Dolcourt using Point Zoom on the LG V30 during a hands-on demo in New York. It looks nice. Then we added "Frolic" by Luciano Michelini.
Now playing: Watch this: LG V30's Point Zoom feels like Curb Your Enthusiasm mode
Even better.
Before the music, I felt weird, standing across the room and slowly zooming in on Jessica in cinematic black and white. I felt a bit like a stalker. That's because I hadn't added my "Curb Your Enthusiasm" music yet.
I want this slow zoom in everything now. It's fun. And a small request: please add "Frolic Mode" to the V30's in-phone editing tools. LG, HBO, figure out a way to make this work.

Some members of B.C.'s First Nation are calling for greater fiscal transparency in the wake of revelations that a band councillor has been removed from their management position following an independent financial audit.
In May, the Squamish Nation launched an investigation into how money earmarked for emergency use was being spent.
Last week, after reviewing the investigator's report, the Squamish Nation Chiefs and Council announced council co-chair Krisandra Jacobs would no longer be employed by the band as manager of communications and band services.
In a notice to band members recently posted on its website, Squamish Nation said its Chiefs and Council are now also reviewing the elected positions held by Jacobs and Glen Newman, the band manager.
"Chiefs and Council have sent a letter to each of the elected officials advising them of the possible outcomes that Chiefs and Council are considering respecting their elected positions and are offering to meet with each elected official separately to consider any additional information they may wish to provide," the notice stated.
Jacobs has been a band councillor and manager of communications since 1997. Newman has served on council for over 20 years.
The notice says the Squamish Nation will reach its decision regarding their elected roles by Oct. 18 and release a summary of the facts to band members the following day.
The investigator's report into the disbursement of the band's emergency funds is being kept confidential, according to the notice, for privacy and legal reasons.
Band members call for transparency
A small group of concerned Squamish band members took to the band office Tuesday afternoon, demanding a copy of the investigation report. They said they were denied.
Squamish band member Bev Brown said the report should be made public, and charges laid, if there's been abuse of trust.
"Any democratic community would be privy to that information. If it was the provincial or federal government, it would be provided," said Brown.
"I feel like we are in the dark in terms of finances, period. We know where the federal funds come from because they provide it online and give it to you. With the own-source revenues, we're not even apprised of what companies we own and operate."
Own-source revenue is income from First Nation-owned projects and real estate holdings.
Squamish band member Jo-Ann Nahanee says the lack of details is fuelling rumours about band finances.
"We have little information about who asked for the independent investigation or why it was asked for," said Nahanee. "We have a right to that information."
Hazel Desharnais of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada (AANDC) said the matter is internal to the Squamish Nation, and the department did not call for the third-party investigation.
"Our government expects First Nation band councils to use taxpayer dollars responsibly and for the benefit of all community members, which is why we brought in the First Nations Financial Transparency Act," Desharnais said via email.
As called for by that Act, the Squamish Nation posted its financial statements and a schedule of remuneration for chiefs and councillors this summer.
The projected 2014 operating budget for Squamish Nation was just under $60 million. The federal transfer to the band for 2013 from AANDC was $11.25 million.
Jacobs' salary as manager of communications and band services was $99,841 for 12 months, with expenses of $15,029. Newman earned $72,898 as band manager and had expenses totalling $27,327.
Neither Jacobs nor officials from the Squamish Nation responded to CBC's requests for an interview.
The Squamish Nation has a registered population of over 4,000 members, about half of which live on reserve. Its traditional territory spans areas across downtown Vancouver, the North Shore, the Squamish area and Whistler.
We all saw it, or didn't see it we should say. The moon didn't rise and we have to find out why.
One evening in late fall the people of Mercuria came together to watch the moon rise as they had for centuries. The moon was the source of all magic in the world and the inhabitants worshiped it daily. On this fateful night the moon did not rise and in the midst of sheer panic from the population, four heroes bravely step forward to discover why the moon has stopped rising and to put themselves to a test of will to save Mercuria. Kitfox's Moon Hunters is a non-linear action adventure inspired by the Zelda series. The choices and discoveries you make unravel the mythology surrounding Mercuria and the mystery of the moon's disappearance. You barely begin your quest before monsters take over the land. Use your time well Hero and unravel the mystery of the missing moon!
Moon Hunters' gameplay is distinctive amongst similar titles in the genre. The adventure can be beaten in just over an hour and to understand and unlock all of the story, it's meant to be beaten several times. Every time it is completed you will find new parts of the story and slowly discover why the moon has not risen by adding star constellations to the sky with each completion. Every time a new journey is started the choices the hero makes determines how much of the story is told. NPCs react differently depending on decisions made by the characters and the time of day. In addition to learning more of the story; new magic, relics, and characters can be unlocked with multiple playthroughs. Every beginning is different and exciting giving Moon Hunters good replay value.
I see the inspiration from Zelda when battling enemies or exploring the map, though where Moon Hunters really shines is it's local multiplayer. Initially four heroes can be chosen; the Spellblade, Druid, Occulist, and Witch. The protagonists have three abilities each, a light and heavy attack along with a dash or escape move. Fluid attacks and spells keep fighting efficient and Heroes abilities benefit from one another by providing a greater range of battle tactics by combining abilities. The Druid's slow spell helps the spellblade have a safe escape from bounding enemies or an occulist summon may give the witch time to revive a fallen ally. The adventure moves fast and again, beating it takes just an hour. Moon Hunters entices you with multiple plays to discover what has happened to the moon and the people you are trying to save.
Pixel and hand drawn art fills the action packed adventure making it look great. Pixel art games have hit the market successfully in the recent few years with releases like FEZ and Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery. Moon Hunters blends nicely within the genre with its beautiful graphics and artwork for each hero, NPC, and enemy. The visualization of each character really helps flesh out the story and gives the heroes a personality that is hard to relay with just pixel characters. Having the artist work directly with the developers and programmers during vital creation times is essential in creating a well rounded experience for the player. The artist that created these works name is Xin Ran Liu and is the Co-Founder and Art Director of Kitfox Games. Their direct involvement with Moon Hunters is evident with the alluring artwork and the personification of the characters they drew.
There are some drawbacks to Moon Hunters that are insignificant compared to rest of what's offered. As you progress and unlock more relics and characters, it becomes easier with each playthrough taking away from the drive to kill hordes of enemies. Moon Hunters is exciting and fun but needs a difficulty increase option to keep up the challenge as the heroes gain strength. No option to add a CPU companion in single-player lacks the excitement that multiplayer has when playing alone. Lack of teammates will make the hero die faster, as no one can revive you on the field when you fall. The interactions between the characters and NPCs greatly differs when only playing single-player as different interactions will happen if more heroes are present. Both of these issues could be easily fixed with a difficulty adjuster and the ability to have a CPU helper with you.
Moon Hunters' fast battles, quick completion, and vast story will keep any action adventurer happy for hours. Kitfox brought a unique quality to the genre by making the player replay the story several times to understand what has happened to the moon and Mercuria in general. The choices the heroes face and how NPCs react is shown through great artwork and fluid pixelization. The multiplayer brings all the best elements of Moon Hunters together and gives your friends a reason to get their asses off the couch and come play. In-depth mythology, efficiently fun gameplay, and four person multiplayer makes Moon Hunters an unmistakably great experience.
It's a Tuesday after school and 25 elementary school personnel are gathered at the Office of School Health of the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD). They are there to learn about gender diversity and how to bring this conversation into the elementary schools. The District is breaking new ground by giving educators tools and resources to make their classrooms, curriculum, and health services inclusive of children of all gender identities and expressions. In this workshop, participants receive posters, pins, sample lesson plans, and books, including the bilingual children's book I wrote, One of a Kind, Like Me/Único como yo.
I spoke with Erik Martinez, LGBTQ Programs Coordinator, to learn about SFUSD's work on gender diversity in elementary schools. Erik, who grew up queer and Latino in a small town in California's Central Valley, wants all children in the District to experience acceptance and belonging.
Why do you think it's important to include gender diversity in the curriculum for young children?
In this age group, there's a lot of openness and imagination at play. Children are in the early stages of socialization, learning the parameters of how and who they can be in the world.
Reading LGBTQ inclusive stories is a way to validate what they may be already be thinking around gender and gender roles. We are planting the seed at young ages for people to think about gender.
It's especially important for young children who are transgender or nonbinary. They may be the only one in their family or in their classroom. We are validating their experience, so they know that they aren't alone and that the classroom is a space for them. This can have profound psychological and wellbeing impacts on a student.
Anything you can do to create more positive bonds, more compassion among young people, the less likely you will see social isolation and bullying.
What are you doing as a district to support this?
We're fortunate to have a district that supports K-12 LGBTQ inclusion in curricular topics. We provide materials, including books. Read alouds are very popular among elementary school teachers for teaching valuable social lessons. It's an easy way for a teacher to initiate a conversation without having expertise around sex and gender. We want to make implementation as easy as possible for teachers, so we create lesson plans or curricula to go along with the books and train them to use the materials.
We also raise awareness of gender inclusive practices and encourage schools to do an event to raise awareness. April is our district LGBTQ Pride Month and several schools are doing Rainbow Days and teach-ins. Some do Pride Parades, bring in community speakers, lead workshops for parents, or teach a single lesson focusing on the topic.
Posters and pins are another way of promoting pride, safety and inclusion in our district. We have a Pride Poster Series by Design Action Collective in English, Spanish, and Chinese. The buttons were inspired by one of the posters and are worn by staff and students to signify pride in our community.
What have you learned about what works or doesn't work?
All it takes is one person at a school site to make things happen.
Providing materials to a school isn't a guarantee that they will be used. There needs to be personal investment at the school site, such as one teacher who is passionate about the topic.
Providing training for teachers increases the likelihood of implementation. The District can also come in and make it happen – be an encouraging voice.
Fear still exists among teachers and administrators – of the potential to say something harmful, or of backlash among parents. So if you can address those fears, you're more likely to see implementation and change at a school site.
Parent advocacy makes a difference. If parents know the rights of the students, can identity staff to be champions, and know the resources in the District, they can be a force for change.
What recommendations do you have for other districts?
Invest in this work. Hire LGBTQ people, especially those of color. Make it a priority. Spend time with staff, whether in professional development training or on campus. Provide resources and training to make implementation as easy as possible. Address fears. Build connections among staff who are invested in this work, connecting them with leaders and building their own capacity to lead this work.
Be attentive to making sure this information is accessible to everyone, not only the students, but also their caregivers. Provide resources in multiple languages, including books, speakers, and intentional outreach.
Noted life coach and faceless skeleton man Skeletor was not always a quiet font of self-affirmation and love. In the past, when their focus was less on transforming themselves into a more perfect Skeletor and more on crushing both foolish musclebrain He-Man and all of Eternia under their purple-booted heel, the sorcerer was prone to lashing out at those around them with cunningly-crafted putdowns. And now, thanks to a supercut of Skeletor's best burns put together by DreamWorksTV, you, too, can have the power of hurting other people's feelings. As penned by bored He-Man And The Masters Of The Universe writers like Paul Dini and J. Michael Straczynski and expertly screeched with a mixture of rage, annoyance, and self-pity by veteran voice actor Alan Oppenheimer, these insults are the perfect way to let everyone you know understand exactly how much they've been letting you down lately. Referring to your boss as an “overgrown alley cat” or calling your parents “a pathetic pair of pitiful pinheads” might not endear you to them, or help you on your journey to self-actualization, but it will give you the sort of self-confidence that leads to assaulting castles in skin-tight purple armor and declaring anyone who crosses you a boob.

The Missouri Department of Conservation said a black bear -- not this specific bear -- was found to have walked 400 miles from where it was tagged by officials. Photo by Andrea Izzotti/Shutterstock
JEFFERSON CITY, Mo., July 26 (UPI) -- The Missouri Department of Conservation said a black bear discovered in a resident's back yard was found to have traveled nearly 400 miles.
The department said a resident in Bollinger County snapped a photo of the bear's ear tag in the spring and sent it to officials, who determined the 3-year-old black bear had last been seen wintering in Warren County and was originally tagged in Christian County -- a total distance of nearly 400 miles.
"This bear probably left Christian County because their mother ran them off and because young males have an instinct to move and find unrelated females," Jeff Beringer, who heads the Black Bear Project for the Department of Conservation, told the Kansas City Star. "No tall bears move this far, but long dispersals are common for male bears."
"Black bears are on the move this time of year looking for new territory, food, and mates," the Department of Conservation said on Facebook. "Some bears travel further than others."
Indonesian officials have revealed the fuselage of AirAsia flight QZ8501 is lying upside down on the ocean floor as the recovery operations are being hampered by bad weather.
The Search and Rescue agency said the sonar images show the plane is sitting upside down as authorities switch their attention to the flight data recorders to determine the cause of the crash.
The image was taken by an Indonesian naval vessel which is participating in the search operation.
On Wednesday, the fourth day of the search, authorities recovered three more bodies, taking the total to six. One of the bodies is suspected to be that of a crew member.
The possibility that the plane exploded in mid-air has been largely ruled out by experts, as there are no burn injuries on the bodies of the victims and the corpses are mostly fully clothed.
The Airbus A320-200, which was travelling from Indonesia to Singapore and carrying 162 people, lost contact with ground authorities 42 minutes after take-off. The last communication from the pilot was a request for higher altitude due to bad weather but this was denied due to congestion in the air.
Though the waters are shallow at the crash zone, high waves are currently hampering the recovery measures and winds are preventing divers from pressing on with the operation.
Singaporean navy personnel have also arrived at the site and are set to coordinate the recovery.
"Weather conditions are not ideal, but we will continue to push," LTC Ang, commanding officer of Singaporean vessel RSS Persistence, was quoted as saying.
Adam Giles dumped as NT chief minister in late-night coup, Willem Westra van Holthe elected leader
Updated
Adam Giles has been dumped as the Northern Territory's chief minister after a late-night leadership spill.
The Primary Industries Minister and Member for Katherine, Willem Westra van Holthe, 52, held a brief press conference at 1:00am to announce they had seized control.
The successful coup came after a phone hook-up late on Monday, the same day several of Mr Giles's Country Liberals colleagues pledged their support for them as leader.
The ABC understands the vote was split nine votes to five.
The coup came after reports on Monday that Mr Giles narrowly avoided a leadership challenge last week amid ongoing concerns about their leadership style.
One minister told the ABC's AM program the fallout from the Queensland election had prompted the challenge because it exacerbated concerns the Territory Government was seen as arrogant and could lose office after one term.
Attorney-General John Elferink is the new deputy, replacing Peter Chandler.
Discontent around for some time, says new leader
For some time several of Mr Giles's colleagues had been unhappy with their leadership, saying they interfered in their portfolios and accusing them of having a dictatorial leadership style.
Some were also upset by a recent Cabinet reshuffle, saying it was motivated by a desire to shore up support for Mr Giles rather than a desire to choose the best ministers for the job.
In their hastily arranged press conference, former police officer Mr Westra van Holthe said "tonight was no particularly special night" when asked what had triggered the overturning of Mr Giles's rule.
They said there had been "discontent with the direction of government" which had "been around some time".
As a government, I acknowledge we could have done things better in the past. New NT Chief Minister Willem Westra van Holthe
Speaking from a prepared statement, Mr Westra van Holthe said the Government "could have done things better in the past".
"Under my leadership, this government will be more consultative with Territorians and engage with them before we make important and crucial decisions to the future of the Territory," they said.
Mr Westra van Holthe will be the Country Liberals' third leader since the party won government two-and-a-half years ago.
They said their Government wanted to provide "stability and confidence for all Territorians, especially our public service".
"We acknowledge that we must work more closely with the community as we move forward and make the Territory a better place to live," they said.
Mr Westra van Holthe thanked Mr Giles "for their time as chief minister".
When asked if they would explain why the party had dumped Mr Giles, they said more information would be released today.
Pressed on the matter, Mr Westra van Holthe said they would be "far more consultative with the people of the NT ... I'll have faith in the ministers with whom I am working".
Mr Westra van Holthe described themselves as an "honest, hard-working man who wants to deliver the very best results I can for the Territory and for Territorians".
After speaking for three minutes, Mr Westra van Holthe took three questions before they called an end to the press conference and walked out.
Mr Elferink remained silent throughout.
Mr Westra van Holthe is the third CLP chief minister since the party came to power in the Northern Territory in August 2012.
Giles 'has my support', says Lambley on day of coup
There had also been concern about Mr Giles's handling of the scandal surrounding former police commissioner John McRoberts, their championing of the sale of the Territory Insurance Office and their ability to communicate the Government's strategy to the public.
Who is Adam Giles?
Adam Giles was Australia's first Indigenous head of government.
The 41-year-old father of one is the Member for Braitling.

They worked in public housing management for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, then moved to Canberra and worked for the Department of the PM.
In 2004 they stood as the Liberal candidate for the ACT electorate of Fraser.
They later settled in Alice Springs, and stood as a CLP candidate for Lingiari in 2007.

Yesterday Mr Giles acknowledged they had heard some leadership rumblings, but said they believed they still had the support of their colleagues and defended their record.
"I think it's good that everyone in Parliament wants to be the chief minister and wants to be able to put forward their vision, their view about how to take the Territory forward into the future," they said.
On the day of Mr Westra van Holthe's trumping of Mr Giles, then-deputy chief minister Mr Chandler said: "Look, we have a Chief Minister, we only need one Chief Minister. We have one, we don't need another one."
At a Darwin school to speak to students about leadership, Mr Chandler said Mr Giles "absolutely" had their full support.
Speaking in the afternoon in the lead-up to the coup, Corrections Minister Robyn Lambley said the weekend's devastating Queensland election result for the Liberal National Party had not gone unnoticed.
"Adam Giles has my support, but it is a time of reflection. I think what we've all taken away from the Queensland election is that nothing can be taken for granted and perception is everything," Ms Lambley said.
Sweet revenge for Mills, the man Giles ousted
Mr Giles, 41, secured the NT's top job in March 2013 from Terry Mills, who was in Japan on a trade mission and learnt by telephone they had been rolled by Mr Giles and close Giles ally, Dave Tollner.
Afterwards, Mr Giles rebuffed media descriptions of the episode as a coup.
Mr Giles, who had stood for election in the ACT in 2004, became Australia's first Indigenous head of government.
Mr Mills, who led the CLP back into office in August 2012 after 11 years in opposition, resigned from politics in February 2014 to take a job in Indonesia as a trade envoy.
Soon after the news broke of Mr Giles being dumped on Monday, Mr Mills retweeted the news and a photo of them laughing.
Less than an hour after Monday's coup, Mr Giles's Wikipedia page had been amended and Mr Westra van Holthe had been installed as the new leader.
The tumultuous events round off Mr Giles's reign over a troubled CLP, which has been split by personal rifts and controversies since it won government.

Let's take a look at Hoodie, the "Back-End as a Service" (BaaS) built specifically for front-end developers. I want to explain why I feel like it is a well-designed tool and deserves more exposure among the spectrum of competitors than it gets today. I've put together a demo that demonstrates some of the key features of the service, but I feel the need to first set the scene for its use case. Feel free to jump over to the demo repo if you want to get the code. Otherwise, join me for a brief overview.
Setting the Scene
It is no secret that JavaScript is eating the world these days and with its explosion in popularity, an ever-expanding ecosystem of tooling has arisen. The ease of developing a web app has skyrocketed in recent years thanks to these tools. Developer tools Prettier and ESLint give us freedom to write how we like and still output clean code. Frameworks like React and Vue provide indispensable models for creating interactive experiences. Build tools like Webpack and Babel allow us to use the latest and greatest language features and patterns without sacrificing speed and efficiency.
Much of the focus in JavaScript these days seems to be on front-end tools, but it does not mean there is no love to be found on the back-end. This same pattern of automation and abstraction is available on the server side, too, primarily in the form of what we call "Backend as a Service" (BaaS). This model provides a way for front end developers to link their web or mobile apps to backend services without the need to write server code.
Many of these services have been around for awhile, but no real winner has come forth. Parse, an early player in the space, was gobbled up by Facebook in 2013 and subsequently shut down. Firebase was acquired by Google and is slowly making headway in developing market share. Then only a few weeks ago, MongoDB announced their own BaaS, Stitch, with hopes of capitalizing on the market penetration of their DB.
BaaS Advantages
There are an overwhelming number of BaaS options, however, they all have the same primary advantages at their core.
Streamlined development : The obvious advantage of having no custom server is that it removes the need to develop one! This means your development team will perform less context switching and ultimately have more time to focus on core logic. No server language knowledge required!
: The obvious advantage of having no custom server is that it removes the need to develop one! This means your development team will perform less context switching and ultimately have more time to focus on core logic. No server language knowledge required! No boilerplate servers: Many servers end up existing for the sole purpose of connecting a client with relevant data. This often results in massive amounts of web framework and DAL boilerplate code. The BaaS model removes the need for this repetitive code.
These are just the main advantages of BaaS. Hoodie provides these and many more unique capabilities that we will walk through in the next section.
Try on your Hoodie
To demonstrate some of the out-of-the-box functionality provided by Hoodie, I am going to walk you through a few pieces of a simple Markdown note taking web application. It is going to handle user authentication, full CRUD of users' notes, and the ability to keep working even when a connection to the internet is lost.
You can follow along with the code by cloning the hoodie-notes GitHub repository to your local machine and running it using the directions in the README.
This walkthrough is meant to focus on the implementation of the hoodie-client and thus, assumes prior knowledge of React, Redux, and ES6. Knowledge of these, although helpful, is not necessary to understand the scope of what we will discuss here.
The Basics
There are really only three things you have to do to get started with Hoodie.
Place your static files in a folder called /public at the root of your project. We place our index.html and all transpiled JS and image files here so they can be exposed to clients. Initialize the Hoodie client in your front end code: const hoodie = new Hoodie({ url: window.location.origin, PouchDB: require('pouchdb-browser') }) Start your hoodie server by running hoodie in the terminal
Of course, there is more to creating the app, but that is all you really need to get started!
User Auth
Hoodie makes user and session management incredibly simple. The Account API can be used to create users, manage their login sessions, and update their accounts. All code handling these API calls is stored in the user reducer.
When our app starts up, we see a login screen with the option to create a user or log in.
When either of these buttons are pressed, the corresponding Redux thunk is dispatched to handle the authentication. We use the signUp and signIn functions to handle these events. To create a new account, we make the following call:
hoodie.account.signUp({ username: 'guest', password: '1234' }) .then(account => { // successful creation }).catch(err => { // account creation failure })
Once we have an account in the system, we can login in the future with:
hoodie.account.signIn({ username: 'guest', password: '1234' }) .then(account => { // successful login }).catch(err => { // login failure })
We now have user authentication, authorization, and session management without writing a single line of server code. To add a cherry on top, Hoodie manages sessions in local storage, meaning that you can refresh the page without the need to log back in. To leverage this, we can execute the following logic the initial rendering of our app:
hoodie.account.get() .then({ session, username }=> { if (session) console.log(`${username} is already logged in!`) }).catch(err => { // session check failure })
And to logout we only need to call hoodie.account.signOut() . Cool!
CRUD Notes
Perhaps the nicest thing about user management in Hoodie is that all documents created while logged in are only accessible by that authenticated user. Authorization is entirely abstracted from us, allowing us to focus on the simple logic of creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting documents using the Store API. All code handling these API calls is stored in the notes reducer.
Let's start off with creating a new note:
hoodie.store.add({ title: '', text: '' }) .then(note => console.log(note)) .catch(err => console.error(err))
We can pass any object we would like to the add function, but here we create an empty note with a title and text field. In return, we are given a new object in the Hoodie datastore with its corresponding unique ID and the properties we gave it.
When we want to update that document, it is as simple as passing that same note back in with the updated (or even new) properties:
hoodie.store.update(note) .then(note => console.log(note)) .catch(err => console.error(err))
Hoodie handles all the diffing and associated logic that it takes to update the store. All we need to do is pass in the note to the update function. Then, when the user elects to delete that note, we pass its ID to the remove function:
hoodie.store.remove(note._id) .then(()=> console.log(`Removed note ${note._id}`)) .catch(err => console.error(err))
The last thing we need to do is retrieve our notes when the user logs back in. Since we are only storing notes in the datastore, we can go ahead and retrieve all of the user's documents with the findAll function:
hoodie.store.findAll() .then(notes => console.log(notes)) .catch(err => console.error(err))
If we wanted, we could use the find function to look up individual documents as well.
Putting all of these calls together, we've essentially replaced a /notes REST API endpoint that otherwise would have required a fair amount of boilerplate request handling and DAL code. You might say this is lazy, but I'd say we are working smart!
Monitoring the connection status
Hoodie was built with an offline-first mentality, meaning that it assumes that clients will be offline for extended periods of time during their session. This attitude prioritizes the handling of these events such that it does not produce errors, but instead allows users to keep working as usual without fear of data loss. This functionality is enabled under the hood by PouchDB and a clever syncing strategy, however, the developer using the hoodie-client does not need to be privy to this as it is all handled behind the scenes.
We'll see how this improves our user experience in a bit, but first let's see how we can monitor this connection using the Connection Status API. When the app first renders, we can establish listeners for our connection status on the root component like so:
componentDidMount() { hoodie.connectionStatus.startChecking({interval: 3000}) hoodie.connectionStatus.on('disconnect', () => this.props.updateStatus(false)) hoodie.connectionStatus.on('reconnect', () => this.props.updateStatus(true)) }
In this case, we tell Hoodie to periodically check our connection status and then attach two listeners to handle changes in connections. When either of these events fire, we update the corresponding value in our Redux store and adjust the connection indicator in the UI accordingly. This is all the code we need to alert the user that they have lost a connection to our server.
To test this, open up the app in a browser. You'll see the connection indicator in the top left of the app. If you stop the server while the page is still open, you will see the status change to "Disconnected" on the next interval.
While you are disconnected, you can continue to add, edit, and remove notes as you would otherwise. Changes are stored locally and Hoodie keeps track of the changes that are made while you are offline.
Once you're ready, turn the server back on and the indicator will once again change back to "Connected" status. Hoodie then syncs with the server in the background and the user is none the wiser about the lapse of connectivity (outside of our indicator, of course).
If you don't believe it's that easy, go ahead and refresh your page. You'll see that the data you created while offline is all there, as if you never lost the connection. Pretty incredible stuff considering we did nothing to make it happen!
Why I Like Hoodie
Hoodie is not the only BaaS offering by any means, but I consider it a great option for several reasons
Simple API: In this walkthrough, we were able to cover 3 out of 4 of the Hoodie APIs. They are incredibly simple, without much superfluous functionality. I am a big fan of simplicity over complexity until the latter cannot be avoided and Hoodie definitely fits that bill. Free and self-hosted: Putting Hoodie into production yourself can seem like a drag, but I believe such a service gives you long-term assurance. Paid, hosted services require a bet on that service's reliability and longevity (see: Parse). This, along with vendor lock-in, keep me on the side of self-hosting when it makes sense. Open Source: No explanation needed here...support the OSS community! Offline-first: Hoodie provides a seamless solution to the relevant problem of intermittent connectivity and removes the burden of implementation from developers. Plugins: Hoodie supports 3rd party plugins to provide support for additional server-side functionality outside the scope of the API. It allows for some clever solutions when you begin to miss the flexibility of having your own server. Philosophy: The developers who built and support Hoodie have clearly thought hard about what the service represents and why they built it. Their promotion of openness, empowerment, and decentralization (among other things) is great to see at the core of an open source project. I love everything about this!
Considerations
Before you make the call to cut ties with your server in favor of a BaaS like Hoodie, there are some things you should consider.
Do you favor increased development speed or future flexibility? If the former is your priority, then go with a BaaS! If you really care about performance and scale, you're probably better off spinning up your own server(s). This points toward using a BaaS for an MVP or light-weight app and creating a custom server for well-defined, complex applications.
Does your app require integration with any 3rd party services? If so, it is likely you will need the flexibility of your own server for implementing your own custom implementation logic rather than constrain yourself to a Hoodie plugin.
Lastly, the documentation for Hoodie is severely lacking. It will help you get started, but many API definitions are missing from the docs and you will have to fill in some of the blanks yourself. This is mitigated by the fact that the interface is extremely well thought out. Nonetheless, it makes for a frustrating experience if you are used to completing documentation.
Conclusion
For front end developers, using a BaaS is a great prospect when considering your options for creating a web application. It avoids the need for writing server logic and implementing what essentially amounts to a boilerplate REST API. Hoodie delivers this possibility, with the added bonus of a clean interface, simple user management, and offline-first capabilities.
If all you need is a simple CRUD application, consider using Hoodie for your next app!

Miniature horses are horses defined by their small height. They can be found in many nations, particularly in Europe and the Americas, and are the result of centuries of selective breeding. Depending on the particular breed registry involved, the height of these horses is usually less than 34–38 inches (86–97 cm) as measured at the last hairs of the mane, which are found at the withers. While miniature horses fit a height-based definition to be considered a very small pony, many retain horse characteristics and are considered "horses" by their respective registries. They have various colors and coat patterns.
Miniature horses are generally bred to be friendly and to interact well with people. For this reason they are often kept as family pets, though they still retain natural horse behavior, including a natural fight or flight instinct, and must be treated like an equine, even if they primarily serve as a companion animal. They are also trained as service animals, akin to assistance dogs for people with disabilities. Miniature horses are also trained for driving, equine agility, and other competitive horse show type events.
Characteristics and registration [ edit ]
Miniature horse stallion
There are two registries in the United States for miniature horses: the American Miniature Horse Association (AMHA) and the American Miniature Horse Registry (AMHR). The AMHA was founded in 1978 and was dedicated to establishing the Miniature horse as a distinct breed of horse.[1][2] Many of the international organizations are associated with the AMHA, including clubs throughout Canada and in several European countries.[3] The AMHR is a division of the American Shetland pony Club and was established as a separate registry in 1972.[4] Worldwide, there are dozens of miniature horse registries. Some organizations emphasize breeding of miniatures with horse characteristics, others encourage minis to retain pony characteristics. Along with registries for miniature horses in general, there are also breed-specific registries, such as several for the Falabella horse.[5]
In the AMHR, Miniatures cannot exceed 38 inches at the withers (which the AMHR defines as located at the last hair of the mane). There are two divisions in AMHR: the "A" division for horses 34 inches (86 cm) and under, and the "B" division for horses 34 to 38 inches (86 to 97 cm).[6] The AMHA requires that horses stand under 34 inches. Horses of any eye or coat color, and any form of white markings, are allowed to be registered. The AMHA standard suggests that if a person were to see a photograph of a miniature horse, without any size reference, it would be identical in characteristics, conformation, and proportion to a full-sized horse.[1] According to the AMHR, a "Miniature should be a small, sound, well-balanced horse and should give the impression of strength, agility and alertness. A Miniature should be eager and friendly but not skittish in disposition."[4]
They are generally quite hardy, often living longer on average than some full-sized horse breeds; the average life span of miniature horses is from 25 to 35 years.[7] However, there are also some health issues that are more frequently found in miniature horses than their full-sized relatives. Overfeeding is a common problem in miniature horses, leading to obesity; this is especially true when owners are used to owning full-sized horses. Dental issues, including crowding, brachygnathism (overbites) and prognathism (underbites) are frequently seen, due to having the same number of teeth in a much smaller mouth. They can also experience retention of deciduous teeth (baby teeth) and sinus problems from overcrowding. The combination of a propensity for overeating and dental problems can lead to an increased occurrence of colic. A major metabolic problem seen more frequently in miniature horses is hyperlipemia, where an appetite-reducing stressor can cause the body to break down significant amounts of fat, overwhelming the liver and potentially leading to liver failure. Reproduction is also more difficult in miniature horses, with a higher incidence of difficult births and a greater potential for eclampsia. The majority of the health problems seen more frequently in miniature horses are easily rectified with proper feeding and maintenance.[8]
History [ edit ]
Miniature stallion with mares and foals
Miniature horses were first developed in Europe in the 1600s, and by 1765 they were seen frequently as the pets of nobility. Others were used in coal mines in England and continental Europe.[9] The English began using small ponies in their mines after the Mines and Collieries Act 1842 prohibited the use of young children as mine workers. Shetland ponies were most frequently seen, although any small, strong ponies that would fit in the small mine shafts were used as pit ponies. The first small horses in the United States date to 1861, when John Rarey imported four Shetland ponies, one of which was 24 inches (61 cm) tall.[2] Additional small British horses, as well as small Dutch mine horses, were brought to the US throughout the late 1800s.[10] These small horses continued the work of their British relatives, being employed in the coal mines of the eastern and central US until the mid-1900s.[2] In the 1960s, public appreciation for miniature horses began to grow, and they were increasingly used in a number of equestrian disciplines.[10]
The Falabella was originally developed in Argentina in the mid-1800s by Patrick Newtall. When Newtall died, the herd and breeding methods were passed to Newtall's son-in-law, Juan Falabella. Juan added additional bloodlines including the Welsh Pony, Shetland pony, and small Thoroughbreds. With considerable inbreeding they were able to gain consistently small size within the herd.[11]
The South African Miniature Horse was developed in South Africa and has a wide range of conformations represented in its population. Some resemble miniature Arabians, while others appear to be scaled-down versions of draft horses.[12] Wynand de Wet was the first breeder of miniature horses in South Africa, beginning their program in 1945 in Lindley, South Africa. Other breeders soon followed, with many using Arabian horses in their breeding programs. In 1984, a breed registry was begun, and the national livestock association recognized the South African Miniature Horse as an independent breed in 1989. There are approximately 700 miniature horses registered in South Africa.[13]
Uses [ edit ]
There are many horse show opportunities offered by registries and show sanctioning organizations worldwide. Many classes are offered, including halter (horse conformation), in-hand hunter and jumper, driving, liberty, costume, obstacle or trail classes, and showmanship. Miniature horses are also used as companion animals and pets for children, elderly people, and people who are blind or have other disabilities, as they are generally less intimidating than full-sized horses.[9] While miniature horses can be trained to work indoors, they are still real horses and are healthier when allowed to live outdoors (with proper shelter and room to run) when not working with humans.[14]
Controversies [ edit ]
Horse or pony? [ edit ]
There is an ongoing debate over whether a miniature horse should possess horse or pony characteristics. This is a common controversy within the miniature horse world and also is a hot debate between mini aficionados and other horse and pony breed owners. While technically any member of Equus ferus caballus under 14.2 hands (58 inches, 147 cm) is termed a "pony," many breeds, including some miniature breeds, actually retain a horse phenotype and their breed registry therefore classifies them as horses.[citation needed]
Some miniature horse breed standards prefer pony characteristics such as short, stout legs and elongated torsos, while others prefer ordinary horse proportions.[15] Even the name is in dispute, terms such as "Midget Pony" and "Pygmy Horse" used in addition to "Miniature horse" and breed-specific names such as Falabella. The level of controversy is reflected by the presence of over 30 different registries for miniaturized horses or ponies just within the English-speaking world.[16]
Dwarfism [ edit ]
Thumbelina - a Dwarf mare
Dwarfism is a concern within the miniature horse world. Dwarf horses, while often setting world records for size, are not considered to have desirable traits, generally have incorrect conformation, and may have significant health and soundness issues.[8] Therefore, many miniature horse registries try to avoid accepting minis affected by dwarfism for breeding stock registration.[17] In 2014, a commercial DNA test became available for one set of dwarfism mutations. The four mutations of the ACAN gene are known to cause dwarfism or aborted fetuses in miniature horses. The test does not detect the mutations that cause skeletal atavism in miniature horses and some ponies, or the osteochondrodysplasia dwarfism seen in some horse breeds.[18]
The oldest living horse on record was a miniature horse affected by dwarfism named Angel who lived with the Horse Protection Society of North Carolina and lived to be over 50.[7] The current record holder for the world's smallest horse is also a horse affected by dwarfism, Thumbelina, who is fully mature but stands 17 inches (43 cm) tall and weighs 60 pounds (27 kg). Though they have received considerable publicity, their owners have publicly stated that they will not be bred.[19] In 2010 a 6-pound (2.7 kg) miniature horse foal named Einstein challenged Thumbelina for the title of the World's Smallest Horse in part based upon the idea that there should be a separate world record category for the smallest non-dwarf horse.[20]
Assistance animals [ edit ]
A demonstration image of a miniature horse working as a service animal
There is controversy over whether miniature horses are suitable as assistance animals for persons with disabilities. Those who favor their use point out that horses live much longer than dogs and can be trained to perform similar tasks. Another plus is that some individuals, particularly from Muslim cultures, consider dogs unclean, but accept horses.[21]
Opponents of their use raise concerns that miniature horses are prey animals, with a fight-or-flight instinct that may limit their usefulness, and for legal reasons.[citation needed] In the USA, where they are legally classified as livestock and require outdoor stabling for good health, their use is limited to owners with access to a large yard in communities having tolerant land use regulations. In terms of practical considerations, they note that it is difficult for even a miniature horse to do things such as lie down in the seat of a taxicab or to stay in a hotel room for extended periods of time.[citation needed]

The Toronto Maple Leafs have seen the carrot.
Now it appears time for the stick.
Leafs head coach Mike Babcock is known for being hard on their players at times.  They are very blunt and rarely sugar-coats anything, and that can wear on athletes – especially in this era of player-friendly coaches in professional sports.
Story continues below advertisement
It certainly wore on the Detroit Red Wings veterans, some of whom played for them for a decade and probably popped champagne when they went to Toronto in May. But throughout their first month-plus here, Babcock had been rather warm and encouraging to a roster filled with players who were beaten down and insecure after last year's debacle of a season.
After losses, they continually pointed to positives and suggested they had deserved a better fate. (In many cases, they had a point.)
That wasn't the case Monday night, after the Leafs lost 4-3 to the Arizona Coyotes. Or the next day at practice.
After seven losses in the Leafs' first eight games, their coach had had enough.
"I'd never seen us compete at that level," Babcock said of the Leafs folding the tent briefly in the second period, before a rally made the game close in the third.
Babcock was particularly miffed with goaltender James Reimer's play. When the Coyotes scored their third goal – a slapper from the top of the circle by rookie Klas Dahlbeck – the Leafs coach was so aghast they grimaced and spun around angrily on the bench.
"You can't give up four [goals] on the amount of chances we gave up tonight," Babcock said of Reimer's play. "It's impossible. You just can't do that."
Story continues below advertisement

"They can't get those goals on that many chances," they later added. "They can't go in the net. Period."
The goalies have got it the worst in the early going. Starter Jonathan Bernier has been pulled, challenged and sat – and the season is only three weeks old.
Reimer, meanwhile, had the better preseason, but was relegated to backup duty regardless. They had started only twice before Monday's poor showing.
In fairness to Babcock, their goalies haven't been all that good, with the sixth-worst team save percentage in the NHL.
And this all could well be a motivational tactic, with a bad-cop routine for the puck stoppers serving as a show of support for the effort of their other players.
But that's not what it looked like Monday. It looked as though the losses were weighing on the coach already.
Story continues below advertisement
They seemed to allow as much the next day.
"When you don't play hard enough and you're not organized enough and you don't have the stick-to-it-ive-ness enough, that comes back on me," Babcock said grimly. "So I take that very personally, to say the least. I want our players to take it personally.
"Our work ethic, our preparation, our execution, our determination, our stick-to-it-ive-ness wasn't worthy. That hurts when you get up in the morning."
And the goalies?
"They can both be way better," they said.
Babcock has earned their reputation.  They are a good coach, and this isn't their first go-round with adversity in the NHL. What this year will be, however, is a unique test of their patience and their endurance in the face of a lot of losses, a lot of questions and a lot of – potentially – sullen players.
Story continues below advertisement
It's not that none of the Leafs deserves to be called out; they do. It's only that everyone knew, coming in, that this would be a long season, and there's an awful lot of it left to go.
If the losses start to really pile up here, one wonders where this goes.
Will Babcock take them all personally? Or can they find the good in the bad, avoid utter exasperation and continue to coax positive outcomes out of the few players who will be here long term?
We know what Babcock is behind the bench of a winner. This season, we'll see something else entirely.
Jameis Winston is one of the biggest winners this offseason.
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers added DeSean Jackson in free agency along with O.J. Howard in the draft, constructing an arsenal of aerial talent that is one of the most fearsome position groups in the league.
The duo will help stretch the field immensely for a passing attack that completed only four passes of 40 yards or more last season, which was tied for the worst mark in the league. Winston has been pleased with the early promise their new weapons have displayed.
"They're dynamic," Winston told NFL Network's Tiffany Blackmon at their 2nd Annual Dream Forever Football Camp on Saturday. "We haven't had a true deep threat guy in Tampa Bay and now we have DeSean. So we're excited to throw them a couple bombs. O.J., man, he's just a specimen. We're privileged to have O.J. Howard."
The Bucs already have a very capable tight end in Cameron Brate, but Howard could be the piece that puts the unit over the top. They were a matchup nightmare when Alabama let them loose downfield and was a top-notch blocker to boot. The first-round pick has generated a similar level of excitement already in Tampa.
"We're happy to have O.J. What he's going to do to that team is going to be amazing," Winston told reporters Saturday. "This is the fastest, most athletic 6-6, 255 guys I've ever seen in my life. It's unreal."
Despite playing in a division where every other starting quarterback has appeared in a Super Bowl and has been named NFL Offensive Player of the Year, the offseason hype train is plugging the Buccaneers as a contender in the NFC South. Tampa Bay has not made the playoffs since the 2007 season, but has improved by four and three wins, respectively, in Winston's first two campaigns at the helm.
In order to make that next step forward, the third-year gunslinger believes that the team needs to develop the right attitude to match its rising success.
"It's a different mindset because we're trying to change the culture into a winning culture," Winston said. "The expectations, we're going to have those, and we're going to have our doubts. But as a team, we have to come together and help change that culture."

Recently the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (AAFPRS) released a study that found an increase in people requesting facial reconstruction, in order to be “more self-aware of looks in social media,” thanks in part to the selfie phenomenon. Many of these people in the study are young and active on social media networks, and perceived bad selfie is causing them to make drastic changes in order to look better in self-shot portraits. You could dismiss this as a fad, but the obsession with selfies could take some down a dangerous path. The Daily Mirror reports that one British 19-year-old nearly killed themselves because they couldn't take the perfect selfie.
The young man, Danny Bowman, reportedly was spending 10 hours a day snapping more than 200 self-portraits with their iPhone. The obsession started when they were 15, and it got so bad that they were sneaking out of class, dropped out of school, lost 28 pounds, and overdosed in their home. Their parents tried to intervene, which only made them angry. Negative Facebook comments toward their selfies and a desire to look like their idol, Leonardo Di Caprio, didn't help theirs cause.
“I was constantly in search of taking the perfect selfie and when I realized I couldn't I wanted to die,” Bowman told the Daily Mirror. “I lost my friends, my education, my health, and almost my life.”
While the Daily Mirror describes Bowman as Britain's first selfie addict, Bowman also suffers from body dysmorphic disorder, or BDD, a very real condition that is believed to be the cause for Bowman's selfie addiction. To us, they look perfectly normal, but they see themselves completely different. The problems really started when they were cast to become a model in 2011, leading them to obsess over their looks via technology.
For most of us, the selfie phenomenon is tongue-in-cheek, but for some it could become a self-destructive form of narcissism, experts warn, potentially leading to harm. Selfies alone may not cause people to commit suicide, but an unhealthy obsession with them could be a warning sign for some type of mental disorder.

Only three same-sex couples have managed to adopt children in nine years.
The government of Israel confirmed Sunday that it has no intention of lifting a prohibition on same-sex couples adopting children.
Responding to a petition from the High Court, the state insisted that allowing gay couples to adopt would place an “additional burden” on children.
“The professional opinion of the Child Welfare Services supports preserving the existing situation,” that adopting couples consist of a man and a woman, the government said in its response. “[This] takes into account the reality of Israeli society and the difficulty it may entail with regard to the child being adopted.”
The state also said that it should be the Knesset, and not the courts, that decides on the issue.
Filed by the Association of Israeli Gay Fathers and the Israel Religious Action Center, the petition asked the Justice Ministry and Social Welfare Ministry to consider allowing common-law and same-sex couples to adopt.

While it allowed that common-law spouses should be allowed to adopt, the government remained steadfast in opposing same-sex parents' rights.
Udi Ledergor of the Association of Israeli Gay Fathers said the statet “has declared war on gay families.”
“It's amazing that Israel is willing to spend enormous resources on legal procedures whose entire goal is to harass and abuse gay families, instead of directing those resources to improve the lives of its citizens, who only want equality before the law and state.”
Michal Rozin, a member of the Knesset's LGBT caucus, said the Israeli government “is abandoning the gay community and this highlights the government's cynical use of the community: In English, they boast about [being LGBT-friendly], but in Hebrew, they deny basic rights.”
Currently gay couples can only adopt when heterosexual married couples cannot be found—which usually translates to children with health issues or from at-risk backgrounds. And if they do manage to get paired with a child, the law views them as two individual adoptive parents. (A total of three same-sex couples have adopted since 2008, when the policy was enacted.)

Israel is often viewed as a safe haven for LGBT people in the Middle East—homosexuality was decriminalized in 1963 and gay and trans people can serve openly in the military. But the influence of the country's powerful orthodox Jewish community means same-sex relationships have no legal standing. (Same-sex marriages performed elsewhere can be registered for mostly statistical purposes.)
In 2016, one day after Prime Minister Netanyahu announced Israel's first “LGBT Day,” the Knesset voted down five bills that would've improved LGBT rights, including measures to introduce civil unions, ban conversion therapy for minors, and recognize the same-sex spouses of fallen IDF soldiers.
An effort to allow same-sex couples to work with surrogates in Israel was also rejected.
“Europe has government funded (x), why can't we?”
Because the United States is the only major country in NATO making the 2% of GDP minimum defense spending allocation. Most European countries, even those outside of NATO, are capable of paying for their social programs because they rely on the United States for their collective security. The same goes for South Korea and Japan, but at least they're starting to pull their own weight.
The armed forces of countries like Germany, the United Kingdom, and France have faced severe budget cuts because they can afford to use the United States as their military safety net. Canada, while not part of Europe, lacks portable anti-tank and any form of anti-aircraft system. Germany cannot afford to buy new, desperately needed machine guns. The United Kingdom is struggling to put even two new aircraft carriers to sea. The only serious NATO player that is getting it's shit together is Poland, which is likely to meet it's 2% commitment within the next five years.
In order to provide for it's own defense in the event of a total American withdrawal, you can bet most of the government programs that define European social democracy would flounder, as the armed forces of the European Union and NATO at large are forced to modernize and become effective combined arms fighting groups.
Take from this what you will. The European Union's member states can spend what they like on social programs, as long as they're not forced to balance themselves between bullets or butter. America's Cold War infrastructure in Europe is the only thing that allows such an imbalance in favor of non-military government spending.

The State Department halted the planned sale of some 26,000 assault rifles to the Philippines' national police after Senator Ben Cardin said they would oppose it amid concerns about human rights violations, Senate aides told Reuters.
Aides said Cardin, the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was reluctant for the United States to provide the weapons following criticism of president Rodrigo Duterte's deadly battle to rid the country of drugs.

News of the move was met with disappointment in Manila. Police spokesperson Dionardo Carlos said the Philippines had yet to be notified about the sale being stopped.
The relationship between the United States and the Philippines, a long-time ally, has been complicated lately by Duterte's angry reaction to criticism from Washington.
More than 2,300 people have been killed in police operations or by suspected vigilantes in connection with the anti-narcotics campaign since Duterte took office on June 30.
The State Department informs Congress when international weapons sales are in the works. Aides said Foreign Relations committee staff informed State that Cardin would oppose the deal during the department's prenotification process for the sale of 26,000-27,000 assault rifles, stopping the deal.

U.S. State Department officials did not comment.
Ronald dela Rosa, the Philippine national police chief and staunch supporter of the war on drugs, said they liked the American rifle, but suggested China as an alternative small-arms provider.
"We really wanted the U.S. rifles because these are reliable," they told broadcaster ABS-CBN.
"But if the sale will not push through, we will find another source, maybe from China."
In October, Duterte told President Barack Obama to "go to hell" and said the United States had refused to sell some weapons to their country, but they did not care because Russia and China were willing suppliers.
According to some U.S. officials, Washington has been doing its best to ignore Duterte's rhetoric and not provide them with a pretext for more outbursts.

An open break with the Philippines could create problems for the United States in a region where China's influence has grown.
Before every Arsenal fixture, we'll bring you a Scouting Report on the Gunners' next opponents.
Arsene Wenger's side visit Sunderland on Saturday, to find out more, we asked tactical expert Michael Cox and journalist Chris Young for their views. MICHAEL COXArsene Wenger will rarely face such an unpredictable starting XI this season as they will at Sunderland on Saturday.
The first game following transfer deadline day always sees some surprise line-ups, but Paolo Di Canio's team selections so far in 2013/14 have been particularly variable - they made three changes for their second league game, then three for their third.
With captain John O'Shea suspended, plus Ki Sung-Yeung, Fabio Borini and Andrea Dossena all arriving since Sunderland's last game (taking the Black Cats' summer transfer signings up to an amazing 13), you'd do very well to correctly predict Di Canio's team selection for this game.
"If there is an obvious area of weakness for Arsenal to exploit, it's at dead-ball situations. In each of their three Premier League matches this season, Sunderland have conceded a goal from a corner" Michael Cox
Arsenal have encountered problems at the Stadium of Light in recent seasons, but Di Canio's tactical approach differs from that of Martin O'Neill.
The Northern Irishman generally ordered their sides to sit deep, whereas Di Canio is likely to request heavy pressing in midfield during the opening stages. It's a tiring approach, but can help their side nullify superior opponents in the first half, and Arsenal must remain committed to their short passing game.
So far, Sunderland have strongly favoured attacking down their left flank, where Italian international Emanuele Giaccherini, the club's most expensive summer signing, is likely to be located. He's an interesting, versatile player who causes problems primarily because of their intelligent positioning rather than their mazy dribbling or incisive passing, and Arsenal's defensive players must communicate well to ensure he's always being dealt with.
If there is an obvious area of weakness for Arsenal to exploit, it's at dead-ball situations. In each of their three Premier League matches this season, Sunderland have conceded a goal from a corner.
While maximising set-piece opportunities isn't necessarily something you'd normally associate with Arsenal, both Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker are a threat in those situations, and popped up with crucial goals towards the end of last season.
Olivier Giroud is also excellent in the air, and will be determined to extend their record of three goals in three games.
CHRIS YOUNG, SUNDERLAND ECHOThere will be a lot of attention on Mesut Ozil making their debut. Sunderland have been difficult to judge so far. They had one good performance against Fulham, but they lost. The draw against Southampton was a backs-to-the-wall performance and it was a poor performance against Crystal Palace last time out but they conceivably could have gone on to win that game after equalising early in the second half. They are difficult to read at the moment because they have bought in a lot of new players in so it's difficult to make any conclusions. Despite taking just one point from a possible nine there is still a lot of optimism around the place.
"The return of Steven Fletcher is a big boost, they scored a lovely goal against Palace considering he's been out for five months and they didn't get any pre-season games under their belt" Chris Young
Last season when Arsenal came up here, Martin O'Neill put five men in midfield and it was more of a containing job until Carl Jenkinson got sent off in the second half. Sunderland could have won the game in the closing stages but I don't think Paolo Di Canio will be so cautious. Their natural instinct is to attack, they want their team to play football, I think they will probably play two forwards to try and test Arsenal.
Di Canio is not the only change the club has made. They have introduced a new director of football called Roberto De Fanti, they've got a new scouting system so it's very much on the Italian model now. The scouts will identify potential targets and Di Canio will say whether they want them or not. Di Canio is a head coach more than a manager but obviously there has been a huge turnover of players with 13 coming in and quite a lot leaving. Di Canio refers to it as their revolution, not just in terms of personnel but in terms of training. Everything is completely different and a lot more intense. There has been a lot made of their discipline on the training ground.
The return of Steven Fletcher is a big boost, they scored a lovely goal against Palace considering he's been out for five months and they didn't get any pre-season games under their belt. They still won't be 100 per cent but he's a natural finisher and there is a lot of potential for a good partnership with Jozy Altidore, who's a big signing. Altidore is strong and quick while Fletcher is a poacher.
The position which Arsenal can exploit is central midfield. Sunderland have had a different combination there for every game they've played and none of them have really convinced. They've bought in Ki Sung-Yeung from Swansea on loan and I think they will probably go straight into the starting line-up. That area has been the biggest concern.
Arsenal are looking good and it's difficult to see anything other than an away win. Arsenal will be on a high after the Ozil signing and Sunderland are still finding their feet.
Nero's fiddling while Rome burned may be nothing compared to the folly of Washington and Wall Street's inaction while the world economy teeters on the verge of global depression. No wonder the Occupy Wall Street demonstrators have spread across the world. By raising a din, they might wake folks up.
Last week, yet another filibuster by Republican senators blocked even a debate on President Obama's jobs bill, which is already modest in the extreme. More than half of the bill would simply avoid making things worse — extending the payroll tax cut and unemployment insurance, and trying to limit layoffs of teachers and police officers next year. Without the extensions, the cuts in government spending and hikes in taxes would reduce an estimated 2 percent of GDP from growth next year — at a time when the economy is already near a standstill.
A good portion of the bill would provide tax breaks for businesses. And a far-too-small part would provide money for building schools, roads, sewers and other infrastructure projects that will put some people to work.
Feeling some heat, Republican senators released their version of a jobs act, which offers up sacrifices to the business gods. It would repeal financial and health-care reform, suspend regulations across the board, and advance a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. And Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) promises, with some Kentucky magic, that it would produce 5 million jobs.
Worse, the bipartisan gang of 12 legislators in Congress's “supercommittee” continues to meet in closed sessions to decide how to cut another $1.2 trillion from deficits over 10 years. If the members fail to agree, deep cuts in defense and domestic spending begin in fiscal year 2013.
Newt Gingrich got this right for once: “It's like saying we're going to shoot you in the head or cut off your leg, which do you prefer?” And with the committee tasked to report before Thanksgiving, we are virtually guaranteed to spend the winter arguing about how to mutilate the economy, not about how to get it going.
Europe is already feeling the effects of premature austerity. Britain's conservative coalition seems intent on driving the country into recession. Germany's economy is stagnant and slowing. Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy are on a forced march to decline.
No wonder people are in the streets. We need bold and sustained action to restart this economy, with all of the G-20, the world's major economies, cooperating.
In Washington, only the Congressional Progressive Caucus seems to have a clue. After touring the country this summer listening to citizens talk about jobs, its members put forth a big jobs agenda — including not only major investment in infrastructure but, among other things, direct public employment, making the government the employer of last resort for everyone under 25.
(About the worst thing we could do is have the millennial generation idled at the beginning of their work lives.) Last week, the caucus's leaders called on the supercommittee to make Wall Street and the rich pay their fair share, and to cut the defense budget to invest at home. Their People's Budget offers a serious jobs agenda in the short run, while getting our books in order in the longer term without dismantling Medicare or savaging Medicaid and Social Security.
But the caucus is a lone voice of sanity in a cacophony of nonsense. The Republican position is that the poverty lobby, not Wall Street, blew up the economy. That the recovery plan that stanched the free-fall of the economy did nothing. That business lacks confidence, not customers. That cutting spending and hiking taxes won't hurt if we promise regulatory reform. More probably, the GOP assumes the economy will limp along, Obama will be blamed, and it will reap the benefits in the 2012 elections. The president, meanwhile, is rightly talking about jobs, getting out of Washington to mobilize people and deploying anger at Wall Street to build public pressure to pass their jobs agenda. Yet the modesty of their program suggests that he, too, thinks the economy needs just a little “jolt” to get going.
But if the economy slows — and there is no reason to think it won't — banks will be in more trouble, the housing crisis will worsen and unemployment will rise, not just here but across Europe and the world. The chances of a descent into depression are growing, yet most of Washington remains clueless, and the silence of the financial elites is deafening. Wall Street traders, we're told, can clean up whether the economy rises or whether it craters. Perhaps they are too busy hedging their bets to raise the alarm. Isn't it a stark indicator of our times that those raising the alarm are the men and women either on the left of Congress or encamping in occupations across our country?

It looks like Marc Webb's upcoming sequel to The Amazing Spider-Man will be getting another new villain! The Hollywood Reporter says that Paul Giamatti is in talks to play the Rhino in the May 2, 2014 film. It's also being reported that Felicity Jones is in talks for an undisclosed role.
The alter-ego of Aleksei Mikhailovich Sytsevich, the Rhino first appeared in 1966's “The Amazing Spider-Man” #41. A former low-key thug, an experiment grafted a nearly-indestructible polymer to Aleksei's skin, making them nearly unstoppable.
Giamatti appeared last in year in a variety of projects like Rock of Ages, Cosmopolis and John Dies at the End. Jones, meanwhile, is well known for roles in films like The Tempest and Like Crazy.
Already set to star Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Jamie Foxx, Shailene Woodley, Dane DeHaan and Martin Sheen, the new chapter in the Spider-Man saga was already confirmed to see the debut of Electro (Foxx) and Mary Jane Watson (Woodley).

The young engineer behind a popular pro-Islamic State (IS) Twitter account was arrested on Saturday at their one-room rented accommodation in an upscale Bengaluru neighbourhood, triggering pledges to free them by those subscribing to the terror group's alarming agenda.
“On the basis of credible intelligence inputs ... we have apprehended Mehdi Masroor Biswas from their apartment,” said director general of police LR Pachuau.
The mobile phone — the one that they apparently used to tweet thousands of jihadi posts to their 17,000 followers on Twitter — was confiscated along with a laptop and other documents for evidence.
Police said 24-year-old Mehdi from a Kolkata suburb working with ITC in Bengaluru didn't probably have any direct links with the terror group which controls swathes of Syria and Iraq as part of its campaign to create an Islamic caliphate.
“He appears to have been only majorly active in the virtual world,” said Bengaluru police commissioner MN Reddi.
Police said they used to post Twitter messages after office hours, cheering the IS's advances in Iraq and Syria, and mocking its enemies. “He was particularly close to the English-speaking terrorists of IS and became a source of incitement and information for the new recruits trying to join IS,” Reddi said.
ISIS twitter case:
Accused arrested by police, confesses operating account since many years
A case registered against them for abetting war against the state.
But their parents in Kolkata said they were being framed. “He is religious but not a fanatic to join a terrorist group. They didn't go to a madrasa and doesn't even know Arabic,” said mother Mamtaz Begam.
Britain's Channel4 on Wednesday night revealed Mehdi as the man behind the Twitter handle @ShamiWitness that was described as a "leading conduit of information between jihadis, supporters and recruits" with 2 million views each month.
But Reddi said Biswas never recruited anyone or facilitated any such activity in India, and had never traveled outside India.
Reports suggest Mehdi was seeking cheap thrill as they were drawn into the IS propaganda machine that promotes its conquests, inspires sympathisers and attracts new recruits through the social media. The IS uses Hollywood-style film clips and other elements to attract disaffected but plugged-in young Muslims like Mehdi, a regular man who shares “jokes, pictures of pizza dinners with friends and Hawaiian parties at work” on their Facebook account.
Their arrest prompted IS to launch a "Free Shami Witness" campaign while Kurdish fighters in Syria celebrated the news.
“Bengaluru ruthless Police arrest brother Mehdi Masroor Biswas as owner of @ShamiWitness twitter acc,” wrote IS Tweeter handle, @IS_WorldPress, drawing immediate response from the group's supporters across the world to free them at any cost.
“We all miss #ShamiWitness Twitter isnt the same without their news,” tweeted JanissaryFighter (?@SaifAlRasheed97).
Kurdish fighters, the IS's bitter enemies, uploaded morphed pictures of Biswas behind the bars, wearing Santa Claus hats.

Update: A Microsoft spokesperson has stated that the information published by The Register, upon which this article was based, is "inaccurate".
You can read that statement at the end of this article. The original article follows:
Microsoft has been facing growing criticism over the methods it has been using to encourage owners of older Windows 7 and 8.1 PCs to install Windows 10 before its offer of a free upgrade expires on July 29. Despite this, it appears the company is not only refusing to back down, but actually becoming even more forceful in its efforts.
Initially, after Windows 10 launched last July, Microsoft allowed users of these older devices to opt in to the upgrade at their leisure. But over time, it's become more aggressive in its approach, as this brief timeline indicates:
Now, as The Register reports, Microsoft has begun tweaking its upgrade process yet again, to make it even more difficult to opt out of Windows 10 installation for those on older devices.
No X-it: Microsoft gives users the choice to upgrade now or later, with no way to close the window
As the screenshot above shows, a new version of Microsoft's upgrade tool no longer offers the option of cancelling installation entirely. Instead, users are presented only with the choice of setting a date and time - being able to defer the Windows 10 installation by no more than a few days - or "start the upgrade now". The 'schedule your upgrade' window has no red X to allow users to close it, forcing them to pick one of those two options.
Speaking with The Register, a Microsoft representative did not comment on the latest revisions, saying only that the "your upgrade is scheduled" notification has been around "for months".
According to Microsoft, Windows 10 is now installed on over 300 million devices around the world. But given the company's increasingly pushy approach to getting users to upgrade to its latest OS, one can't help wondering how many of those users actually decided that they wanted to upgrade, and how many believed they had no choice but to do so.

Update: ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Mary Jo Foley has posted an update to their article stating that this may have been a false alarm. It would appear that this screen only appears if a user has already accepted the update and agreed to the EULA. Still, it's not much better that once you've explicitly agreed to the update, you don't have the right to change you mind.﻿
In other words, if you agree to the Windows 10 update, be sure that you really want it first.﻿
Update 2: A Microsoft spokesperson has provided the following statement to Neowin, making it clear that the information in The Register's report was wrong:
LL Cool J is a Hip Hop icon. Three decades in and still going strong, few can touch LL's status. With over a dozen albums and countless hit singles, LL always had something for the hardcore fans as well as for the mainstream listeners.
This is a list with OUR favorite LL tracks and it may focus more on their earlier work than some of you will like – if you miss YOUR favorites let us know in the comments!
15. I Need Love (1987) “I can't sit and wait, for my princess to arrive / I gotta struggle and fight, to keep my dream alive / I'd search the whole world for that special girl / And when I finally find you, watch our love unfurl / I need love…” Aw come on, just admit it – you know you love this track too. It's true that LL's later attempts on love songs / Hip Hop ballads were more often miss than hit, but this pioneering Hip Hop ballad is a classic we all know the words to.
14. The Ripper Strikes Back (1999) “Ask Canibus / They ain't understanding this / Cause ninety-nine percent of their fans don't exist / I'm going underground and blowin' your rep down / Next time save that shit for the lyricist lounge” After the beef that started over Canibus' originally intended verse on LL's posse cut 4,3,2,1 – Canibus dropped a pretty dope dis directed at LL with 2nd Round Knock Out. LL Cool J came back hard with this track though, to destroy Canibus and leave no doubt about LL's superiority.
13. Going Back To Cali (1988) “Going back to Cali, stylin', profilin' / Growlin' and smilin' while in the sun / The top is down on the black Corvette / And it's fly, because it's sittin' on Dayton's…” That bass! Originally released in 1988 as a single from the Less Than Zero soundtrack and later part of LL's third album Walking With A Panther, this track is another banger co-written and produced by Rick Rubin.
12. The Breakthrough (1987) “Not only on the stage, I rock in the park / And I'm a killer in the daytime, and worse after dark / So don't ever mess with the king of the sound / LL Cool J, the baddest around…” Pure Hip Hop. No hook, no chorus – just 4 minutes of straight rhyming over a hardcore drumbeat.
11. You'll Rock (1985) “The momentum of this party can only increase / The design of this rhyme is a masterpiece / You'll wanna kick steps to this musical feast / And witness the force I'm about to release…” Another track that perfectly exemplifies the B-boy feeling and has LL spittin' dope rhymes about their own abilities. One of the best tracks on the excellent Radio album.
10. The Boomin' System (1990) “Big beats bumpin' with the bass in back / All the sophisticated suckers catch a heart attack…” One of the best album openers ever. LL talks about a booming bass and you need a system that can handle it to fully appreciate this trunk-rattling banger.
9. Doin' It (1996) “It's the first time together and I'm feeling kinda horny / Conventional methods of making love kinda bore me / I wanna knock your block off, get my rocks off / Blow your socks off make sure your G spots soft…” Like I Need Love this is another ‘guilty pleasure'. Massive mainstream appeal and one of LL's biggest hits, this raunchy song just can not be hated on. The bass is thumping and the vibe is just right. Just gotta love this one. Also props for the use of the ‘Go Brooklyn' chant, which is sampled from Audio Two's classic Top Billin' song.
8. Go Cut Creator Go (1987) “Three years ago in St. Albans Queens / I was rockin' at a park called one eighteen / Little kids stood and watched as I rocked the spot / Didn't know years later I'll be standing on top” Another dope track from the Bigger And Deffer album, this track is a tribute to LL's deejay Cut Creator, who gets to flex their skills.
7. It's Get No Rougher (1989) “Who could take the game of rap and rule it alone / Demonstrate many styles on the microphone / Build an empire like an African King / I had to show and prove Jack the Ripper could swing / I'm a rapper's nightmare, I crush my opponents / There's only one title: I own it…” One of the best songs of the underappreciated Walking With A Panther album has LL spittin' dope rhymes over a Bomb Squad produced track. It definitely get's no rougher.
6. The Doo Wop (1987) “LL has iced all the washed up slobs / Vigilante of rap, so to hell with the mob / Don't run from the cops, makin' suckers jock / And I'm only 18 makin' more than your pops” A brilliant track that infuses doo-wop with Hip Hop and has LL recounting past adventures – or was it all a dream?
5. I'm Bad (1987) “No rapper can rap quite like I can / I'll take a musclebound man and put their face in the sand…” LL Cool J at their bragging and boasting best, I'm Bad remains one of LL's most recognizable songs and one of their biggest hits.
4.

A SCOTS farmer has sparked outrage with pictures of them killing an elephant and other animals on a bloody African safari.
Ian Evans was pictured smiling with a rifle over the body of the elephant in South Africa.
But last night they insisted that they wept when they gunned down the beast – a species classed as “vulnerable”.
And they claimed their killing spree was better for wildlife.
Other pictures show them standing over the bodies of other animals including zebra and buffalo.
Evans's exploits were exposed by their furious former daughter-in-law Helen Winters – who also accused the farmer of killing the family's pet geese this year.
They also accused Evans of storing tusks and elephant skin products at their farmhouse near Newton Stewart in Wigtowshire .
Yesterday, the 62-year-old farmer refused to answer questions about the tusks and elephant products.
When asked if they felt guilty about the killing of elephants, they said: “If I told you the truth, I would get so much crap back about it.
“But I cried when I shot the elephant because it was the first time I'd ever done it.
“The whole thing got to me. It was a unique moment that will never happen again.”
The photographs of Evans's holiday kills were shared on social media by Helen, 36, the estranged wife of their son Ross.
Helen left the family's dairy farm in February this year after their daughter Faye, 20, suffered severe brain injuries in a horse riding accident in Cambridge. They stayed in England for four months as Faye recovered.
But they said when they returned, they discovered Evans had got rid of their five pet geese, which she'd kept for 10 years.
“When I returned home for the geese, a worker told me that Ian had shot them,” Helen - originally from Durham - said.
“At first, Ian said they hadn't killed the geese. But when I told them I was going to put these pictures on Facebook, they asked me if they could replace them or give me the money they were worth.
“His reasoning was that I'd abandoned them. But they could have easily texted me to say they need moving or got in touch with the animal welfare people.
“You don't shoot somebody's pet. If I shot your dog, there would have been something said about it.”
Helen added: “I knew that Ian would travel to Africa but little bits and pieces slowly came out the longer I was there.
“He was proud of killing animals. The last set of tusks that came over are taller than me.
“Unless you're going to eat it, I don't believe in killing. And I don't believe in shooting elephants.
“He has mountains of these pictures – elephants, giraffes, zebras, antelope, gazelles.
“I think their behaviour is disgusting. They turned up with a guncase and a handbag made from elephant skin.
“There is an elephant ear in the farmhouse, and an elephant foot covered by zebra skin.”
Yesterday, Ian accepted that he'd “disposed of” the geese but said an attempt to rehome them had failed.
They continued: “I didn't shoot them but I did dispose of them. I did away with them.
“She abandoned those animals. There was no one to look after them. They had the run of the place and the mess they made was incredible.”
Ian, who also runs outdoor adventure company Galloway Tanks and Activity Centre, said in a statement on their business website that they killed the elephant during a cull seven years ago.
They wrote: “There are around 900 elephants in this reserve (expanding at seven per cent per year, which is unsustainable).
“All the meat from the cull is sold to fund community projects such as infrastructure, education of local children, community halls and other community buildings.The licence fees go to help the running and maintenance of the reserve. The cull is part of the management of the reserve.”
When asked why they took part, they explained: “I just love Africa. I am in love with the enormous ecosystem that you can study.
“Yes, I was part of a cull. That's explained in my statement. It was seven years ago.
“I went (to Africa) in 2014, but the pictures they are using are from 2009, 2007 and earlier. There were five years between the last one and the one before that.”
Evans also confirmed they spoke in defence of big game hunting on Radio 2's Jeremy Vine Show last July.
They said: “The whole sustainable hunting thing gets such a bad press. That is why I called.
“Africa depends on people like me going out and spending money. That's what keeps reserve going..”
Evans also alleged that before their bust-up, Helen would proudly hang buffalo heads in the farmhouse.
They added: “These pictures they have shared have been on my Facebook for six years. I find it so galling that they are now trying to turn everything against me.”
There was a furious reaction to the photographs on social media and calls for a boycott of Evans's businesses.
Harry Huyton, director of animal welfare group OneKind, said: “It beggars belief that anyone can derive any sort of pleasure from killing beautiful creatures and posing with their bodies.
“Trophy hunting is absolutely abhorrent and this individual should be ashamed of themselves not only for killing these animals but then boasting about it afterwards.”
Eurozone finance ministers and Greece's creditors on Tuesday (24 May) renewed the tradition of late night discussions but in the end agreed to disburse a €10-billion tranche of aid and to relieve Greece of part of its debt.
The agreement will also keep on board the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which called for debt relief. But that decision will have to be confirmed later this year.
"It is now recognised by all stakeholders that Greek debt is unsustainable," IMF representative Poul Thomsen said (Photo: Council of the EU)
"It is something that a month ago I couldn't have dreamt of that the ministers would have agreed to," the Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem told journalists after the 11-hour meeting.
"The ministers have stretched their political capital to put this on the table," they said.
The first decision taken was to close the first review of the €86-billion bailout programme agreed last year.
That was made possible after Greece in recent weeks passed laws to reform its pensions and income tax system, increase VAT, create a privatisation fund, facilitate the selling of bad loans by banks and establish a fiscal brake mechanism in case the budget goes off-track.
Ministers decided that Greece would receive €10.3 billion, starting with a first tranche of €7.5 billion, probably in the second half of June, to cover debt servicing needs and clear some arrears.
'Important moment'
A second €2.8-billion tranche would be disbursed after the summer, when Greek authorities have taken measures regarding the privatisation fund, bank governance and arrears clearance.
"It is important moment for Greece after so much time," Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos said after the meeting.
Although the conclusion of the review, seven months later than originally planned, is a major step in the bailout programme, it was overshadowed by difficult talks on debt relief.
The IMF had linked its further participation in the programme to an agreement on debt relief because it says that the Greek debt is not sustainable.
IMF's rules say that it cannot fund a bailout when a country's debt is not sustainable.
In discussions prior to Monday's meeting the fund called for an "upfront unconditional" debt relief for Greece.
The IMF proposal was opposed by Germany, which on the other hand said it would not accept that the bailout continues without the IMF.
Discussions at the Eurogroup were "difficult with the IMF," a EU source said.
Another source told EUobserver that talks were "like a match between the IMF and Germany with a lot of time-outs".
Sirtaki dancing
Ministers, the IMF representative Poul Thomsen and officials from Greece's European lenders - the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the European Stability Mechanism - worked on several draft statements detailing different solutions for debt relief.
The meeting was suspended several hours to go through the details, and a second time so that Thomsen could speak with the IMF's chief Christine Lagarde who was in Kazakhstan.
At one point, to relax the atmosphere, a French official made a demonstration of sirtakis, the traditional Greek dance, several sources said.
Just before 2 am, the Europeans and the IMF agreed on short and medium term measures to reduce the cost of debt repayment for Greece.
The plan, which still needs to be detailed, will imply that the ESM, the eurozone's emergency fund which owns part of the Greek debt, takes measures that would reduce interest rates for Greece, extend loans maturities and open the way for it to buy loans from the IMF.
In the long term, Dijsselbloem said, "a possible debt relief will be delivered at end of programme" in 2018, and its scope would be determined on the basis of new assessment of the sustainability of the Greek debt.
Debt compromise
The debt deal was described by participants as a compromise.
"The IMF welcomes that it is now recognised by all stakeholders that Greek debt is unsustainable and that Greece needs debt relief," the fund's Poul Thomsen told journalists.
Thomsen added that the IMF made a "major concession": "We had argued that this debt relief measures should be approved up front and we have agreed that they will be approved at the end of the programme".
On the other hand, EU institutions and ministers agreed to specify that Greece's primary surplus - the budget surplus before debt payments - should be 3.5 percent of GDP "as of 2018", leaving the discussion about surplus target for the following years open-ended.
While the EU had said that Greece could maintain a 3.5-percent surplus for many years, the IMF had argued that is been too ambitious and made the Greek debt even less sustainable.
It is now likely that the targets will be lowed, a source said. That could allow the IMF to say that the Greek debt is sustainable and that it can confirm its participation to the bailout.
Another assessment
Despite the deal, the IMF's involvement in the bailout still has to be confirmed.
The Eurogroup statement said that the IMF management will "recommend to the fund's executive board [representing all the IMF member states] to approve a financial arrangement before the end of 2016".
But Thomsen said that the fund "will participate provided that a revised debt sustainability assessment suggests that measures are sufficient to conclude debt is sustainable".
"We will need to assess the adequacy of the measures," they said.
The assessment will not be ready before the autumn, leaving the door open to new debt talks between the IMF and the EU before a final decision by the fund's executive board.

Security is a top priority for every Apple product, and regrettably we stumbled with this release of macOS.
When our security engineers became aware of the issue Tuesday afternoon, we immediately began working on an update that closes the security hole. This morning, as of 8 a.m., the update is available for download, and starting later today it will be automatically installed on all systems running the latest version (10.13.1) of macOS High Sierra.
We greatly regret this error and we apologize to all Mac users, both for releasing with this vulnerability and for the concern it has caused. Our customers deserve better. We are auditing our development processes to help prevent this from happening again.
Apple today released Security Update 2017-001 to fix a serious vulnerability that enables access to the root superuser account with a blank password on any Mac running macOS High Sierra version 10.13.1.The critical bug, which gained attention after it was tweeted by developer Lemi Ergin yesterday, lets anyone gain administrator privileges by simply entering the username "root" and a blank password in System Preferences > Users & Groups.The security update is rolling out on the Mac App Store now, and it should be installed by all users running macOS High Sierra as soon as possible. Regardless, starting later today, Apple said the security update will be automatically installed on all Macs running macOS High Sierra 10.13.1.Apple has since apologized for the vulnerability in a statement issued to MacRumors:The vulnerability does not affect macOS Sierra or any other previous version of the operating system.
Three cryptography experts from a Dutch university have cracked the codes used to start luxury cars such as Audis, Bentleys, Porsches, and Lamborghinis, knowledge that could allow anyone with the right tools to wirelessly lockpick a $300,000 car. The researchers were preparing to publish a paper in August explaining the method used to penetrate Megamos Crypto, the algorithm-based system used to verify an owner's key. However, Volkswagen's parent, which owns the four brands, has secured an injunction against the scientists from a UK court.
"The public have a right to see weaknesses in security."
The scientists argued that "the public have a right to see weaknesses in security on which they rely exposed," but a judge ruled three weeks ago that "car crime will be facilitated" if the scientists publish the algorithm. Volkswagen had asked them to publish a redacted version without the codes, but they declined. Since then, the decision has become part of a wider discussion about car security.
The injunction is a temporary step in the case brought by Volkswagen, so it's possible the decision could be reversed. In the meantime, we'll be on the lookout for PhDs driving 911s.
Although cooperative interactions among kin have been established in a variety of biological systems, their occurrence in plants remains controversial. Plants of Arabidopsis thaliana were grown in rows of either a single or multiple accessions. Plants recognized kin neighbours and horizontally reoriented leaf growth, a response not observed when plants were grown with nonkin. Plant kin recognition involved the perception of the vertical red/far-red light and blue light profiles. Disruption of the light profiles, mutations at the PHYTOCHROME B, CRYPTOCHROME 1 or 2, or PHOTOTROPIN 1 or 2 photoreceptor genes or mutations at the TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE OF ARABIDOPSIS1 gene required for auxin (growth hormone) synthesis impaired the response. The leaf-position response increases plant self-shading, decreases mutual shading between neighbours and increases fitness. Light signals from neighbours are known to shape a more competitive plant body. Here we show that photosensory receptors mediate cooperative rather than competitive interactions among kin neighbours by reducing the competition for local pools of resources.

In 1952 a Catholic newspaper in Ireland proclaimed: “The welfare state is diluted socialism and socialism is disguised communism.”
Extreme? Yes. Dated? No. When you listen to the dying declarations of the spear-carriers for neoliberalism, it's hard not to hear the same alarmist codswallop.
The logic goes like this: being unemployed and poor is bad because people choose to be unemployed or poor. If you receive income support, it is because you are unemployed and poor. Therefore, receiving income support is bad. Therefore, removing income support is good. Coincidentally, this means more money for the rich and less for the poor.
Damning evidence of wealth disparity highlights inequality across generations | Greg Jericho Read more
Social services minister Christian Porter's recent National Press Club address was replete with denunciations of the “politics of envy” associated with redistributionist policies, as well as the “morally unacceptable” nature of social expenditure because it means placing a debt burden on the children of today to pay off as the adults of tomorrow.
These are old tropes. Joe Hockey used them regularly when they were treasurer. The intergenerational framework is always going to be a useful means of distracting from the uncomfortable reality of class inequality in the current generation.
A false divide is constructed between those who have a job (and pay taxes) and those who don't.
It is time that we did away with this fictitious divide. It was always false. It implied that the low-paid cleaner had more in common with the mining magnate than with the person who is locked out of the labour market.
But now, especially as we try to understand the future of work and the massive changes to the structure of the labour market, it is time we consigned this nonsense to the rubbish bin of ideological history.
People who are low paid, casually employed, underemployed, unemployed, informally employed, on dodgy contracts, women who work as unpaid or low-paid carers, students who take whatever work they can get and remain silent about the indefinite training wages, sole parents, people with a disability, aged pensioners, veterans; all have more in common with each other and with other members of the working class than we dare admit.
The proposed welfare bill will push people further into poverty. We have to stand together against it | John Falzon Read more
By recognising this commonality, we can begin to reframe the way in which so-called welfare dependency and the “injustice” and “immorality” of social expenditure is presented. This is crucial at a time when the government has ruled out increasing the woefully inadequate Newstart payment, which has not seen an increase in real terms since 1994 .
The discussion needs some perspective. We have a minimum wage that sits at around 40% of the average weekly earnings and a Newstart payment that sits at around 40% of the minimum wage. The minimum wage is not a living wage and the unemployment benefit is not even a pale shadow of a living wage. And we see the consequences at the St Vincent de Paul Society every day, where topping up from charitable assistance has become the norm for many people simply to survive.
We need a solid jobs plan, and full employment should be a policy priority. Instead we keep getting served up a putting-the-boot-into-the-unemployed-plan and a slashing-social-expenditure-plan. Behavioural approaches won't fix structural problems. The government can blame people all they like but this won't address the inequality many are burdened with, as wages are suppressed and profits soar, buttressed by tax cuts, wage cuts and social expenditure cuts.
As neoliberalism struggles to present a semblance of relevance, we are presented with the tired old narrative that when government collects revenue from those who can afford it and redistributes resources to those that need them, we are witnessing “socialist revisionism at its worst.” . In fact, we are faced with the reality that 732 companies paid zero tax in the 2015-16 financial year.
The government is right, however, about one thing. We do need to innovate.
Second Sydney homeless camp cleared out by NSW government Read more
Our social security system was built in very different structural circumstances. The labour market is different. Work is different. We should be embarking on a serious reframing of how we can, collectively and with common resources, achieve social and economic security for everyone. We need, for example, to explore how government might play a leading role in achieving full employment instead of harassing the people who have been structurally excluded from jobs.
There is nothing innovative about marginalising people who are already made to feel that they have been stigmatised through drug-testing and cashless welfare cards.
There is nothing smart about a program like Path that uses young people for six months as cheap labour and then discards them.
We need to build a way forward that ensures that no one misses out on the essentials of life: a place to live, a place to work (or income adequacy for those who cannot engage in paid work), a place to learn (from early childhood through to university and TAFE), and a place to heal.
This means not just leaving these essentials to the whims of the market but actively ensuring that no one is excluded. This is an economic as well as a social imperative.
Inequality is buttressed and boosted by unfair rules that must be changed. We need to imagine a future predicated not on the perpetuation of inequality but the provision of social and economic security.
Inequality is neither a personal choice nor a national tragedy. It is a choice governments make.
