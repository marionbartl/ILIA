It is a different client that give you similar features as the website, not the AC one (which is currently Windows only).
Today, we are beyond excited to announce a project that is over three years in the making, the only American-made nylon watch strap. Over the years we approached many manufacturers within the watch and textile industry about producing the strap in the United States and heard over and over that it couldn't be done. Well, if there is one thing that can define the team at Worn & Wound, it's stubbornness. That, and a healthy dose of patience.
Needless to say, we are very pleased to introduce ADPT Strap: the All Day, Purpose and Terrain American-made Nylon Watch Strap. Or, as we call it, Adapt Strap.
ADPT Strap is the only fully American-made nylon mil-strap currently on the market. Everything, from the webbing to hardware to thread to final stitching and even packaging are sourced and manufactured in the USA, most of which is custom made from the ground up. Based on a military design from the 1970's, ADPT Strap is a classic design featuring the signature security-band underneath, catching your watch should a spring bar fail. Though originally designed for the military, we see this design as an ideal everyday, sport and outdoors concept, hence ADPT.
For those of you want to cut to the chase, ADPT Straps can be purchased at shop.wornandwound.com, Huckberry, Bespoke Post and Long Island Watch right now. For those who want to read about the making of ADPT, please continue on. We also have a dedicated ADPT site for more info.
Our first big challenge was finding the nylon. Seems like an easy task, but in the US, getting metric sizes means making new patterns. It took a lot of cold calls, starts, stops and bottles of Tylenol until we finally found a partner, but we couldn't be happier with them. Based in the northeast, they operate a state-of-the-art facility and their client list includes NASA, DARPA and the US Military.
For webbing, our initial series features custom shuttle-loom woven 420D nylon. It's about 1.5mm thick, making it nice and plush, with a marked tooth that differs on the top and bottom and an attractive bevel on the sides, a sign of the traditional manufacturing technique used. It's tough and rugged, yet comfortable on the wrist.
Webbing might seem like a simple, almost stock component of a strap, but trust us, it's anything but. Our manufacture gave us a tour of their facilities which was truly eye opening. To summarize the process, webbing starts as its most fundamental unit, mono-filament nylon. Thin as a human hair, these delicate strings get wound together through a machine of sorts that I could only describe as a mix between a spiderweb and a prism of light. Hundreds of strands on spools getting sorted, organized and twisted together to create the thread that will later be used on looms. Each thread being a custom thickness for the job at hand.
Next, the loom gets prepared, which requires a days-long manual process setting up a pattern. Once prepared, the loom can begin making the webbing. This is a centuries-old technology that still produces a fine product. The machines themselves are gorgeous, featuring hand-carved wooden shuttles, clacking away in an industrial symphony. You know how selvage denim is well-regarded for its durability and quality? Our nylon is made in largely the same way.
Once woven, the nylon gets dyed to our custom colors, which are perfectly matched from sources via light spectrometer, guaranteeing the same color every time. The dyeing machine alone was bigger than a NYC apartment, feeding the nylon up and down through baths of dye, then curing lights and drying lamps. On one end it's white and raw, on the other it's fully dyed and safe to touch. It's borderline miraculous to watch.

COLUMBUS, Ohio—An area of West Antarctica more than twice the size of California partially melted in 2016 when warm winds forced by an especially strong El Niño blew over the continent, an international group of researchers has determined.
In the June 15 issue of the journal Nature Communications, they report that the warm spell persisted for more than two weeks in January 2016. Satellite data revealed a mix of melted snow and ice over most of the Ross Ice Shelf—a thick platform of floating ice that channels about a third of the ice flowing from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet into the ocean.
While researchers have been gathering evidence for years that warm ocean water is melting West Antarctic ice shelves from beneath, this is one of the first times they've been able to document how warm air could also cause widespread melting from above.
Dan Lubin
Julien Nicolas
David Bromwich
Aaron Wilson
As it happens, researchers had installed the necessary instruments to investigate these processes in West Antarctica only a few weeks earlier, as part of a study to better understand how clouds affect the amount of energy that reaches the snow surface and influence its temperature.
“We were extraordinarily fortunate to be able to deploy state-of-the art equipment to West Antarctica just before this large melt event occurred,” said Dan Lubin, principal investigator of the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) West Antarctic Radiation Experiment (AWARE). Lubin is a research physicist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California and a coauthor of the Nature Communications study.
“These atmospheric measurements will help geophysical scientists develop better physical models for projecting how the Antarctic ice sheet might respond to a changing climate and influence sea level rise,” Lubin added.
Julien Nicolas, lead author of the paper, is a research associate at the Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center (BPCRC) at The Ohio State University. He's part of the OSU team that provides weather and climate analysis for AWARE.
When Nicolas got a January 2016 alert from the AWARE expedition that the weather at their campsite atop of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet had turned unseasonably warm, he checked to see in the satellite data what was happening to the rest of West Antarctica.
The presence of water in the snow is often hard to detect from visible satellite imagery, especially if clouds block the view. Instead, Nicolas analyzed satellite measurements of the microwave radiation emitted by the snowpack, since dry and wet snows have very different microwave signatures.
What he saw during the melting event was an area of roughly 300,000 square miles, including most of the Ross Ice Shelf, that likely contained a mix of snow and water.
“What probably happened is that the surface snowpack was able to contain the meltwater, acting as a buffer and preventing the formation of melt ponds and streams that can be common on some Antarctic ice shelves,” Nicolas said, “but we cannot rule out the presence of standing water in many locations.”
What makes this event particularly interesting to scientists is that it took place during one of the strongest El Niño events on record.
“This conjunction of events was no coincidence,” he said.

During an El Niño, warm waters from the equatorial Pacific Ocean move east. El Niños also favor weather patterns that steer warm air towards West Antarctica, but strong westerly winds that blow over the ocean to the north of the continent usually keep the warmer air at bay.
BPCRC senior research associate Aaron Wilson, also a coauthor on the study, used climate models to show that melt events in West Antarctica are more likely to occur during El Niño conditions, especially when westerly winds are weak. What makes this January 2016 event unique, he explained, is that the warming occurred despite strong westerly winds.
“Without the strong westerlies, it's likely there would have been much more melting,” Wilson said.
Coauthor David Bromwich, professor of geography and leader of the Ohio State team, explained it this way: “In West Antarctica, we have a tug-of-war going on between the influence of El Niños and the westerly winds, and it looks like the El Niños are winning,” he said. “It's a pattern that is emerging. And because we expect stronger, more frequent El Niños in the future with a warming climate, we can expect more major surface melt events in West Antarctica.”
More frequent melting would accelerate the general deterioration of the ice sheet, he concluded.
Co-authors on the paper include former Ohio State master's student Jonathan Wille, who served as a weather observer in West Antarctica in January 2016; Ryan Scott and Lynn Russell of Scripps Institution of Oceanography; Andrew Vogelmann of Brookhaven National Laboratory; Maria Cadeddu of Argonne National Laboratory; Johannes Verlinde of Penn State; Colin Jenkinson and Gregory Stone of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology; and Heath Powers and Maciej Ryczek of Los Alamos National Laboratory.

Why Apple made me trash two months of work.
It all started with a speeding ticket in September. I knew there was a fixed speed camera at that particular location, but my distraction turned out to be rather costly. This got me thinking.
The Idea
A mobile application that notifies the driver whenever a speed camera is approaching. The application needed to be extremely simple to use; download the app, enable notifications, and you never have to launch it again.
The Execution
Without going into technicalities, the main problem with this approach is that iOS apps can only run in the background for a short period of time.
I did my research, and found a solution that used both the motion coprocessor and the GPS to keep the application alive just enough to check for the user's position; this ended up costing only 1–2% of battery life in 7 days. Quite an achievement considering early prototypes were draining the battery overnight.
Test Flight
By mid November I had a name. Malta Speed Cameras was ready for public testing. The new iTunes Connect integration with Test Flight gave me an opportunity to test it on a lot of devices before launching. The target was to launch in December.
Rejection
In just 24 hours I received Apple's verdict, App Rejected.
22.1: Apps must comply with all legal requirements in any location where they are made available to users. It is the developer's obligation to understand and conform to all local laws
——- 22.1 ——-
Your app contains content or features that facilitate, enable, or encourage an activity that is not legal in all the locations in which the app is available. This is not in compliance with the App Store Review Guidelines.
Specifically, the primary purpose of your app is to identify speed camera locations.
We encourage you to review your app concept and evaluate whether you can incorporate additional content and features that are in compliance with the Guidelines.
I changed the name of the app to Malta Speed Alerts, added some functionality and resubmitted. Rejected again.
Granted, maybe Apple are not familiar with Maltese laws and regulations and are taking the safest way out.
By January, the application was still unpublished. So, I contacted the Maltese Transport authorities who confirmed that the app would be legal as long as it doesn't distract the driver.
I reverted to the original name, and attached a copy of the correspondence to the Test Flight submission, this time thinking that it would be enough to get approved for Beta testing. I was wrong. The app got rejected for the same reason.
So I appealed. This was Apple's reply:
The App Review Board evaluated your app and determined that the original rejection feedback for the current version of your app is valid. Your app does not comply with:
22.1: Apps must comply with all legal requirements in any location where they are made available to users. It is the developer's obligation to understand and conform to all local laws
We understand you have received an email from the Malta transport authority. We also understand your app will only be functional in Malta. However, it is not appropriate for the sole purpose of your app to display the location of speed cameras, and alert users to their location. This is not appropriate functionality for the App Store.
In order for your app to be reconsidered, it must provide additional features and functionality in addition to the speed camera location functionality. For example, the location of other possible road hazards the user may want to be informed about. Displaying the camera locations on a map is not sufficient additional functionality, as it is still only displaying speed camera locations.
How is this acceptable?
Conclusion
I understand that the review process is there to safeguard the integrity of the app store; however, it has recently become the centre of many infamous rejection stories. This, in turn, ends up hurting genuine app developers.
How can anyone test new ideas with the threat of being rejected by the app store for any reason? Should we publish on the Play Store instead?
- A veteran Alameda County sheriff's deputy was hurt after he was struck by a transportation vehicle at Santa Rita Jail in Dublin early Wednesday morning, a sheriff's spokesman said.
The incident happened at about 6 a.m. at the transportation yard behind the jail near Broder Boulevard, Sgt. Ray Kelly said. The Alameda Co. Sheriff's Office identified the victim as Deputy Mike Foley, 60. He has worked for the Alameda sheriff for eight years but before that had worked for Concord police for 30 years.
Authorities declined to release the name of the hospital where Foley was being treated. He was said to be in critical condition on Wednesday.
Foley, described as a hard-working veteran who often volunteers for overtime, underwent a procedure to try to reduce swelling in his brain. Officials said the hospital he was taken to at the time of the accident did not have functional CAT scan equipment.
Officials with the sheriff's office called the incident an accident. The driver, also a deputy, will be placed on administrative leave due to trauma. The driver was said to be "devastated" by the accident.
Foley was said to be walking through the parking lot when he was struck by an inmate transportation bus, driven by the deputy. There were no inmates on the bus.
California Highway Patrol will recreate the scene of the accident on Thursday. At the news conference, the driver was characterized as a reliable driver with a long history of being a "professional driver".
The accident happened prior to the driver picking up inmates at the jail.
“He had just started the bus. It was the very start of his day and was pulling out of his spot where they park the bus and that's where he struck the deputy who was walking,” said Alameda County Sheriff's Sergeant J.D. Nelson.
“It was dark and I'm sure there is condensation on the windows,” Nelson said. “It's an accident. He just didn't see him.”
A large group of other deputies have gathered to support the deputy and his family.
Senator Orrin Hatch brushed aside public opposition to the Republicans' health care plan Tuesday as people looking for a handout.
The American Health Care Act, which was passed by a majority of House Republicans last week, has come under fire from lobby groups including the American Medical Association and the AARP, as well as a large swath of the general public, according to recent polls.
Hatch, a Utah Republican who is currently working on the bill in the Senate, was asked Tuesday how that public reaction will affect the decisions senators are making on the bill.
“The public wants every dime they can be given. I mean face it, once you get them on the dole they're going to take every dime they can,” said Hatch.
“We've got to find some way of getting things under control or this country in the near future is going to be gone.”
Hatch made the statements immediately after leaving a meeting of Republican senators to discuss Medicaid, the publicly-subsidized health insurance program for low-income Americans. As written by the House, the AHCA cuts $840 billion from Medicaid over the next decade.
Hatch described Medicaid costs as “out of control” and said Republicans need to reign them in. But any substantial cuts to the program will be contentious, especially in states that expanded Medicaid under President Obama's Affordable Care Act in order to insure millions of new people.
Senator Rob Portman of Ohio was in the same meeting as Hatch, and said Tuesday that he wants to see some kind of protections for the 700,000 people in his state that gained insurance through the Medicaid expansion.
“It's important to me because one, we're facing the worst drug crisis in the history of our country and more people are dying from opioid overdoses than any other cause of accidental death,” said Portman. “In my own state it's at epidemic levels. This [Medicaid] expanded population is heavily impacted by that.”
But so far Republicans seem determined to roll back the Medicaid expansion. Many have described Medicaid costs as spiralling out of control. Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania argued Tuesday that the House's suggested $840 billion cut is in fact not a cut at all because it still means more Medicaid funding than pre-Obamacare levels.
“The House bill spends more money on Medicaid than... before Obamacare came along. And for eight years an awful lot of Republicans have said they want to repeal Obamacare, so I wouldn't characterize it as cuts,” said Toomey.
What is clear so far is that the Senate will make changes to the AHCA. Republican Senators must walk a delicate line to win over enough moderates and conservatives to pass the bill without the help of the Democrats. They can afford to lose just two of 52 Senators and even if they do reach that goal, the new bill must also be passed again by the House.
Republicans initially announced that a 13-member working group would take the lead on drafting the Senate health bill. They quickly came under fire because there were no women in the group. On Tuesday, Republicans insisted that membership is actually informal and all Republican senators will be involved. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell went so far as to say “there is no particular working group.” Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, not originally listed as part of the group, attended Tuesday's meeting.
Republicans aren't giving a public timeline for when they want to pass the bill, but if they move as quickly as the House it could take several months.
0 'New boundaries' for homeless as Seattle clears encampments
Some of Seattle's most visible homeless encampments are disappearing as part of the city's increased efforts to get people access to services.
Scott Lindsay, the public safety advisor to Seattle Mayor Ed Murray, told KIRO 7 the city's Navigation Team is making a dent in the huge local homeless issue.
“We've got a lot more intensive effort going on right now to engage people who are living unsheltered, on the streets, often in very dangerous conditions," Lindsay said.
For the past two days, members of the Navigation Team have been clearing a homeless encampment on 4th Avenue South and South Royal Brougham, offering shelter to the more than 30 people who have been living there.
Sixteen people accepted that offer, according to Lindsay.
He said, over the past five weeks, hundreds of the city's homeless have been contacted at local encampments and offered shelter and services.
About half of them have accepted those offers.
Lindsay also told KIRO 7, as part of the Navigation Team's ongoing efforts, more than 1,000 tons of garbage has been cleared from the encampments.
On March 7, the encampment known as The Field, which is near the junction of I-5 and I-90, was cleaned up by the Navigation Team.
The encampment under the Ballard Bridge was also recently cleared.
In the coming days, according to Lindsay, Navigation Team members will focus their attention on homeless encampments under the West Seattle Bridge, on the east and west sides of Queen Anne Hill and on an encampment near the Space Needle at 3rd and Broad streets, in Belltown.
Lindsay said the Navigation Team members' primary responsibility is offering shelter and services to people who are living outside.
For those who refuse help, Lindsay said, the city will “continually engage them” and offer services.
“We always hope that they will say yes, but we're also trying to set new boundaries for what's acceptable in the city,” Lindsay told KIRO 7. “It's not ok to set up your tent in a dangerous location and throw trash on the freeway. You're not going to get away with that anymore.”

Fox News released two new presidential primary polls this Sunday showing Donald Trump up big in New York and Pennsylvania, and Hillary Clinton leads her rival Bernie Sanders in both states.
From Fox News:
Trump's advantage is widespread in the Republican contest. A new Fox News poll finds he leads among men, women, every age group, every income group, and among those with a college degree and those without.
Clinton's the top choice among Democrats, as Bernie Sanders is only able to take the lead among younger voters and men.
First, the Republicans: Trump dominates with 54 percent support among likely GOP primary voters. John Kasich garners 22 percent and Ted Cruz is third with 15 percent.
…
Trump receives 48 percent among likely GOP primary voters in the Keystone State. That's more than the combined support for John Kasich and Ted Cruz. Kasich is at 22 percent and Cruz gets 20 percent. Another 11 percent are undecided.
Just over half of men back Trump (53 percent), while the rest split between Kasich (20 percent) and Cruz (19 percent).
Women are a bit less enthusiastic about the front-runner: 42 percent support Trump, 25 percent Kasich and 20 percent Cruz.

So first there were the fleas. They've lived in our house before. And in spite of the temporary presence of a dog, we concluded that my husband brought them home from his recent camping trip. He was infested. The dog was not.
So I stripped sheets from beds, powdered the house with borax, and sprayed the dog with a mild vinegar and water wash. Three of the beds weren't made yet. But we could take care of all that after the family gathering. There would be plenty of time when we got back with some grandkids who were staying overnight so we could pick blueberries the next day.
The plan was simple. I'd make the beds. Paul could walk the dog. Bedtime would be later than usual but not unreasonable.
Then the plan changed.
“We have a problem,” Paul said when he returned from the walk. The dog had nosed his way into a bush and got a snout full of skunk spray.
The new plan meant the dog couldn't come into the house yet. Paul headed to the store to buy tomato juice. I still had to finish making the beds. So I recruited two grandkids–cousins, the two oldest.
“You two watch the dog, but don't touch him.” They sat on the creaky porch swing. The only light from stars and the corner street light.
I gathered old towels, a basin of soapy water, and a bucket for the tomato juice. And by the time I finished the beds, Paul was back.
The younger cousins were upstairs getting in some bonus video game time. Paul and the two older cousins were outside washing the dog.
I stood in between, near a window on a stairway, laughter arose from the driveway.
And I remembered another day that hadn't gone quite right. We were at our church picnic. The dinner had been wonderful. But then one of the cousins convinced Grandpa Paul to go on the ride that went forward, backward, and sideways.
“Remember the time Grandpa threw up at the park?” I had told them they would always remember that day. “You'll always remember this day too.”
It seemed as though nothing had gone right that day, yet all was right that could be.
After the dog dried off and settled down, the lone girl cousin was down the hall between pink sheets with a book and a light. Quiet there already. Later it was quiet upstairs. After the game was off, after a fight over who was hogging the covers, after cousin whispers of adventures and memories.
The next day we picked 22 pounds of blueberries. It took two vehicles to carry the cousins and the grandparents. We stopped for ice cream after our work. Grandpa played tag with them in the playground.
He did not throw up. But may we always remember anyway.

The uprising in Kiev has apparently reached its conclusion. President Viktor Yanukovich and the opposition reached an agreement, negotiated by the Polish, German and French foreign ministers. The parliament is now effectively in charge, deciding who will be ministers and when elections will be held, whether to dismiss judges and so on. It isn't clear whether the parliament can fire the sitting president without impeachment and trial, but all of this is now moot. What is interesting is that the Polish, French and German foreign ministers negotiated an outcome that, for practical purposes, ignored the Constitution of Ukraine. It sets an interesting precedent. But for Ukraine, the constitution didn't have the patina of tradition that a true constitution requires, and few will miss Yanukovich.
The question now is whether all of this makes any real difference in Ukraine or the world. There is a new temporary leadership, although it is still factionalized and the leaders of the factions have not fully emerged. The effect of hostile gunfire will forge unity in Kiev for a while, but in due course, ideology, ambition and animosity will re-emerge. That will make governing Ukraine as difficult as in the past, particularly because the differences among the neo-Nazis, the liberals and groups in between — all of which manned the barricades — are profound. A government of national unity will be difficult to form.
Another issue is what will happen the next time crowds storm government buildings. The precedent has been set — or rather, it was set during the 2004 Orange Revolution — that governments and regimes can be changed by a legalistic sleight of hand. At some point a large crowd will gather and occupy buildings. If the government opens fire, it is run by monsters. I don't mean that ironically; I mean it literally. But if the government allows itself to be paralyzed by demonstrators, then how can it carry out its constitutional responsibilities? I don't mean that ironically either. The Ukrainian Constitution, new or old, is meaningless because Ukrainians will not endure the pain of following it — and because foreign powers will pressure them to deviate from constitutional democracy in order to create a new one.
There should be no mistake. The Yanukovich government was rotten to the core, and he will not be missed. But most governments of Ukraine will be rotten to the core, partly because there is no tradition of respect for the law and because of the way property was privatized. How could there be a tradition of law in a country that was reduced to a province of another state and that numbered among its rulers Josef Stalin? Privatization, following the fall of the Soviet Union, occurred suddenly with vague rules that gave the advantage to the fast and ruthless. These people now own Ukraine, and however much the crowd despises them, it can't unseat them. The oligarchs, as rich people in the former Soviet Union are called, are free; they can eliminate their critics or bribe them into silence. The only thing that is more powerful than money is a gun. But guns cost money and lives.
The idea that what will follow the Ukrainian revolution will be the birth of a liberal democracy reminds me of the Arab Spring. In the West, there is a tradition of seeing a passionate crowd massed in a square as the voice of the people. Reporters interview demonstrators and hear that they want an end to a corrupt and evil regime and subliminally recall the storming of the Bastille, the founding myth of the revolutionary tradition. A large crowd and a building anger at government evil points to the millennium.
In the Arab Spring the hope was great and the results disappointing. There was genuine hope for change, and observers assumed that the change was for liberal democracy. Perhaps it will yet be. Sometimes it was a change to a very different type of regime. What is portrayed and seen in this situation are the corrupt leaders commanding brutal soldiers. If the regime and the soldiers are wicked, it follows by this storyboard logic of good and evil that then their victims must be virtuous. It is rarely that easy. It is not only that the crowd is usually divided into many factions and bound together only by anger at the regime and the passionate moment. It is also that unexpected consequences lead them far from what they intended.
How Long Will Unity Last?
The deepest symbolism of revolution, and the most problematic, is that the people in the square speak for the people as a whole. The assumption made by the three foreign ministers was that in the negotiation between the three leaders of the demonstrators and the president, the protests' leaders were more faithful representatives of the people than the elected president. They may have been in this case, but it is not certain.
Parts of Ukraine are bitterly angry about the outcome in Kiev. A Russian flag was raised over the city hall of Sevastopol, located in Crimea in the south, over the weekend. Crimea has historically belonged to Russia. In 1954, Nikita Khrushchev took it away from Russia and gave it to Ukraine. The Russians in Crimea have never really liked being part of Ukraine and the demonstrators didn't represent them. Nor did they represent all those who live in the eastern part of the country, where Russian is commonly spoken and where being close to Russia is both an economic and cultural desire.
Thus there are two questions. The first is whether there is enough unity in the Ukrainian parliament to do what they must now do: create a government. The excitement of the moment has hidden the factions, which will soon re-emerge along with new ones. Yanukovich was not without support, for good reasons or bad. His supporters are bitter at this outcome and they are biding their time. In addition, the oligarchs are weaving their webs, save that many of the lawmakers are already caught in their web, some happily and some not. The underlying constraints that created the Yanukovich government are still there and can create a new Yanukovich out of the most enlightened Ukrainian leader.
The second question is whether Ukraine can remain united. The distinctions between the region oriented toward the West and that oriented toward Russia have been there from the beginning. In the past, governments have tried to balance between these two camps. Our three foreign ministers and the leaders of the demonstration have signaled that the days of taking Crimea and the east into account are over. At the very least their interests weren't represented at the talks. Those interests could be rebalanced in the parliament, or they could be dismissed. If the latter were to happen, will Ukraine split in two? And if it does, what will be the economic and social consequences? If parliament takes to accommodating the two sides and their respective oligarchs, then how does it avoid winding up with a more photogenic and sympathetic Yanukovich?
The Motives of Outsiders
What happened to Ukraine mattered deeply to the Germans, French, Poles and Americans, all of whom had a deep involvement and sympathy for the demonstrators and hostility toward Yanukovich. Certainly it matters to the Russians, for whom maintaining at least a neutral Ukraine is essential to the national interest. This entire crisis began when Yanukovich decided to reject closer ties to the European Union. It was that decision that triggered the demonstrations, which, after violent repression, evolved from desiring closer EU ties to desiring regime change and blood.
The Ukrainian government has $13 billion in debt, owed mostly to Western institutions. The Russian government has agreed to provide Ukraine with $15 billion in aid doled out in tranches to cover it, since Ukraine can't. Russia is now withholding additional aid until it can be confident the emerging government in Kiev is one with which it can work. It has also given Ukraine discounted natural gas. Without this assistance Ukraine would be in an even worse situation.
In turning toward Europe, parliament has to address refinancing its debt and ensure that the Russians will continue to discount natural gas. The Europeans are in no position politically to underwrite the Ukrainian debt. Given the economic situation and austerity in many EU countries, there would be an uproar if Brussels diverted scarce resources to a non-member. And regardless of what might be believed, the idea that Ukraine will become a member of the European Union under current circumstances is dismal. The bloc has enough sick economies on its hands.
The Germans have suggested that the International Monetary Fund handle Ukraine's economic problem. The IMF's approach to such problems is best compared to surgery without anesthesia. The patient may survive and be better for it, but the agony will be intense. In return for any bailout, the IMF will demand a restructuring of Ukraine's finances. Given Ukraine's finances, that restructuring would be dramatic. And the consequences could well lead to yet another round of protests.
The Russians have agreed to this, likely chuckling. Either parliament will reject the IMF plan and ask Russia to assume the burden immediately, or it will turn to Russia after experiencing the pain. There is a reason the Russians have been so relaxed about events in Ukraine. They understand that between the debt, natural gas and tariffs on Ukrainian exports to Russia, Ukraine has extremely powerful constraints. Under the worst circumstances Ukraine would move into the Western camp an economic cripple. Under the best, Ukraine would recognize its fate and turn to Russia.
What the Europeans and Americans were doing in Ukraine is less clear. They had the triumphant moment and they have eliminated a corrupt leader. But they certainly are not ready to take on the burden of Ukraine's economic problems. And with those economic problems, the ability to form a government that does not suffer from the ills of Yanukovich is slim. Good intentions notwithstanding, the Ukrainians will not like the IMF deal.
I will guess at two motives for European and American actions. One is to repay the Russians for their more aggressive stance in the world and to remind them of how vulnerable Russia is. The second is as a low-risk human rights intervention to satisfy internal political demand without risking much. The pure geopolitical explanation — that they did this in order to gain a platform from which to threaten Russia and increase its caution — is hard to believe. None of these powers were in a position to protect Ukraine from Russian economic or military retaliation. None of them have any appetite for threatening Russia's fundamental interests.
As stated above, the question now is twofold. Will the Ukrainian parliament, once the adrenaline of revolution stops flowing, be able to govern, or will it fall into the factional gridlock that a presidential system was supposed to solve? Further, will the east and Crimea decide they don't want to cast their lot with the new regime and proceed to secede, either becoming independent or joining Russia? In large part the second question will be determined by the first. If the parliament is gridlocked, or it adopts measures hostile to the east and Crimea, secession is possible. Of course, if it decides to accommodate these regions, it is not clear how the government will differ from Yanukovich's.
Revolutions are much easier to make than to recover from. This was not such a vast uprising that it takes much recovery. But to the extent that Ukraine had a constitutional democracy, that is now broken by people who said their intention was to create one. The issue is whether good intentions align with reality. It is never a bad idea to be pessimistic about Ukraine. Perhaps this time will be different.
What's Going On is not only Marvin Gaye's masterpiece, it's the most important and passionate record to come out of soul music, delivered by one of its finest voices, a man finally free to speak his mind and so move from R&B sex symbol to true recording artist. With What's Going On, Gaye meditated on what had happened to the American dream of the past -- as it related to urban decay, environmental woes, military turbulence, police brutality, unemployment, and poverty. These feelings had been bubbling up between 1967 and 1970, during which he felt increasingly caged by Motown's behind-the-times hit machine and restrained from expressing himself seriously through his music. Finally, late in 1970, Gaye decided to record a song that the Four Tops' Obie Benson had brought him, "What's Going On." When Berry Gordy decided not to issue the single, deeming it uncommercial, Gaye refused to record any more material until he relented. Confirmed by its tremendous commercial success in January 1971, he recorded the rest of the album over ten days in March, and Motown released it in late May. Besides cementing Marvin Gaye as one of the most important artists in pop music, What's Going On was far and away the best full-length to issue from the singles-dominated Motown factory, and arguably the best soul album of all time.
Conceived as a statement from the viewpoint of a Vietnam veteran (Gaye's brother Frankie had returned from a three-year hitch in 1967), What's Going On isn't just the question of a baffled soldier returning home to a strange place, but a promise that listeners would be informed by what they heard (that missing question mark in the title certainly wasn't a typo). Instead of releasing listeners from their troubles, as so many of his singles had in the past, Gaye used the album to reflect on the climate of the early '70s, rife with civil unrest, drug abuse, abandoned children, and the spectre of riots in the near past. Alternately depressed and hopeful, angry and jubilant, Gaye saved the most sublime, deeply inspired performances of his career for "Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)," "Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)," and "Save the Children." The songs and performances, however, furnished only half of a revolution; little could've been accomplished with the Motown sound of previous Marvin Gaye hits like "Stubborn Kind of Fellow" and "Hitch-Hike" or even "I Heard It Through the Grapevine." What's Going On, as he conceived and produced it, was like no other record heard before it: languid, dark, and jazzy, a series of relaxed grooves with a heavy bottom, filled by thick basslines along with bongos, conga, and other percussion. Fortunately, this aesthetic fit in perfectly with the style of longtime Motown session men like bassist James Jamerson and guitarist Joe Messina. When the Funk Brothers were, for once, allowed the opportunity to work in relaxed, open proceedings, they produced the best work of their careers (and indeed, they recognized its importance before any of the Motown executives). Bob Babbitt's playing on "Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)" functions as the low-end foundation but also its melodic hook, while an improvisatory jam by Eli Fountain on alto sax furnished the album's opening flourish. (Much credit goes to Gaye himself for seizing on these often tossed-off lines as precious; indeed, he spent more time down in the Snakepit than he did in the control room.) Just as he'd hoped it would be, What's Going On was Marvin Gaye's masterwork, the most perfect expression of an artist's hope, anger, and concern ever recorded.
Whether you have been a long-time fan of George R. R. Martin's “Song of Ice and Fire” fantasy novels or were only recently introduced to the HBO series “Game of Thrones,” adapted from the books, you're probably aware of two details about this author: it has been six years since the publication of the last novel in the series, “A Feast For Crows,” and Mr. Martin is very aware of how much his readers would like to see the planned follow-up, “A Dance with Dragons.” In a recent interview with The New York Times, Mr. Martin acknowledged he was still putting his finishing touches on that book – even though a July 12 publication date had already been announced. A profile of him in The New Yorker was titled “Just Write It!”
So he has. Lest there be any ambiguity to the recent post on Mr. Martin's blog depicting a fallen King Kong, his publishers at Bantam Spectra have posted the above video showing the editor Anne Groell reading pages from the manuscript for “A Dance With Dragons,” and even alluding to how it might end. So, Mr. Martin, when do we get to see the next book?

Sum Pig Food Truck
Big praise to a food truck that pays homage to the swine. The Sum Pig truck moves all over town – city and suburbs – so you may have to seek it out. And aim to order an assortment of items to get the Full Monty of pigdom.
Among them, make sure you try the Bacon Parfait. It's a tall cup, creatively layered with bacon, real pit barbecued hickory smoked pork loin, braised collard greens and sweet corn. A thick scoop of mashed potatoes is dolloped on top. And, because that's not enough, it's all topped with some homemade cheddar cheese sauce and adorned with a thick stick of bacon. I don't remember the details of the “food triangle” they taught us in that high school nutrition class, but I think this Bacon parfait has every group covered.
But what is it? The bacon parfait resembles a dessert, but it works as a substantial lunch. Or even a suitable dinner. It's a plate of BBQ in a clear plastic cup. You could debate it, or you could just enjoy the deliciousness.
The “Bacon Blue” is a smoked pork sammy, topped with Carolina barbecue sauce, a layer of Gorgonzola and a few thick-cut strips of Applewood smoked bacon. Because we think Gorgonzola was invented by the devil, we asked them to sub in cheddar, which seemed an improvement. It's a fine effort, but not among the top 10 BBQ sandwiches you can get around this town.
The Cheddar Bacon Beer Soup is made with Conshohocken Brewery India Pale Ale. Because I own a piece of that brewery, I can't fairly give it a score. I can, however, tell you that it's earth-changingly delicious.
Scores:
Bacon Parfait: 81/100
Bacon Blue: 72/100
WE ARE NOW about nine months in to the Windows 10 era, and things are going great or not so great, depending on to whom you listen. Microsoft keeps touting ever growing numbers of active users of its latest operating system, which it claimed had passed 200 million by the start of this year.
Meanwhile, figures from market research firms such as IDC and Gartner appear to show that sales figures for PC systems have not shown the recovery that was predicted once Windows 10 was available.
This has been blamed partly on the fact that Microsoft has made Windows 10 available as a free upgrade for the first year following its release, meaning that people did not necessarily feel the need to buy a new system.
However, a steady stream of negative stories about Windows 10 may have coloured the perception of the platform among potential users, and could be discouraging many from taking up the free offer.
This could be worse for Microsoft than it first appears. It comes at a crucial time when Windows is arguably going to sink or swim, and the company cannot afford to take a misstep right now.
I've covered the release of many versions of Windows during my time as a tech writer, and it often seems to me that Microsoft can be its own worst enemy at times. Windows Vista set out to cure the security holes in XP, but ended up doing it in such a ham-fisted way that people quickly lost patience with the continual User Account Control prompts. It was also heavy on system resources.
Then Windows 7 came along and pretty much fixed all the problems with Vista, and everyone was happy for a while until Windows 8 came along. This was meant to be Microsoft's answer to consumers preferring tablet devices with their intuitive touch-oriented user interfaces, but it turned out to be such a kludge and a compromise that it proved deeply unpopular.
Microsoft seemed to have steered itself back on track with Windows 10. As preview versions trickled out, people were encouraged by the return of the desktop environment and the Start menu, which Microsoft had cleverly integrated with the Live Tiles of Windows 8. It boasted innovative features like Continuum, and handled touch and keyboard input well, and Microsoft was prepared to let existing users upgrade for free.
So it came as a disappointment when the first people to install the release code of Windows 10 reported that it had several settings relating to the collection of user data that the system sends back to Microsoft. Most of these are enabled by default unless you opt to customise settings during the installation. Microsoft, it seemed, had taken too many tips from web companies that collect as much personal information as they can.
Then there is Microsoft's increasingly aggressive tactics to get everyone running Windows 10. It started with a simple notification on the taskbar of Windows 7 and 8, making people aware of Windows 10 and offering to let them 'reserve a copy' to download when available.
However, Microsoft then started pre-emptively downloading the Windows 10 installer to those who had opted to reserve a copy, taking up gigabytes of space. This was so that the update would be ready to hand when users opted to install it, Microsoft claimed.
Windows 10 was then published as an 'Optional Update' via the Windows Update service, before being escalated to a 'Recommended Update' this year, which means that installation is triggered automatically depending on the user's Windows Update settings.
This has led to what the INQUIRER has dubbed 'Updategate' after users claimed that Windows 10 had suddenly installed itself without their knowledge or permission. Microsoft disputes this, saying that the Windows 10 installer offers the choice of accepting or declining the upgrade.
Whatever the truth of the matter, Windows 10 is starting to acquire a tarnished reputation. Many have decided to stick with Windows 7, in a repeat of the 'XP Forever' phenomenon that dogged Microsoft's attempts to kill the ageing operating system.
This hasn't been helped by the company's decision to take control over Windows Updates away from users. Any update or security fix in Windows 10 is automatically downloaded and installed, at least in the consumer version, which means that it's impossible to stop an update installing even if the PC owner knows it will cause compatibility problems.
The danger for Microsoft is that there are perfectly good alternatives to Windows these days. Linux distributions such as Ubuntu or Linux Mint now offer an ease of use comparable with Windows, and many tech-savvy users, including yours truly, will be tempted simply to ditch Windows in favour of Linux because Windows 10 is starting to seem more trouble than it's worth.
And this could turn into a real problem for Microsoft if the next generation of techies grows up with more experience of using Linux than Windows.
In some ways, the writing is on the wall already, as shown by Microsoft adding features like the Bash command line shell from Linux into Windows 10, even if this was done to please the increasing number of developers working with Linux workloads running in the firm's Azure cloud.
Meanwhile, a whole generation of youngsters in this country is getting a taste of Linux thanks to the Raspberry Pi low-cost computer, which runs a version of Linux as its default environment.
Windows 10 was seen by many as a make-or-break release for the future of Microsoft. It would be ironic if the firm has sabotaged this through its own stupidity and heavy-handed tactics. µ
A review by T. F. Rhoden of Renaud Egreteau's Caretaking Democratization: The Military and Political Change in Myanmar
Why have the Burmese armed forces withdrawn from direct control of the state? Why have they allowed a “hybrid” regime, with a representatively elected government, to form? What moniker does one use for this new, neither fully authoritarian, nor fully democratic, Myanmar? Indeed, what spurred the recent deepening of political liberalization and widening of democratization across the nation. And why now and not decades earlier?
These are some of the questions which imbue Renaud Egreteau's excellent Caretaking Democratization: The Military and Political Change in Myanmar (Oxford University Press, 2016) with a saliency and urgency for those wishing to apprehend Myanmar today.
In what this reviewer considers to be the most important publication of the decade on the subject of Myanmar's democratization, Egreteau argues that the “transition has been driven from above, by ruling Burmese elites—especially military ones—in a clear position of strength since the early 2000s.” By initiating a “well-thought-out”, “caretaking”, and “pacted” transition since 2011, “the Tatmadaw leadership merely chose to move down a notch on the scale of political intervention.” This analysis reminds us that there is more here than some naïve romanticizing of “Burma's Spring.”
The decades of military authoritarianism are over. The sordid “military junta” as a regime type has disbanded. The current government, particularly after the 2015 general election, is the most democratically representative since independence. But, the Burmese armed forces' praetorian commitment to political intervention—some of these guaranteed by the 2008 Constitution—demonstrates that the military will continue to have a sizable effect on future developments. Egreteau is keen to remind us that the science of comparative politics is uncertain about the endpoint to this “transition.”
The introduction and initial chapter lay out the focus of the study, one that centers the years from 2010 to 2015 as instrumental. This positions the book as an indispensable resource for comparativists and international affairs scholars in understanding early-stage democratization. Despite the particularity, and peculiarity, of this “sui generis case”, Egreteau frequently utilizes other postcolonial examples to draw out similarities and differences where relevant. Core to the argument of the “planned withdrawal” of the Burmese military from the highest reigns of governmental power were those machinations of “inter-elite negotiations” which centered upon a “pact” between three specific segments of Myanmar's polity. This “top-down” approach included soldier-turned-civilian leaders from the ancien régime, well-known and well-liked leaders from the pro-democracy opposition—foremost amongst them, Aung Sang Suu Kyi and elites of the National League for Democracy (NLD) political party—and leaders of politicized or armed ethnic groups, particularly those who appeared open to cease-fire negotiations.
Egreteau points out that incorporating… [click here to continue to read full text]

Arctic sea ice extent data, 1980–2012. Data from NSIDC Via the Guardian
Side by side view of ice extent each month over time. Y-axis is a normalized index from the dataset. Notice the overall downward trend, especially in the summer months. Not a single month has an upward trend over the entire timespan.
June Ice Extent over Time. Compare the "recovery" this year to the trend and previous recovery years (1985, 1990, 1995).
July Ice Sheet over Time
August Ice Cover by Year including the reported recovery.
So yes, the fact is there is a larger ice sheet than last year (the 60% number even seems right), but remember that we are comparing it to a record low in 2012.
outperforming expectations at the time, it's reasonable to predict that in the near future their performance will drop back to their average. Statisticians refer to this phenomenon as regression to the mean . A common example is the Sports Illustrated Cover Jinx , an urban legend that claims players and teams pictured on the cover of the magazine are doomed to fail in the near future. Given that the players featured on the cover are usually the ones that are alreadyexpectations at the time, it's reasonable to predict that in the near future their performance will drop back to their average.
Looking at the data we can see repeated cycles of recoveries which denialists have repeatedly pointed to as trendbreakers or evidence of global cooling. Once again the importance of zooming out on your data for context. Doing anything else is just irresponsible anomaly hunting.
The past 24 hours have seen a slew of news reports trumpeted by climate change deniers indicating that sea ice cover in the Arctic increased by 60%. I first came across the story this morning when Craig Rucker of CFact.org sent out this info-graphic and accompanying message via email.The two most commonly sources are the Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail , two UK papers known the world over for their great science reporting ; the Daily Mail even got an award for it . But just to be safe, let's review the data ourselves again Statisticians have a saying: "torture the data enough and eventually it will confess." Climate denialists have transformed this into an art form. This graphic, created by Dana Nuccitelli at The Guardian, is the most wonderful demonstration of this technique I've ever seen. By reporting trends over small windows of 6 years to a decade, it is trivial to create a series of trendlines that all show global temperatures decreasing over time.Checkmate scientists!Dana put together another fun little chart with sea ice extent on a similar theme:In accordance with the scientific method, I should be able to replicate these findings myself. So I went and downloaded the entire dataset from NSIDC myself and did a little number crunching. Here are just a few of the plots I created:It can be hard to see the trends in this 1000ft view of the data, so let's compare apples to apples and go month by month.Even back in June we could see a clear recovery in ice sheet extent and area. The magnitude of the recovery is comparable what we will see in August, but expressed as a percentage it is only a 10% increase. As the ice continues to melt through the summer, the difference in ice coverage remains roughly the same but because there is less ice overall (and because we're comparing to an all-time record shattering low in 2012) by the time we reach August the percentage has reached 50% by my math. Variation in data sets makes the reported 60% still a reasonable number because we're dealing with such small values.
Shepard stared at the bottom of her empty glass and contemplated filling it up again for what would be the fifth time. She sat alone in her cabin and decided to treat herself to another glass of whiskey. She could no longer recall what had made her drink to begin with but she had long since recovered from it. Shepard chugged the fifth glass and slammed it down on her table concluding that she was now thoroughly drunk.
The commander felt a giddy sense of amusement for reasons she didn't know but she found herself unable to wipe the smirk from her face as she laid back on her couch. Shepard jolted up from her relaxed position and remembered an idea she had several drinks ago. The commander stumbled over to her comm and hailed Liara's cabin.
Shepard's balance wavered slightly as she stood up next to the comm waiting for a response from her dear Asari. Finally the comm opened and Liara's soft voice emanated from Shepard's console.
"Shepard is there something you need?" The doctor asked.
"Yeah… I need to um discuss something important with you Liara do you mind coming up?" Shepard said trying to hide her state of intoxication.
"Um… Ok I'll be right up. Are you alright?" Liara asked with an uncertain tone.
"Oh I'm great I just need to see you like right now!" Shepard replied, her words slurred and high pitched.
"Okay see you in a minute." Liara replied and the comm link closed.
Shepard stumbled over to the drawer under her console where she kept among other things alcohol and glasses. She pulled out two glasses and a bottle of Thessian wine she received as a gift from Anderson during her incarceration in Vancouver . She popped the cork off the bottle and sloppily poured it into the two glasses.
The cabin door snapped open and Liara walked in. Shepard spun around to greet her and held up the glasses
"Liara!" Shepard cried out and pushed the glass towards the Asari who stood fixed in a state of confusion and amusement at the commander obvious intoxication. Liara gently took the glass out of the slightly shaking grip of the commander.
"Having a good time Shepard?" Liara asked with giggle. Seeing Shepard like this was unexpected but not at all un-enjoyable to the doctor.
"Yeah! Thought I'd unwind a little and now all I want is to dance with you!" Shepard blurted out and took a deep swig from her glass, Liara followed suite.
"Well it may take few more of these before I'm willing to watch you dance Shepard." Liara said with a smile.
Shepard rewarded her comment with a drunken laugh and the commander brought her drink to her lips for another large chug.
"So how are you doing tonight?" Shepard said with her words slurring forcing Liara to suppress the urge she had to laugh out loud.
"I'm doing quite well thanks for asking." Liara replied courteously.
"Well you look even better." Shepard said as she gave Liara's body a scanning look from top to bottom.
"Your too kind." Liara said blushing. She wasn't used to dealing with commander in such a blunt manner.
Liara took several sips from her wine glass until it was empty. Shepard reached back and grabbed the bottle of wine to fill up the Asari's glass and then her own.
"Cheers!" Shepard said and clinked her glass with Liara's before taking yet another large swig.
Shepard and the doctor finished many glasses of wine before Shepard turned on a slow piano piece and took Liara's hands and spun her around as they danced drunkenly throughout the commander's spacious cabin. Shepard twirled Liara under her arm before pulling her in close as the two did their best effort at ballroom dancing despite their severe intoxication.
"Either I'm really drunk or you learned how to dance!" Liara said as the two moved together in a slow harmony.
"Yeah well maybe I'm just drunk or you would look even better if you were on that bed over there." Shepard said.
"And here I was thinking you only liked me for my dancing." Liara said coquettishly.
"There are quite a few things I like about you Doctor T'Soni but dancing isn't exactly at the top." Shepard said as her eyes wandered to the Asari's chest.
"Funny I was about to say something similar." Liara teased.
As the pair continued their dance Liara's hands slowly inched their way down the commander's back before resting on Shepard's plump bottom.
"I should get you drunk more often." Shepard said as she enjoyed the Asari's new hand placement.
"Perhaps you should." Liara said biting down on her lower lip as she stared into Shepard's green eyes.
"Do you ever think about the two of us after this war?" Liara asked as she moved one hand free to run it through Shepard's black hair.
"Every single day." Shepard replied.
"Me too." Liara said and flashed a warm smile as she continued to run her hand through the commander's hair.
"But it isn't what I'm thinking about right now." Shepard said as she moved her own hands on to Liara's bum.
Liara then playfully shoved Shepard on to the bed before crawling up next to her. The two women almost instantaneously were locked in a passionate kiss.
Liara rolled over on top of Shepard and straddled her. Liara let out a drunken nervous laugh before un-buckling her top and removing it exposing her breasts. Shepard reached up to cup her hands over the Asari's breasts before rolling Liara on to her back. Shepard reached back and un-did her hair clip letting her long black hair flow down her back freely before sloppily pulling off her clothes and throwing them randomly about the room. Then their lips came together once more. They only separated from their kiss when Liara began to move herself further down Shepard's body planting kisses as she went. Shepard's hands tightened on the bed sheets and she let out a soft moan as she enjoyed Liara's new placement. And it wasn't long before Shepard returned the favor.
It was approaching noon ship time on the Normandy and Shepard and Liara were still fast asleep their naked bodies intertwined on the commander's bed. Shepard and Liara's clothes lay strewn about the cabin's floor and empty bottles and spilled glasses littered the tables. A loud clearing of the throat woke the sleeping Asari and Liara's eyes jolted open. She sprang up into a sitting position disorientated and scanning the room before setting her eyes on Garrus who stood at the foot of the bed.
"Goddess!" Liara shrieked in embarrassment and pulled the covers up to hide her naked body.
The doctor's scream woke the sleeping commander who almost mimicked the Asari's reaction completely. Shepard let out a scream and covered her breasts with one of her arms and buried her face in embarrassment with her free hand. Garrus turned his back to the two women and shuffled his feet awkwardly.
"Can we help you Garrus?!" Shepard said embarrassed.
"Sorry to um wake you two but we're arriving at the Citadel within the hour and you have that meeting with the Salarian councilor. I'm sorry but someone needed to wake you two EDI was refusing…I'll give you two some privacy." Garrus said nervously and quickly shuffled out of the room.
Shepard took a moment to try and process what had just happened. Her head ached and made looking into bright light sting her eyes. Liara on the other hand was still red in the face.
"Well um Good morning Liara." Shepard said jokingly.
"Goddess I'm so embarrassed and my head is pounding." Liara said finally pulling her face from her hands to make eye contact with Shepard.
"Small price to pay for what we did last night Doctor T'Soni." Shepard said rubbing her eyes clear.
"Where are my clothes?" Liara said scanning the room from the comfort of the bed.
Shepard stepped out of the bed and opened her drawers pulling out a fresh set of clothes for herself. Shepard dressed herself and pulled her hair back into it's a usual bun.
"Use my shower if you want Liara, I'll go grab you something to wear from your cabin." Shepard said as she finished with her hair.
"Thanks. I'll do that. And Shepard thanks for last night I had fun." Liara replied.
"Yeah me too. I guess I needed to unwind more than I realized. Okay I'll be back soon." Shepard said as she leaned in to give Liara a quick peck on the cheek before leaving the room.
Shepard rode the elevator down to the crew deck trying to think of what to say to Garrus when she got there. The door to the elevator lifted and Garrus stood studying the memorial in front of the commander. She awkwardly approached him and cleared her throat.
"Morning Garrus." She said.
"Afternoon actually Shepard." Garrus replied
"Sorry about that. Liara is pretty embarrassed I guess I am too." Shepard said nervously rubbing her head.
"I guess we all need to blow off steam every now and then. I'm glad you got the chance Shepard. And by the looks of it you certainly made the most of that chance." Garrus said with a chuckle
"Yeah..yeah laugh it up Garrus. And um… if you could not mention what you saw to anyone We'd both really appreciate it. Not that I'm ashamed or anything but something tells me it might not be good for moral if every member of the crew knew what their commanding officer did in her downtime." The commander said.
"Really? I think it would boost moral." Garrus said with a chuckle.
Shepard glared at him.
"Your secret is safe with me Shepard." Garrus assured her.
"Thanks. Well I got to go get the doctor some clothes so see you around Garrus." Shepard said and moved towards Liara's office.
Shepard sifted through the Asari's office trying to find where she kept her clothing. The commander settled on the dresser next to the Asari's bed. Shepard pulled open the drawers and found what she was looking for. She gathered the doctor's clothes and made for the exit.
As the door whizzed open she was greeted by James Vega who stood in the Mess studying a data pad. James looked up from the datapad and stared at the pile of clothes and then up to the commander's face with an arched eyebrow.
"Morning Lola…Borrowing some of Doctor T'Soni's clothes?" James said with bemusement.
Shepard's face began to turn red again and she started smiling nervously.
"Uh… yeah I just need to check her sizes. You know with Christmas around the corner. So don't mention this to anyone or you will ruin the surprise." Shepard said with a stutter.
"Do Asari even celebrate the holidays?" James asked with interest.
"Sure they do. Now I got to run so see you around James." Shepard spat out and jogged back to the elevator.
Shepard dropped the pile of clothes on to her bed. Liara walked out of the bathroom moments later, her body wrapped in a towel.
"Got you these. And if James asks say your really looking forward to Christmas this year." Shepard said.
"What's Christmas?" Liara asked confused.
Across Latin America, the overall number of infections of the AIDS-causing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been stagnating, a worrying phenomenon when compared to other regions, like Africa, where it is in decline

San José (AFP)
The virus that causes AIDS is spreading among women and homosexuals in Latin America, due largely to the violence and discrimination that afflict both groups, according to a United Nations official.
"The rise in the number of infections is occurring among young women and homosexual men, both of whom live in situations of discrimination," Luiz Loures, deputy director of the UNAIDS program, told AFP.
Because they are discriminated against, he added, people in these groups sometimes shun society and do not take part in prevention programs.
Across Latin America, the overall number of infections of the AIDS-causing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been stagnating, a worrying phenomenon when compared to other regions, like Africa, where it is in decline.
Loures, who holds the rank of UN undersecretary general, was in San Jose this week to take part in a forum organized by ICW Latina, which brings together women living with HIV.
At the forum, he drew a clear link between high rates of violence among young Latin women and high HIV rates.
"Our statistics clearly show that where there is violence there is HIV," he said, adding that "women who suffer violence may have an HIV risk 30 to 50 percent higher than those who do not."
He added that more than 30 percent of young women in Latin America say they have suffered physical or sexual violence, a rate he called "very high, and very concerning."
- Worrying levels of violence -
In fact, women in Latin America -- and particularly in Mexico and Central America -- face the highest rates of violence of women anywhere in the world, according to a report by the UN Women office.
The other problem is the difficulties many women face in obtaining needed care or information on reproductive health, with 42 percent of women in some countries saying they have suffered discrimination in health centers, Loures said.
"This is a permanent problem and it leaves a black mark on the region," he said. "Until we reduce violence and discrimination, there is no way to stop the new infections" of HIV.
In 2016, some 540,000 women in Latin America were living with AIDS, and of them, 73,000 were between the ages of 15 and 24, according to UNAIDS. Throughout the region, a total of some 1.8 million people carried the virus.
This year, an estimated 27,000 new HIV infections will afflict women in the region, 28 percent of all new cases, the organization said.
Loures noted that Latin America was the first region in the world where a movement arose in civil society to demand treatment for HIV patients, leading some governments to guarantee treatment. But he said the Latin countries will have real difficulty in reaching a UN goal of eradicating infections by 2030.
While many people with HIV were being treated, others were yet to be served, he said.
"We need to do much more," Loures said. "We have to do a better job of ending violence against women, which for me is a more important epidemic than that of HIV."

In a move that's not wholly surprising given AMD's Radeon R9 290X launch last week and serving as a tacit understanding that its comparable GPUs do not currently offer as much value for money, Nvidia has just announced it is delivering much-anticipated price cuts to the GeForce GTX 780 and GTX 770 GPUs. The cuts are due to be active by 1pm tomorrow.
Quoting prices in US dollars, the GTX 780 will drop from $649 to $499 and the GTX 770 from $399 to $329. Given that both GPUs have near-perfect exchange-rate correlation presently, one would expect the cheapest boards from each family to drop to £375 and £250, respectively, though it's likely both will be a touch more expensive as retailers try to increase margin.
Such a move puts the GTX 780 below the AMD Radeon R9 290X, and the GTX 770 very much in the financial crosshairs of the Radeon R9 280X. Nvidia believes it will offer still more value because the GTX 780/770, if purchased from authorised retailers, are bundled with redeemable codes for the following triple-A games, Batman: Arkham Origins, Splinter Cell: Blacklist, and Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag.
And adding further spice to this announcement, Nvidia has revealed November 7 as the launch and general availability date for the GeForce GTX 780 Ti. We're still waiting on specifications, but we do now know that it will cost $699 (£550?) in reference form.
What do you think? Has Nvidia done enough to quieten the ever-increasing Radeon threat? Will the upcoming R9 290 (non-X) further upset the status quo? Do let us know your thoughts in the comments facility below.
Update
It seems as if enthusiastic etailers have already jumped the gun. For example, partner-overclocked GTX 780s are now available for £399.99 and also-overclocked GTX 770s £239.72, both from Scan.co.uk.
It is possible, perhaps even probable, that this fall's election will be contested between two of three most disliked presidential candidates of at least the past quarter century.
And it is possible, perhaps even probable, that this is not a coincidence.
A Gallup survey released Saturday shows that Donald Trump has the highest unfavorability rating (60 percent) of any presidential candidate since the polling firm started tracking the figure in 1992. For her part, Hillary Clinton ranks third (52 percent) with the no-new-taxes-breaking George H.W. Bush of 1992 at No. 2.
In other words, the 2016 presidential election could be decided between two people that the majority of Americans, according to Gallup, don't like politically.
How is this possible?
Actually, it makes complete sense. In fact, one could argue that such a contest would perfectly befit the current political era.
At a time when partisanship has taken new and more rigid forms, the result has been an America increasingly wary of the other side. Many Americans are increasingly motivated to vote against candidates rather than for them.
Mr. Trump and former Secretary of State Clinton symbolize this shift in different ways, but they speak to the shrinking middle of American politics. As the national parties have less and less in common, their national candidates likewise have less in common, leaving voters with a starker choice that they are just as likely to oppose as embrace.
Indeed, political scientists note that Americans are more neatly “sorted” into the two parties than they have been in recent history. In other words, conservatives support Republicans and liberals support Democrats.
No more “blue dog” Democrats who want to reform welfare. No more Northeast Republicans who want to address climate change.
It means there is a brighter line between the national Democratic and Republican Parties than there has been in decades, because there is less internal pressure to moderate. If, increasingly, everyone in the party is left-of-center (or right-of-center), the party naturally shifts left (or right).
The result is two sharply different visions for America, two sharply different sets of solutions.
Another result is the vanishing swing voter. (See the Monitor's Cover Story on the subject.) A larger share of American voters might register as independents than as Democrats or Republicans, but they don't act that way. Those independents who reliably turn out to vote tend to take sides just like the partisans, voting in consistently partisan ways.
“People are more confident in their opinions when they see polarized parties,” Corwin Smidt, a Michigan State University political scientist, told the Monitor. “They think, ‘Well, if the choices are so stark, it's just not a gray area at all.' ”
And so they worry about the “other side” winning, according to research by Emory University political scientists Alan Abramowitz and Steven Webster. They found that voting behavior is increasingly guided by this “negative partisanship.”
This fall, it seems, American voters might have a lot to vote against.
Trump has become the Republican front-runner precisely because of his lack of broader appeal, argues pollster Frank Luntz in the Financial Times.
“No high-polling presidential candidate in the modern era has so intrepidly drawn the ire of so many within the American electorate,” he writes. “Yet in rendering one voting bloc utterly apoplectic, he has appealed viscerally to another. The balance of middle ground politics is not, shall we say, Mr. Trump's bailiwick.”
His calls for the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants and a temporary ban on all noncitizen Muslims entering the country are antithetical to those outside his conservative base, which partly explains their appeal within it.
“He's simply raising an important issue nobody else has the courage to talk about,” Mr. Luntz adds, paraphrasing the Trump voters' reasons for supporting the billionaire.
For Clinton, the issue is less ideological than historical. She is facing a perceived lack of trustworthiness that dates back to her husband's administration – and has been exacerbated by her handling of State Department e-mails.
Yet the same trends that have vaulted Trump to front-runner status are apparent in the Democratic primary process, too.
Bernie Sanders could topple Clinton in Iowa and New Hampshire. And he is an avowed socialist talking about a revolution.
“In Sanders's vision, a massive grassroots uprising will shatter the constricting limits of today's political debate and thrust forward long-time liberal goals such as single-payer health care and free public-college tuition,” writes Ronald Brownstein in The Atlantic. “For Sanders's growing army, it's an exhilarating prospect.”
For Republicans, it is appalling.
To some degree, this is what primaries do: push candidates toward the extremes. But there is a mounting sense that, as the parties move further apart, this year represents something new – or at least more intense.
While the experience might be temporarily cathartic, evidence suggests it might not be ultimately satisfying. As Congress has become more sorted, Americans' confidence in it has declined. Americans have less confidence in Congress than they do in any other major American institution – and have since 2010 – according to a Gallup survey.
After all, a revolution entails one side “winning” – not likely in a political environment where each side is becoming more entrenched to stop the other.
“On both sides, the energy is with candidates … offering the dream of a clean sweep and a blank sheet on which to rewrite the nation's priorities,” writes Mr. Brownstein. “Yet because the candidates offering such fundamental change are largely misdiagnosing the reasons for today's impasse, it's unlikely they could break it even if they capture the presidency.”
Their misdiagnosis? Brownstein suggests that it's unlikely one side can ignore the other to rewrite the nation's priorities.

“Given the nation's underlying partisan divisions, the only way to advance bigger ideas may be through compromises across party lines that neither side is discussing much yet.”
What this primary campaign has done, perhaps, is highlighted the shifting political topography and distance between those party lines.
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A soldier who reported for duty with her children in tow has been granted her request for a discharge, her lawyer said Monday.
Lisa Pagan was recalled to the Army after being honorably discharged four years ago.
Lisa Pagan, of Davidson, North Carolina, reported for duty Monday morning at Fort Benning, Georgia, with her two preschool children. She had been honorably discharged from active duty at the rank of specialist nearly four years ago but was recalled as part of the Individual Ready Reserve program.
The former Army truck driver asked for a reprieve from deployment because her husband travels for business and they would have no one to care for their children if she was sent overseas. Until Monday, her request had been denied.
Late Monday afternoon, Pagan's lawyer told CNN the Army would grant her request and begin the process of discharge again, this time for good.
"We are definitely heading in the right direction for Lisa and her family and her children," said Mark Waple, Pagan's attorney. "She has been told by her chain of command they plan on doing everything they can within reason to do this as expeditiously as possible."
Pagan enlisted in 2002 and was honorably discharged from active duty in June 2005. She was never deployed.
Before she left for Fort Benning, Pagan, 27, told CNN affiliate WCNC that her relatives weren't able to care for her children for various reasons, including her relatives' health.
She said her family couldn't afford to have her husband give up his job. They would lose their house, she told the Charlotte, North Carolina-TV station.
"I'm a human being. I need to take care of my children. They don't have anybody else," Pagan told WCNC.
Since September 11, 2001, the Army has recalled about 25,000 soldiers. Nearly half requested a delay or a full exemption. Some just wanted to finish their school semester before reporting. Others had financial or medical problems that made it difficult to report for duty.
The Army says it granted nearly nine out of 10 delay requests and six out of 10 requests for exemption.

On 27th March, Bter announced that 45 altcoins and assets will be delisted from their exchange. The Chinese version announcement is here. They identified those coins as missing development team, unstable network, no trading volume etc, This bold move is the first time in three years' time without any notice. This move is really hurting a lot of users.
Although they request users to withdraw them within one month otherwise the withdrawal won't be processed automatically. But they claim they still process the withdrawal manually within three months.
The delisted coins include:
BITUSD, BITCNY, AsiaCoin, Archcoin, Atomic, AuroraCoin, Boolberry, BlockNet, BitBar, CryptoBuck, Cloudcoin, Communitycoin, Pennies, CosmosCoin, NeoDICE, KeyID BitShares, DarkCash, Extremecoin, Freicoin, FreshCoin, GhostCoin, GameLeagueCoin, NXTInspect, KlondikeCoin, LottoShares, MemoryCoin2.0, MultiGateway, FreeMarket, NavajoCoin, NAS, NeoCoin, NetCoin, NFD, Pangea, DPOS, Qora, RoxCoin, Slimcoin, Spark, BitSwift, TagCoin, ViaCoin, ClearingHouse, ZCCoin, nTx.
Users are complaining they cannot withdraw them due to no working wallet or that the coins are still frozen by Bter, Bter are stealing this money. Most of the coins are abandoned by the development teams, there are no trading volume at all, or there are no others exchanges who are still listing those coins etc. Many users are still holding them at Bter's account. They bought them from Bter's platform and keep them there. The coins suddenly have been delisted and become worthless.
On 29th March, Bter gave another announcement that they will provide some solutions for the untransferable coins, which are that Bter will help holders exchange those coins to new ones which are tradeable and have working wallets based on the average exchange rate before being delisted. But no further details are presented at the announcement. This is really praised decision. If Bter want to carry on its business and win back the lost trust from its users, it has a lot of things needed to be improved, like the quality service, carefulness about the users, return of the owed money to its users etc.
CCLA Responds To Questions On M-103 Tweet
Yesterday, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association was asked why it was not standing up for free speech and arguing against Motion 103 (“M-103”).
The answer is simple. M-103 does not restrict free speech.
Not only does M-103 not restrict or censor speech, it is also not a bill and is not law. It is of no legal force or effect. It is a motion that has been introduced and has not passed.
So what is M-103? It is a motion with two main asks. First, it asks the government to condemn Islamophobia “and all forms of systemic racism and religious discrimination.” Second, it asks the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage to undertake a study on how the government could develop “a whole-of-government approach to reducing or eliminating systemic racism and religious discrimination including Islamophobia”, and asks for data collection on hate crimes and “evidence-based policy-making”.
The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms protects freedom of speech in section 2(b), freedom of religion in section 2(a), and the rights to equality and non-discrimination in section 15. There is no rational argument that M-103 – an un-passed motion that has no force of law – restricts or constrains section 2(b).
The CCLA has a long history of defending the right to free speech, regardless of whether we agree with such speech, provided that the speech is not criminal. The CCLA has argued to protect speech that is racist, misogynist, homophobic, anti-Semitic and anti-Islamic. CCLA has and will oppose government censorship and restraint of speech even when we find that speech reprehensible. When the government seeks to restrict or censor speech, we have demanded that the government discharge its burden of explaining why any restraint on speech is justifiable.
The CCLA continues to argue for freedom of speech of the most odious and heinous views because we recognize that freedom to express unpopular or controversial views is essential to a free democracy. For example, in this past year, the CCLA challenged the government in writing, when the Minister of Public Services sought to restrict mail delivery of a publication called Your Ward News – a publication that is racist and misogynist, insults visible minorities, and is pro-Hitler.
The CCLA continues to support people's rights to disseminate content and messages, regardless of whether we support or agree with that content, and would call on the government to discharge their burden of proving that any restriction on speech is justifiable in a free and democratic society.
However, the CCLA rejects hyperbole and exaggeration that seeks to concoct restrictions to free speech where no such restriction exists.
Illinois Prosecutors Planning To Appeal Ruling That Said Recording Police Is Protected By The First Amendment
from the of-course-they-are dept
Earlier this month, we wrote about the ridiculous criminal case against Michael Allison , who was facing 75 years in prison for the horrible crime of recording the police. The details of the case made it quite clear that the charges against him were vindictive, in response to attempts by Allison to challenge a questionable fine he'd received. Thankfully, an Illinois state court tossed out the lawsuit , noting that the law pretty clearly violated the First Amendment.Of course, for whatever reason, Illinois state law enforcement has taken particular interest in the case, with the state Attorney General office coming in to help with the case, and the Illinois Assistant Attorney General flat out claiming that there's no First Amendment right to record police. So, it should probably come as little surprise that the state has indicated that it's planning to appeal the ruling (via Radley Balko ). Perhaps this isn't a surprise -- but it does suggest a really broken system where the state is so adamant in trying to vindictively punish a guy for defending his own rights.

There's a ton of reasons why Nintendo collectibles sell so well for the company. Nostalgia. Rarity. Short windows. The fact that they play so well with kids and adults alike. The sheer power of the character factory that is Nintendo, who is able to create memorable properties out of thin air like Splatoon. All of that factors into the nightmare that is pre-ordering a Nintendo product, and the SNES Mini is the same old song and dance.
Just take the UK for example. While the US is still in the dark for pre-orders UK vendors have already sold out of their allotments, and although more could open up in the future, folks are left to fend off scalpers right now. Yep, the £79.99 has shot up to £199.99 in most cases. Scalpers, of course, were able to get ample stock!
There's no avoiding it, it'll be the same for the US. Nintendo says they'll actually stock it this time, but none of us really believe them after they said they'd do the same for the NES Mini after the fact, and never did. Except this time there's the added collector value of Star Fox 2, which was never released to the public.
Oh Nintendo!

Hamlin N.Y.- Monroe County Sheriff's deputies say a pizza delivery man is facing charges. That after they say he reported a homicide to police that never happened.
Deputies say 18 year old Mason Requa called 911 and told deputies that he had witnessed a homicide around nine o'clock Wednesday night.
Requa, they say, gave a detailed description of the incident including descriptions about the suspects, type of weapon used and what clothing the victim was wearing.
Several agencies, including deputies, U.S. Border Patrol and New York State Police searched for close to four hours until, investigators said, Requa admitted telling investigators that he made up the story because he was afraid he would be fired from his job for a late pizza delivery. Requa was charged with Falsely Reporting An Incident.
He is due back in court next Tuesday.

Server Problems are Resolved!
Since Release last week there has been massive interest in Path of Exile. The influx of users caused server stability problems that were mostly noticeable during peak times (disconnections and item loss issues with the guild stash). We worked round the clock (literally until 4am this morning) to deploy a series of fixes. After looking at 18 hours of data, we're happy to announce that these server problems appear completely resolved! We've put together some screenshots of our internal monitoring tools to show the huge effect that these fixes had.
This is a graph of our server concurrency for a 10 hour period around peak time before it was fixed. Note that we were struggling to keep 40,000 players connected at the same time. The jagged drops in the graph are a thousand of players being disconnected at a time.
This is the graph of our server concurrency for a similar period this morning. The graph is completely smooth and we effortlessly handled over 50k-60k concurrent players.
Please note that these improvements only affect the disconnections that people were experiencing. They don't address other areas like combat sync (which we're still working on). Thanks for your patience with these issues. I am very happy to report this progress and excited to share more good news with you about performance as it happens.

US cancels Trump's visit to UK after anti-Muslim tweet backlash
US diplomats have canceled President Trump's unofficial visit to Britain in January, according to a report Thursday.
The decision was made in the wake of Trump's retweeting of three anti-Muslim videos from a far-right group, Britain's Telegraph reported
Trump had scheduled a “working visit” in early 2018 to formally open the United States' new embassy in London, and was not scheduled to meet with the Queen.
No new date has been set.
“The idea of a visit has obviously been floated, but not December and not January. I would not expect a Trump visit in January,” a senior US diplomat told the newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May has chastised Trump for the tweets, saying it was “wrong” to have shared the videos. She also denounced the group behind the tweets, Britain First, as a “hateful organization.”
But May did not withdraw Trump's invitation to come to Britain for a full-blown state visit sometime in the future.
ISIS militants had vowed to make Ramadan, Islam's holy month that began last week, a “month of conquests,” and Friday they were congratulating themselves on having started to deliver on that promise with threats of continued violence in the three weeks still left to go. Just days ago, ISIS spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani called on supporters to launch more attacks, telling followers that those ‘martyred' during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan receive greater blessings than those who die during other times of the year.
At least three separate attacks caused the deaths of dozens on Friday in Tunisia, France and Kuwait. Islamic State supporters heralded the killings as “Bloody Friday” in discussions across secretive online forums and social media, an analysis by Vocativ revealed. The group claimed responsibility for the bombing of a Shiite Muslim mosque in Kuwait City, which killed at least 27 people, and the attack at a beach resort in Sousse, Tunisia, which killed another 39.
Friday's killings come at the end of a week marred by ISIS showcasing its brutality. Islamic State fighters launched a two-pronged offensive in the Syrian cities of Kobani and Hasaka on Thursday, massacring as many as 146 civilians according to new reports, including women and children. The group released two execution videos that John Horgan, a psychologist and terrorism researcher at Georgia State University, told Vocativ were “sadism at a clinical level.”
ISIS has for several years made a point of using Ramadan for launching significant strikes.
In 2012, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, then known as the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq, made his first online statement as the head of the militant network. In 2013, the group carried out simultaneous raids on Taji and Abu Ghraib prisons in Iraq during the holy month, setting free more than 500 prisoners who quickly joined ISIS' ranks.
And this time last year, ISIS declared its caliphate after capturing Mosul in June, as Ramadan was getting underway in the northern Iraqi city.

On the heels of a nationwide measles outbreak comes a report that campaigns aimed at scaring people about the consequences of non-vaccination might not be as effective as many think. An upcoming article in the journal Communication Research challenges the popular assumption that emotional appeals have a wide, sweeping effect on people's health beliefs.
"Many health practitioners believe the best way to communicate the value of vaccination is to highlight the consequences of non-vaccination by using emotional pictures," said author Graham Dixon, associate professor with The Edward R. Murrow College of Communication at Washington State University. "My study shows that approach can backfire, particularly with individuals who have anti-vaccine views."
In his study, people read messages about vaccination that included an image of a child in a hospital bed. When the child was described as having a vaccine-preventable disease due to non-vaccination, people with anti-vaccine views were not emotionally affected by the picture and experienced lower risk perception regarding non-vaccination.
Dixon said people's existing attitudes and beliefs often bias how they process new information. As a result, a seemingly persuasive message might be effective for one group of people, but backfire for another group.
"The fear is that emotional campaigns might lead people with anti-vaccine views to become even less concerned about the risk of vaccine-preventable disease," he said. "Instead of using scare tactics, health practitioners should target the factors behind anti-vaccine beliefs by improving doctor-patient relationships and increasing trust in modern medicine."
Sex roulette parties where one person is secretly HIV positive and nobody is allowed to use condoms are on the rise, warn doctors.
The parties are usually attended by gay men, who are entertained by the 'thrill' of not knowing whether they will be infected or not.
Spanish doctors have noted a rise in the parties where attendees often take anti-viral drugs to reduce the risk of transmission.

Sex roulette parties where one person is secretly HIV positive and nobody is allowed to use condoms are on the rise, warn doctors (stock image)
Dr Josep Mallolas of Hospital Clinic Barcelona said that the parties are a sign that people have 'lost respect' for HIV, reports el Periodico.
'There is everything: sex roulette parties, or sex parties you can only attend if you already have HIV,' he told the outlet.
He added that some of the parties are known as 'blue' parties because attendees take anti-viral medication to cut the risk of transmitting the virus.
Psychosexual therapist Kate Morley told HelloU: 'Going to sex roulette parties is about the risk, partygoers think the higher the risk, the stronger the thrill.
'In the case of sex parties the intense high is as you combine orgasm with high adrenaline.'
She advised, though, that the long term consequences are dangerous.
New information surrounding Russian "crown prosecutor" Natalia Veselnitskaya, the woman who met with Donald Trump Jr., Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and now White House Senior Advisor Jared Kushner at Trump Tower in June 2016, is raising serious questions about how she got into the U.S. at all.
Six months before the June meeting, which Trump Jr. agreed to after being offered damaging information about Hillary Clinton as part of the "Russian government's support" for his father, Veselnitskaya was denied entry into the U.S. A few months later, she was granted rare entry by the Department of Justice under Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Veselnitskaya argued her entry to the U.S. was crucial in order to carry out her legal work for a Russian firm in New York City, yet engaged in a number of other projects or interests during her time in the U.S.

With this revelation, Lynch is backing away from the situation and denying knowing anything about it. From The Hill:
In a statement, a spokesperson for Lynch said the former attorney general “does not have any personal knowledge of Ms. Veselnitskaya's travel.” The U.S. Attorney's office in New York told The Hill that it let Veselnitskaya into the country on a grant of immigration parole from October 2015 to early January 2016 after her initial request for a visa had been denied.
Court records show that when Veselnitskaya sought permission to extend her stay, the U.S. attorney at the hearing told the judge that the special visa the Russian lawyer received was part of a “discretionary act that the statute allows the attorney general to do in extraordinary circumstances.”
The U.S. attorney described the grant of parole immigration as extremely rare.
Meanwhile, Obama administration officials from a number of agencies are shifting the blame for the situation.

Back in 2006, I reasoned (in The Curse of the Voynich) that if the nine-rosette page's circular city with a castle at the top…
…represented Milan (one of only three cities renowned for their circular shape), then the presence of swallowtail merlons on the drawing implied it must have been drawn after 1450, when the rebuilding of the old Porta Giovia castle (that was wrecked during the Ambrosian Republic) by Francesco Sforza as [what is now known as] the Castello Sforzesco began.
Ten Years Later, A Challenge
However, Mark Knowles recently challenged me on this: how was I so sure that the older castle on the site didn't also have swallowtail merlons?
While writing Curse, for the history of Milan I mainly relied on the collection of essays and drawings in Vergilio Vercelloni's excellent “Atlante Storico di Milano, Città di Lombardia”, such as these two pictures from Milano fantastica, in “Historia Evangelica et actos apostolorum cum alijs illorum temporum eventibus cum figuris crebioribus delineatis”, circa 1380:
…and this old favourite (which Boucheron notes [p.199] is a copy probably made between 1456 and 1472 of an original made in the 1420s)…
On the surface, it seemed from these as though I had done enough. But coming back to it, might I have been too hasty? I decided to fetch down my copies of Evelyn Welch's “Art and Authority in Renaissance Milan” and Patrick Boucheron's “Le Pouvoir de Bâtir” from the book overflow in the attic and have another look…
Revisiting Milan's Merlons
What did I find? Well: firstly, tucked away in a corner of a drawing by Galvano Fiamma (in the 1330s) of a view of Milan (reproduced as Plate IIa at the back of Boucheron's book), the city walls appear to have some swallowtail merlons (look just inside the two outermost towers and you should see them):
And in a corner of a drawing by Anovelo da Imbonate depicting and celebrating the 1395 investiture of Gian Galeazzo Visconti (reproduced in Welch p.24), I noticed a tiny detail that I hadn't picked up on before… yet more swallowtail merlons:
Then, when I looked at other miniatures by the same Anovelo da Imbonate, I found two other (admittedly stylized) depictions of Milan by him that also unmistakeably have swallowtail merlons:
So it would seem that Milan's city walls may well have had swallowtail merlons prior to 1450. The problem is that the city walls aren't the same as the Porta Giovia castle walls (built from 1358, according to Corio): and I don't think we know enough to say whether or not the castle itself had swallowtail merlons. It's debatable whether the drawing of the 1395 investiture (which took place in the Porta Giovia castle) depicts the castle itself having swallowtail merlons: I just don't know.
But the short version of the long answer is that because the Porta Giovia castle was only built from 1358-1372 (or thereabouts), we can't rely on texts written before then (such as Galvano Fiamma's). And there seems quite good reason to suspect (the Massajo drawing notwithstanding) that the Porta Giovia castle may well have had swallowtail merlons when it was used for the Visconti investiture in 1395. But I don't know for certain, sorry. 🙁
There are texts that might give us an answer: for example, the (1437) “De Laudibus Mediolanensium urbis panegyricus” by Pier Candido Decembrio (mentioned in Boucheron p.74), or Bernardino Corio's “Storia di Milano”. There are plenty of documents Boucheron cites in footnotes (pp.202-205), including “Lavori ai castelli di Bellinzona nel periodo visconteo”, Bolletino della Svizzera italiana, XXV, 1903, pp.101-104 (which I'll leave for another day). But it's obviously quite a lot of work. 🙁
Finally, I should perhaps add that a few details by Anovelo da Imbonate have an intriguingly Voynichian feel:
Though there were plenty of other miniature artists active in the Visconti court in Milan in the decades up to 1447, parallels between their art and the Voynich Manuscript's drawings haven't been explored much to date. Perhaps this is a deficiency in our collective Art Historical view that should be rectified. 🙂
We have all seen plenty of images and videos of Apple's new iOS 7 software running on the iPhone, but Apple was so rushed ahead of WWDC this year that it didn't even have time to get an iOS 7 beta for the iPad ready for last Monday's debut. While the iOS 7 experience on the iPad will obviously be similar to the iPhone experience in many ways, the iPad's interface always varies from the iPhone's in a number of areas, of course. Now, Apfelpage.de has posted several images of iOS 7's iPad UI that were pulled out of Apple's emulator software. Several additional screenshots of iOS 7 on the iPad follow below, and Apple's first beta of iOS 7 for the iPad is expected to become available in the coming weeks.
UPDATE: A few more screenshots from iOS developer Sonny Dickson have been added below.
I have now officially entered the Ultrarunners club! After the last few months of training, I finally got to cross the finish line of the Centurion South Downs Way 50 last Saturday. What a race!
My original plan was for the NDW50 as I know the route well, but with only 300 places it filled up before I could convince my mate James that he should join me (and I wanted a fellow ultra-runner-in-training :)). So we settled on the South Downs instead, signing-up in mid-August last year.
It's been looming in the calendar for a while but out of nowhere race day came around and it was time to see if we'd done enough training to make it round the course in one piece, and hopefully enjoy it a little along the way!
Prepping up
I've raced many road races before but never an ultra, and never one with a mandatory kit list. Usually I only have a small handheld water bottle and some jelly babies. Clearly that wasn't going to cut it this time, because as a minimum you need to carry a mobile phone, 1+ litres of water, a survival blanket, waterproof jacket, whistle, head-torch, backup head-torch, warm hat, gloves, and a base layer.
My jacket wasn't waterproof enough, I needed some trail shoes, and my trusty CamelBak wasn't even big enough to fit everything in. So I had a few bits of kit to acquire...but that's never a bad thing, right?
Most runners know that it's never a good idea to use new kit for race day that you haven't practiced with, as you may have some issues with it that cause you discomfort or worse over a long race. However, this relies on your Hermes delivery guy not leaving your package of new kit 'securely in the basement' that you don't have.
If that does happen, you might only have time for a single run with the complete kit! Not ideal, but my test run with everything packed into this (using Centurion's very useful video) was short but o.k., so fingers-crossed that would extend for 50 miles!
Pretty confident I'll be meeting the mandatory kit requirements... Okay, so most of it is for afterwards, trying to anticipate what I'll be craving after 8+ hours of exercise
Race Day
The race starts at Worthing College at 9am, so we were able to drive down from London early in the morning. It was a pretty grim morning, pouring down with rain and a little nippy. More than once we did question our life choices that had led us to this point.
Standard marathon breakfast. But this being effectively a very hilly double-marathon, follow up with a second breakfast for good measure :)
By the time we arrived though the weather had started to clear up, as well as our enthusiasm. Registration was quick and easy. We had our kit checked, signed a waiver and picked up our running number in no time. There was a busy but jovial atmosphere as everyone did their last-minute pre-race rituals and tried to decide whether the weather had cleared up sufficiently from the early morning rain to start without a jacket. Answer, yes.
And at about quarter to 9, in a group of 378 hopeful runners, we made our way to the start line...
Feeling apprehensively excited. This is it now!
3,2,1 Go!
We had a quick race briefing and then we were off! The rain had stopped, the sun was trying to peek out, and only 50 miles of trail lay between us and Eastbourne. Time to run!
Being my first Ultra I went in with no time-goal in mind, instead just wanting to finish, and as a bonus before sunset. That was quite a liberating feeling after racing on the road where I'm used to aiming for very specific splits and knowing exactly what I'm capable of; This was a whole different ball game, I felt I'd done enough training to finish but other than that it was all unknown territory.
A mile or so in and it's smiles all round. Will it last?
One thing that struck me really quickly was how sociable running a big trail event like this is. Coming from road-races where typically you'll set your watch and then focus in on your own race, it was a nice contrast.
Instead of jostling elbows of runners trying to get an early head-start, runners were bantering together like old school friends as they pushed on in mass up the hills. Ok, maybe at the front with the elite runners it's a bit different. Or maybe it's a smaller community and people are all old friends.
Either way, it was great chatting to all of the other runners. And to find out that most of them seemed to have raced several ultras before, or were wearing Grand Slam 100 T Shirt's was pretty epic... Humbling to be running 50 miles on a Saturday morning with most friends thinking you're crazy, and yet find yourself towards the novice end of the runners spectrum.
Incredible views to be had throughout the day. You can see for miles! (Of which you're about to run)
The first 11 miles of the race to the first aid station flew by. I felt good and full of energy, but was cautious to maintain a comfortable pace as I didn't want to burn out later. That, and some veteran 100 miler finishers were behind me and presumably they had a better idea about pacing than me :)
I think I pretty much sold the race to James with:
"Don't think of it as a 50 mile race... Think of it as eight back-to-back 10k's where you stop and stuff your face after each one"
It seemed to work, everyone likes food. I mean a selling point of the Heartbreaker was obviously the soup and roll. Luckily the aid stations on the SDW50 didn't disappoint. Instead of a cup of water grabbed mid-run, we stopped for a comparative feast.
I usually re-fuel with Clif bars on long runs as I find them pretty good and tasty, but today I supplemented them with ham sandwiches, fruit and chocolate in abundance.
After so many miles, food never tasted so good. And this is only half of it, there's a whole table of sandwiches, wraps and more fruit out of shot
The course exactly follows the South Downs Way except for a few miles at the start and finish, and it was virtually impossible to get lost en-route. As well as the standard acorn marking the trail there were Centurion's own markers, red and white tape and chalked arrows at key points.
A point-to-point and easy to follow route. My map stayed unused in my bag
Along the way was some fantastic scenery. We saw lots of animals, including running through a farm at one point. Cows, pigs, horses, sheep, check. That was cool, the raging bonfire not so much...
The total elevation gain over the race is 5700ft (1750m), so fairly hilly and no point in charging straight up all the hills. It was comforting that everyone else seemed to share the same view!
What goes up must come down...and back up
The hills were also a good opportunity to eat something, take in some more water, or update my 'crew' that came to support me of my progress (handy having that mandatory phone).
Unless you're aiming for the front of the field, a nice chance to admire the view and take a few photos
There are a few designated crew points aside from the aid stations. My girlfriend Abi and some of my family were waiting at Devil's Dyke 15 miles in, and then 5 miles later at Clayton Windmills. It was great to see them, and still feeling strong.
Devils Dyke, awaiting runners a plenty
They were waiting a while sometimes as being my first ultra I could only give very rough ball-park times for when I expected to be at each point. At least it was a nice day :)
At Clayton Windmills mile 20, it's not just the runners enjoying the views
Around the 30 mile mark I checked my Garmin. This was now the longest run I'd ever done, so I took a quick audit of how my body was holding up. Legs were...tired, but otherwise okay except for a niggling rubbing on the left heel. Hmm, hope that doesn't get worse. Not too bad all told, which was more than could be said for the watch, already down to 7% battery! I had a backup charger with me so I spent a while rigging it up to charge while hanging off one of the loops on the vest. And then had to run the next few miles holding it so it didn't bounce around... Not ideal. Especially considering the claimed 16-hour battery life being the sole reason I upgraded!
I reached Bo Peep at 39 miles and saw Abi again. Still mentally good, but physically quite fatigued by this point.
By the time I reached the aid station at Alfriston (41 miles) I knew I was going to finish. Holding back at the start had paid off and I now found myself wanting to speed up towards the end. Abi sent me a message to say I could make it under 9 hours if I got my game on too. Crikey, better get moving! Reaching Jevington at 46 miles I ran into the aid station not quite realising it was only a few miles till the finish until the volunteers called it out. Wondering why I had stopped I headed straight back out again and up the final climb of the course!
After around 8 and a half hours of running I reached the summit and stopped for a photo taken by one of the awesome volunteers that were all along the course. This was great.
All down hill from here now!
From here is the home-straight, downhill all the way taking you off the Downs and through the streets of Eastbourne until you reach the Athletics track of the Sports Park. It was a fairly tricky, technical descent down very narrow gulleys, and I almost stacked it a few times.
But I made it off the downs and onto the roads in one piece, feeling surprisingly good and picked up the pace a little towards the end. Soon the track was in view and I could hear the cheering in the distance. So close now! I reached the track just as a couple of fire engines arrived responding to the constant fire alarms that were going off, ready for my final victory lap of the track before crossing the line, taking my medal, and collapsing on the floor for a well-earned rest!
In total I was running for a little over 8h47m, my longest run ever in both time and distance. And possibly the most enjoyable.
Saved some energy for the mandatory sprint finish...!
I can't get over how quickly the day seemed to fly by. My longest run in training was 30 miles, but that felt like it took longer (it didn't). I put that down to the camaraderie of the day, and the frequent checkpoints that meant the race was broken up so it wasn't one long slog. It helped that the weather was good too! I'm sure I might have felt different if it was freezing, foggy, and lashing it down with rain :)
Challenge completed, great feeling!
At the finish line was hotdogs, tea and coffee. Oh, and the huge cool bag of food that I brought with me. After some stretches, I just ate. That 7k calorie deficit isn't going to fill itself, Om nom nom!
James completed the course too and had more or less the same feelings. Driving back to London we were absolutely exhausted, and drifting off to sleep. But not before the enlightenment of the day led him to come up with a real pearl of wisdom.
"Man cars are so good aren't they. So much easier than running."
An awesome medal to add to the collection :)
Summary
Exactly what I was looking for to make the jump up from marathon running to ultra-running. I haven't done many trail races (yet) to compare, but based on my experiences on the day I would recommend this race to anyone wanting to do the same.
Organisation: Great. Everything was easy on the day, and Centurion sent out a few emails in advance of the race with everything you need to know

Pretty good at £70. Some road-half marathons ask for amounts nearing that these days! Making it better: Would have been awesome to have a choice of hot-food at the end not just hot dogs. And announcements of runners when they hit the finish track would have been cool (actually I thought this was supposed to happen)
Would have been awesome to have a choice of hot-food at the end not just hot dogs. And announcements of runners when they hit the finish track would have been cool (actually I thought this was supposed to happen) Would I do it again? Yes
Now I just need to recover. Walking the next day was a bit of a non-starter, just like after I finished my first marathon. I also really like sleeping at the moment. And I think I've now gained weight with all the food I've eaten since.
What's next? In around 3 weeks now I'm running the Prague Marathon. The legs aren't too happy about that...
Part of Reinventing Parliament, a series examining how to make Parliament relevant again. With thanks to www.samaracanada.com
For the past week, The Globe has been examining how Canadians could reinvent Parliament to make it more respectful and more responsive. One message has come through above all: MPs must have courage.
In story after story, politicians past and present, progressives and conservatives, academics and layfolk said the same thing in many different ways: Prime Ministers and party leaders have stripped so much autonomy from MPs that they have become irrelevant, and Parliament with them.
Story continues below advertisement
Voting records analyzed by The Globe show that only a few Members of Parliament have broken ranks with their parties since the last election, on a handful of issues. Fear of reprisals – they will never make cabinet; they will lose their critic's portfolio; the leader will not sign their nomination papers in the next election – keeps them in line. Whatever these MPs promised their constituents as candidates, the only promise they keep is to obey the party whip.
The result is a House of Commons so scripted, so partisan, and so divorced from genuine debate and inquiry that Canadians feel increasingly alienated from the cockpit of their democracy.
Do other countries do democracy better? Yes. "There may be some exceptions in those African dictatorships that are part of the Commonwealth and so on," observed Leslie Seidle, a research director with the Institute for Research on Public Policy, "but in the advanced parliamentary democracies, there is nowhere that has heavier, tighter party discipline than the Canadian House of Commons. People are kicked out of their party temporarily for what are really very minor matters."
Yet despite the many and sometimes conflicting proposals for new procedures, new civility, new powers for the Speaker and for committees and for MPs, it is the members themselves who surrendered their sovereignty to the Centre, and only they can take it back.
Only MPs themselves can decide whether their job on a parliamentary committee is to examine and improve legislation or simply to vote the party line on proposed amendments.
Only MPs themselves can speak their mind on the floor of the House of Commons, rather than simply parroting the talking points shoved into their hand by some flunkey from the leader's office.
Only MPs themselves can vote their conscience rather than simply bend to the will of the leader.

Only MPs, working collaboratively with other MPs within their own party and across party lines, can restore the sovereignty that once was theirs.
The alternative might be a House of Commons that is simply bypassed by new forms of democratic expression. Social media are already pointing to a potential new era of participatory democracy, with crowd-sourced laws and more accessible politicians.
Activists have embraced the tool to great effect, though within political parties and the bureaucracy an ingrained fear of spontaneity renders it effectively useless.
There are other alternatives: Former Reform Leader Preston Manning is constructing a Model Parliament to train nascent politicians.
Mark Dance, a former parliamentary intern for Conservative James Bezan and Liberal Justin Trudeau, makes the case for a fourth institution of Parliament – a digital House.
There are many possibilities, and many futures. But for Members of Parliament living in the here and now, the choice is plain: Take your sovereignty back, or risk a Parliament that has no meaning or purpose.

Maxime Chanot's condition has been upgraded to “questionable” for New York City FC's Eastern Conference semifinal second leg vs. Columbus Crew.
The Luxembourg international missed the first leg through his sports hernia injury which has kept him out of contention for three months.
READ: Major Keys to NYCFC vs. Columbus
Chanot's last appearance came in the 2-2 draw with Toronto FC in July but he could make his comeback as NYCFC look to overturn a 4-1 deficit to reach the Conference Final for the first time in team history.
It would be a timely return considering that Alexander Callens will miss the game through suspension after receiving a red card in the first leg.
Miguel Camargo is the only player definitely out of contention for City with his season-ending injury, while Columbus are without Gaston Sauro, Ben Swanson, Alex Crognale and Connor Maloney.

Key Stats
Logstash is the “L” in the ELK Stack — the world's most popular log analysis platform and is responsible for aggregating data from different sources, processing it, and sending it down the pipeline, usually to be directly indexed in Elasticsearch.
The role Logstash plays in the stack is critical — it allows users to filter, massage, and shape the data so that it's easier to work with. This Logstash tutorial gives you a crash course in getting started with Logstash, and provides instructions for installing Logstash and configuring it.
Installing Logstash
Depending on your operating system and your environment, there are various ways of installing Logstash. We will be installing Logstash on an Ubuntu 16.04 machine running on AWS EC2 using apt. Check out other installation options here.
Before you install Logstash, make sure you have Java 8 installed.
To install Java 8, use:
sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install default-jre 1 2 sudo apt - get update sudo apt - get install default - jre
You can now begin the installation process for Logstash.
First, you need to add Elastic's signing key so that the downloaded package can be verified (skip this step if you've already installed packages from Elastic):
wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add - 1 wget - qO - https : //artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -
The next step is to add the repository definition to your system:
echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/6.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-6.x.list 1 echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/6.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee - a / etc / apt / sources . list . d / elastic - 6.x.list
All that's left to do is to update your repositories and install Logstash:
sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install logstash 1 2 sudo apt - get update sudo apt - get install logstash
Configuring Logstash
Logstash configuration is one of the biggest obstacles users face when working with Logstash. While improvements have been made recently to managing and configuring pipelines, this can still be a challenge for beginners.
We'll start by reviewing the three main configuration sections in a Logstash configuration file, each responsible for different functions and using different Logstash plugins.
Logstash Inputs
One of the things that makes Logstash so powerful is its ability to aggregate logs and events from various sources. Using more than 50 input plugins for different platforms, databases and applications, Logstash can be defined to collect and process data from these sources and send them to other systems for storage and analysis.
The most common inputs used are file, beats, syslog, http, tcp, udp, stdin but you can ingest data from plenty of other sources.
Inputs are the starting point of any configuration. If you do not define an input, Logstash will automatically create a stdin input. Since you can create multiple inputs, it's important to type and tag them so that you can properly manipulate them in filters and outputs.
Logstash Filters
If Logstash were just a simple pipe between a number of inputs and outputs, you could easily replace it with a service like IFTTT or Zapier. Luckily for us, it isn't. Logstash supports a number of extremely powerful filter plugins that enable you to manipulate, measure, and create events. It's the power of these filters that makes Logstash a very versatile and valuable tool.
Logstash Outputs
As with the inputs, Logstash supports a number of output plugins that enable you to push your data to various locations, services, and technologies. You can store events using outputs such as File, CSV, and S3, convert them into messages with RabbitMQ and SQS, or send them to various services like HipChat, PagerDuty, or IRC. The number of combinations of inputs and outputs in Logstash make it a really versatile event transformer.
Logstash events can come from multiple sources, so it's important to check whether or not an event should be processed by a particular output. If you do not define an output, Logstash will automatically create a stdout output.
A Logstash Configuration Example
Logstash has a simple configuration DSL that enables you to specify the inputs, outputs, and filters described above, along with their specific options. Order matters, specifically around filters and outputs, as the configuration is basically converted into code and then executed. Keep this in mind when you're writing your configs, and try to debug them.
Structure
Your configurations will generally have three sections: inputs, outputs and filters. You can have multiple instances of each of these instances, which means that you can group related plugins together in a config file instead of grouping them by type. Logstash configs are generally structured as follows:
#/etc/logstash/conf.d/ - apache.conf - haproxy.conf - syslog.conf 1 2 3 4 5 #/etc/logstash/conf.d/ - apache . conf - haproxy . conf - syslog . conf
So you can have a configuration file for each of the functions or integrations that you would like Logstash to perform. Each of those files will contain the necessary inputs, filters, and outputs to perform that function.
Your configurations will generally have three sections: inputs, outputs and filters. Here's an example of what a Logstash configuration file looks like:
input { file { path => "/var/log/apache/access.log" start_position => "beginning" sincedb_path => "/dev/null" } } filter { grok { match => { "message" => "%{COMBINEDAPACHELOG}" } } date { match => [ "timestamp" , "dd/MMM/yyyy:HH:mm:ss Z" ] } geoip { source => "clientip" } } output { elasticsearch { hosts => ["localhost:9200"] } } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 input { file { path = > "/var/log/apache/access.log" start_position = > "beginning" sincedb_path = > "/dev/null" } } filter { grok { match = > { "message" = > "%{COMBINEDAPACHELOG}" } } date { match = > [ "timestamp" , "dd/MMM/yyyy:HH:mm:ss Z" ] } geoip { source = > "clientip" } } output { elasticsearch { hosts = > [ "localhost:9200" ] } }
The input section is using the file input plugin to tell Logstash to pull logs from the Apache access log.
In the filter section, we are applying: a) a grok filter that parses the log string and populates the event with the relevant information from the Apache logs, b) a date filter to define the timestamp field, and c) a geoip filter to enrich the clientip field with geographical data.
Tip! The grok filter is not easy to configure. We recommend testing your filters before starting Logstash using the grok debugger. A rich list of the most commonly used grok patterns is available here.
Lastly, the output section which in this case is defined to send data to a local Elasticsearch instance.
Each of the configuration files can contain these three sections. Logstash will typically combine all of our configuration files and consider it as one large config. Since you can have multiple inputs, it's recommended that you tag your events or assign types to them so that it's easy to identify them at a later stage. Also ensure that you wrap your filters and outputs that are specific to a category or type of event in a conditional, otherwise you might get some surprising results.
Working with Logstash Plugins
You will find that most of the most common use cases are covered by the plugins shipped and enabled by default. To see the list of loaded plugins, access the Logstash installation directory and execute the list command:
cd /usr/share/logstash bin/logstash-plugin list 1 2 cd / usr / share / logstash bin / logstash - plugin list
Installing other plugins is easily accomplished with:
bin/logstash-plugin install logstash-output-kafka 1 bin / logstash - plugin install logstash - output - kafka
Updating and removing plugins is just as easy, as well as installing a plugin built locally.
Start Stashing!
The only thing that's left to do is get your hands dirty – start Logstash!
sudo service logstash start 1 sudo service logstash start
Configuration errors are a frequent occurrence, so using the Logstash logs can be useful to find out what error took place.
sudo tail -f /var/log/logstash/logstash-plain.log 1 sudo tail - f / var / log / logstash / logstash - plain . log
This post guided you through the steps for installing Logstash, configuring it, and making sure that you have access to all the functionality that you need through the plugin ecosystem. Since Logstash is the first element in an ELK-based data pipeline, you should now have a solid base on which to build a log analysis pipeline. Check out this Kibana tutorial to understand how.

Distribution Release: Voyager Live 18.10 The Voyager Live team has announced a new version of the project's Ubuntu-based distribution. The new release, Voyager Live 18.10, switches from using the Xfce desktop to using GNOME Shell as the default interface. An English translation of the original French release announcement reads: " I present to you for the first time: Voyager - GE 18.10 based on the GNOME Shell desktop and Ubuntu 18.10 (Cosmic Cuttlefish). Why GNOME Shell now? Voyager abandoned the GNOME Shell desktop 10 years ago for Xfce, because of its youth and especially because lack of flexibility and extensions were problematic at the time. Now, after several tests, the conclusion is that part of the GNOME Shell system is again ergonomic, customisable and more flexible than it was in the beginning. So it was considered to make a version named GE for GNOME Shell. Why the intermediate version with 9 months of support in 18.10 and not 18.04 LTS with its 3 years of support? Because GNOME Shell 3.30.1 does not install on the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and because 3.30 is much better than the 3.28 which is taking too many system resources. So here we are with this new digital and human adventure. " The new release offers nine months of support. Download (MD5) from SourceForge: Voyager-GE-18.10-amd64.iso (1,862MB, torrent, pkglist).
Distribution Release: Voyager Live 18.04 Voyager Live is an Xubuntu-based distribution and live DVD showcasing the Xfce desktop environment for French users. The project the latest release, Voyager Live 18.04, is a long term support release offering three years of support. An English translation of the original French release announcement reads: " I present you with Voyager 18.04 LTS with three years of long-term support (LTS), until April 2021. A variant based on Xubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver) with the Xfce desktop and version 4.15 of the Linux kernel. This project is done by a team who I wish to thank for their valuable work. Attention, Voyager is only a pushed variant of Xubuntu. The entire internal structure of Xubuntu 18.04 LTS is left by default to avoid any security issues and packages. All updates come from official Ubuntu. Voyager 18.04 LTS is multi-profile and multitasking in an aesthetic and immersive environment as much as possible and this, since the origins of Voyager, is so that the time spent on your machine is more enjoyable.

Distribution Release: Voyager Live 9 Rodolphe Bachelart has announced the release of Voyager Live 9, a brand-new version of the project's desktop Linux distribution featuring a highly customised Xfce desktop with many user-friendly enhancements. This release, based on Debian 9, is built around the Xfce 4.12 desktop, coupled with Linux kernel 4.9.30. The entire Voyager structure has been re-coded and cleaned up, while the scripts have been modified to accommodate the Xfce 4.12 desktop and its components. This is a version which aims to provide the latest Xfce on Debian for both recent and old machines, with new ergonomics which are already part of the (Ubuntu-based) Voyager 16.04.2, as well as new themes, software and scripts. GParted is now included in the live image so users who have a problem using the Debian installer's disk partitioner, can perform manual partitioning before installation. A tutorial is provided in Thunar live in both French and English. Three editions will be available - two x86_64 image with EFI and non-EFI support (labelled as "gpc") and an i686 PAE variant (not yet released at the time of writing)."

Distribution Release: Voyager Live 14.04.4 "X" Rodolphe Bachelart has announced the availability of a new edition of Voyager Live. Voyager "X", based on Voyager 14.04.4 LTS, is an experimental version built around the new Xfce 4.12 desktop which was only recently released. It also includes an updated Linux kernel, version 3.16. The entire layout of the desktop has been recoded and the scripts improved to work with the new Xfce. This is a version whose goal is to bring the latest Xfce and kernel improvements to some of the more recent computer systems. Although Xfce 4.12 is final, it has yet to be integrated into Ubuntu's official repositories; as such, it is considered as experimental. At the moment only a 64-bit ISO image is available for download, with a 32-bit variant possibly coming later if needed. This version of Voyager X has been tested extensively and it can be installed as an "official" Voyager. Xfce 4.12, coupled with Linux kernel 3.16, has made Voyager faster and more responsive, with many parameters optimised for better performance and with much improved hardware support. The release announcement (in French) offers more details and several screenshots. The announcement warns that due to the young nature of Xfce 4.12 and some Voyager features, users should back up their data prior to upgrading to the new release.

Live Art Installations
Ten-dozen musicians, aerial and aquatic dancers, antique ships and explosives experts join up for a naval spectacular.
Pipaluk Supernova is standing on a dock at Langelinie, on the edge of the Copenhagen harbor. It's 10 p.m. "There are five platforms in front of me," she says on the phone. "There are Polish World War II soldiers laying sandbags on one of them. A bunch of World War II soldiers, actually." "Real soldiers?" I ask. "No, dancers dressed as soldiers. On another platform there's a giant aquarium, and there will be dancers in there as well." "We call it the Battle of Copenhagen. But instead of shooting with guns, we'll be shooting with double-bass music." "In scuba gear?" I ask. "No, in beautiful, flowing dresses." "So there's no water in the tank?" I ask. "No, there's water. They will be using breathing techniques." This is a rehearsal, of sorts, for the Battle of Copenhagen, a multimedia spectacular that will occur at the mouth of the harbor on Friday, supported mainly by the Danish Arts Council. Pipaluk Supernova is the choreographer of the seaborne crew of several hundred performers, but in the end, she says, there is plenty of improvisation. "We have the concept, but when it comes down to it, we can really play."
That concept? A musical-historical-pyrotechnic tribute to the eponymous, legendary rout of the Danes by the British Vice Admiral Horatio Nelson in 1801. "We call it the Battle of Copenhagen," composer Andreas Bennetzen says in this recruitment video, "But instead of shooting with guns, we'll be shooting with double-bass music." Over 100 upright bass players will set sail Friday evening on the historical ships that usually lie docked along the quay. In a nod to naval tradition, they will be conducted via nine electronic flag signals—each for a different section of sheet music—and Morse code. Only the three soloists will be amplified. The rest will count on the stillness of the night and their power in numbers. There will also be drag queens, a light show, dancers, and a real Danish reenactment troupe, whose voluntary participation was a pleasant surprise to Supernova. She's drawing loosely on military inspiration, but the reenactors—in accurate, period uniforms—take this history very seriously. "They're bringing their own cannon in a trailer," she says. "They're going to shoot at the ships from the other side." This titanic project began with Bennetzen, a composer and bass player, hoping to write a piece for a large number of bassists. His previous high was 40 basses, in 2005. "One bass on the harbor is beautiful," he says in the video. "But not enough to make headlines." Opportunity knocked in the form of Bass 2012, the third installation of Europe's largest convention for bass players (previously in Paris, in 2008, and Berlin in 2010).
Supernova was intrigued. Her artistic background is dizzyingly diverse—she trained at Marcel Marceau's famous mimodrame school in Paris, and lived in New York, San Francisco, and "with Indians in the jungle," before returning to Copenhagen to choreograph elaborate and ambitious performances like 2009's Submarine Ballet. Her unusual first name is Inuit—she's from Greenland—and her last name she adopted to give a sense of artistic legitimacy to her band, Supernova. Cities are changing fast. Keep up with the CityLab Daily newsletter. The best way to follow issues you care about. Subscribe Loading... From a brainstorming session for Bennetzen's piece, the team emerged with the idea of a naval battle. (“OK, we haven't done that before.”) It seemed obvious that the performance, like previous Live Art Installations projects, ought to take place in situ. “I find very old-fashioned for people to sit in chairs, in a black-box theater,” says Supernova. "Where I'm sitting right now is very historical: Copenhagen harbor where sea battles took place hundreds of years ago. Right in front of me is a crane from 1791." She learned from local historians that there are 7,000 skeletons lying on the bottom of the harbor. "That's quite fascinating. I had never heard that before." "I'm big time in favor of reclaiming the city," she says, "in terms of people who live in the city taking responsibility for their city, making the city theirs instead of taking for granted a bunch of rules that prize efficiency over social interaction." "How long will the performance last?" I ask. "About one-and-a-half hours." "A little faster than your average battle." "A little faster, yeah. But considering the number of double basses, it's probably enough." All images courtesy of Live Art Installations.
The Taliban has attacked targets in different parts of the Afghan capital, Kabul, including a police headquarters in the western part of the city, killing at least 16 people and wounding dozens.
A suicide car bomber on Wednesday struck an Afghan police precinct in western Kabul, the interior ministry said.
Immediately after the blast, gunfire rang out, witnesses told Al Jazeera, in a continuing attack which sent clouds of acrid smoke billowing into the sky.
Shortly after, a suicide bomber blew himself up at the gates of an Afghan intelligence agency branch in eastern Kabul as another attacker was gunned down while trying to enter the compound, according to the ministry.
"Unfortunately, 16 people have been killed in the two attacks in Kabul," said Waheed Majroh, a spokesman for the Afghan health ministry, adding that a further 44 people were wounded.
A Taliban spokesman claimed the group inflicted heavy casualties.

Police sources told Al Jazeera that a suicide car bomber detonated an explosives-laden vehicle next to the police station and near a military training centre.
The explosions were large enough to be heard outside of the city.
The UN Security Council "condemned in the strongest terms the heinous and cowardly terrorist attacks", and urged states to cooperate with Afghan authorities to bring "perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors" of such acts to justice.
Afghan security forces are battling a resurgent Taliban amid record casualties and mass desertions, as the fighters escalate nationwide attacks even in winter months, when the fighting usually wanes.
Repeated bids to launch peace negotiations with the Taliban have failed and an intense new fighting season is expected to kick off in the spring.
Hey you! This Sunday marks the series premiere of Fear the Walking Dead, AMC's new zombie series that bears a striking resemblance to one of the network's other shows: Mad Men. I mean The Walking Dead. But WTF is Fear the Walking Dead and how is it? Come sit on my knee and let me tell you...
All right, so exactly what is Fear the Walking Dead?
It's a spinoff companion piece to the wildly popular The Walking Dead, obviously. But really, it's a way for AMC to capitalize on its moneymaker by offering up more zombies, because zombies equal ratings. Unlike its older cousin, Fear the Walking Dead is not based on any of the comics, so not only will there be no one around to blurt out spoilers, there will be no one around to complain about how the show is different from source material. PHEW! There are six episodes in Season 1, and AMC has already renewed the show for a 15-episode second season premiering next summer, because it knows that people are going to watch no matter how good or bad it is.
Who is involved with the show?
Robert Kirkman, the co-creator of The Walking Dead comics and the show, co-created Fear the Walking Dead with former Sons of Anarchy producer Dave Erickson, who will serve as showrunner. Erickson's other credits include Low Winter Sun and Marco Polo, so uhhh, yeah. Walking Dead producers Gale Ann Hurd and Greg Nicotero are also credited as producers.
When and where is it set?
While The Walking Dead was set in Atlanta and took place several months after the zombie outbreak first turned people into flesh-eating meat bags, Fear brings zombies to the West Coast, specifically Los Angeles. And we join things as the outbreak first breaks out, meaning life is mostly normal for the zombie buffet in the first episode. It's a nice contrast to the backwoods of Georgia.
How does that affect the tone of the series?
Well, there aren't any dirty people running around with shotguns... yet. Instead, Fear the Walking Dead shows off the initial panic of a populace wondering what in the W-T-F is going on. Remember, in the universe of The Walking Dead, people don't have the benefit of zombie movies, meaning all these weirdoes shambling around eating people are total f'ing mysteries. And because it's set in Los Angeles, there's more of an urban feel to the show rather than a bunch of hillbillies wandering around eating squirrels.
Which unlucky characters will we be following this time around?
When Erickson and Kirkman started promoting the show, they sold it as a family drama. I KNOW. But that's exactly what it is, particularly in the first episode. Maddie Clark (Kim Dickens) is a guidance counselor and mother who is engaged to Travis (Cliff Curtis), and they both have kids from previous relationships. Maddie's teen kids are Nick (Frank Dillane), a James Franco-like heroin addict, and Alicia (Alycia Debnam-Carey), a good kid and ambitious student. And Travis' teen son Chris (Lorenzo James Henrie) totally hates Travis for divorcing his mom Liza (Elizabeth Rodriguez). In fact, most of these people sort of hate each other in the first episode, because that's what makes good family drama these days, I guess.
What about the undead, what are they like?
If you've been watching The Walking Dead, then you've probably noticed that the Walkers have been slowly deteriorating over the series' run. Like, some are just barely hanging together by rotting tendons now. In Fear, these monsters are fresh and decomposition is minimal. You'll see some glassy eyes and they lumber around like they've been dead for a while (no speedy 28 Days Later zombies here), but otherwise they are pretty intact.
What did you like about what you saw?
Even though The Walking Dead made a great decision to start things well after the beginning of the outbreak so it could concentrate on stories of survival and post-apocalyptic society, we've all been curious about how everything started. Well... here you go! That paranoid atmosphere really comes through in the second episode, and some of the acting is strong, too, particularly Dickens and Dillane. Oh! And the music is pretty good. It's more of a throbbing, electro-pulse score than the eerie strings of Bear McCreary's score for The Walking Dead. There are some scares, and call me an anarchist misanthrope, but there's something strangely gratifying about watching the world descend into chaos.
What didn't you like about what you saw?
The first episode is steeped in bad family melodrama (of course one of the kids is a drug addict), and there's a bit of a disconnect in watching everyone wonder what is going on when we all know very well what's going on. It's zombies, dummies. Overall, it's a pretty dry approach to the start of a zombie apocalypse and doesn't offer anything you wouldn't expect.
Well, should I watch it?
I liked the second episode a lot more than I liked the first episode, but if you really like The Walking Dead, there's no reason you shouldn't like both. It is, for better and worse, very similar to The Walking Dead in its effectiveness. If you don't like The Walking Dead, then I would stay away because there's nothing that different. People are scared and are trying not to get eaten, basically. (Note: You can watch the series' opening scene here).
And the most important question: Will there be an after-show talk thingy called Talking Fear the Walking Dead or Talking Fear or Fear the Talking Dead or Fearing Talking About Fear the Walking Dead?
No! At least not yet.
Check back Sunday for a full review of the 90-minute premiere from Cory Barker.
Fear the Walking Dead premieres Sunday, August 23 at 9pm on AMC.

Russia is establishing a National Guard force which will be tasked with fighting terrorism and organized crime, the country's President Vladimir Putin has announced.
"The decision has been made, we are establishing a federal body of executive power on the basis of the Interior Ministry Troops," TASS quoted Putin as saying at a meeting with Interior Minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev, Federal Drug Control Service chief Viktor Ivanov and Interior Ministry Troops commander Viktor Zolotov on Tuesday.
The National Guard will perform duties assigned at present to the Special Police Task Force (OMON) and the Special Rapid Response Unit (SOBR), Putin added.
The Russian president also said that the Federal Drug Control Service and the Gederal Migration Service would become subordinate to the Interior Ministry.
Varlamov made 29 saves for his first shutout of the season and 22nd of his NHL career to help the Avalanche to a 4-0 win against the Bruins at TD Garden on Monday.
[WATCH: All Avalanche vs. Bruins highlights]
Nail Yakupov scored two goals, and Sven Andrighetto and J.T. Compher also scored for the Avalanche (2-1-1), who are unbeaten in their past 12 games in Boston (11-0-1). The Bruins' last win at home against the Avalanche was March 30, 1998.

"It's a good start for me. I didn't play for a long time," said Varlamov, who is 2-0-0 after being sidelined for the final 40 games last season and having two hip surgeries, one in January and one in February. "Came back and started the season with two wins. It brings confidence to the team. I thought today we played a very solid game."
Tuukka Rask made 19 saves for the Bruins (1-1-0), who played without center Patrice Bergeron for the second straight game because of a lower-body injury. Andrighetto got the Avalanche on the board at 4:41 of the first period with a wrist shot from the high slot off a pass by Mikko Rantanen.
Compher scored shorthanded at 13:22 for a 2-0 lead. The Bruins outshot the Avalanche 11-5 in the first period but had nothing to show for their efforts.
"We had plenty of time to get back in the game," coach Bruce Cassidy said. "The core group that we rely on just wasn't a good effort, young, old, in between. And clearly put myself in that category. We're supposed to be ready to play at home, especially after a couple days off. So that was the biggest disappointment for me."
Yakupov scored his first goal to give Colorado a 3-0 lead at 6:07 of the third after he won a race to Matt Duchene's clearing pass in Boston's end and fired the puck into the net Rask vacated while attempting to play the puck. Yakupov closed the scoring with an empty-net goal at 19:16.

Goal of the game
Carl Soderberg did yeoman's work to get the puck out of the Colorado zone during a second-period penalty kill and led a 2-on-1 that Compher finished by carrying the puck to the right dot and beating Rask to the short side high.

Save of the game
Varlamov preserved the Avalanche's 2-0 lead 23 seconds into the second period by stopping Matt Beleskey's wrist shot from out high and then thwarting Austin Czarnik's backhand attempt from the right side of the slot on the rebound.
Highlight of the game
Bruins forward David Pastrnak took the puck wide on his backhand to get around Avalanche defenseman Tyson Barrie and went to the net on his forehand early in the second period. Varlamov prevented Pastrnak's shot from going into the net by keeping his left pad down and pinned up against the post. Video review confirmed the no-goal ruling on the ice.

They said it
"I think we are fortunate to be [2-1-0]. In Game 1 we relied on our goalie too much. Game 2, our goalie was great too but we didn't get enough offensive production. But our best game of the road trip was certainly our third. So, to be [2-1-0] and come in to Boston and play a good team, and to be able to get a good solid win, it's a little bit of a sign of maturity growth for our team." -- Avalanche coach Jared Bednar on finishing the season-opening road trip with a winning record
"Yeah, from the first shift everything went the wrong way. But those games happen. The season is long, obviously, and obviously we have to be better. We have to learn what we did wrong and how we can do better the next time." -- Bruins forward David Pastrnak

EshOne on Joe Nice's Gourmet Beats "Zero Zero Eight" 4.2 DUPLOC.COM RATING
Gourmet Beats is steadily becoming one of the imprints you need to be signed on if you want your music to have a certain credibility in the United States. It becomes clear that Joe Nice carefully thought through and prepared the launch and further scheduling of his label. The previous “Los Angeles” EP only has been released short while ago and Gourmet Beats already introduces record number 8 featuring the Poland based EshOne. Affiliated with Artikal Music UK, the chief at Elk Beats is mostly known for his experimental and rather abstract, yet catchy and original productions. By now it is safe to say Gourmet Beats can be described the best as a consistent source for quality dubstep music. Period. GB008 is due to release on the 4th of November 2016.
The White House Drug Czar's office has tumbled through a cascading set of warnings about the dangers of marijuana over the years. The drug that once would fry your brain or lead to heroin addiction has recently been downgraded to a cause of sloth.
The softer ads argue that while it might not kill you, pot will make you a couch potato and a good-for-nothing loser.
Now, the Drug Czar Office (currently run by acting chief Ed Jurith) is going one further: not only will marijuana sink you into hours of wasted time on your couch, you won't even be any good at video games while you're sitting there.
"Getting high affects your brain in ways that may directly influence your gaming ability," warns the Drug Czar's Web site, citing the impairment of "many of the skills required for winning a background, defeating an opponent, [and] beating games."
To dramatize how bad a stoner can be at video games, the site interviews a computer-generated character who laments the demise of a gamer friend of hers. "I used to have a good time with Lyle. We made a good team. He had skill. He had swiftness," she says. "Well, he used to, anyway. Then our last fight, Lyle decided to get high. And it was simply: sayonara skill, sayonara swiftness."
Nearly a year after the project was completed, North Dakota gathered this month to celebrate the Rugby Wind Power Plant. In the tiny town of Rugby, where the population fell 15 percent over the first decade of the new millennium to 2,510, the giddy effect of 17 full-time permanent jobs — in addition to 149 megawatts (MW) of wind power — apparently lingers.
At the event, U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.) captured the belief that wind represents a huge economic opportunity for the prairie state. “North Dakota truly is the Saudi Arabia of wind energy potential,” he said, “and the growth we're seeing in wind energy in North Dakota means more jobs creation, economic development and a cleaner environment.”
The wind farm is about the biggest thing to hit Rugby since the town laid claim — dubiously, it appears — to the title “Geographical Center of North America” in 1932. Over the course of construction, some 250 workers were employed at the site. Iberdrola said that in addition to those temporary jobs and the 17 permanent ones, the wind project contributes about $2 million annually in the form of landowner lease payments and property taxes.
The plant is made up of 71 new Suzlon S88 turbines, each capable of generating 2.1 MW turbines of electricity. Missouri River Energy Services gobbles up nearly a quarter of the energy to power 11,000 homes in the upper Midwest, while Iberdrola markets the remaining energy.

‘Ah, beware of snobbery,' said Cary Grant, who was surprisingly often the smartest guy in the room. ‘It is the unwelcome recognition of one's own past failings.'
In Britain, the only place where true toffs abide and, let's face it, the place where modern snobbery was most successfully codified, it is still a more powerful force than we like to acknowledge.
Brexit was a comedy of the thwarted snobbery of the right and left. A referendum was organised by a Remainer toff who assumed he would win because, well, he was a toff. He was, in the event, comprehensively defeated and deposed. Meanwhile, the even more fervently Remainer middle-class bien–pensants, who sincerely believed they spoke for the working classes and who said they wanted to hear their voice, turned out to be fabulously deluded when they did.
By doing the ‘wrong' thing by the standards of their ‘superiors', only the working classes left the stage with their dignity intact. As the curtain fell all were agreed — this one will run and run.
The toffs have now retreated to plot against Theresa May, their unexpectedly ruthless and irretrievably grammar-school nemesis. American and British middle-class bien-pensants told themselves a deliriously condescending tale about how the (unstatedly ignorant) workers had been misled by the lies of the Brexiters.
The losing half the population regarded the winning half with pity and, more often, disdain. This was a class matter: suddenly it was OK to believe that there was something fundamentally wrong with people worse off than you. Snobbery was respectable again; a dangerous development.
In 2011 that hero of the new left, Owen Jones, wrote a book called Chavs: the Demonisation of the Working Class. It made many fair points; Jones was rightly outraged by inequality and the class scorn the chav classes have endured. But the Brexit vote made an even fairer point — those who aspired to care for the workers had failed and would, thanks to the Corbynism which Jones supported, continue to do so.
To see Brexit in terms of class is to root it firmly in British soil. Class is the tribal system to which we still cling. In America, money decides the hierarchy. In France, intellectual status. A form of snobbery is involved in all such systems. Snobbery in its most harmless form involves what Sigmund Freud called the ‘narcissism of minor differences' — pathetic little status badges like a billion more dollars, an acquaintance who once met Bernard-Henri Lévy or the wearing of creepy black velvet slippers at dinner. Freud decided this was not something to worry too much about.
‘We can now see,' he wrote in Civilisation and its Discontents (1930), ‘that it is a convenient and relatively harmless satisfaction of the inclination to aggression, by means of which cohesion between the members of the community is made easier.'
Freud said that without the narcissism of minor differences — petty snobbery in essence — we might fight each other. But British snobbery is different. It is highly specific and highly significant, not to say vicious. The assorted minor-difference watchers — design freaks, fashion fuckwits and comedians — should not lull you into thinking real snobbery is a frivolous matter. Alain de Botton, in his book Status Anxiety, gets this right, not least by pointing out that in the 1820s the word ‘snob' emerged from Oxbridge, where colleges often wrote ‘s.nob', short for ‘sine nobilitate' — without nobility.
‘In the word's earliest days,' writes de Botton, ‘a snob was taken to mean someone without high status, but it quickly assumed its modern and almost diametrically opposed meaning: someone offended by a lack of high status in others, a person who believes in a flawless equation between social rank and human worth.'
There it is — the moral point. An accident of birth, to the true snob, is not, in fact, an accident. You are, from the womb, imprinted with a grandeur and a value unavailable to the rest of us. We may speak of the virtues of aspiration, of hard work, of getting on, but however much you may strive, you will never be so imprinted.
Obviously there is no material sign that any such imprinting process occurs. This is an extreme superstition which is clung to by some people all the time and which is embraced by many more when their cherished beliefs are offended. The British, under pressure, default to snobbery.
My own theory as to why this may be lies in cultural history. We are taught that our morality and culture derive ultimately from classical Greece, that from Athens to us is, as William Golding once put it, ‘the right line of history'. Toffs, in particular, love this idea — Boris Johnson, for instance, positively wallows in it.
I have always found this notion bizarre in the extreme, not to say plainly wrong. Greek philosophy and drama is a self-help guide for the Athenian elite. As the philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre has pointed out, Aristotle's ponderings on ethics and politics were written from a position of rank snobbery — he had no concern for, MacIntyre says, women, slaves, servants, farmers, fishermen or anybody who actually made anything.
The reality is that the much more inclusive ethics and morality of western liberalism descend not from Greece but from the Sermon on the Mount filtered through the Enlightenment. And what did Jesus say? He said the meek, the poor and the hungry mattered, that all apparent differences in wealth and status were levelled in and by the sight of God.
In defiance of the culture from which their privileges spring, real snobs believe that this is false, that superiority and inferiority are in-born. Even occasional snobs, hobby snobs, betray traces of this belief; it is, in fact, built into the meaning of the word. This is now being further reinforced by a technocratic society that eschews all metaphysical valuations. And equality — this is something the left should learn — is necessarily a metaphysical value, because physically we are definitely not equal. There has to be a leap of faith even in the making of a secular, liberal society.
Full-blooded snobbery is what we should look out for. It is this form of snobbery that, stripping away all the comedy, the narcissism of minor differences and the politics, still exists poisonously in British society and which lately seems to have been given a new lease of life, first by the rise of the toffs to power under Cameron and now by the post-referendum conviction there is some inherent flaw in those who voted to leave.
The more you notice snobbery, the more you discover and the more revolting it becomes. In a censorious age, we selectively protect minorities from our most vehement impulses. Racism and sexism are forbidden (ageism, disgracefully, is not). Snobbery is exactly like racism in that it judges us not for what we say or do but for what we most unalterably are. Snobbery, in short, is often funny but always evil.
The Unity Labs team is experimenting with bringing film-quality assets, designed for maximum fidelity but non-realtime rendering, into the 60+ FPS world with Unity. Since film and TV formats and pipelines (such as Ptex, USD & UDIM) are not widely supported in realtime engines, working with these assets requires new techniques and tools. Beyond the obvious issues with the size and density of these assets, there can often be a large number of materials and texture files involved with a single asset (such as the case with UDIM), which we'll need to easily interact with and modify. To streamline this workflow, we've created a new Multi-material Editor to help manage and interact with all these materials.
UDIM and other multi-tiled UV mapping techniques are not a new file type, but a pipeline for UVing and a set of conventions for naming source texture files. These multi-tiled UV mapping techniques can increase the number of materials beyond what is reasonable to simultaneously edit and keep in sync with the current material inspector, and multi-selecting materials every time is not very practical.
In the Multi-material Editor, we assume that the individual tiles have their own material assignment from the source asset, which is the most common pipeline. If that's not the case in your pipeline, you could use a custom mesh importer to break the mesh up into individual submeshes with corresponding materials at asset import time.
Getting Started
Download the Multi-material Editor. To install, simply create a project in Unity 5.5 or newer. Then add this repo in the assets folder of your project. There are 2 new scriptable object types that can be accessed by right-clicking in the project view in the Create menu.
Material Texture Settings is under Create > Multi Material > Material Texture Settings and can be used to assign textures to UDIM materials. The custom inspector is able to apply the texture setting to selected materials and assumes the material and texture are named according to UDIM conventions. Texture Name is the material property name of the texture field and Search Dir is the directory that contains the textures for that material property. Multi Material Data is under Create > Multi Material > Multi Material Data and holds an array of Materials for use in Multi Material Component or you can directly modify the materials from the scriptable object's inspector.
The Multi-material Component can be added to a game object to control the Shared Materials array in the object's renderer. If a Multi Material Data is created from the render, or assigned from the project, that data can be modified here. This can be useful if you have multiple objects that share a group of materials that need to be modified at once.
About the Tool
We need the tool to allow us to interact with multiple materials on an object or across objects as if they were only one material, except for the case of texture assignment. To allow the most options, we split the material data out into its own class so it could be created and serialized on a component based on the object's renderer, or saved as an asset in a scriptable object, to be shared across multiple objects. We then built a custom inspector for viewing all the materials within this single custom inspector using a separate custom drawer class. This uses the standard material inspector, but also supports any custom material inspectors you may be using.
Materials, and the Unity Standard Shader in particular, use custom UI with logic built into the inspector, so we are unable to just use the standard Property Drawers for a material's serialized properties. This means that to interact with a material in a meaningful way we need to use the Material Editor Inspector within our custom inspector. It is possible to insert the drawing of an editor (with its public GUI methods) inside of another editor or EditorWindow if we create and manage that inserted editor. In the Multi-material Editor, the MaterialArrayDrawers class lets us do just that with the Material Editor as seen in the MultiMaterialEditor and MultiMaterialDataEditor. The coding pattern used for this editor can also be used in other cases where you want to draw an inspector within another editor, which can be useful if you want to draw a custom inspector for a Scriptable Object directly in a component that uses that object.
There are some important things to keep in mind both for performance and interaction limitations in the Material Editor when trying to draw it inside another editor's OnInspectorGUI. First, the header GUI can change the layout and rect context you set in the inspector. Also if the header contains any controls (for example, the shader menu), you cannot detect changes in that control with BeginChangeCheck and EndChangeCheck. This means we are not able to sync the changes on the shader selection when they happen. To keep the shaders in sync, we recreate the material header as close as possible with DrawMaterialHeaderMaterialView(). Note the isVisibleField where we have to reflect into the material editor to show the body of the editor, and ShaderPopup, where we try to replicate internal editor drawing styles but are not able to display the Unity internal shaders unless they are already loaded.
Second, since we are drawing the whole Material Editor's OnInspectorGUI(), we do not know what property drawer has changed, just that something in the OnInspectorGUI() block changed. This means there are potential changes anywhere in the material that could need to be synced to the other materials. If we continuously sync all the properties of even a small array of materials with an interactive control like a color picker, we can significantly impact performance.
Therefore for best performance when syncing materials, we need a way to only change the properties that have been modified. We do a quick compare between the actively modified material and the first different material in our Multi-material, and only cache those serialized properties that are different—except textures—between the two materials. Then we only apply those cached changes to all of the other materials. Unfortunately, you can get some false positives if you have materials that are greatly different, or it can miss the change if it happens to match the compared material. As a workaround, we have added a Sync to Material button on the active material which copies all the properties across the Multi Material.
The Multi-material and its editors show how you can customize Unity's UI for specific workflows you may want or need on your project. Some future areas to explore are building some more generic drawers to display multiple editors inside another component's inspector, filtering Serialized Properties you want to sync (eg. not just ignoring textures), and handling animated materials and/or runtime-scripted interaction with the Multi-material.
The Redskins' new head of personnel has made his feelings clear about Kirk Cousins, and he wants the quarterback in Washington for the long haul.
"In the worst way," senior vice president of player personnel Doug Williams told NFL Network's Steve Wyche on Up To The Minute Live on Friday. "Let's face this thing, the last two years, Kirk Cousins has had tremendous years. And one thing in this league that's hard to find is that guy to run the football team and Kirk does a tremendous job doing that. And with the weapons that he has and the offensive line that he has and I think our defense is a little better than what we were last year, quite naturally you want Kirk Cousins as quarterback."
Williams said that negotiations have already been going on between Cousins and team officials and that he won't stick his head into administrative matters. That didn't stop him from making a sales pitch.
"All I can do is hope and pray that Kirk looks at the big picture and looks at this football team and realizes we do have a pretty solid football team, solid offensive line, he's got something to work with," Williams said. "Having said that, [vice president of football administration] Eric Schaffer and [president Bruce Allen] have been on this negotiation for a long time. I think it's unfair for me to stick my head into it at this time. Now, I'm aware of what's going on, but as far as my two cents into it and talking to Kirk and what have you, I think I have to step back from that."
The interview is well worth your time, diving into what alternative route the Redskins might take if Cousins brings his talent to the free agent market. It's highly unlikely the Redskins would franchise Cousins for a third straight season, guaranteeing Cousins almost $35 million for one year of play -- an insane amount of money that would earn Cousins roughly $10 million more than Colts quarterback Andrew Luck makes in a year.
Williams mentions 30-year-old backup Colt McCoy as a potential placeholder or "long distance" starter in the future.
"If that doesn't happen, if Kirk doesn't sign a long-term contract -- which I hope he does -- that tells if not, we gotta go to work," Williams said. "We gotta search long and hard to find that guy. But at the same time, we got a capable backup here in Colt McCoy, who can hold the fort down for a while or even take it the long distance."
Williams is wisely putting some distance between himself and whatever is happening between Cousins and management. In the new collaborative Redskins front office, it seems like Williams is content to stay in his lane of acquiring, developing and selecting players -- one that will become extremely challenging if Cousins ends up elsewhere next season.
The Federal Reserve values U.S. real estate at an estimated $40 trillion, making it the largest asset class in the country. So it shouldn't surprise us that, as TechCrunch recently reported, in the last quarter of 2014, venture funding of real estate tech firms reached nearly $300 million.
Venture capital firms that back the likes of Uber, Instagram and Buzzfeed are pouring money into rising tech startups. Residential listing and brokerage app Compass (formerly known as Urban Compass) was recently valued at $800 million and has lured top talent from tech giants like Google and Twitter. Redfin reinvented real estate brokerage by combining advanced technology with full-service brokers and raised $71 million in their latest round. And while there has been significant progress in commercial (and even single-family) real estate technology, with companies like Compass, Hightower, CompStak and Redfin, to name a few, there are still big gaps in certain areas, and problems to be solved.
Technology in the multifamily real estate sector has been particularly lagging, despite growing at an immense pace. The sector contributes more than $1.3 trillion to the national economy annually in the form of jobs, construction, management, operational expenditures and renter spend in local communities. In addition, Americans are increasingly choosing rental housing as the number of married couples with children decreases dramatically, baby boomers begin to downsize and move to apartments or condos and millennials choose to be renters for mobility, comfort and financial reasons. By 2023, more than four million new renter households will be created; by 2030, nearly three-quarters of households will be childless.
This landscape accounts for the surge in new rental listing sites, such as Apartment List, that compete with established players like ApartmentGuide.com, Zillow, Apartments.com, Rent.com and more.
But if renting is the new owning, why are we still writing a personal check to pay our rent in 2015? Research shows that 78 percent of renters prefer to pay their rent electronically, yet the industry as a whole is still only collecting about 30 percent of its payments online. This is symptomatic of a sector of the real estate industry that hasn't quite caught up to the increasing demands for these types of functionalities and amenities.
Why are we still writing a personal check to pay our rent in 2015?
Similar problems exist in multifamily reporting, data analysis and cybersecurity. Multifamily owners, operators and vendors capture online and within their property management systems a massive amount of information about the preferences of their renters and the efficiencies of their operations that can be used to address myriad issues. Yet, in most cases, the data is stored in multiple, disparate systems that make it difficult to conduct meaningful analysis. Existing systems also open users to increased security risks because of the sheer scale of information stored in several systems that each perform different functions.
While I would love to say that tech in the multifamily real estate sector is booming, the fact is that progress and competition is fairly stagnant and the space is thirsty for tech innovations. The key to bringing multifamily real estate up to speed with commercial real estate is simply more comprehensive and open-source solutions.
Research shows that consumers who rent crave online resources: 60.1 percent of all renters used a smartphone or tablet during their recent search, and 68.2 percent of renters searched for their apartment/home extensively online before visiting the property in person. That said, almost 90 percent of respondents still feel it's important to view the property in person before they make their final decision. This opens up the possibilities for revolutionary technology in drones, 3D and even virtual reality technologies.
Anyone will agree that the entire process of leasing and buying property will eventually take place digitally — from online documentation and payments to automated agent selection and virtual home selection. The direction we're headed is pretty clear; it's just a matter of how fast we intend to get there.
Police in Northern Ireland have charged two men with a number of offences after a fire engine was stolen and taken on a joyride in Larne, Co Antrim on Saturday.
One man (19) faces charges including burglary and dangerous driving and the second man (66) been charged with five offences including burglary and aggravated vehicle taking causing damage to property, according to the PSNI.
The incident occurred in the early hours of Saturday and significant damage was caused to a number of cars and house in the Glenarm Road area of Larne.
A spokesman for the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service (NIFRS) condemned those behind the attack. “At approximately 4.30am (on Saturday) morning, Larne station was broken into and a fire engine was stolen,” said fire chief Kevin O'Neill.
“Subsequently, this fire engine was driven into a number of cars and houses in the Larne Area.
“This incident is ongoing and there are currently no reports of any injuries at the scene. The station was damaged during the break in and NIFRS have initiated their business continuity arrangements to ensure fire cover is maintained within the Larne area.”
DUP MLA Gordon Lyons said: “Breaking into a fire station and stealing a fire engine shows a clear disregard for the people of Larne and those who serve in the fire service.
“But to drive it around the town and create mayhem along the way demonstrates just how low some people are prepared to stoop.
“I am thankful that no one was hurt or killed, however this was an extremely stupid and dangerous thing to do. As a result, the scene on the Glenarm Road this morning looks like something out of an action film and the people responsible have caused thousands of pounds worth of damage.
“They need to understand the consequences and seriousness of their actions and I hope that the police ensure that happens.”
The two men are to to appear at Coleraine Magistrates' Court on Monday.
Four persons were charred to death and more than 30 injured when an oil tanker turned turtle and exploded on NH 37 in Assam's Golaghat district late Monday night.
The driver of the oil tanker, bound for Upper Assam's Digboi from Guwahati, reportedly lost control of the vehicle which overturned near Rangaliting tea estate under Dergaon police station, a police officer said.
The tanker exploded resulting in oil leakage and a devastating fire which led to the death of three persons on the spot, while another succumbed to his injuries in the hospital today, the official said.
At least nine houses, mostly belonging to tea garden labourers near the highway, were completely gutted in the fire.
The dead include an elderly couple and a nine-year-old girl, the police officer said.
Meanwhile, Assam agriculture minister Atul Bora visited the area and announced an ex-gratia of Rs four lakh to the next of kin of the deceased, a government official said.

But there are some special circumstances to this particular commodity.
Until now, the retail price of cannabis has remained steady even as the commodity's wholesale price—that is, the price growers receive from retail dispensaries—has steadily dropped over the past five years.
But that's in the context of a market just beginning, still subject to myriad state and local restrictions, and generally preceded by the special circumstances of the medical-marijuana economy.
However, if five states legalize recreational cannabis for adults on Election Day, the number of Americans living in states where no medical recommendation is necessary to buy cannabis would triple overnight.
Let's look at California. A suddenly much-larger new market (that is, once the legislature works out the adult-sale machinery) might create a logjam in supply, raising prices. But so many large-scale farms have been readied for legalization that that shouldn't happen. Evidence of this trend can be found around the state, as rural areas with weak economies permit bigger and bigger grow sites.
The real price plunge will come for consumers who've been buying it on the illegal market. The price of pot has always been artificially inflated—thanks to Prohibition. For decades, the plant was grown, harvested, processed, shipped, and sold in—at best—a legal gray area. Any black-market commodity carries a black-market markup. As cannabis becomes legal, economists and observers agree, that premium will evaporate, and the price will drop.
With that artificial tariff gone, and all sorts of new actors entering the business, cannabis should become a buyer's paradise, with a glut of supply. And as the San Francisco Chronicle observed, that could mean an absolute crash in the price of cannabis for producers and retailers alike.
Just how far the price of marijuana will drop is an open question. Some growers pegged the hit to their bottom line at 30 to 40 percent; they may pray for such a minor hit if the 2010 estimate given by the RAND Corporation–90 percent below the then-current illegal-market price–comes true.
Other states have seen wild fluctuations in the price of pot—but this was thanks in part to constricted supply. Cannabis prices in Washington were as high as $25 a gram or more before most cultivation centers came online; prices now have stabilized to around $10 a gram earlier this year—that same magic $35-to-$40 figure—to as low as $3 a gram, the Chronicle reported.
Or even lower than that. That 2010 RAND study guessed that the cost of producing a pound of cannabis could drop to between $150 and $300. Compare that to wholesale prices of $1,000 (or less) to $2,500 for top-shelf, and it's easy to see room for a massive price crash.
That said, cannabis is labor intensive, and some of the human toll is baked into the cost of the finished product. Top-shelf buds will likely never be machine-trimmed, as the rough handling shakes loose too many trichomes and terpenes. There will be also be a market for mass-produced cheap cannabis. Just how big either market will be remains to be seen.
As the Chronicle noted, we might see companies turn toward “higher-margin, value-added, highly processed goods” for special clienteles.
But if the crowd-sourced data on websites like Priceofweed.com is accurate, the great price crash is already happening. Users report purchasing high-quality ounces for as little as $100.
The alcohol comparison is beat to death, but look for something similar to what happens to other legal agricultural commodities. Plants with high yields that are easy to grow—think: Blue Dream—will almost certainly come cheaper, while tricky, finicky plants with small yields—thin and spindly sativas like Jack Herer and Sour Diesel—will be more dear.
Either way, you'll stop paying black-market prices to black-market people.
A consortium consisting of China-based Dakang Australia Holdings Dakang and Australian Rural Capital Ltd. dropped their $281.3 million (U.S.) bid this week after missing a crucial deadline in their second attempt to acquire S. Kidman & Co., Australia's largest private landowner and one of the world's largest cattle ranches.
On April 15, Australia's treasurer Scott Morrison extended the review period for the application in order to sufficiently consider the “complex case.” On April 29, however, he expressed concern regarding the deal and gave the two companies a deadline to respond.
“Given the size and significance of the Kidman portfolio, I am concerned that the acquisition of an 80% interest in S. Kidman & Co. Ltd. by Dakang Australia Holdings Pty Ltd. (Dakang) may be contrary to the national interest. I have today made my concerns known to the applicant and provided them with a natural justice period in which they may respond and consider how they wish to proceed,” Morrison said in a statement that gave the applicant until May 3 to respond.
Morrison expressed concern over the ranch selling as a single composite property asset, saying it was not in the national interest. “I am not yet satisfied these concerns have been addressed by the revised proposal that has been submitted to me,” he said.
Additionally, he said a review found that significant domestic interest in the ranch remains. “The size of the asset makes it difficult for any single Australian group to acquire the entire operation."
Kidman managing director Greg Campbell told Xinhua news agency that the tight timelines meant that withdrawing the foreign investment review board application and terminating the bid implementation agreement was really the only option available.
"Kidman is typical of many large agricultural pastoral holdings in that the value of the business comes from the strategic advantage in having a geographically spread portfolio of properties," Campbell said.
"A breakup of the business to sell properties separately would result in significant reduction in Kidman's value, reduced production of up to 3,000 (metric tons) of beef per annum, the loss of 50 jobs from the present structure and lower tax revenue for the country," he added.
Kidman holds approximately 1.3% of Australia's total land area and 2.5% of Australia's agricultural land. It has 10 cattle stations, including properties across regional South Australia, Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland covering 101,411 sq. km. Additionally, the company has managed a long-term average herd of 185,000 cattle.
Mobileye's Road Experience Management (REM) platform scored another big win today: Signing up Nissan, the third major automaker to enter an agreement with the company to help build and use its high-precision road maps, which are updated in real time using anonymized, crowdsourced data from cars on the road.
Nissan joins BMW and Volkswagen as REM platform members, and will both use the Global RoadBook maps that result from Mobileye's system to help its own vehicles navigate and to add redundancy to its forthcoming autonomous driving software. Nissan vehicles will also help contribute to the pool of collective crowdsourced data, which is big for REM because the more vehicles participating, the better the quality of the real-time data that updates the maps across the fleet as soon as changes happen on the road.
Nissan had already been working with Mobileye and REM, with a pilot that extended into Nissan's London-based self-driving tech demonstrations. REM isn't the only collab between the two companies, either – Nissan uses Mobileye tech in its ProPILOT ADAS system, for instance.
Mobileye and future owner Intel must be even happier about this new deal, however – with each new automaker that sings up for REM, the platform becomes an even more attractive component for other car companies, and approaches the status of ‘industry standard' for autonomous vehicle operation.

Many areas of scientific research -- Earth's weather, ocean currents, the outpouring of magnetic energy from the sun -- require mapping out the large scale features of a complex system and its intricate details simultaneously.Describing such systems accurately, relies on numerous kinds of input, beginning with observations of the system, incorporating mathematical equations to approximate those observations, running computer simulations to attempt to replicate observations, and cycling back through all the steps to refine and improve the models until they jibe with what's seen. Ultimately, the models successfully help scientists describe, and even predict, how the system works.Understanding the sun and how the material and energy it sends out affects the solar system is crucial, since it creates a dynamic space weather system that can disrupt human technology in space such as communications and global positioning system (GPS) satellites.However, the sun and its prodigious stream of solar particles, called the solar wind, can be particularly tricky to model since as the material streams to the outer reaches of the solar system it carries along its own magnetic fields. The magnetic forces add an extra set of laws to incorporate when trying to determine what's governing the movement. Indeed, until now, equations for certain aspects of the solar wind have never been successfully devised to correlate to the observations seen by instruments in space. Now, for the first time, a scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., has created a set of the necessary equations, published in Physical Review Letters on Dec. 4, 2012."Since the 1970s, scientists have known that movement in the solar wind often has the characteristics of a kind of wave called an Alfvén wave," says Aaron Roberts, a space scientist at Goddard. "Imagine you have a jump rope and you wiggle one end so that it sends waves down the rope. Alfvén waves are similar, but the moving rope is a magnetic field line itself."The Alfvén waves in this case tended to have great consistency in height -- or amplitude, which is the common term when talking about waves -- but they are random in direction. You might think of it like a jump rope twirling, always the same distance from center, but nonetheless able to be in many places in space. Another way scientists have envisioned the waves is as a "random walk on a sphere." Again, always the same distance from a given center, but with a variable placement.Such metaphorical descriptions are based on what instruments in space have, in fact, observed when they see magnetic waves go by in the solar wind. But it turns out that the equations to describe this kind of movement -- equations necessary to advance scientific models of the entire system -- were not easily found."The puzzle has been to figure out why the amplitude is so constant," says Roberts. "But it's been very difficult to find equations that satisfy all the characteristics of the magnetic field."Similar waves are, in fact, seen in light, known as polarized waves. But magnetic fields have additional constraints on what shapes and configurations are even possible. Roberts found a way to overlap numerous waves of different wavelengths in such a way that they ultimately made the variation in amplitude as small as possible.To his surprise, the equations Roberts devised matched what was observed more closely than he'd expected. Not only did the equations show waves of constant amplitude, but they also showed occasional random jumps and sharp changes -- an unexplained feature seen in the observations themselves."Overlapping the waves in this way gives us a way of writing down equations that we didn't have before," says Roberts. "It also has this nice consequence that it is more realistic than we expected, since it shows discontinuities we actually see in the wind. This is important for simulations and models where we want to start with initial conditions that are as close to the observed solar wind as we can get."Of course, having an equation doesn't yet tell us the reason why the waves in the solar wind are shaped in this way. Nonetheless, equations that describe how the waves move open the door to increasingly accurate simulations that may well help explain such causes. By alternately improving models and improving observations, scientists continue the cyclic nature of such research, until just what physical action on the sun causes these curiously-shaped Alfvén waves someday becomes clear.
Samsung is good at a lot of things. It makes great products that consumers have been loving for the past few years, it certainly isn't afraid to experiment in order to get things right, and it certainly knows how to make excellent use of its massive marketing budget, which now reaches well into the double-digit billions annually. Software has never been the company's strong suit though, and its devices are regularly characterized by feature spam. Samsung is working to change that trend, but to really build new software and services that offer more value and better experiences for users, the company knows it will need some outside help.
The Wall Street Journal on Monday evening ran a report based on an internal document it claims to have obtained. The M&A document is said to be part of a presentation prepared earlier this year by Samsung's Media Solution Center, and it apparently details a number of companies that Samsung may look to acquire in Silicon Valley where it recently opened new offices as well as in the surrounding region and in Israel.
Among the companies said to be on Samsung's radar at the time the document was created are Unity Technologies, a San Francisco-based gaming platform developer; Glympse, a location-based services provider; and Everything.me, an Israeli mobile search company. Samsung has reportedly also reportedly considered buying all or part of Atari, which recently auctioned off several components of its business after filing for bankruptcy.
According to WSJ's report, Samsung currently has $1.1 billion allocated for startup and venture capital investments in America.
PHILADELPHIA -- You only get one first impression in life -- and it seems like Eagles rookie Carson Wentz is making the most of his.
Wentz has only been in Philadelphia for a little under two weeks, and has been with his veterans even less time than that, but after just a few practices, the quarterback is already impressing his new teammates.
"He's awesome," receiver Josh Huff said. "Strong arm, mobile, throws an accurate ball."
History says Wentz will start ... soon
Wentz has had just a handful of practices with the veterans, and although only one was open to the media, it is easy to see why he has made a good first impression.
The rookie from North Dakota State looked very comfortable out on the field with his teammates, and it was clear watching him move and throw the ball why the Eagles traded up to the No. 2 pick to get him.
Although the pads weren't on, and the team mostly did seven-on-seven drills, Wentz looked very sharp during the practice open to the media, and moved well around on the pocket.
On one play the rookie broke the pocket to his right, getting to the sideline before rocketing a pass about 15 yards down the field for a completion.
"He is definitely a gunslinger," tight end Zach Ertz said. "He has a live arm, he throws a good spiral, it's easy to catch."
Catching is something the Eagles' receivers struggled with last season. While they certainly hold plenty of blame for the drops, you have to wonder how much of the blame also falls on veteran quarterback Sam Bradford.
Bradford has had issues with his receivers dropping passes throughout his career, from his time in St. Louis to his one season with the Eagles. The fact that multiple teammates of Bradford have pointed out how catchable Wentz's passes are is certainly interesting.
Even during the open practice last week, a few of his passes were dropped by his receivers. On one drill, with Bradford and Wentz standing next to each other, Wentz's pass was caught while Bradford's was dropped.
Another potential difference between Bradford and Wentz?
8 reasons to be concerned about the Eagles
"He is aggressive," receiver Reuben Randle said of Wentz. "I heard about it from the rookie camp, that he was taking his shots. He took a shot (during practice) that we weren't expecting. He gives us a shot to make a play. You have to love that from a quarterback. He trusts his playmakers outside to make a play for him, and I like that about him."
Taking shots down the field was something Bradford didn't do much of last season, and he completed even less. Only 60 of his 346 completions went for 10 yards or more, one of the worst rates in the NFL among starting quarterbacks.
Whether Wentz will continue to take shots down the field when he actually steps into an NFL game remains to be seen. When he will even play also remains a mystery.
One message, however, is clear from his teammates.
"When (Wentz's) time comes," Ertz said, "it's going to be an unbelievable time for us."

I'm developing a Windows packet capture software called Npcap. And it needs to send loopback raw IP sockets based on Windows Kernel. But the WskSocket->Dispatch->WskSendTo always causes DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL BSOD on Win7 SP1. The strange thing is that my code doesn't trigger this BSoD on other systems like Win8, Win10. It only happens on Win7. So I even doubt that is this a bug of Windows itself or only my bug? Thanks!
The reproduce steps are:
Install Npcap 0.07 r17 with default options Install Nmap 7.20 Beta 5 (don't install the shipped Npcap) In CMD, run nmap -v -O -6 localhost to perform a localhost scan (this functionality is provided by Npcap), you will encounter the BSoD in a couple of seconds. If you want the faulty driver's debug symbols, it can be downloaded here. Refer to
pcap-DebugSymbols\win7\x64
pcap.pdb for x64 system and
pcap-DebugSymbols\win7\x86
pcap.pdb for x86 system.

The Baloch are the majority ethnic inhabitants of the region of Balochistan in Iran. They speak Rakhshani Balochi, an Iranian language.
Approximately 25 percent of the Baloch population lives in Iran: media reports indicate there are 1.5 million Baloch in Iran. The utter vast majority of the Baloch population reside in Pakistan, and a significant number i.e. 600,000 reside in southern Afghanistan.
In Iran, the Baloch are divided into two groups: the Sarhadi and the Makorani. The cities such as Iranshahr, Chabahar, Nikshahr, Sarbaz, and Saravan are known as the Makoran region, while Zahedan and Khash are known as Sarhad region.
The government of Iran has been trying to reverse this situation by implementing new plans such as the creation of the Chabahar Free Trade Zone.

(Reuters) - McKesson Corp, one of the largest U.S. distributors of pharmaceutical drugs, will pay a record $150 million to resolve a U.S. investigation into whether it failed to report suspicious orders of addictive painkillers.
Tuesday's deal with the U.S. Justice Department followed an earlier settlement with the company over similar violations in 2008. The latest accord came as U.S. authorities continue to grapple with the nation's opioid drug epidemic.
“The consequences of McKesson's decision to circumvent its obligations are too devastating to ignore and warrant today's punishment,” New Jersey U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman, whose office was involved in the deal, said in a statement.
Under the settlement, San Francisco-based McKesson must on a staggered basis suspend sales of controlled substances from distribution centers in Colorado, Ohio, Michigan and Florida for several years.
It will also be subject to new and enhanced compliance obligations and be required to hire an independent monitor to assess compliance, a first of its kind arrangement under a Controlled Substances Act civil penalty settlement.
McKesson in a statement said it has implemented significant changes to its monitoring and reporting processes and was committed to combating prescription drug diversion and abuse.
“We are committed to tackling this multi-faceted problem in collaboration with all parties in the supply chain that share the responsibility for the distribution of opioid medications,” McKesson Chief Executive Officer John Hammergren said in a statement.
Each day about 78 Americans die of an opioid overdose, according to authorities. Oxycodone, a big source of profit for drug dealers, is abused by over 13 million Americans annually, prosecutors say.
Tuesday's accord came after McKesson in 2008 reached a $13.25 million settlement resolving claims that it failed to design and implement an effective system to detect and report suspiciously large or frequent orders.
The Justice Department said that following that deal, from 2008 until 2013, McKesson supplied various pharmacies an increasing amount of oxycodone and hydrocodone pills, both opioid drugs that are frequently misused.
The Justice Department said the evidence showed that McKesson did not fully implement or adhere to its own compliance program designed after the 2008 settlement.
As one example, the Justice Department said that in Colorado, McKesson processed over 1.6 million orders for controlled substances from June 2008 through May 2013, yet only reported 16 as suspicious.
I have converted many users, including my wife, to Linux in the past 10 years and and I am still going strong. If you do it right, Linux will do a better job for your users than Mac OS X or Windows … if you do it right.
Harvey Dent: Two sides of Linux advocacy
There are two ways of converting a user to Linux. The first to format a user's computer without investing time in learning what the PC is used for, with the assumption that you know best, and then install your own favorite apps and tell the user to use them. When the user complains he can't do such-and-such thing anymore, you respond: “why do you need to do that; do this instead.” The result? The user goes back to his or her former operating system, with not-so-fond memories of Linux.
The second way is to first invest time in carefully identifying the user's needs and then decide whether Linux really is right for that user.
I have actually refrained from converting a few users to Linux after realizing their heavy reliance on some particular software or services that were not yet available for Linux. To them, a PC was just a means to do a particular job and in those cases the job at hand was more important than the OS.
Aggressively forcing those users to switch to Linux would only do more harm than good.
Why so serious? Let's put a smile on that face
I have a simple conversion strategy. First get the users comfortable with the tools, applications or services they will be using under Linux. I have a very good use case where I deployed this strategy. When I lived in Garmisch Germany, my best buddy there (and he still is my best friend) was an Irishman named Dominic Kennedy who happened to be a Windows user.
The good news was that he was on the fence: he had heard about Linux and was willing to give it a try. However we had to get him comfortable with Linux so that he didn't have to relearn everything. My strategy is called ‘how to change all four tires of your car without getting your hands dirty'. You guessed it right, you replace one tire at a time.
In most cases, open source applications do a much better job than their proprietary counterparts in consumer as well as professional space. The first thing I did was to understand what Dominic was doing on his computer, and which applications he was using. I invested time in understanding his usage of each application. Once I had that knowledge I started replacing those applications with open source ones on his current system. Keep in mind I don't start with OS replacement, I start off with applications.
Why? You will see later.
I replaced Internet Explorer (yes there are people who still use Internet Explorer) with Chrome and Firefox, and explained to him the advantages of these apps. He used to write down passwords in a diary. I showed him how he could use Firefox Sync to save passwords in a secure manner. He doesn't have to remember passwords anymore.
In the case of Google Chrome, extensions and web-apps helped him do more things than he could do on IE.
GIMP and Krita replaced the very old version of Photoshop installed on his system. He was not a professional graphics designer and it's crazy to invest over $600 per year in PS to do basic image editing.
The third tool in my arsenal was LibreOffice, which replaced the aging, and I suspected ‘pirated' version of Microsoft Office installed on his system. I could see the sudden brightness in his eyes to find that he could use an office suite for free of cost, legally.
I also introduced him to Google Docs, which allowed him to work on documents, 'presentations', and 'excel' sheets. The collaborative feature of Docs was already exciting for him, in addition to 'never having to worry about saving the files again'.
He was already was a VLC user as it beats both WMP and QuickTime when it comes to playing various video formats. But he wasn't aware of other neat tricks VLC had up its sleeves such as media file conversion, the ability to play online videos, etc.
Clementine then became the default music player. It can pull lyrics, artist info and could do much more than the default Windows players.
That wasn't all. I also introduced him to Thunderbird, which allowed him to manage his personal and professional accounts from the same application. Thunderbird, like Firefox supports plugins so his calendar, contacts and chats were synced with his Thunderbird account. I went a step further and also installed Pidgin, which allowed him to stay in contact with friends and families via Chat.
Once in a while he would transcode videos from one format to another and had some 'shady' looking Transcoder for Windows, which also installed some toolbars on his IE. I gave him Handbrake, one of the best open source transcoders and he was happy to see the ‘clean' interface of it with many more features than that shady one.
All of these apps pretty much replaced every single piece of software he was using on his Windows machine. I told him to use these apps for a month and keep me posted if he came across any problems. One special instruction that I gave him was that whenever he needed another app besides these to let me know so that I could suggest an alternative.
A month later when I visited him again, he had no problem with his new set-up. He even liked it.
The reason was simple: I didn't take him out of his comfort zone. He knew that he was still using Windows.
But was he?
When people tell you that they use Windows, that's not entirely true. No one uses the OS itself. We use applications or services that run through applications. We don't use the OS; applications use it to allocate resources to the hardware.
It was time to drive him towards the next step of changing the tires. I asked if he was still using Windows or was he using these applications that I installed. There was a moment of silence. It was a clever question. He knew that. He took a deep breath and smiled at me. He shook his head and said, ‘Well all I use is these applications and not Windows.”
The iron was hot, time to strike the hammer. “So as long as you get to use these applications it doesn't really matter whether it's Windows or any other OS on your system?”
Dominic gave it a thought, smiled and nodded his head.
I took a backup of his work and installed a Linux distro that was best suited for his needs. Then I installed all of those applications that he was already using. He did need a walkthrough with the new OS as it was different from Windows. But, mentally he had already been through this process when he was switched from Windows-specific, proprietary applications to their open source counterparts.
That experience had made him confident and positive about the change. He was aware that the GUI would be different but it would do more or less the same thing. And since he had had a very pleasant experience with open source applications, he approached the distro with the same positivity.
Within a week he was fluent in Linux and was happily using it! And that's how we convert users to Linux.
So which distro did I install on his system?
That's the topic for the next article where we carefully pick the appropriate distro for specific use cases.

Correction: The headline initially said Sanders's rally was in Charleston. It was in Washington.
About 30 feet away from a solemn prayer service for victims in Charleston, @SenSanders holds loud pension rally: pic.twitter.com/728G8rw3Z8 — Frank Thorp V (@frankthorpNBC) June 18, 2015
At the same time a prayer service for victims of the shooting in Charleston, S.C., was held Thursday on the Capitol lawn, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders held a rally -- within shouting distance.
And there was shouting.
On a day when the national conversation is focused on the attack and victims and not presidential politics -- not to mention a day when Jeb Bush and Donald Trump said they would cancel campaign events in the key early primary state -- canceling your own campaign rally isn't a bad idea.

And that goes especially if it's going to be within eyesight and earshot of mourners.
Overlap was only for a few minutes but 2 staffers came over to ask Sander's people to halt his rally & Schumer cut Sanders dirty look — Matt Laslo (@MattLaslo) June 18, 2015
Sanders said in a statement posted to Facebook on Thursday afternoon the attack Wednesday night was a "tragic reminder of the ugly stain of racism that still taints our nation." He also cancelled a trip to Charleston planned for Sunday, according to Politico's Gabriel Debenedetti.
Southland (stylized as SOUTHLAND) is an American television crime drama series[1] created by writer Ann Biderman and produced by Warner Bros. Television. It originally aired on NBC for one season from April 9 to May 21, 2009, and then on TNT for four additional seasons from March 2, 2010, to April 17, 2013. On May 1, 2009, NBC announced that Southland had been renewed for a second season with an initial 13-episode order to begin airing on Friday, September 25, 2009, at 9:00 pm, one hour earlier than its original time slot.[2] On August 27, 2009, shortly before its scheduled premiere, NBC moved the opening of its second season to October 23, 2009, citing the need to promote the show more fully.[3] On October 8, 2009, NBC announced that the series had been canceled after one season.[4]
On November 2, 2009, TNT announced it had purchased the rights to Southland's original seven episodes, as well as six completed episodes from its second season. Southland began airing on TNT on January 12, 2010.[5] On April 26, 2010, TNT announced it had picked up Southland for a ten-episode third season to begin airing on January 4, 2011.[6] TNT's renewal of the show included a substantial budget cut and corresponding cast reduction.[7] Southland was renewed for a ten-episode fourth season on March 22, 2011,[8] which premiered on January 17, 2012. The series was renewed for a ten-episode fifth season which began airing February 13, 2013.[9]
On May 10, 2013, TNT announced that Southland had been canceled after five seasons.[10]
Premise [ edit ]
Southland takes a "raw and authentic look" at Los Angeles and the lives of the LAPD officers who police it. The show's first season centers on the experiences and interactions of LAPD patrol officers and detectives, and is a more character-driven drama than a police procedural.[11]
Among the characters are rookie Officer Ben Sherman and his training officer, John Cooper who, unknown to most of his colleagues, is gay; Detective Lydia Adams, who must balance work with the responsibility of living with her mother; Officer Chickie Brown, who aspires to be the first woman on the LAPD's elite SWAT team; and Detective Sammy Bryant, whose home life interferes with his working life.
After its first season on NBC, Southland moved to TNT network. The second season placed less emphasis on the ensemble cast, instead focusing more on the Adams, Sherman, Cooper and Bryant characters and their partners. The weekly stories also centered more on how crimes came together, with fewer serialized story lines.[12][13]
Cast and characters [ edit ]

Recurring cast [ edit ]
Production [ edit ]
The series was created by Emmy Award-winning writer Ann Biderman, who began her television writing career on the first season of police drama NYPD Blue. The series' executive producers are Biderman, Christopher Chulack, and John Wells. Wells and Chulack, both also Emmy Award winners, had previously worked together on critically acclaimed medical drama ER and emergency services drama Third Watch. Many other crew members had previously worked with Wells and Chulack on these series. Wells and Biderman also write for the series and Chulack is a regular director. Biderman left her executive producer position after the second season but continued to write for the series' third season.
Ex-police officer Angela Amato Velez served as a consulting producer and writer for the first season; she had previously worked for the executive producers on Third Watch. Dee Johnson also served as a consulting producer and writer for the first season; she had previously worked with Wells and Chulack on ER. Emmy Award-winning writing team Mitchell Burgess & Robin Green were hired as executive consultants and writers for the second and third seasons; they had previously worked together as executive producers on The Sopranos. Diana Son served as a consulting producer and writer for the second season; she had previously worked on the crime drama Law & Order: Criminal Intent.
David Graziano became a co-executive producer for the second season. Andrew Stearn was a producer for the first two seasons and was promoted to co-executive producer for the third season; he had previously worked on Third Watch. Jonathan Lisco was hired as a co-executive producer for the third season; he is a former lawyer and created the New Orleans police drama K-Ville. Jason Horwitch, creator of AMC's Rubicon, joined the show as consulting producer for the fourth season.
ER and Third Watch veteran Nelson McCormick is also a regular director for Southland. Steadicam expert J. Michael Muro serves as a regular cinematographer and occasional director for the series. Dana Gonzales is the other regular director of photography.
The producers used both actual and former gang members to play the role of gang bangers in Southland.[15]

Reception [ edit ]
Southland received positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the first season received an average score of 69, based on 22 reviews[16] and the second season received an average score of 77, based on 12 reviews[17] both indicating "Generally favorable reviews". Upon returning for its third and fourth season the series received wide critical acclaim, receiving an average score of 81, based on 9 reviews for the third season[18] and an average score of 87, based on 7 reviews for the fourth season both indicating "Universal acclaim".[19] The fifth season received a rating of 86 out of 100 based on 8 reviews.[20]
Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times compared Southland favorably to series like The Shield, Rescue Me and The Wire in citing the series debut as "one of the most gripping opening episodes of any network crime series". Noting the show's "bold, contemporary tone", Stanley concluded that "Southland is commendably stinting and cold, a series that doesn't aim to please, and is all the more pleasurable for it."[21] In a second review a year later, Mike Hale was less effusive in his praise. While commending the series for fine performances from its cast and its combination of straightforward immediate plots and long-range storytelling, Hale criticized the "heavyhandedness" he saw in some of the writing, noting especially the "sententious lectures about the nature of police work" delivered to Sherman by Cooper in the pilot episode. He finds the show "worthy" but in need of work to qualify as a classic.[22]
Dorothy Rabinowitz of The Wall Street Journal says "Prattle is, in any case, a minor note compared with the crackling pace of the first script, its evocative mood of menace at every turn, each police car racing to destinations that will reveal who knows what tragedy or unspeakable sight."[23] Matt Zoller Seitz of Vulture applauded the series' realism, and stated "It's the most engrossing cop series since season one of NBC's Homicide, and maybe the most raggedy and real."[24]
Southland received three nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Stunt Coordination, winning the award twice in 2011 and 2012, and was nominated in 2013.[25] In 2012, the series was awarded with a Peabody Award.[26]
Home media releases [ edit ]
Shortly before its TNT premiere, Warner Home Video released the first season on DVD in an uncensored version, with the profanities intact.[27]
In May 2011, Warner Home Video also released the second season in a similarly uncensored version. This title is currently only available through the studio's manufacture-on-demand (MOD) program.[28]
On February 5, 2013, a box set titled Southland: The Complete Second, Third, and Fourth Seasons was released on DVD; it included over an hour of bonus features.[29]

MUMBAI: Motilal Oswal Real Estate (MORE), the real estate arm of Motilal Oswal Private Equity (MOPE), has raised over Rs 1,000 crore for its third real estate fund and plans to invest the money in structured debt and mezzanine transactions across the six top Indian cities. IREF III has committed 70% of its capital across total 12 transactions in these markets and is likely to be fully committed by the end of current financial year, people close to the development said.MORE has till date invested in the sector through three real estate funds Along with NCDs and proprietary investments, its cumulative assets under management are currently over Rs 2,000 crore. It raised Rs 200 crore under IREF in 2009-10 and Rs 500 crore under IREF II in April 2015 and has now achieved final closure for third fund."We have retuned 43% capital from our second fund with average investment level IRR of 24% and this has helped us in robust response for third fund,” said Sharad Mittal , head, Real Estate Funds at MORE.
A spectacular column in The New York Times by novelist Lionel Shriver makes the point. The new literary and academic establishment in the humanities has become so illiberal, particularly in its preposterous condemnation of “cultural appropriation,” that even the word liberal itself is falling out of fashion.
The people who stole the word liberal – gradually circa 1900-1933 – seem to be in the process of tossing out the last modicum of respect for liberty they had It's so bad that Shriver was denounced and condemned for arguing that it is just fine for novelists to write characters into their work that are not of the same cultural, racial, and demographic background of the writer. Not very controversial, right?
Explosion followed. Yes, that's how bad it's gotten out there. The literary habit that built civilization, the musical tactic that brought us the Nutcracker and Carmen, the technological tendency that build modernity from the Middle Ages to the present, the political rhetoric that ended slavery and emancipated women, the artistic strategy that has brought the world together in mutual understanding and in unprecedented ways, now stands condemned as the micro-aggression of cultural appropriation.

How did the left in the West come to embrace restriction, censorship and the imposition of an orthodoxy at least as tyrannical as the anti-Communist, pro-Christian conformism I grew up with? Liberals have ominously relabeled themselves “progressives,” forsaking a noun that had its roots in “liber,” meaning free. To progress is merely to go forward, and you can go forward into a pit.
Protecting freedom of speech involves protecting the voices of people with whom you may violently disagree. In my youth, liberals would defend the right of neo-Nazis to march down Main Street. I cannot imagine anyone on the left making that case today.
It's right. The people who stole the word liberal – gradually circa 1900-1933 – seem to be in the process of tossing out the last modicum of respect for liberty they had even as recently as ten years ago. If you are considered a thief for showing appreciation for other cultures, learning from people unlike yourself, using art and literature to draw attention to certain human universals, there is really nothing left of liberty.
If these are your views, you really should relinquish the word liberal. And the truly great thing is that this is happening right now thus leaving it, perhaps, to be reappropriated by actual lovers of liberty.
Do Not Talk about Beyoncé's Lemonade!
I experienced the intolerance for disruptive ideas earlier this year in the strangest way. Beyoncé's Lemonade – a feature-length pop operetta about betrayal and forgiveness – had just come out. I devoured it, was challenged by it, learned from it, and found themes within it that I was ready to write about: particularly the Hayekian themes I found in the work.
However, just as I started putting together my thoughts, the Internet filled up with dire warnings: if you are a white man, do not write about Beyoncé's Lemonade!
I can't write about Beyoncé's Lemonade? Really? Why not? Because it is a story about the experience of black women in America, and it would be disrespectful to appropriate this experience and this art to serve your own private desire to interpret the work.
Did I really relish hurling myself into the meat grinder of leftist fanaticism, being condemned as a racist cultural appropriator because I dared to say something about Beyoncé's Lemonade? Others took a more moderate position: do not yet write about Beyoncé's Lemonade. Giv it a few days, a few weeks, a few months, so as to allow women of color to at least have the first chance to comment and write.
Now, I can't say I was entirely intimidated to silence by this demand. However, I did hesitate, maybe briefly perceiving some plausibility to the claim. It makes some sense that the intended audience would become the dominant voice of interpretation. I'm ok with that, but would my adding my voice somehow prohibit this? I doubt it, seriously.
Still, I was thinking. So I let it go. The next day, I actually asked a “woman of color” who is a friend, and she said, “that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. I want to know what you as a white man have to say about this!” That was cool, but I felt the moment passing.
Did I really relish hurling myself into the meat grinder of leftist fanaticism, being condemned as a racist cultural appropriator because I dared to say something about Beyoncé's Lemonade? Not much. It is always easier not to speak than to speak.
As I look back, this was a mistake on my part, but it does illustrate how illiberalism and dogmatic demands to keep your thoughts to yourself can have a chilling effect on public culture.
Who Is Against Freedom of Speech Today?
In the postwar period, the mantle of principle on the matter of free speech moved from left to right. Recall that William Fr. Buckley's God and Man at Yale (1953) was essentially an argument against academic freedom. It said that leftists were invoking this principle to advocate for ideas (atheism and Keynesianism) that contradict the values of the donating alumni to Yale itself. It was due to this erudite but essentially illiberal treatise that the postwar right gained the impression of being “anti-intellectual.”
What a difference sixty years make. Today the organizations most passionately for academic freedom and freedom of speech are the Young Americans for Liberty, the Students for Liberty, and the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education – three organizations that, rightly or wrongly, are considered to be on the right side of the political debate. At this very time, the other side has developed a kind of allergy to the demand for free speech. Everyone is triggered by everyone else.
Around the same time, Leonard Read and his circle deeply regretted the loss of the term liberal. With some reservations and lingering doubts, they revived the term libertarian as a substitute. It was supposed to be a synonym. But IMHO, it's not nearly as good because it lacks the history, the broadness of mind, the high aspiration for society as a whole.
The True Meaning of Liberal
Liberalism built civilization.There really is only one way forward. That is the way offered by the liberal tradition – a tradition variously and pragmatically sampled by the left and the right but not really believed in full by either. After all, if your ambition is to control society, you can't really claim the mantle.
It's a beautiful thing that the word itself seems to have been abandoned by all modern political players, who prefer other terms. Fine. Liberalism has the most brilliant heritage in every language. It means individual rights, freedom of expression and enterprise and association, suspicion of government, and a confidence that society can organize itself better on its own without any institution making and enforcing a central plan.
Liberalism built civilization. It makes sense that the word would be abandoned when the dominant players in politics today have every interest in tearing it down by circumscribing freedom. But therein lies an opportunity.
In 2015 I made a commitment to stop using the term liberal in a derogatory way. I think I'll complete this year by committing to using it in a completely positive way. Will you join me? We might be the only self-described liberals in the United States, and, perhaps then, we can make a contribution to regaining the term's true meaning.
Or we might just say, reappropriate it.
Apple wasted little time approving Wolfram Alpha's new iPhone app, which we hinted at last week. Just a few days after they submitted it to the store, Apple sailed it right through the approval process with such speed that it even surprised the Wolfram Alpha team, which had hoped to get some feedback from testers before the approval. I was one of those people, so rather than send them feedback, I'll write it here.
There are two key points about Wolfram Alpha's iPhone app: 1) It is pretty cool, and very nicely done. 2) They're insane for trying to sell it for $50.
I'm going to mainly focus on second point here, because if you've used Wolfram Alpha, you don't really need much explanation about this app, which is a slick interface for the service. And while I get Wolfram Alpha's logic behind selling the app for $50, I think it's faulty logic. Here's what they're telling us:
A note on price — it is listed at $49.99, which is basically less than 1/2 the price of a graphing calculator with inferior functionality in comparison, which is how the company came to that number. Or, as we've been saying, the price of 12 lattes from Starbucks…
Both of those points are true, but the App Store has created a different economic reality than say, walking into an Office Max and buying a graphing calculator. It's no secret that most apps that sell well tend to be cheaper — as in, free or $0.99. Apple has recently tried to de-emphasize this by adding a “Top Grossing” section to the App Store. That's fine, but with the exception of the $90 Navigon GPS turn-by-turn app, all of the top grossing apps are under $10. And most are under $3.
The reality is that you can probably count the number of iPhone apps over $10 that sell really well on your hands. Of those, the number over $20, you can probably count on one hand. And of those, if you remove the GPS turn-by-turn apps and maybe a few apps meant for doctors, you're probably down to a couple fingers.
And I'm sorry, but Wolfram Alpha does not yet have the clout of Navigon, nor is it in the hot turn-by-turn GPS space that would warrant such a high price. “We do plan to offer regular discounts and sales,” the team tells us. But if they really want this app to sell, they're going to have to knock off like 90% of its price. Actually, to be honest, even at $10, I'm not sure how many people would buy this app.
And that's too bad for the team. As I said, the app is a solid one, but this is the reality of the App Store. Games that sell on systems like the Nintendo DS for $30, are $3 on the iPhone. Hell, there are even some games that sell on the bigger consoles for $60 that are less than $10 on the iPhone. They're not quite as good graphics-wise, but I would argue that they're every bit as fun. And don't think for a second that studios like EA wouldn't sell them for $30 if they could, but they realize that they can't.
Wolfram Alpha may have to figure that reality out the hard way. It's fine that it can replace your $100 graphing calculator, but it's also limited because it requires WiFi or a 3G connection to do so. And the iPhone already comes with a calculator, which can turn into a more advanced one, and both of those are free. And there are dozens of graphing calculator apps in the App Store that sell for a whopping $0.99.
Okay, you might say, but Wolfram Alpha does offer a lot of interesting data far beyond graphing calculators. That's also true, like giving you a detailed read out of how many calories are in a Big Mac, fries, and a Coke. But if you're using this on your iPhone or iPod touch, you already have access to Google, and more to the point, the mobile web version of Wolfram Alpha, which is free.
Clearly, the service had some insight into how controversial the price will be. They go on to note:
The core WolframAlpha site will always be free. This is one of several “premium” experiences that the company will offer in addition. The app is targeted at the most serious users, and is priced as such. Likewise, we feel that the app's egonomics and speed make it well worth the investment.
I can only assume they mean “ergonomics” there, but we'll forgive them for that Freudian slip.
The app absolutely does offer a nice experience, one that yes, is better than the free website. But $50 better? No. $10 better? Maybe. $5 better? We're getting closer. Again, right or wrong, this is just the reality of the App Store economy.
As we've noted previously, the iPhone app is the first example of Wolfram Alpha's new APIs that they hope will extend their most valuable asset: Their data. But if you're trying to get more people to use access your data, charging $50 is not a great play. A better one may be to get people hooked on your data, then charge down the road when they realize how valuable it is — if they ever do, which is still far from certain with Wolfram Alpha.
It's also interesting to note that despite talk of a deal with Bing, the defautl web search in the Wolfram Alpha app is Google. Both Bing and Yahoo are options, but you have to change it in the settings.
You can find the Wolfram Alpha app here in the App Store.
Today's Penn State football news headlines feature a look at where the PSU-Pitt rivalry ranks among the best in college football and where the Lions sit in the preseason Big Ten power rankings.
Pat Forde of Yahoo! Sports took a look at the hottest rivalry games in college football this season and gave Penn State-Pitt a mention. His reasoning: The Lions have huge expectations following a stunning 2016 season that might have ended with a College Football Playoff berth if it weren't for a 42-39 road loss to Pitt. Penn State gets Pitt at home this time around on Sept. 9.
Forde wrote:
They've met 97 times dating back to 1893, but the rivalry was dormant for 15 years before renewing last season. It was a memorable game that wound up having long-term effects on the national picture - Pitt pulled out a 42-39 thriller, a result that ultimately helped prevent the Big Ten champion Nittany Lions from making the playoff. This year Penn State has playoff aspirations and quite likely cannot afford another loss to the Panthers. (Note: Penn State hasn't beaten Pitt without some involvement from Joe Paterno - as head coach or assistant - since 1947.)
Penn State will defend its Big Ten title in 2017 with a deeper, more experienced team, a fact that wasn't lost on BTN's Tom Dienhart . Still, the Lions could be looking up at an Ohio State team widely assumed to return to the College Football Playoff. The Lions, who match up with the Buckeyes Oct. 28 in Columbus, checked in at No. 2 in Dienhart's Big Ten power rankings.
Dienhart wrote:
2. Penn State. The Nittany Lions are reigning kings of the Big Ten. And get this: The 2017 edition may be even better, especially on offense.
Up next: Akron
In other Penn State football news, the Lions are primed to win the Big Ten again, but can they run the table? Penn State has a plan to return to college football relevance, and the offense has a chance to be as explosive as the lauded 1994 attack.

A series of “flash mobs” for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump will take place throughout Michigan August 30.
Trump supporters will gather at 13 different locations across Michigan on Tuesday Aug. 30 from 4:00-5:30 p.m. to wave signs, flags, and other Trump campaign merchandise around to those who pass by.
The events are hosted by the grassroots group Michigan Conservative Coalition, a group committed to the principles of the founding fathers and the Republican Party platform.
According to the group's founder, Rosanne Ponkowski, the events are a fun way for volunteers to gather in support of the nominee. She also said the events are growing in number.
“Each location will have a local feel unique to its community, but each site will show their support to elect Donald J. Trump during the same 4 to 5:30 p.m. time window,” said Ponkowski in a statement. “Grassroots enthusiasm for the Trump campaign is driving even more flash mob sites.”
The full lineup of events is listed on Michigan Conservative Coalition's Facebook event page.
Pro-Trump flash mobs have also been reported in Florida on Aug. 20.

Police are investigating the possibility that a man nailed to a wooden fence in a savage 'crucifixion' in Belfast yesterday was attacked by a so-called 'neighbourhood watch' group.
Harry McCartan, from Poleglass, remained in the Royal Victoria Hospital last night awaiting surgery to remove two blocks of wood that were still attached to his hands by nails. He had been so badly beaten his family could only identify him by a tattoo on his arm. His condition was described as 'ill but stable'.
The 23-year-old was attacked by a gang of men who subjected him to a horrific beating before nailing both his hands to a wooden fence in the loyalist Seymour Hill estate.
Police do not believe at this moment that the attack was sectarian and they have ruled out the possibility that Mr McCartan was abducted from another area of Belfast.
The Fire Service were called to the scene on a country lane near Lilac Walk in Seymour Hill, Dunmurray at around 3.45 yesterday morning. The young man was found lying, unconscious, with nails hammered into both his hands, attached to a wooden style leading to a field on the edge of the estate.
Police say they do not know why Mr McCartan, a Catholic from west Belfast, was in the Seymour Hill area. But they are examining a red Rover car, licence plate number LIW 75OO, which was found just yards from where he was found and which had bloodstains inside. Documents belonging to Mr McCartan were found near the car.
Detective Superintendent Gerry Murray told reporters yesterday that there was no clear motive for the attack although they are following a number of lines of inquiry.
'It appears that a number of young men have taken the law into their own hands,' he said. 'As far as we are concerned this was a barbaric attack on an innocent young man and for whatever reason he has been brutally punished.'
Each episode will tackle a "big question" that humankind has pondered over the ages, AMC said. As part of that, it'll dig into the genesis of beloved sci-fi films, TV shows, video games and books, and where they're going in the future. The series will also feature Cameron and other notable sci-fi personalities debating "the merits, meanings and impacts of the films and novels that influenced them."
Cameron added that he's interested in not just the history of the genre, but how it informed and interacted with real science and space exploration. Speaking about Kubrick's Space Odyssey, he said "I liked the special effects, but I really loved the ideas and the questions behind them: How will the world end? Will technology destroy us? What does it mean to be human?" He added that without early sci-fi writers like Verne and Wells, "there wouldn't have been Ray Bradbury or Robert A. Heinlein, and without them, there wouldn't be Lucas, Spielberg, Ridley Scott or me."
AMC didn't discuss any storylines or who notable guests would be, but the series should have science fiction fans salivating. Cameron is perhaps the ideal producer for the project, having produced sci-fi classics like Aliens and Terminator and being passionate about cinema technology. He's also a strong science advocate, having explored the Mariana Trench in a submersible. He also produced a short documentary film on climate change.
Human rights groups criticise Dhaka court for mass trial of 846 defendants over deaths of 74 people in military revolt
A court in Bangladesh has sentenced 152 people to death for their actions in a 2009 border guard mutiny in which 74 people, including 57 military commanders, were killed.
Dhaka's metropolitan sessions court judge Mohammad Akhtaruzzaman also sentenced 157 others, mostly border guards, to life in prison while 271 people were acquitted. The extensive case involves 846 accused, and the verdicts are still being announced.
The mutiny on 25-26 February 2009 took place two months after the prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, took office. The military was unhappy over the response of the government, which did not allow troops to attack the border guards' headquarters in Dhaka where military commanders were killed.
Hasina offered an amnesty to quell the revolt but rescinded the offer when dozens of bodies were found in sewers and in mass graves.
Bangladesh's military has staged 21 coup attempts. The amnesty offer and the government's handling of the case strained the military's relationship with Hasina, and she pledged to try those responsible.
The country's criminal investigation department investigated and pressed charges against 850 people with serious crimes including murder and arson. Four of the accused died and 20 were tried in absentia.
Human rights groups have criticised Bangladesh for the mass trial, saying it will not aid justice. New York-based Human Rights Watch last week said at least 47 suspects have died in custody while the suspects have had limited access to lawyers, and to knowledge of the charges and evidence against them. Bangladeshi authorities have denied the allegations.

Donald Trump may be headed toward the White House, but a few years ago, he was no stranger at another national landmark: the Playboy Mansion.
“I met Donald Trump a few times,” Holly Madison, former Playboy playmate, told Page Six on Monday. “But I don't know him well or anything. He was always polite and really nice.”
Madison, 36, lived at the Playboy Mansion and starred in “The Girls Next Door,” a reality show on E! about life with Hugh Hefner, from 2005 to 2009. She has since gone on to pen “Down the Rabbit Hole” and “The Vegas Diaries,” two memoir-style books about her time with Hefner and the consequential years performing in Las Vegas.
“It's kind of surreal seeing Donald Trump run for president because I used to see him at parties sometimes and run into him,” Madison continued. “I was a judge at his Miss USA pageant when he used to own it so it's definitely kind of surreal … and weird.”
Over the weekend, Trump's questionable treatment of women was the subject of a lengthy article in the New York Times.
But the presidential hopeful slammed the piece Monday, writing on Twitter, “The @nytimes is so dishonest. Their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by Rowanne Brewer, who said it was a lie!”
The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Orlando is a dream come true for many Harry Potter fans. Yet, unless you live in Central Florida, it may not be a trip you can take often — or at all. So we would like to show you how to enjoy one of the best offerings from the Wizarding World without having to buy a plane ticket. Proceed below to find a variety of Butterbeer recipes.
After considering many different butterbeer recipes, it seems there are two basic approaches when deciding on a recipe. While both approaches include directions for making a frothy head to top your butterbeer, the significant differences come in the making of the “beer” itself.
The simple approach involves adding some simple flavoring to cream soda. The more involved, but in my opinion tastier approach, involves cooking your own “flavoring” to add to the cream soda. Both approaches to the recipe have their strengths and weaknesses, as well as varying degrees of “authenticity” when compared to the Wizarding World's original.
Simple Butterbeer recipes
The simplest approach to making butterbeer is to add some purchased flavorings to your favorite cream soda, mix it up, make the frothy topping, spoon it on top, and enjoy. My children were happy to serve as taste-testers for me while I tried two different versions of the simple butterbeer.
Simple Butterbeer recipe #1
The prize for Butterbeer most reminiscent of the Butterbeer we enjoyed at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter goes to this treat from Autumn Clemons as outlined in her article at designdazzle.com. Just remember that this recipe is reminiscent of the original, not identical to it.
Butterbeer Recipe Ingredients:
2 liter cream soda
2 tablespoons Butter extract
2 teaspoons rum extract
*drop the extracts into the 2 liter bottle, put on cap and slowly rotate until combined.
Butterbeer cream topping ingredients
1 7oz container of marshmallow creme
1 cup whipping cream
1 teaspoon rum extract
*add all items together in an electric mixer and combine until smooth.
Pour the butterbeer into a glass, drizzle with the cream topping, and enjoy!
Here's what we liked about this one:
It's easy to serve a crowd. Just add the flavorings right into a 2-liter bottle of cream soda.
It replicates the fizziness of the original better than any others we tried. This might have something to do with how it's mixed up, by swirling the 2-liter of cream soda after adding the flavorings, as opposed to pouring it out and stirring it. Or maybe it's something about the combination of this particular recipe's beer and froth. Whatever it was, my kids were impressed that this one kept on fizzing, much like the original. It is not as sweet as the original, though.
If you're serving this for a party, you can even print out butterbeer labels to cover the cream soda label.
Marshmallow cream and whipping cream make for a yummy froth!
The downside:
It makes a lot. If you're making this for yourself, you're going to have left overs.
It uses a lot of extracts. The beer itself uses both butter extract (quite a bit of it) and rum extract. Personally, I could taste the artificial quality of the extracts, and they seemed to overpower the drink. You may want to consider cutting the amount of extract used by up to half.
While similar to the original, it's not as sweet, and my kids definitely missed the sweetness.
Simple Butterbeer recipe #2
The runner-up in the simple approach category is a recipe with only a few ingredients. We found it sweeter than our winner, but the basic froth of sweetened whipped cream was no match for the marshmallow cream/whipped cream/rum extract combination in the winning recipe. You can find very detailed instructions and photos on chicaandjo.com. This recipe makes two drinks.
Ingredients
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
2 tbsp powdered sugar
24 oz of your favorite cream soda
2 tsp vanilla butter nut flavoring
Directions
Measure the heavy whipping cream into a bowl, then add powdered sugar. Whisk briskly until whipped. Once your cream topping is ready, add your vanilla butter nut flavoring to your cream soda and stir gently so you don't get rid of all the carbonation in the soda. Just like in the above recipe, pour the butterbeer into a glass, drizzle with the cream topping, and enjoy!
Best Butterbeer recipe
After trying the two simple versions, we tried a more involved (but not difficult) recipe courtesy of huffingtonpost.com, which calls for cooking butter and sugar and a few other ingredients to make a homemade flavoring for your butterbeer, and greatly reduces the amount of artificial extracts and flavorings in the finished product.
Ingredients
1 cup light or dark brown sugar
2 tablespoons water
6 tablespoon butter
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon cider vinegar
3/4 cup heavy cream, divided
1/2 teaspoon rum extract
Four 12-ounce bottles cream soda
Directions
In a small saucepan over medium, combine the brown sugar and water. Bring to a gentle boil and cook, stirring often, until the mixture reads 240 F on a candy thermometer. Stir in the butter, salt, vinegar and 1/4 heavy cream. Set aside to cool to room temperature. Once the mixture has cooled, stir in the rum extract. In a medium bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of the brown sugar mixture and the remaining 1/2 cup of heavy cream. Use an electric mixer to beat until just thickened, but not completely whipped, about 2 to 3 minutes. To serve, divide the brown sugar mixture between 4 tall glasses (about 1/4 cup for each glass). Add 1/4 cup of cream soda to each glass, then stir to combine. Fill each glass nearly to the top with additional cream soda, then spoon the whipped topping over each.
And for the judges' opinions – what we liked:
This recipe really is quite tasty. We found it to be sweeter than the simpler recipes above, and just all around yummy.
I liked that I could taste the butter and brown sugar flavors, and not be overwhelmed by artificial extract flavors. There is a small amount of rum extract in it, but not nearly the amount in the simple recipes.
What we didn't like as much:
While tastier, adding the butter/sugar mixture to the cream soda “clouds” the soda, creating a contrast between the original butterbeer, which is a crisp, clear drink. You'll have to make a choice between flavor and resemblance to the original.
More Butterbeer recipe options
As if making three different Butterbeer recipes in one weekend weren't enough, there were more recipes we could have tried but didn't. One frozen Butterbeer recipe looks very similar to the cooked butter and sugar version that we tried, and since we liked the flavor of that one, I suspect the frozen version would be tasty as well. If you'd like to give it a try, you can find the recipe at enchantinglysweet.com (archive).
Another recipe I really would have liked to try involved adding butterscotch flavored syrup (the kind you might add to your coffee) to some marshmallow cream, and using that to top plain cream soda. This would be an ultra simple recipe. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any butterscotch flavored syrup at any store in my area. If you try this one, be sure and leave us a comment letting us know how it tastes.
Butterbeer recipes at home: Final thoughts
While none of the recipes we tried were exactly like the original Butterbeer, we had a fun time testing and testing some more. The next time we get a craving for Butterbeer, we'll go back to our favorite simple recipe and lessen the amount of extracts. I'd also try using the marshmallow fluff version of the froth on any of the other recipes that call for a simple sweetened whipped cream.
Try some of these recipes, or mix and match to create something better – I'd love to hear your results and your favorites!

Researchers introduce new layered semiconducting materials as silicon alternative
(Nanowerk News) When the new iPhone came out, customers complained that it could be bent -- but what if you could roll up your too big 6 Plus to actually fit in your pocket? That technology might be available sooner than you think, based on the work of USC Viterbi engineers.
For many decades, silicon has been the heart of modern electronics -- but as a material, it has its limits. As our devices get smaller and smaller, the basic unit of these devices, a transistor, must also get tinier and tinier. Bottom line: the size of the silicon transistor is reaching its physical limit. As silicon devices are based on what is called a top-down cutting method, it is increasingly difficult for silicon to be made even smaller. Consumers also demand phones to be lighter, faster, smaller, more flexible, wearable, bendable, etc. Yet silicon is also rigid -- one can't bend your smart phone or computer. These physical limitations have driven the race for new materials that can be used as semiconductors in lieu of silicon.

The demand for a silicon material aided the discovery of graphene, a single layer of graphite -- which won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010. Since this time, scientists and engineers have developed many two-dimensional (2D) material innovations -- layered materials with the thickness of only one atom or a few atoms. One such layered 2D material is black arsenic phosphorous. Now, a team of scientists at USC Viterbi, in collaboration with Technische Universität München, Germany, Universität Regensburg, Germany, and Yale University, have developed a new method to synthesize black arsenic-phosphorous without high pressure. This method demands less energy and is cheaper, and the synthesized materials have some incredible new properties.
The innovation, developed by USC Viterbi researchers, including Bilu Liu, the paper's lead author and postdoctoral researcher; Ahamad Abbas, graduate student; Han Wang, assistant professor; Rohan Dhall, graduate student; Stephen B. Cronin, associate professor; Mingyuan Ge, research assistant; Xin Fang, graduate student; and Professor Chongwu Zhou of the Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering, in concert with their collaborators, is documented in a paper in Advanced Materials ("Black Arsenic-Phosphorus: Layered Anisotropic Infrared Semiconductors with Highly Tunable Compositions and Properties").
What the researchers are most excited about is the ability to adjust the electronic and optical properties of these materials to a range that cannot be achieved by any other 2D materials thus far. This includes manipulating the materials' chemical compositions during materials synthesis and the materials' ability to sense long wavelength infrared (LWIR) waves due to their small energy gaps. This particular electromagnetic spectral range of LWIR is important for a range of applications such as LIDAR (light radar) systems, basically because LWIR waves are highly transparent in earth atmosphere. This wave range also has great application for the soldiers in the military who rely on infrared thermal imaging technology and for flexible night vision glasses. Another intriguing aspect of these new layeredsemiconductors is their anisotropic electronic and optical properties, which means the materials have different properties along x and y direction in the same plane. The researchers believe these are marked improvement from existing materials and devices and would lead to unique applications.
In addition, the researchers anticipate that it could also lead to important improvement for devices that monitor the environment. "We believe these materials are important members in a large family of 2D materials, because they fit into the long-wavelength-infrared light range and deliver properties that any other currently existing 2D materials cannot," said Zhou, the research team leader.
THE makers of the Romanian edition of the board game Monopoly may want to consider altering the “Get out of jail free” card to one reading “Wrote a book in jail”. A change in the law in 2013 allows convicts to claim 30 days off their sentences for every work they publish while in prison. This has led Romanian tycoons and politicians imprisoned on corruption charges to indulge in a frenzy of scribbling. It is a system as corrupt as they are.
Among those who have taken advantage of the loophole, or hope to do so, are Adrian Nastase, a former prime minister; Gheorghe Copos, a businessman and former government minister; Gigi Becali, another tycoon-cum-politician; and Ioan Niculae, reputedly the richest person in Romania. Gica Popescu, a former star footballer convicted of money laundering, is on the verge of early release after penning no fewer than four titles. Other hopeful authors include bigwigs in sports management and yet more politicians.

Before 2013 a clause in the law permitted reduced sentences for those who produced works of academic research, but the criteria were narrow enough to prevent abuse. The new law, too, was supposed to be accompanied by strict guidelines determined by the ministry of justice and approved by government. This never happened. Until the loophole is closed, those with the means to do so will continue to pour out valueless work.
Prisoners are not allowed computers and prison libraries are basic. Manuscripts must be written with pen and paper. According to Romanian journalists, wealthy prisoners generally hire outside academics as “research supervisors”. They, or other ghostwriters, do the actual writing; the work is then smuggled into jail, where the prisoner copies it out by hand. A publisher is paid to print a few copies, which are presented to the parole board, which (with no guidelines or expertise) judges whether it is worthy of a reduced sentence.
Most of the work has met with derision. Mr Copos, who wrote about the matrimonial alliances of medieval Romanian rulers, was accused of plagiarism. Mr Becali produced a picture-heavy book about his relationship with Steaua Bucharest, the football team which he controls. Realini Lupsa, a pop singer, wrote about stem cells in dental medicine. No one knows how many people have taken advantage of the system. One recent report put the figure at 73, with some prisoners producing up to five books in only a few months.
Cristi Danilet, a member of Romania's judicial council (which oversees the country's judges), says he cannot work out whether “incompetence or political interference” has allowed the loophole to be left open. Another source, who requested anonymity, argued for the latter. Victor Ponta, the prime minister, is due to go on trial soon for corruption, the source noted; it is hardly surprising that politicians are not eager for a change.
At some point, the loophole will be closed. Romania's National Anti-corruption Directorate (DNA) has been clamouring for the law to be fixed since April. In the past couple of years the DNA has emerged as one of the most powerful institutions in the country. In the first nine months of 2015, says Livia Saplacan, its spokeswoman, it indicted 15 members of parliament and nine out of the country's 41 provincial heads, as well as sending Mr Ponta to trial.
The DNA has lent a newfound credibility to the Romanian judicial system. But it is still too early to say whether it will bring about a fundamental change in the corruption ingrained in its political and business culture. Politicians are already mobilising to curb its powers. Some worry that the DNA's information, much of it gleaned from Romania's intelligence services, is giving the spooks too much power. Romanians are delighted that the rich and powerful are being sent to jail, says Oana Popescu, the head of Global Focus, a think-tank. But they are resigned to the fact many of them will wriggle their way out early. “It is the Romanian way,” she sighs.
Mental Health
Take a minute to write down the first five things that come to mind when you hear the words "mental health".
Mental health has become one of those phrases that's used so much it's pretty much lost all meaning. Ask ten people on the street what mental health means and you'll get eleven different answers. Most commonly and perhaps most ironically, mental health is used to talk about mental illness. Take a look at the list of words you wrote (shame if you didn't do it!). Probably the word depression is on there, maybe anxiety, PTSD, maybe psychiatry or psychology. Lets imagine that a million people do the same exercise, what percent do you think would write passion, compared to depression? Joy, compared to illness? Love, compared to anxiety?
Here's the first thing we need to realise about mental health:
Being mentally healthy isn't the same as not having any mental illnesses.
In other words, the absence of mental illness does not imply the presence of mental health.
Consider the World Health Organisation's definition of health:
a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity
If we've known this since 1948, why did it take until 1998 for positive psychology to arrive and for science to seriously start considering the "health" part of mental health? And that 50-year gap doesn't just represent lost time either, it represents roughly 35,600,000 suicides too.
But regardless the delay, Positive Psychology, pioneered by former American Psychological Association president Martin Seligman, represents the first time since its inception that psychology has attempted to find empirical data about what makes life truly worth living, here's what they found...
Components of Mental Health
Mental health and wellbeing consists of five key areas: positive emotions, sense of engagement, healthy relationships, sense of meaning and purpose, and a sense of achievement. These can be remembered with the pneumonic PERMA.
You can test your current levels of PERMA using the PERMA-P Questionnaire [PDF]. You could even take the questionnaire multiple times across your self-improvement journey to track what progress you're making.
Positive Emotions
The Positive Emotion component of mental health is simply that. It means that mentally healthy people experience positive feelings more frequently than they do negative feelings. That isn't to say that the ideal state of being is 100% positive emotion and 0%, simply that we should keep the ratio in check in our day-to-day lives as our brains are hard wired to notice the negative more readily than the positive, for evolutionary reasons. Research by Barbara Fredrickson suggests a good ratio is 3:1, and that successful business teams communicate positive emotions 6:1, though this has recently been contested.
Engagement
Have you ever been so into something, that when you're working on it time seems to have stopped? Maybe you were playing vidya and thought it had been fifteen minutes, but when you looked at the clock, hours had past. That sensation of being utterly wrapped up in something is called flow. Flow is a key part of a sense of engagement, which in turn is a key part of mental wellbeing. Engage and get involved with projects and ideas that give you a sense of flow.
Relationships
When was the last time you laughed until it hurt? When was the last time you thought deeply about life, the universe, and everything? Chances are that both of those things happened with other people around. Very few people are truly happy with a solitary life, positive relationships form a big part of mental health. Indeed, loneliness has been linked to ill physical health also. Seek out people who make you happy!
Meaning
Given the choice would you choose to live a meaningless life? Who would?! Meaning and purpose are key ingredients of mental health. They consist of three things: comprehension, significance, and service. Comprehension is our need to understand the world and our place in it. Significance is our need to have values and to feel valued in return. Service is our need for highly motivating “transcendent” goals – which simply as humans we like to have goal which serve something bigger than ourselves, like our communities or god etc. (Protip: I'll be publishing a three-part extravaganza on meaning and purpose soon, follow me!)
Achievement
Achievement is exactly that – we like to win. Lose too often and we become dejected and pessimistic. As with negative emotions, our brains are evolutionarily wired to hold on to failure. Recognise this fact and celebrate your wins, no matter how small.
Practical Exercises to Build Mental Health and Wellbeing
Three Good Things
Three Good Things is a simple, empirically validated exercise that increases levels of happiness and decreases symptoms of depression over six months. All you have to do is: each night before you go to bed, write down three things that went well today and why you think they happened. Remember to write down the why, that's the important part!
Gratitude Letter
Gratitude Letter is again a simple, empirically validated exercise that increases levels of happiness and decreases symptoms of depression over a month. All you have to do is: Think of someone to whom you are grateful but have never properly thanked. Write them a letter outlining what they did for you, how you benefited and why you are thankful to them. You can deliver the letter if you want to but it is not necessary for the exercise.
Best Possible Self
Best Possible Self is a creative writing exercise that has empirical evidence to show that it “significantly increases subjective wellbeing” It asks that you think about your life in the future. Imagine that everything has gone as well as it possibly could. You have worked hard and succeeded at accomplishing all of your life goals. Think of this as the realization of all of your life dreams. Now, write about what you imagined.
At My Best
Write roughly one side of A4 paper which tell a positive story of you at your best. Read this story once a day for a week, reflecting on what made you your best in that situation: your character strengths, your values and virtues, your relationships etc.
Signature Strengths
Reflect on the character strengths you think you exemplify, or take a character strengths profile like the VIA-IS (www.viacharacter.org). Pick one of your top five results and commit to using it in a new way this week.
Good luck, and good mental health to you!

Brendan Foley was only three minutes into his first dive on his first day at the site of the 2,100-year-old Antikythera shipwreck when a colleague came swimming over to him.
"You've gotta see this," they said. "We found bones. We found a skull!"
Archaeologists have been scouring the site in Greece for more than 100 years, and only a few scattered human remains have shown up during that time. Foley swam in the direction his colleagues pointed, trying not to get his hopes up.
But what he saw half-buried in the sediment was even more than he could have hoped for: "We have the first human skeleton recovered from an ancient shipwreck since the advent of ancient DNA studies," Foley said. "We can investigate this individual in a way that was never possible before."
[The world's oldest computer is still revealing its secrets]
Researchers studying the shipwreck Antikythera have discovered a nearly complete skeleton. (EUA/WHOI/ARGO)
The discovery of the long-buried bones in the dark, chilly water 150 feet beneath the surface of the Mediterranean could give new insight into what is arguably the ancient world's most famous shipwreck. Discovered by sponge divers in 1901, the wreck has yielded a king's ransom in ancient bronze statues, silver coins, ceramic jars, marble sculptures and decadent gold jewelry. Most precious of all is the mysterious Antikythera mechanism, a complex, clockwork instrument that modeled the passage of time and the movements of celestial bodies and has been called the world's oldest computer. It is far and away the most sophisticated piece of machinery from the ancient world, and scientists still have no idea who made it — or why.
DNA analysis of the newly excavated skeleton could offer clues to that mystery and countless others associated with the shipwreck.
"Now we're face to face with someone who sailed that ship, face to face with someone who might have handled the mechanism," Foley said. "We can look through his eyes at the voyage, at the wreck, at the whole first century B.C."
Fragments of the 2,100-year-old Antikythera mechanism, believed to be the earliest surviving mechanical computing device, are displayed at the National Archaeological Museum in Athens on June 9 , 2016. The fragments were found in the shipwreck. (Petros Giannakouris/AP)
Foley, an underwater archaeologist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, has spent several years surveying the wreck, trying to reconstruct how it would have looked 2,100 years ago in hopes of finding new treasures — and perhaps even a second Antikythera mechanism. In 2012, he and his colleagues identified a second, smaller wreck, probably dated around the same time as the first. They found lead sheets from the hull of the main ship that were sourced from mines in northern Greece, and deduced from the preservation of the human remains that they must have been buried by organic material right after they sank. Those facts, paired with a cup uncovered by an earlier expedition that bore the Greek name "Pamphilos," let Foley begin imagining the circumstances of the ship's demise.
"It's quite possible this was a grain-carrying ship," he said. "They were the supertankers of the ancient world."
Such ships frequently carried tourists, like the Greek man Pamphilos, who must have been both wealthy and literate to have a cup with his name and know how to read it. Laden with cargo and passengers, the ship could have been sailing toward Rome when it passed through the narrow, reef- and rock-chocked passageway between the islands Antikythera and Crete, just south of Greece.
"They were sailing along, it was probably that proverbial dark and stormy night, and they didn't know how close they were to Antikythera, and before they knew it they just ran into the cliff," Foley said. "And they were lost in an instant."
The skeleton Foley and his colleagues just uncovered was probably caught between decks as the ship went down.
Antikythera project co-directors Theotokis Theodoulou and Brendan Foley inspect the skeletal remains: skull and upper jaw with teeth, two femurs, radius, ulna, ribs. (Brett Seymour/EUA/WHOI/ARGO)
A preliminary analysis of the remains — which include two femurs, the long bones of the forearm and most of the skull — suggest that they belonged to a young man, probably in his mid- to late 20s. They are brittle, but well-preserved, and stained a deep red by iron.
Foley speculates about what that could mean: "Maybe he had iron fasteners on his clothing? Or things in his pocket or purse? Or maybe this is a slave and he's shackled, and that's why there's so much oxidized iron around."
[This Smithsonian scientist's death was a mystery; 150 years later, his skeleton helped solve it]
DNA analysis should reveal more. As soon as the skeleton was found, Foley contacted Hannes Schroeder of the Natural History Museum of Denmark, one of the few places in the world with the technology to sequence highly degraded ancient DNA. Scientists have never successfully sequenced human material that had been submerged in so much saltwater for so long; though remains were uncovered from the 16th- and 17th-century shipwrecks Mary Rose and Vasa, those were found before the advent of next-generation DNA sequencing, which is much more powerful than previous methods.
"It's tricky, because this is such a rare find that we don't have a lot of experience in the field generally," Schroeder said.
Diving operations manager Phillip Short inspects amphoras on the Antikythera shipwreck. (Brett Seymour/EUA/WHOI/ARGO)
On Schroeder's advice, Foley and his colleagues removed the bones from the sea floor one by one. Each was photographed and 3-D-modeled, then placed in a plastic bag with seawater to keep them as close as possible to the conditions under which they survived for 2,100 years.
Now the scientists are waiting on approval from the Greek government to start testing the remains.
"It's a little bit of a race against time," Schroeder said. "Those remains were preserved down there at 50 meters below sea level. If you started changing their environment, they will start degrading quickly."
But Schroeder is optimistic, largely because both of the skeleton's petrous bones are still intact. These ultra-dense bones, which help form the inner ear, are some of the best for recovering ancient DNA. Those results will allow the team to identify the skeleton's ethnicity and begin to flesh out the man behind those scattered bones.
"This kind of thing is really why I became a scientist," Foley said. "This is it."

Fact check: Where do Australians get illegal guns?
Updated
Tracing the source of guns used in crime across Australia is difficult, and the origins of illegal firearms is the subject of significant disagreement among federal lawmakers.
The claim: Nationals Senator Bridget McKenzie says most guns used in crime are illegally imported rather than coming from licensed owners.
Nationals Senator Bridget McKenzie says most guns used in crime are illegally imported rather than coming from licensed owners. The verdict: ABC Fact Check could find no study or evidence that proved the majority of guns used to commit crimes are illegally imported. Comprehensive data on the source of illegal guns in Australia is lacking. Senator McKenzie's claim is baseless.
A recent Australian Crime Commission report on organised crime said a new database being developed will track the full life of a gun, something law enforcement agencies have never been able to do.
But for now, where illegal guns come from remains a hotly debated topic.
A Senate inquiry into managing gun-related violence resulted in two reports: one signed by the committee chair, Greens Senator Penny Wright, and Labor Senator Joe Ludwig; and a second signed by three Coalition Senators and Liberal Democrats Senator David Leyonhjelm.
When the reports were tabled on April 10, Victorian Nationals Senator Bridget McKenzie accused Senator Wright of "waging a relentless scare campaign trying to demonise licensed and responsible firearms owners".
"What we have found is clear evidence provided by witnesses, including law enforcement agencies, that most guns used to commit a crime do not originate from licensed firearms owners but are in fact illegally imported," Senator McKenzie said in a media release.
Is it true that most guns used to commit crime are illegally imported? ABC Fact Check investigates.
Illegally imported guns
Senator McKenzie claims that most guns used to commit crimes don't come from licensed owners.
The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service told the Senate inquiry that in 2013-14, it found 1,737 undeclared firearms, parts and accessories that people had tried to import illegally into Australia, of which 80 were guns.
Karen Harfield, national director of intelligence for Customs and Border Protection, told the inquiry it was impossible to know how many guns came into Australia illegally.
"We are talking about an illicit market. So in relation to how many times it happens, the answer is, we do not know what we do not know," Mrs Harfield told the inquiry.
The Australian Crime Commission told the inquiry that its National Firearm Trace Database showed that only 1 per cent of guns that ended up in the black market were illegally imported.
The figures for firearms thefts do not appear to support the contention that they are a major source of firearms fuelling gun crime in NSW. NSW Police
However, a submission from the NSW Police took a different view.
It said its Strike Force Maxworthy, established in 2012 to investigate illegal firearms arriving from overseas, found 140 ammunition magazines for Glock pistols had been imported by mail, ready for reassembly.
Twelve assembled Glock pistols were recovered in raids. This compared with 25 handguns stolen in NSW in 2013-14.
"When compared to the number of handguns identified as having been illegally imported through operations such as Strike Force Maxworthy, the figures for firearms thefts do not appear to support the contention that they are a major source of firearms fuelling gun crime in NSW," the NSW Police submission said.
Roderic Broadhurst, professor of criminology at ANU, told Fact Check it is impossible to know how many guns are smuggled.
He said that on "dark net" websites like Silk Road, guns were "big ticket" items, which could be sent in bits by post.
"Many weapons nowadays, apart from perhaps the barrel, are made from plastic – not too easily detectable by X-ray machines and so on," he said.
"The reality is you can't inspect every box, every container, and you'd be doing pretty well to do 4 to 5 per cent, because the volumes are huge."
He said guns could also now be made on 3D printers.
For more on 3D-printed guns, read this fact file.
Tracing illicit guns
Samantha Bricknell, research manager of the Australian Institute of Criminology's violence and exploitation research program, told Fact-Check the National Firearm Trace Database was the best data source on illegal guns.
It tracks unregistered guns seized by law enforcement agencies.
The Crime Commission's evidence to the Senate that only a small percentage of illicit guns were imported came from its trace database.
Dr Bricknell took the trace database records of 2,750 firearms seized up to 2012 and analysed their sources in a 2012 report.
A source could be determined for only a small proportion of the guns. Of those, theft was the most common, accounting for 39 per cent of the handguns, and 10 per cent of seized rifles and shotguns.
Less than 2 per cent of long-barrel guns and between 4 and 17 per cent of handguns had been smuggled into Australia.
However, the report said the large proportion of guns whose source could not be determined limited the conclusions that could be drawn about who originally owned the guns and whether they had been illegally imported.
The report also could not say whether or not the guns had been used to commit a crime.
Legal guns that became illegal
By far the biggest category of seized rifles and shotguns from the trace database - 88 per cent - were those whose source could not be determined.
These were guns that should have been registered or surrendered after law reforms in 1996.
The reforms were introduced after the Port Arthur massacre, when a National Firearms Agreement was implemented to standardise gun registration in the different states and territories, and the people licensed to own and use them.
Dr Bricknell said in her report that some owners deliberately disobeyed the new rules, but in some cases the guns had been misplaced, lost or forgotten about.
No-one knows whether these guns are owned by licensed or unlicensed owners.
An example of the lack of data can be found in a review into the 2014 Martin Place siege, which said it was possible that the sawn-off pump action shotgun used by Man Haron Monis was imported legally to Australia in the 1950s.
At the time there was no requirement for the importer to register it, or for the owner to have a permit to use it, so it was possible the gun was not handed in during the buyback and therefore "may have been invisible to authorities since its importation," the review said.
The Crime Commission's national manager of intelligence, John Moss, gave the Senate inquiry an example of a woman who handed in a semi-automatic pistol to a Queensland police station in October 2014.
The commission traced the gun and found it had been manufactured in 1937 and last seen in 1940.
"It was delivered to the Queensland police station functional - 75 years later - with no data existing in our systems across the nation," Dr Moss said.
The size of the illegal market
The Institute of Criminology's study shows that guns not surrendered or registered in 1996 are a potentially large source of guns that fall into the hands of criminals.
In 2012, the Crime Commission assessed the illegal firearms market in response to shootings in Western Sydney and Adelaide.
Data on 3,186 guns from the National Firearm Trace Database was used, along with data from the US online firearm tracing system.
The full report wasn't made public but key data was released by Jason Clare, then police and justice minister.
It found:
There were 2.75 million registered guns in Australia held by 730,000 licence holders
Conservatively estimated there were 250,000 long barrel guns and 10,000 handguns in the illegal firearms market
Guns in the illegal market stayed in circulation for decades - the oldest traced gun was a functioning revolver manufactured in 1888
Like the institute's study, the commission's report showed that theft was a greater source of illegal guns than those illegally imported, and by far the biggest source was guns not surrendered or registered in 1996.
The report signed by Senator McKenzie did not accept the commission's estimate that there were 250,000 long barrel guns and 10,000 handguns held illegally in the community.
It criticised the sample size and pointed to a statement in Mr Clare's media release that for a third of requested traces, there was insufficient information to work out where they came from.
The report Senator McKenzie signed also said: "One of the difficulties encountered by this inquiry has been the inability of the committee to ascertain, with any degree of certainty, where the majority of the illicit guns originate and the size of the illegal gun market."
Stolen guns used in crime
Unlicensed guns stolen from licensed owners is one possible source of illegal guns.
When Fact Check asked Senator McKenzie for the basis of her claim, her office responded with information presented to the Senate inquiry and highlighted data from the Institute of Criminology's National Firearm Theft Monitoring Program.
The institute's report, Firearm Theft in Australia, showed that 1,545 firearms were reported stolen between 2004-05 and 2008-09.
Ninety per cent were registered and nearly 90 per cent of the people who reported the thefts held the appropriate licence for the stolen gun.
Only 3 per cent (10 incidents and 51 firearms) of guns stolen were then used in a crime or were found in possession of someone charged with a serious offence.
However, the report noted that data on all variables was not provided by the Northern Territory, and Western Australia did not provide data for 2008-09.
Dr Bricknell said the data did not include thefts that owners chose not to report because the gun was not registered, or because the owner was not licensed.
The Institute of Criminology's deputy director Rick Brown told the inquiry: "We really do not know how many of those that are stolen subsequently get used for the purposes of organised crime. We have no way of estimating that."
The bottom line
The Crime Commission told the inquiry that "theft remains a primary method of diverting firearms to the illicit market".
There was "some evidence" of illegal importing, "although ACC data indicate that these comprise a small proportion of all firearms diverted into the black market," it said.
The Australian Federal Police took a similar view.
Assistant Commissioner Julian Slater told the committee: "Certainly the data I have seen recently in relation to thefts are numbers that are substantially greater than what we are seeing seized at the border."
However, neither authority specified that these guns had necessarily been used in crimes.
Fact Check could not find any study that comprehensively addresses the claim made by Senator McKenzie.
Crime Commission and Institute of Criminology studies show that theft accounts for more guns seized by police than illegal importation, but these studies don't show whether the stolen guns came from licensed owners, nor whether they were used to commit a crime.
In addition, a large number of illegal guns are in circulation that used to be legally held, but there's no way of knowing whether they are in the hands of licensed or unlicensed owners.
The institute's National Firearm Theft Monitoring Program shows that only 3 per cent of guns stolen from licensed firearm owners are used to commit crime, but it includes few unlicensed guns, whose theft is usually not reported.
The verdict
Senator McKenzie's claim that most guns used to commit a crime are illegally imported rather than coming from licensed gun owners can't be verified by data.
The Senate inquiry report she herself signed emphasises the uncertainty of the number and sources of illegal guns.
Her claim is baseless.

The Government intends to extend the entitlement to vote in Seanad elections to all third-level graduates “as a small first step” towards the reform of the Upper House, Taoiseach Enda Kenny has said.
In a speech last night to the Fine Gael national conference in Limerick, Mr Kenny said the outcome of last week's Seanad abolition referendum was clear and that the Government would continue to reform the political system and ensure the Seanad was “as effective as possible”.
A 1979 referendum on extending the Seanad franchise to graduates of “any other institutions of higher education in the State” was emphatically passed but the measure has not been enacted to date. At present, graduates of the National University of Ireland and Trinity College Dublin each elect three senators.
“I intend to discuss this with other leaders in the coming weeks and, as a small first step, I have asked that legislation be prepared to give effect to the 1979 decision of the Irish people to extend the Seanad electorate to all graduates,” said Mr Kenny, who was behind the idea to hold last week's referendum.
On the economy, the Taoiseach said Ireland was on track to exit its EU-IMF bailout on December 15th and, while this did not mean the State's financial troubles would be over, he pledged “we won't go back”.
“Yes, there are still fragile times ahead. There's still a long way to go. But at last, the era of the bailout will be no-more. The economic emergency will be over.”
In order to plan for life after the bailout, Mr Kenny said the Government would publish a medium term economic strategy before the end of the year.
“We will use our economic freedom to return Ireland to full employment and to plan for better living standards across the country,” he said.
Mr Kenny said Tuesday's budget would be “tough” but that the key objectives, to invest in creating jobs and reaching bailout targets, were in the public interest.
On social issues, Mr Kenny said the Government's decision to bring the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill “was the right thing for the women of Ireland” and achieved “a delicate balance” that protected the life of mother and baby.
He said previous governments had steered well clear of the issue but he as Taoiseach was “convinced of the need to provide that clarity” to medical professionals and comfort to expectant mothers.
A group of anti-abortion protestors gathered outside the conference at the South Court Hotel yesterday urging Fine Gael to repeal the law and their demonstration could be heard in the auditorium as Mr Kenny delivered his televised address.
Mr Kenny said the Government had overhauled bankruptcy laws and created the Personal Insolvency Service in an effort to rebalance the rights of borrower and lender.
“We have made it very clear to banks, and they have agreed that by the end of next year, they must have reached sustainable arrangements with the vast majority of mortgage-holders in distress,” he said.
“Because that distress is not just financial. It's emotional, psychological, physical, it's in every corner of our country. And it must be relieved if people are to get on with their lives and our country is to heal.”
Mr Kenny said the State was making progress addressing unemployment but that there were still too many people out of work and leaving the country.
He thanked the public for “your sacrifice, your patience” given the fact people were living with lower salaries and higher costs.
“Yes, we still have a long way to go. But because of what you did at your end of the bargain, finally, there are better days ahead.”
Garbage dump landslide kills over 110 in Ethiopia
By Eddie Haywood
18 March 2017
In the early morning hours of March 11, a devastating landslide swept through the Koshe Garbage Landfill located on the outskirts of the capital city Addis Ababa, burying a number of makeshift homes under tons of refuse, claiming scores of lives and leaving many others injured.
On Thursday, emergency workers at the landfill told reporters that the death toll had reached 113 and was expected to climb. As many as 150 people are believed to have been at the site at the time of the landslide. Several days after the catastrophe, rescue efforts were still ongoing.
The landfill at Koshe has been the dumping ground for Addis Ababa for over five decades, and is home to some of the poorest residents of the city. Makeshift houses for these residents were constructed from cardboard and other debris found in the dump. On any given day, as many as 500 people make a living scavenging through the garbage dump.
The slums surrounding the massive garbage dump are home to the most economically marginalized and poorest Ethiopians.
Survivors of the landslide reported that the government was slow to organize a rescue operation. When rescue workers were finally dispatched to the landfill residents began to voice their outrage at the government's slow response, pushing and shoving rescue workers.
“Nobody is helping us. We are doing all the digging ourselves. It is shameful,” Kaleab Tsegaye, a relative of one of the landslide victims, told Reuters.
Werknesh, a mother who had resided at the landfill for 30 years, told Voice of America that she had lost six family members to the landslide, including her pregnant daughter and three grandchildren.
“Our children are covered under the soil,” she said. “It sounded like an explosion, and then covered everyone with soil. There are bodies that have not been found until now.” Werknesh criticized the governmen's slow response, saying, “The government didn't even order an excavator. I had to pay for an excavator out of my own pocket.”
Excavation operations at the dump have recovered many of the dead. Tebeju Asres, a resident at the landfill observing a backhoe moving a mass of refuse, told the New York Times, “My house was right inside there. ... My mother and three of my sisters were there when the landslide happened. Now I don't know the fate of all of them.”
The likely cause for the landslide appears to be the development of the site as a source for alternative energy. Construction of a biogas plant near the dump has involved the laying of pipe around and underneath the large landfill, causing massive destabilization underneath the location of many of the makeshift shanties where most of the landfill dwellers reside.
The city government is now moving to utilize the tragedy of the landslide to forcibly relocate the landfill's surviving residents. Decades-long squabbles between residents and the city have resulted in occasional violent clashes between the landfill dwellers and city officials, who have given the landfill over to wealthy interests wishing to develop the site as a source for the production of methane gas as an alternative fuel for electricity.
UK-based Cambridge Industries, the corporation that owns the biogas plant, is under a government contract to develop the site as a source of methane gas, making the claim that methane produced from the dump can give electrical power to as much as 25 percent of Addis Ababa's four million residents.
Cynically, the national government of Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn declared a three-day nationwide mourning for the victims of the landslide. Desalegn, briefing members of the Ethiopian parliament, expressed his “deep condolences” to the victims of the landslide.
Koshe, which in local slang translates to “dirt,” perfectly encapsulates the government's callous outlook toward the denizens of the landfill.
The deplorable economic conditions for the informal residents at Koshe are by no means isolated. The majority of Ethiopians live under conditions of extreme poverty, with some 78 percent of Ethiopians subsisting on $2 a day or less. According to Oxford University, Ethiopia ranks number 10 out of the world's 10 poorest countries.
According to the nonprofit organization the Borgen Project, life expectancy at birth in the country is at an extremely low 59 years. Only about 34 percent of Ethiopia's rural population has access to improved water sources. Preventable diseases, including malaria, account for 60 percent of all health problems. Illiteracy grips two-thirds of Ethiopians, underscoring the lack of social spending on education for the masses.
At the other end of the scale, there has been an obscene accumulation of wealth for the richest Ethiopians. Just one man, Ethiopian businessman Mohammed Hussein al Amoudi, has amassed a personal wealth of over $10 billion. Additionally, Ethiopia has one of Africa's highest rates of GDP growth. According to the World Bank, national output grew by $60 billion between 2004 and 2014. Ethiopia, like most of Africa, is rich in vast economic resources, but those resources are controlled by a handful of the wealthiest Ethiopians.
The Ethiopian elite have been faithful servants to Washington and its agenda for the Horn of Africa, deploying the country's military forces to wage bloody wars in Somalia and South Sudan, two countries that are integral to Washington's aim of isolating China's growing economic influence on the continent, which is seen as a threat by the US elites.
The landslide tragedy at Koshe demonstrates that the capitalist government in Addis Ababa is unable to guarantee safe housing, let alone provide even the paltriest relief for the victims of the latest disaster. In a world driven by capitalism's unquenchable appetite for profit, such disasters will remain a permanent feature of everyday life for the world's working class and poor.

Saturn is so beautiful that it would be next to impossible to pick what would be my favorite picture of it ever.
Impossible until now. Because HOLY HALEAKALA Croatian software developer and “amateur” astronomical image processor Gordan Ugarkovic has created a picture of Saturn so stunning words fail me.
Seriously, try, if you can, to take this in:
Saturn.

Look. I had to shrink the original 4000 x 3200 pixel behemoth to fit this blog. So please, click that picture to see it in full resolution. It's staggering.
OK, you should know by now that words never fail me. Let me take you on a journey, one that's 1.6 billion kilometers long…
On Oct. 10, 2013, Cassini took 36 shots of Saturn, a dozen each using red, green, and blue filters which approximate true color. Ugarkovic grabbed the raw files, processed them, and assembled them into this mosaic.
The detail is incredible. Cassini was high above Saturn to the north, looking “down” on the ringed world when it took these images. You can see the bizarre hexagonal north polar vortex, the six-sided jet stream flowing around Saturn. The subtle but beautiful bands mark the cloud tops of Saturn's atmosphere. Unless I'm mistaken, the thin white line you see wrapping around the planet at mid-latitude is the remnant of a vast storm so huge it completely dwarfed our own home world of Earth. And if you look carefully (you can measure it!) you can see that Saturn is highly flattened, its equatorial diameter wider than through the poles.
But dominating this jaw-dropping scene are Saturn's magnificent rings, seen here far more circular than usual. Cassini's mission has been to observe Saturn and its moons, which means it tends to stay near the planet's equator. But now scientists are playing with the orbit more, to do more interesting science. The spacecraft is swinging well out of the equatorial plane, so here we see the rings at a much steeper angle, and they are less affected by perspective.
They jump out in this portrait. The broad, bright B ring in the middle; the outer, darker A ring; the fainter, inner C ring. You can see the dark gap called the Cassini Division (named for the astronomer after which the spacecraft itself is named), carved out by the gravity of the moon Mimas. The narrower groove near the edge of the outer A ring is the Encke Gap, created by the tiny moon Pan — that gap may look narrow, but it's 325 km across, roughly the distance from Washington, D. C. to New York City.
Just outside the main rings you can catch a glimpse of the narrow F ring (you have to look at the high-res image and zoom in to see it). At about the two o'clock position is, I believe, the moon Prometheus, and at about one o'clock is Pandora. They orbit just inside and outside (respectively) the F ring, acting as “shepherd moons”, whose gravity keeps the ring confined to such a narrow band.
Also, note how you can faintly see the dark side of Saturn, to the left. The clouds on that side of the planet are not being lit by the Sun, but by the reflected light from the rings themselves! In the same way our own Moon can be bright enough to read by, Saturn's rings illuminate its night. Imagine: Saturn, by ringshine.
And, of course, the shadow of the mighty planet falls across the rings, blacking them out. This image reminds me strongly of another favorite Saturn shot, taken by Voyager 1 in 1980. But Cassini's advances in technology, coupled with Ugarkovic's master touch, have easily replaced it.
There is just something about Saturn. It profoundly affects all of us when we see it, and was the first object I ever saw through a telescope when I was a lad. It is no exaggeration to say I am an astronomer today because of that first glimpse. And after all these years, it never, ever gets old.
A profoundly deep tip o' the lens cap to Emily Lakdawalla at The Planetary Society blog for tweeting about this picture. If you're on Twitter, follow her.

What's occurring right now in America is a war on Whites. It's an endless cycle of discriminatory practices and an attempt to erase and rewrite history.

White Nationalism doesn't mean White Supremacy and it's not about hate at all. Most of what the far right is advocating for is the protection of the culture and history which is being assaulted full frontal full speed ahead.

Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who recently joined the Republican primary carnival in an “official” way, says the government should reauthorize the Patriot Act in response to the murder of four Marines in Chattanooga, Tenn., by a 24-year-old gunman.
And he suggested that changing a policy that stops military personnel from carrying weapons in certain civilian areas would have prevented the attack. Those policies “are outdated,” Mr. Walker said on Fox News, because the United States is “at war and radical Islamic terrorism is our enemy.”
After a career criminal who had illegally entered the United States killed a San Francisco woman on July 1, Bill O'Reilly demanded that Congress pass a law that would impose mandatory sentences on people who repeatedly enter the country illegally and members of the right-wing Republican caucus in the House eagerly responded.
The idea was that such a law, along with another proposal to strip cities of federal funds if their police are not required to turn over all undocumented people to the federal government, would prevent shootings like the one in San Francisco.
This leaves me a little confused.
After any highly publicized killing – like the murders in Charleston, or Newtown, or in any number of other places — advocates of gun control call for greater restrictions on the sale and use of firearms. And people on the right, like Mr. O'Reilly and Mr. Walker, reliably respond by saying that no law could have prevented those killings.
So, which is it? Can no law stop a determined person from killing another human being? Or can laws do that? It would be inconsistent, if not hypocritical, to take both positions, so there must be some logical explanation.
Mr. Walker and the Fox host Megyn Kelly tut-tutted about the fact that President Obama did not immediately call the Chattanooga killer a Muslim terrorist. They had no idea at the time whether that was true, but the point of the exchange was to attack Mr. Obama. They used it to revive another favorite talking point – that the president did not quickly label the attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi as a terrorist attack (even though he actually did).
Oddly enough – or maybe not oddly at all – Mr. Walker called the murder of nine African Americans in a Charleston church a “racist” and “evil” act, but neither he, nor any other Republican candidate or public figure that I can find called it an act of terrorism, which is precisely what it was.
Senator Lindsey Graham, another Republican presidential poser, called it “racial jihadism,” but that was mainly to deflect attention from the real motivations for the murders and toss that “jihad” word out there.
I'm sure there is a logical explanation for that, too.
Celebrities aren't the only ones giving their babies unusual names. Compared with decades ago, parents are choosing less common names for kids, which could suggest an emphasis on uniqueness and individualism, according to new research.
Essentially, today's kids (and later adults) will stand out from classmates. For instance, in the 1950s, the average first-grade class of 30 children would have had at least one boy named James (top name in 1950), while in 2013, six classes will be necessary to find only one Jacob, even though that was the most common boys' name in 2007.
The researchers suspect the uptick of unusual baby names could be a sign of a change in culture from one that applauded fitting in to today's emphasis on being unique and standing out. When taken too far, however, this individualism could also lead to narcissism, according to study researcher Jean Twenge, of San Diego State University.
Baby naming history
The results come from an analysis of 325 million baby names recorded by the Social Security Administration from 1880 to 2007. The research team figured out the percentage of babies given the most popular name or a name among the 10, 20, or 50 most popular for that year and sex. Since it wasn't required that people get a social security card until 1937, names before that time may not be random samples of the population, the researchers note.
Results showed parents were less likely to choose those popular names as time went on. For instance, in the late 1800s and early 1900s, about 5 percent of babies were named the top common name, while more recently that dropped to 1 percent.
About 40 percent of boys received one of the 10 most common names in the 1880s, while now fewer than 10 percent do.
For girls, the percentage with a top-10 name dropped from 25 percent in about 1945 to 8 percent in 2007.
Similar results were seen for the top-50 names. About half of girls received one of the 50 most popular names until the mid-20th century. Now, just one in four have these names.
(A list of top-10 baby names by year, and their popularity, can be found here.)
This trend in baby-naming didn't show a constant decrease. Between 1880 and 1919, fewer parents were giving their children common names, though from 1920 to the 1940s common names were used more often than before. Then, when baby boomers came on the scene, so did more unusual names.
The biggest decrease in usage of common names came in the 1990s, said Twenge, who is also an author of "The Narcissism Epidemic: Living in the Age of Entitlement" (Free Press, 2009) and "Generation Me: Why Today's Young Americans Are More Confident, Assertive, Entitled – and More Miserable Than Ever Before" (Free Press, 2007).
Naming narcissists
The results held even when the researchers accounted for immigration rates and increasing Latino populations, which could bring relatively less common names into the mix.
"The most compelling explanation left is this idea that parents are much more focused on their children standing out," Twenge told LiveScience. "There's been this cultural shift toward focusing on the individual, toward standing out and being unique as opposed to fitting in with the group and following the rules."
The positive side of individualism, Twenge said, is that there is less prejudice and more tolerance for minority groups. But she warns that when individualism is taken too far, the result is narcissism.
"I think it is an indication of our culture becoming more narcissistic," Twenge said.
Past research has shown that back in the 1950s parents placed a lot of importance on a child being obedient, which has gone way down. "Parenting has become more permissive and more child-focused and [parents] are much more reluctant to be authority figures," Twenge said.
As for whether these unusually named kids will have personalities to match is not known.
"It remains to be seen whether having a unique name necessarily leads to narcissism later in life," Twenge said. "If that unique name is part of a parent's overall philosophy that their child is special and needs to stand out and that fitting in is a bad thing, then that could lead to those personality traits."
The research, which is detailed in the January issue of the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science, also included Emodish M. Abebe of SDSU and W. Keith Campbell of the University of Georgia in Athens.
A few notes.
First, I published an article in New Matilda last week about the Australian Defence League.
Secondly, one of the groupuscules I referred to in the article, the Party for Freedom, was to have held a public meeting at Redfern Town Hall on Thursday, February 6, to discuss how awful Africans are. The Party has now transferred the venue to Humanist House in Chippendale.
Or maybe not.
According to Party Chairman Nicholas Hunter-Folkes — the man who believes Third World peoples, including Africans, ought to be sterilised so as to keep them from reproducing — leftists have forced management at the House to cancel the meeting. In addition, the Party's website was allegedly subject to a DDOS attack on the weekend.
Further details of the non-meeting may be obtained from either Nick on 0417-679 972 or [email protected] and/or Andy on 0434-559485 or [email protected]
(Note that Humanist House was the subject of an unsuccessful coup attempt by neo-Nazis in 2010.)
Finally, four men were found guilty last week in a Perth court for distributing racist stickers promoting Combat 18 — stickers also being distributed by boneheads in Melbourne's northern suburbs. One of the men convicted, Jacob Marshall Hort, was previously responsible for administering a Combat 18 website (terrormachine.net) and played in the band ‘Indigenous Hate'. In July 2010, Hort was convicted of criminal damage and discharging a firearm stemming from an incident in which several shots were fired at the Queens Park Suleymaniye Mosque, causing $15,000 damage.
Note that Hort & Co have been denounced by ‘Blood & Honour Australia' (that faction aligned with the Hammerskins) as liars and traitors; his (former?) C18 comrade, Bradley Trappitt, has since been welcomed into the New Right/'national anarchist' camp by its leader Welf Herfurth. What this means for relations between B&H/C18, B&H/SCHS, the New Right and Volksfront is unclear at this stage.
Four men fined over racial hate stickers
Kalamunda Reporter
January 28, 2014 A HIGH Wycombe man was among four men fined a total of $8200 in Armadale Magistrates Court for placing racially motivated stickers across a number of Perth suburbs, including Midland and Glen Forrest. Jacob Marshall Hort (27) and three other men, aged in their 20s and 30s, faced a total of 28 charges of criminal damage for posting the stickers on property, including shopping centres, rubbish bins, an ATM and car parking signs. The WA police State security investigation group began an investigation into the group after a front-page report published in the Hills Gazette's sister paper Midland-Kalamunda Reporter in February of last year. The report detailed the stickers, which showed a swastika and a man clad in a balaclava with his arm in a nazi salute, together with website details, an email address and contact mobile phone number, had been placed on a City of Swan carpark sign, on The Avenue, asking residents to “support your local skinheads”. The group was charged in August and September after an extensive police investigation. The court heard five men had placed stickers in Cannington, Maddington, Gosnells, Thornlie and Seville Grove. Desmond Liddington (29), of Busselton, Jordan Richard Dyer (29), of Bunbury, and Toby Adam Middlecoat (39), of Carlisle, were also convicted, along with Hort. A Westminster man (36) failed to appear in court and an arrest warrant has been issued.
PS. Oh yeah. A handful of members of the Australia First Party attempted to disrupt a march on Invasion Day in Brisbane.
Five best friends, all students at Francis Polytechnic High School, have been accepted into the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Kathy Vara reports for the NBC4 News at 5 p.m. on Tuesday, April 8, 2014. (Published Tuesday, April 8, 2014)
They are five friends, five students at Polytechnic High School and, as of last week, five new MIT admits.
The Los Angeles Unified School District announced Friday that five students from Polytechnic High School's Math/Science Magnet had been admitted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
"To be honest with you, I cried," student GiMin Choi said. "The fact that all of us got it in, it's just more happiness to share"
Ari Bennett, principal of Polytechnic High School, said he is "in awe of our MIT 5."
"Each one represents the caliber and high standards of our Math/Science Magnet at Poly. Congratulations to these wizards of technology who will change the world one atom at a time," Bennett said.
Those so-called wizards of technology are Raymundo Cano, Andrew Koh, Kevin Escobar Rodriguez, GiMin Choi and William Lopez-Cordero.
"Its just surreal," Rodriguez said.
The five students shared their excitement with NBC4 Tuesday.
"I have to admit, even to this day I still open my decision page and read the whole letter, it seems so unreal," Cano said.
It addition to MIT, all five students were accepted to other top universities. Cano was also accepted Harvard - a university just down the street from MIT.
MIT, considered the nation's premier program for science and technology, will allow the students to explore their passions.
Choi wants to study either environmental engineering or computer science. Koh is also interested in computer science, but added that he is also interested in biology applications as well. Cano may join his friends in the computer science field, but is also considering a mathematics major.
Lopez-Cordero wants to work at NASA. Rodriguez wants to eventually work in robotics.
Regardless of their field of study, the friends are just happy they're making the transition to college together.
“Normally after high school, that's where friendships split. But at least our little crew is going to stay together,” Rodriguez said.
TOKYO (AFP) - Chinese ships sailed into disputed waters off Japan-administered islands in the East China Sea on Friday, officials said, after G7 leaders cautioned against "intimidation" in territorial disputes.
The Japanese coastguard said two vessels entered the 12-nautical-mile band of territorial waters around one of the Senkaku islands, which China also claims and calls the Diaoyus, at 10am (0100 GMT).
"The two ships were initially spotted about 27km west of Uotsurijima, but they have now entered the Japanese territorial waters," a coast guard official said.
For over a year after Tokyo nationalised some of the islands in September 2012, Chinese vessels and aircraft regularly approached, playing cat and mouse with the Japanese coastguard.
There has been a marked decrease in incidents this year - Friday's was only the 13th - although each episode has tended to come in apparent response to events in the larger relationship.
The Chinese move came after leaders of the Group of Seven, who met in Brussels, warned against any use of force in the East and South China Sea, where Beijing is involved in disputes with several countries.
"We are deeply concerned by tensions in the East and South China Sea," the leaders said in a statement at the end of a first day of talks in the Belgian capital.
"We oppose any unilateral attempt by any party to assert its territorial or maritime claims through the use of intimidation, coercion or force."
The statement, which did not mention any country by name, called on all countries to follow international law in resolving competing claims.
In recent months, China has ramped up its activity in the South China Sea, which Beijing claims almost in its entirety.
Chinese and Vietnamese vessels have sparred near the site of a drilling rig that Beijing moved into disputed waters, with one boat sinking after an apparent collision.
A longstanding mystery surrounding the deaths of 3,000 soldiers from Napoleon's army found in a mass grave in Lithuania has been solved.
The jumbled bones of the men who died on the French leader's ill fated attempt to march on Moscow in 1812 show signs of starvation, according to archaeologists from the University of Central Florida.
According to Forbes, buttons found on the site, which was first discovered in Lithuanian capital Vilnius in 2002, show over 40 different regiments were represented from Napoleon's army as they made their desperate dash back across Europe.

Around 500,000 in the Emperor's army began their long march to Moscow in June 1812, but by the time they were stumbling back to Vilnius in retreat six months later only 40,000 had survived.
Around 20,000 men were believed to have died of hypothermia, starvation and typhus in Vilnius alone.
This failure was seen as the beginning of Napoleon's downfall from power in France, which led to his temporary exile in 1814 before his imprisonment by Britain following the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.

Today, July 31, we acknowledge "Equal Pay Day" for Black women in this country, a day that marks the number of days into the next year that Black women on average ​would need to work to earn the same amount their white male counterparts made in the year prior.
Black women make only 63 cents on average for every dollar a white man is paid. This may not seem like a significant difference, but 37 cents on each dollar earned adds up to a devastating economic disadvantage for Black women and their families. And, it's a larger disparity than the average American woman faces — 80 cents on the dollar.
Think of it like this. Imagine you were running a race. If you're a Black woman, you would start days​ behind many others. That's not fair.
In order to make what their white male counterparts have made by the age of 60, Black women would have to work until they're in their 80s. In total, by the end of their careers, on average Black women will have made $840,040 less than their white male counterparts.
Eight out of every 10 Black mothers are their family's breadwinner.
This isn't just about the individual woman. This is also about the families they support. Eight out of every 10 Black mothers are their family's breadwinner. For the average family, if the wage gap was closed, that family could afford 19 more months of mortgage payments, 43 more months of child care, or more than 11,600 additional gallons of gas.
This pay disparity is not a reality we should accept. We need to do more to combat the economic injustices that exist at the intersection of gender and race.
So, what do we do?
Advocate For Pay Transparency
Well, we need to pay transparency in our workplaces so more women have the ability to negotiate their salaries and fight pay discrimination.
We need to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill I've co-sponsored, which requires employers to show that pay differences are not due to gender, and cracks down on employers who break the rules or punish employees who seek to be paid equally.
But that isn't enough. We must address the disproportionate number of Black women who are stuck in low-paying jobs.
Prepare Black Women For Better Jobs
We need to prepare Black women and girls for good-paying jobs in growing fields. Right now, Black women are about 7 percent of the population, but make up just 2 percent of scientists and engineers. We need to fix that.
It's time to address the underlying issues in our education system that push Black girls out of the classroom and limit their education opportunities even before they reach college. It's time to pass laws that incentivize companies and schools to increase opportunities for technical training and mentoring in the STEM field. And, it's time to get creative.
The image of STEM jobs in the media has the potential to shape perceptions of that field. Let's work with the media and entertainment industry to raise awareness and pique interest in these jobs.
We also need to address the fact that a disproportionate number of Black women are working in minimum and subminimum wage jobs and are struggling just to make ends meet.
Raise The Minimum Wage
It's a fact that jobs in male-dominated fields tend to make more than jobs in fields dominated by women. This is a problem that plagues all skill levels, and it impacts Black women in particular. About 28 percent of employed Black women work in what are called "service occupations" — professions like nannies, caregivers, and house cleaners.
These jobs are undervalued. You may be surprised to learn that on average, a childcare provider is paid less than a janitor or a dog trainer. Not only are these women making less than comparable jobs in male-dominated fields, many of them are only making the federal minimum wage of $7.25. On top of that, these jobs often don't have important benefits like paid sick days. This should not be the case.
We need to raise the federal minimum wage. If we raised the minimum wage to $15 an hour, 4 million black women would see their incomes rise. At the same time, we also need to challenge the societal norms that devalue these jobs and the outdated policies that make having a job and caring for a family a near-impossible balancing act.
Get To Work
We've got work to do, so I'll leave you with a promise and a request. I promise to do all I can to advocate for these laws in the halls of our Capitol, and to seek out other ​solutions to these inequalities. My request of you is to make your voice heard on this issue. Talk to your representatives. Take a moment today to call or write and tell them these issues matter to you.
I believe together, we're a force that cannot be dismissed or written off to the sidelines and we can make real, meaningful progress toward addressing these economic injustices.
For 17 months, since the Minsk Agreements were signed in February 2015 to try to bring peace to the eastern Ukraine the Kiev regime, and its neo-Nazi and NATO allies, have been preparing for a new offensive against the east Ukraine republics. On July 22nd the Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin stated in a letter to the UN Security Council that “a relapse of large-scale military operations in eastern Ukraine may bury the process of peace settlement there.” He then called on Kiev's allies to pressure Kiev to back off its war preparations which include the continuous shelling of civilian areas by Ukraine heavy and medium artillery and constant probing attacks by Ukraine and foreign units over the past spring and summer months.
The commander of the Donetsk Republic forces stated in a communiqué on July 22 that the region along the contact line between the two sides was shelled 3,566 times in one week alone ending on the date of the communiqué and confirmed the information set out in Churkin's letter and reports of the Organisation For Security Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) that the Kiev regime had transferred more heavy artillery, mortars, tanks, multiple rocket launchers to the front.
The shelling has destroyed civilian housing, a water treatment plant and other infrastructure with the clear objective of forcing out the residents and to prepare the ground for a large scale offensive. Ambassador Churkin added that not only were regular Kiev forces massing in the east but they had also deployed the new-Nazi Azov and Donbas “volunteer” battalions, and that Kiev has begun a wide ranging seizure of land in the neutral zone and the towns located there.
Of course the blame for all these criminal actions by NATO and its marionettes in Kiev are placed on Russia as we have seen set out in both the Atlantic Council Report earlier this year and in the NATO Warsaw Communiqué on July 9th in which NATO put the ultimatum to Russia, “do what we say or you will see what we will do”. The day before Ambassador Churkin sent his letter to the Security Council, the French Foreign Minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, in a speech at the Centre of Strategic and International Studies stated that the “sanctions”, that is, the economic war being carried out against Russia by the NATO countries, would only stop if Russia did what it was told.
The Germans have also made noises about being prepared to halt this economic warfare against Russia, about how much they regret it and how they desire only peace and harmony, but, again, only if Russia adheres to their demands.
The attacks on the Donbas republic civilian areas are of course war crimes and crimes against humanity to which the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court responds with her practiced silence despite the fact she has accepted two letters from the Kiev regime providing the ICC with jurisdiction to prosecute war crimes committed there. But, of course, neither Kiev, nor their NATO bosses that control the prosecutor of the ICC have any intention of laying war crimes charges against themselves.
The Russian fear of a renewed offensive against the Donbas republics is a real one since the Warsaw Communiqué issued by NATO on July 9th stated emphatically that NATO does not recognise the republics, that Ukraine needs to be reunited by force if necessary, and that Crimea must be returned to Ukraine. The increased military activity in eastern Ukraine is taking place at the same time that there is increased activity in the Baltic centred on the Russian base at Kaliningrad, a strategic objective for NATO in order to control the Baltic sea lanes and airspace and the approaches to St. Petersburg. Crimea is an objective because of the Russian naval base at Sevastopol, the seizure of which was one of the primary objectives of the NATO coup that overthrew the government of President Yanukovich. It is the main objective in the on going NATO “Sea Breeze” naval exercise in the Black Sea.
The situation has become increasingly dangerous as the war against Russia is conducted without limits, that is, across all sectors of life from the military and economic to sports. The International Olympic Committee has now banned the core of the Russian Olympic track and field team from competing at the Games, plus any others who have faced doping allegations in the past, an act of collective punishment that is totally unjustified since it is based on the dubious statements of a wanted man in Russia, Grigory Rodchenkov, who is singing for his supper in the United States, and will sing any song they want him to. The whole scandal is motivated not by problems with doping, but by an attempt to further isolate Russia from the world and slander its leadership and people. The result is that the Olympic Games will be a farce both as a sports event and as a symbol of peace in the world and should be cancelled or boycotted.
On top of all this, compelling evidence is daily coming out that the attempted coup against the government of Turkey was instigated by the Americans and its partners in other NATO countries in order to stop President Erdoğan from a rapprochement with Russia. The timing alone of the coup indicates that; for it took place just a few days after Erdoğan apologised to President Putin regarding the shoot down of the Russian plane, and just after rumours circulated that they would kick the US out of their base at Incirlik and give it to Russia.
The Turkish government has accused the US of being involved at least indirectly by supporting Turkish Islamist émigré elements led by the cleric, Fethullah Gulen, an arch enemy of President Erdoğan, who resides in the US and appears, to Erdoğan, to be linked to the coup. Stories have also appeared in the Turkish press of the arrest of the two pilots that shot down the Russian plane over Syria, who happen to be, according to the accusations, the same two pilots that attempted to shoot own Erdoğan's plane the night of the coup. It is stated, though not confirmed, in the Turkish press that these two men worked for the CIA.
On Monday July 25th, it was reported in the Turkish press that American General John Campbell, former commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan was central to the planning of the coup and that it was financed with CIA money through meetings at the US base at Incirlik. If these accusations are correct then the attempted coup constitutes act of aggression by the United States and its allies against Turkey, an attack by NATO on a NATO member.
The British on the same day floated a story in the Daly Express that their special forces, the SAS, are ready to go into to Turkey to “rescue UK citizens” in the event of a second coup attempt and predicted civil war in Turkey of there is a second coup attempt. They stated,
“With fears rebels could be about to try to overthrow the government for a second time, which is likely to result in a Turkish civil war, troops have moved into neighbouring Cyprus and are preparing a rescue mission to save stranded Britons.
Defence chiefs have drawn up emergency plans and fully armed soldiers, together with members of the Special Forces Support Group, are ready to fly into areas popular with tourists and help families get home safely.
Hundreds of jets, helicopters and other aircraft will be drafted in to help the estimated 50,000 Brits flee the danger. “
This means that Britain as well as the US are prepared to help a second coup attempt against Erdoğan and further confirms their involvement in the first coup attempt, as does the reported refusal of the Germans to allow Erdoğan's plane to enter German airspace to seek refuge when it appeared he had been overthrown. That decision turned out to be a mistake as he quickly recovered his wits, returned to Turkey and broke the coup.
However this turns out, the principal target remains Russia. Erdoğan's rapprochement with Russia and falling out with NATO weakens NATO in its war against Russia and provides Russia with another card to play, even if it may be the Joker.
Meanwhile in the United States the war against Russia has become a dangerous internal political issue as the Clinton camp accuses Donald Trump of being a Russian agent and his campaign financed by Russian money, essentially accusing Trump of treason. Trump laughs all this off but the fact that these absurdities can even get the attention of the news media shows how desperate things are. The New York Times columnist Andrew Rosenthal wrote a column on the 25th of July with the title “Is Donald Trump Putin's Puppet” then proceeded to state that he was Putin's pet poodle at the least.
But things get even more curious as the FBI states it is investigating whether emails “leaked” by Julian Assange's WikiLeaks organisation, were provided to him by Russia after Russia hacked into the email system of the Democratic National Convention. The Russians deny this absurd charge but so far I have not seen Julian Assange deny that they are his source and we must wonder what his true motivations are if the effect of his “leak” is to have Russia accused of hacking into US government and political party email systems thereby supporting the NATO propaganda against Russia.
It also begs the question as to why Assange would get involved in American party politics at all by publishing emails that would supposedly damage the Clinton campaign for the benefit of the Trump campaign. Is he working for Trump? Is he working for Clinton trying to make it look like Trump works for Russia, or, as is more likely, is he working for those who want to bring down both Trump and Russia? Andrew Rosenthal for the Times, quipped, “it's eerie, at best, that Julian Assange's WikiLeaks chose this moment to release the stolen emails…”
But it is not so “eerie” if the exercise is meant to smear Russia and a candidate for President who is willing to at least talk with the Russians. Perhaps his supporters can ask him and report back what his answer is because his actions raise serious questions as to his motivations, his intentions, and his connections. Someone is playing us. It's about time we found out who.

Autoerotic fatalities are accidental deaths that occur during sexual self-stimulation when an apparatus, device or prop that is being employed to enhance pleasure causes the death.[1] Researchers only apply the term to unintentional deaths resulting from solitary sexual activity, not suicide or acts with a partner.[1] The incidence of autoerotic fatalities in Western countries is around 0.5 per million inhabitants each year.[1]
Autoerotic asphyxia is the leading cause. 70 to 80% of autoerotic deaths are caused by hanging, while 10 to 30% are attributed to plastic bags or chemical use. Both of these lead to autoerotic asphyxia. 5 to 10% are related to electrocution, foreign body insertion, overdressing/body wrapping, or another atypical method.[1] Specific causes include the use of chemicals such as amyl nitrite, GHB, or nitrous oxide, and props and tools such as knives, oversized dildos, ligatures or bags for asphyxiation, duct tape, electrical apparatus for shocks, water for self-immersion, fire-making equipment for self-immolation, or sharp, unhygienic or large fetishized objects. Male victims are much more likely to use a variety of devices during autoerotic behaviour than female victims.
The subject has been treated in two books, Autoerotic Fatalities by Hazelwood et al. (1983) and Autoerotic Asphyxiation: Forensic, Medical, and Social Aspects by Sheleg et al. (2006).

As film reviewers have noted, making a dark, gripping and bleakly funny romp out of the Global Financial Crisis of 2007/8 is no easy task, but one of the best films out this summer, The Big Short, certainly manages it.
It's already widely known that the GFC was caused by an explosion of sub-prime, or bad mortgages and other products, often bundled together, given phony AA ('very safe') ratings, and on-sold to unsuspecting investors.
The housing market became propped up on these illusory financial products until the bubble burst, causing the whole market to collapse and almost tanking the US economy.
It was foreseen by so few people – and those that could see it were derided as bananas - Dita DeBoni
Most of the world continues to grapple with the fallout from the GFC today.
The Big Short tells this sometimes complex story from the point of view of a few oddball outsiders – including one called Michael Burry.
Burry – a real-life person – was one of the few to take a proper look at the loans that had been bundled together and realise they would never be paid back.
He visits all the top investment banks in New York, negotiating with them to pay him out if the housing market collapses.
In the middle of high times, and convinced housing is a safe bet, they accept his seemingly bizarre wager while laughing him out of the room.
His idea is picked up by a handful of other mavericks, some of whom set out to investigate the supposedly booming housing market and find loan sharks, families on the brink of disaster and strippers owning multiple properties, geared up to the hilt.
The ending is as tragic as it is inevitable (although lucrative for the few who had seen it coming).
The interesting thing to me about this movie – and about the whole debacle that underpins the GFC – is that it was foreseen by so few people – and those that could see it were derided as bananas.
The nay-sayers weren't trusted because up against them was an entire industry of supposedly financially astute men in suits, working for the biggest companies in the world, far from stupid and far too significant to be corrupt on such a major scale.
But they were capable of perpetrating an enormous con, as events proved.
Just because we are told that everything's cool by men in suits, it doesn't mean they are always right - Dita DeBoni
It's not just America where financially sober men in suits seem to be able to convince the population that black is white.
There are shades of this scenario playing out in New Zealand right now, as those who fancy themselves superior in the area of economics and business scoff at suggestions the TPP agreement will be anything less than absolutely marvellous for New Zealand.
The smear campaign against people who oppose the TPPA – or see much to question in it – has almost completely stifled proper debate about this game-changing deal.
Doubters have been called 'children', hippies, dirty lefties, communists, 'anti-trade', and much worse.
Even if they are respected economists, doctors, business leaders or even revered rugby players, they are in for a drubbing for questioning the TPPA.
The latest attack lines suggest that because the sky hasn't immediately fallen in, the TPPA must be A-OK.
This, despite well-founded fears of future unintended consequences.
We're also told we've been talking about it for ages, despite little proper analysis in the mainstream media.
Now we're told Maori will benefit from the TPPA. In fact, Maori appear to have the most to lose.
All the while, our police force is co-opted by the Government to stamp out democratic, non-violent protest. And we laugh at North Korea!
It is true that the TPPA may not inflict immediate harm on New Zealand, unlike the collapse of the US housing bubble did during the GFC.
But there is every reason to be concerned, and to want to be listened to, and heard by our own Government concerning an agreement that has potentially enormous negative ramifications for our people and our environment.
THURSDAY, Jan. 26 (HealthDay News) -- The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine Gardasil does not trigger autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, type 1 diabetes or multiple sclerosis, according to a two-year study that included nearly 190,000 girls and women.
Gardasil is recommended in the United States for girls and young women to protect them against HPV infection, which is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States and can lead to cervical cancer. A second HPV vaccine, GlaxoSmithKline's Cervarix, is also approved to prevent infection with the virus.
However, long-standing concerns that the HPV vaccine might trigger autoimmune reactions have led many parents to bar their children from receiving the three-dose vaccine, the study authors pointed out in a news release from Kaiser Permanente.
In the study, which was funded by Gardasil's maker, Merck & Co., researchers analyzed the health records of almost 190,000 females aged 9 to 26 in California who were followed for six months after receiving each dose of Gardasil in 2006-2008.
The Kaiser Permanente researchers said that, compared to females who did not get the shot, vaccinated females did not have higher rates of 16 autoimmune conditions, including lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, Graves' disease, multiple sclerosis, optic neuritis and others.
The study, led by Chun Chao, a research scientist at the Kaiser Permanente department of research and evaluation in Pasadena, Calif., is published in the February issue of the Journal of Internal Medicine.
One expert not connected with the study said the findings were reassuring.
"This study confirms what we had already believed to be true of this vaccine," said Dr. Stephanie Blank, assistant professor in the department of obstetrics and gynecology and director of the gynecologic oncology fellowship at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City. She believes that "the benefits of the HPV vaccine clearly outweigh the risks. The HPV vaccine gives us a great tool -- a means to actually prevent cervical cancer."
An expert in rheumatology agreed.
"This well-designed study looked at a large number of women who received the human papillomavirus vaccine. There did not appear to be an increased risk of developing autoimmune diseases in those vaccinated," said Dr. Harry Fischer, chief of the division of rheumatology at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City. "This article speaks to the safety of the vaccine and helps to confirm that it does not contribute to the development of autoimmune diseases," he said.

Sonic decanters, slip-on wine thermometers, devices to pour your wine without pulling the cork -- the list of fancy wine accessories is growing apace, as global wine enthusiasts look for newer, better ways to appreciate their favorite tipple.
But James Molesworth, Senior Editor at Wine Spectator magazine says expensive gadgets are largely unnecessary. "You don't need much else besides a simple decanter, corkscrew and stemware."
The inclusion of the latter -- quality stemware, which can easily cost upwards US$100 per glass -- is becoming a popular choice in many of the world's leading high-end restaurants.
"It's mirrored the growth of lifestyle dining," Molesworth tells CNN. "It's part of the theater and expectation, at a certain level and at three-star restaurants. It's the same way you would expect to be served fine china and impressive flatware."
Same wine, different glass

Beyond aesthetics, the promise delivered by some luxury glassware companies -- like Austria-based Riedel -- is that the actual design of the glass can alter the taste of the wine.
Since 1958, Riedel has produced specially-designed glasses, tailored to appreciate over 300 types of wines and grape varieties.
The idea is, if you have a bottle of say, a Pinot Noir, and pour it into a few different glasses, the taste of that wine will vary across the different-shaped glasses.
As Georg Riedel, the 10th generation owner of the family business, explains: "The glass is a tool made to deal with the multiple flavor contributors in wine -- like fruit, neutrality and acidity -- and balance them."
The 'architecture' of a glass

Each Riedel glass adheres to three main design parameters -- the size, the shape and the opening.
The size controls how much air is in contact with the wine, the shape determines how the liquid flows to the opening, and the rim's diameter influences how fast the wine flows, and then, how it lands on the palate.
He says even an average drinker's palate can appreciate the differences in taste.
"We belong to the category of mammals and have a brain. We're naturally drawn to sucrose. The sweeter something is, the more we like it," Riedel says.
Glasses, he explains, can over-accentuate the bitter or acidic components of wine, while others, with more optimal design, should bring out a wine's fruitier flavors.
So, does shape really matter?
While taste is arguably a subjective experience, scientists at the Institute of Biomaterials and Bioengineering at Tokyo Medical and Dental University, recently weighed in on the matter.
Using an imaging device called a sniff-cam, Professor Kohji Mitsubayashi and his team mapped out the distribution of ethanol vaporizing from differently-shaped glasses.

In one part of the study , three types of glasses -- a standard wine glass, a straight glass and a cocktail glass were trialled. When the same amount of wine was poured into each of these glasses, and examined at a temperature of 13 degrees Celsius, the images revealed that a ring-shaped vapor pattern appeared at the edges of the wine glass.
Mitsubayashi explains that this ring-shaped pattern allows drinkers to appreciate the wine, without the smell of ethanol -- which is likened to the smell of vodka -- interfering.
That interference is captured by the sniff-cam, showing higher intensities of ethanol vapor, in the other two glasses.
"The shape of the wine glass has a very sophisticated and functional design for tasting and enjoying the aroma of the wine," the report concludes.
No miracles guaranteed
So should all passionate wine drinkers rush to line their cupboards with premium glass?
Austrian glassmaker Georg Riedel weighs in: "We would never say, 'this is the wrong way to drink something.' Wine is there to be enjoyed."
But he believes drinkers "actually do miss something," because many don't benchmark their wine in different glasses when they crack open a bottle.
"I would say everyone who tastes wines in different-shaped glasses would believe they are actually different wines. And out of those, you can pick your preference, which proves that one shape elevates the components of the wine better than another," he says.
"Of course, a glass cannot change a wine from a bad wine to a good wine. We are not responsible for miracles."

A swipe of the finger across an iPhone screen launches molecules at targets through the open neck of an Erlenmeyer flask in an educational app a UCLA chemistry professor developed with his students.
Neil Garg, along with several former undergraduate chemistry students, created an app that teaches standard concepts in organic chemistry. “Backside Attack,” named after the chemical reaction featured in the app, will be available for download on iOS later this month for free.
“A few students (from my Chemistry 14D: “Organic Reactions and Pharmaceuticals” course) mentioned they wanted to do something that would impact science education,” Garg said. “We initially had no direction or experience, but we knew we wanted to create an app.”
After receiving input from former students, Garg and his team began drawing rough blueprint sketches of the app interface in fall 2015 that were later converted into computer-based software by a graphic designer and programmer.
Garg said the app is designed to teach the SN2 reaction, one of the simplest reactions in organic chemistry and the first reaction that most organic chemistry students learn. One of the features of the SN2 reaction is called “backside attack,” in which a molecule approaches another from behind in order to trigger a reaction.
“Most organic chemistry classes start with the SN2 reaction, and we also thought it would be a simple vehicle to teach many other concepts in organic chemistry,” Garg said.
The app itself leads players through several levels. As they complete each level, players move on to learn a slightly more complex or difficult concept, Garg said.
One level shows a syringe filled with a particular molecule that players need to shoot inside a flask containing another molecule it will react with. As players move through the levels, the size of the flask's opening becomes smaller and more difficult to aim at, making it harder to complete the level. Another level requires players to draw the correct molecular mechanism before they can advance.
Garg added each level has an option for the student to learn more about the concept being taught by accessing a paragraph explanation of the subject. The app then prompts students to answer a question that would assess whether they had learned the concept.
Stefan Prisacaru, a member of the app development team who graduated from UCLA this year, said helping build the app has made him more interested in science education. He added it made him realize that science courses do not just have to be about getting a high grade and could be applied outside the classroom.
“Now, I realize you study because you can impact the world around you – especially now that I see how applicable chemistry is to everyday life,” he said.
Prisacaru said he is now interested in pursuing other projects in science education, such as creating a medical coloring book that would teach people basic health concepts, including what cholesterol is or how exactly smoking impacts the body.
“Science doesn't have to be scary,” Prisacaru said.
Tara Kappel, another member of the app development team who graduated from UCLA this year, said she helped provide the perspective of students who had just learned organic chemistry. She added that many students are intimidated by organic chemistry's reputation as a difficult course.
“We wanted it to be interesting, engaging and accessible to a lot of people, and to show people that organic chemistry isn't that difficult to learn,” Kappel said.
Kappel added she thinks the most difficult aspect of building the app was catering to students who had never learned organic chemistry, and those who were in the process of learning the subject.
“We were always trying to consider all the different ways students can learn,” she said.
Garg said he plans to advertise the app through a social media campaign and by reaching out to organic chemistry faculty at UCLA and other universities. He added if the app is well received he plans to make it accessible on other devices or possibly create more apps that teach different chemical reactions.
“It has been really cool to see students engage in a challenging and creative exercise outside of the classroom,” Garg said. “This is students at their best, and we're really excited to get it out there.”
В России хотят всех террористов Донбасса причислить к лику святых и построить церковь в которой стены разрисуют сценами из реальных боев на Донбассе.
Такое заявление сделал главред издания "Завтра" Александр Проханов во время интервью с экс-регионалом Олегом Царевым, передает новость OnPress.info.
«Я завершил роман о новороссии, и один из героев там говорит, что когда закончится все это кровопролитие и несчастье, то он хотел бы поставить храм. И расписать его не так, как расписывают - канонически: там, Иисус на чин, там, на западной стене - страшный суд, там, святые .., а расписать его героями и персонажами этой войны. Чтобы в этом храме присутствовали все лики лидеров, которые прошли через новороссию, которые сейчас там и еще будут...... На этом храме должны быть портреты и Бородая, и Стрелкова, и Черта, и Мрачного, и Захарченко, и легендарного Моторолы...», - заявил журналист.
Кроме этого Проханов отметил, что "все, кто прошел через новороссию, в каком-то смысле, могут быть причислены к святым...".

Defining sedentary behaviour
Is stationary behaviour the same as sedentary behaviour? Absolutely not, according to sitting scientists.
You can be stationary but not sedentary, because standing is active.
It's all explained in a new dictionary written by scientists studying sedentary behaviour, a field of research that began less than 10 years ago with the question: What if sitting is dangerous?
"In the history of our species, we've largely moved, and so the imposition in contemporary society is the actual sitting. That's the change," said Dr. Mark Tremblay, a pioneer researcher in the emerging field.
Some of the first hard data on the benefits of physical fitness came from a 1953 study comparing drivers and conductors on London's double-decker buses. Epidemiologist Jeremy Morris discovered that the drivers who sat for most of the day had more heart attacks than the conductors who were actively climbing the stairs and punching tickets.
The conclusion: exercise prevents disease.

Modern sedentary behaviour scientists have come at it from another angle, asking whether the conductors were behaving the way humans are supposed to, by moving around, while the drivers were actually hurting their health by sitting so much.
"We know there is a lot of associational evidence," said Tremblay, founder of the Sedentary Behaviour Research Network (SBRN) and an obesity researcher at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO) in Ottawa.
But so far, there is no causal link between sitting and disease. The experiments required to try and find it pose an ethical problem.
"We've attempted to try some randomized controlled trials, but we can't get ethics approval because you can't impose sedentary behaviour on research volunteers," Tremblay told CBC Health.
So far, research has associated sitting with cardiometabolic disease and skeletal weakness, and there are some emerging associations with mental and emotional health.
Tremblay says the new dictionary will help move the field forward. It was published last weekend, after more than a year of discussion involving 85 researchers from all over the world, and includes some of the following definitions:
Sitting : a position in which one's weight is supported by one's buttocks rather than one's feet, and in which one's back is upright.
: a position in which one's weight is supported by one's buttocks rather than one's feet, and in which one's back is upright. Active sitting : Working on a seated assembly line; playing guitar while seated; using devices that engage one's feet/legs while seated; doing arm ergometry while in a wheelchair.
: Working on a seated assembly line; playing guitar while seated; using devices that engage one's feet/legs while seated; doing arm ergometry while in a wheelchair. Passive lying : Lying on a couch, bed or floor while sedentary.
: Lying on a couch, bed or floor while sedentary. Active lying : Isometric plank hold (yoga position).
: Isometric plank hold (yoga position). Passive standing : Standing in line.
: Standing in line. Active standing : Standing on a ladder; standing while painting, washing dishes, working an assembly line; standing while juggling; standing while lifting weights.
: Standing on a ladder; standing while painting, washing dishes, working an assembly line; standing while juggling; standing while lifting weights. Supported standing: Standing while holding a couch, chair or a parent's hand; standing with the aid of crutches or a cane.
Hunting bats for new viruses
Meet Simon Anthony, virus hunter. He and his team are capturing bats and tracking coronaviruses in an effort to predict future SARS-like pandemics before they happen.
They travelled to 20 hotspots in Africa, Asia and South and Central America, where they caught and released thousands of bats, rodents and monkeys, and sent saliva and other samples off for virus testing.

"Our main goal was to find viruses that we didn't know about," Anthony told CBC Health.
The research is challenging some major assumptions about our ability to predict new pathogens that could trigger pandemic disease.
"I think one of the reasons people have not put much effort into trying to predict emergence is that people think it's a very random event and therefore impossible to predict," Anthony said. "The other is that people think there is an inexhaustible diversity of virus out there. I think that might not be true."
His group found 100 new viruses, and calculated that bats could be harbouring around 3,200 unidentified coronaviruses. He admits that's a big number, but insists it would be possible to catalogue them and determine whether they pose a threat to human health.
"We don't know whether we'll ever be able to reliably predict things ahead of time, but at the very least we think we will be able to make our response to outbreaks a lot faster simply by learning more about these viruses in wildlife," said Anthony, an assistant professor at New York's Columbia University.
For example, scientists would be able to react quicker to an outbreak if they know what viruses are prevalent in the local bats.
"We can implement some kind of intervention strategy that tries to block transmission from bats into people," Anthony said.
Anthony takes blood from a bat as part of a pandemic prevention study.
"It's all related to this idea of pandemic prevention and how can we get ahead of the curve. Making vaccines, building public health infrastructure, training people in how to respond to outbreaks — that's critically important, but all that is still responding to outbreaks when they occur."
Anthony's program is part of a global virus surveillance project called PREDICT, funded by the United States Agency for International Development. (USAID).
His research has confirmed that bats are a major reservoir for coronaviruses, which cause some of the most dangerous human infections, like SARS, which killed 774 people including 44 Canadians in a 2003 outbreak, and MERS, which is responsible for more than 700 deaths so far in an ongoing outbreak.
Ex-European Council president Herman Van Rompuy suggested Brussels would find it harder to stomach a vote for Scotland to breakaway from the rest of the UK if it hadn't been authorised by Westminster. Ms Sturgeon has consistently threatened a fresh independence referendum since last summer's Brexit vote, with the First Minister insisting Theresa May must listen to her demand for a “differentiated” exit deal for Scotland. The SNP leader has also described Scotland staying in the EU as an independent member state as the “best option” for the country. But former top EU boss Mr Van Rompuy advised Ms Sturgeon the way the SNP pushes for a second referendum would affect Brussels' view of a possible successful vote for Scottish independence.
GETTY Herman Van Rompuy warned Nicola Sturgeon over a 'unilateral' move for a referendum
Asked how the EU should deal with Scottish independence if nationalists won a referendum, Mr Van Rompuy told an audience at Chatham House this morning he would “never answer hypothetical questions”. But the former Belgian prime minister also said: “There is a difference between a unilateral move of Scotland and - whatever the outcome may be - a referendum with the consent of Westminster.”

The 2014 Scottish independence referendum was agreed after Westminster granted temporary powers to the Scottish Parliament to hold a vote. It is likely a similar arrangement would have to be reached between Edinburgh and London for a second referendum to be held - although Ms Sturgeon could call for the Scottish Parliament to authorise a non-binding referendum without consulting the UK Government. The SNP are two votes short of a majority in the Holyrood parliament, although the Greens have promised to back a bid for a second independence referendum should Ms Sturgeon's party propose a bill.

The nice thing about an election year that's accompanied by federal budget surpluses is that it's fertile ground for tax cuts – and both the Conservatives and Liberals have promised that tax savings are on the way. But who should really benefit from tax cuts? While it might not seem politically correct to suggest that the rich should get the lion's share of tax breaks, let me share a story that I first shared many years ago that provides food for thought here.
The cost of dinner
Each and every day, 10 men go to a restaurant for dinner together. The bill for all 10 comes to $100 each day. If the bill were paid the way we pay our taxes, the first four would pay nothing; the fifth would pay $1; the sixth would pay $3; the seventh $7; the eighth $12; the ninth $18. The 10th man – the richest – would pay $59. Although the 10 men didn't share the bill equally, they all seemed content enough with the arrangement – until the restaurant owner threw them a curve.

"You're all very good customers," the owner said, "so I'm going to reduce the cost of your daily meal by $20. I'm going to charge you just $80 in total." The 10 men looked at each other and seemed genuinely surprised, but quite happy about the news.
The first four men, of course, are unaffected because they weren't paying anything for their meals anyway. They'll still eat for free. The big question is how to divvy up the $20 in savings among the remaining six in a way that's fair for each of them. They realized that $20 divided by six is $3.33, but if they subtract that amount from each person's share, then the fifth and sixth men would end up being paid to eat their meals. The restaurant owner suggested that it would be fair to reduce each person's bill by roughly the same percentage, and he proceeded to work out the amounts that each should pay.
The results? The fifth man paid nothing, the sixth pitched in $2, the seventh paid $5, the eighth paid $9, the ninth paid $14, leaving the 10th man with a bill of $50 instead of $59. Outside the restaurant, the men began to compare their savings. "I only got one dollar out of the $20," said the sixth man, pointing to the 10th man, "and he got $9!" "Yeah, that's right," exclaimed the fifth man. "I only saved a dollar, too! It's not fair that he got nine times more than me!" "That's true," shouted the seventh man. "Why should he get back $9 when I only got $2? The rich get all the breaks!" "Wait a minute," yelled the first four men in unison. "We didn't get anything at all. The system exploits the poor!"
The nine outraged men surrounded the 10th and brutally assaulted him. The next day, he didn't show up for dinner, so the nine sat down and ate without him. But when it came time to pay the bill, they faced a problem that they hadn't faced before. They were $50 short.
The moral
There are a couple of lessons to be learned here. The first is an observation from my wife: If the 10 individuals had been women, they probably would have figured things out. But in all seriousness, I'm going to suggest that the approach taken by the restaurant owner in the story is exactly the right approach to divvying up tax cuts. It's how our system should work. The people who pay the highest taxes should get the greatest relief from a tax cut, in absolute dollars.
The fact is, if you overtax the rich, they just might not show up for dinner next time. After all, there are plenty of good restaurants around the world.

This story is relevant today because both the Conservatives and the Liberals have proposed to cut taxes – in different ways. The Liberals have said that they would offer no tax cuts to the rich, but would instead increase the tax burden on the highest earners. The problem with this, of course, is that pushing any taxpayer's marginal tax rate to 50 per cent or higher (which would be the case for many Canadians, particularly in provinces that also have taken steps to increase the marginal tax rate for the highest earners) will absolutely cause those folks to explore new ways to bring the tax burden down. And in the end, it may drive some to leave.

We almost made it an entire week with only two-Star Wars rumor stories, but alas, we've got one more to close out the week. To be fair, this latest rumor does have some weight to it, if only to clear up confusion regarding the possibility of a release date delay. As you well know, Harrison Ford recently injured his leg pretty badly on the set of Star Wars: Episode VII. The actor will be out of commission for two months, which is a significant blow to the production as Han Solo is said to play a major role in director J.J. Abrams' sequel. On Monday, a rumor surfaced that filming could maybe be postponed due to the injury, but now word comes that Disney is adamant that Episode VII will be released on December 18, 2015—despite the fact that Abrams and producer Kathleen Kennedy have apparently been lobbying for a delay to May. Hit the jump to read on.
The folks over at Latino Review are reporting that the release date of Star Wars 7 will absolutely not be delayed. Abrams and Kennedy apparently would like the release date to be pushed to May 4, 2016—putting the film back into the traditional Star Wars release date—but Disney CEO Bob Iger has given a firm “no.”
One may think that delaying the Star Wars sequel a mere five months isn't a big deal, but it would actually be a huge deal. You see, when Bob Iger announced that Disney had purchased Lucasfilm for a very hefty sum and would be moving forward with a new series of Star Wars films, he promised shareholders a Star Wars movie in 2015. Disney is, first and foremost, a business, and they are counting on an enormous amount of profits from Star Wars merchandise due on shelves for the 2015 holiday season. There's also the revenue from the movie as well. This is and has always been the plan, and Iger doesn't seem keen to deviate at this point.
As with all rumors, none of this is confirmed, but it is important to keep the business side of things in mind when speculating about things like release dates and production delays. I'm not saying it's right (I'd much rather have a good movie—the movie Abrams intended to make—rather than a movie that makes its initial release date). But alas, it appears that Abrams and Kennedy will have to work around Ford's injury and barrel towards Christmas 2015.
I'm sure Abrams realized that taking on Star Wars would be a herculean task when he signed on, but I wonder if, had he known what issues would arise (the script troubles, Ford's injury, etc.), would he still have signed on? I feel for the guy. Hopefully it'll be smooth sailing from here on out and it'll all have been worth it come December 18, 2015. At least Rian Johnson is already hard at work on Episode VIII, right?

There was standing room only in court number one at Castlebar District Court on Tuesday. Judge Mary Devins worked her way through procedural matters on more than a dozen cases, which ranged from criminal damage to the door of a family resource centre to theft and possession of cannabis.
Solicitors whispered to clients like irritated parents. “Stand straight and get your hands out of your pockets,” one scolded her client, an ashen-faced young man wrapped in a parka.
As the crowd of defendants began to lighten, Volkswagen's legal team made its way to the front of the court. Paul Fogarty, a barrister representing the car manufacturer, stepped up in black robe and white collar bands. He is representing Volkswagen on behalf of A&L Goodbody; he was accompanied by two of the firm's solicitors. No VW executives were in court. It was, perhaps, a signal of things to come.
Fogarty's client is a car giant with revenue of €230 billion in 2015, the year it was hit by a global scandal to do with emissions. The controversy has resulted in a class-action lawsuit in the United States; reports estimate that if the company has to pay compensation in Europe on the same scale as it did in the US its total legal costs could run to hundreds of billions.
Taking the case against Volkswagen in the District Court, where the maximum general damages are €15,000, is Eithne Higgins, a Co Roscommon nurse and mother of three who owns a Seat Leon. She is represented by Evan O'Dwyer, a Co Mayo solicitor with a practice in Ballyhaunis.
After 40 minutes of discussions and two adjournments Volkswagen's legal team walked out of the courtroom.
This sitting was the latest in a series of hearings related to discovery orders sought by Higgins. Despite the unassuming location, the case has drawn international attention, for it is believed to be the first to seek that the car firm make public the original expert opinion and technical evidence that it used to develop a fix for the affected engines.
Perhaps as a result of the potential cost, the car giant is adopting a zealous defence. It is a far cry from the conciliatory approach the firm has adopted in the US.
The emissions cheat
VW has alleged that as far back as 2005 a small group of employees decided to cheat by installing software that adjusted nitrogen-oxide levels according to whether vehicles were on the road or being tested.
Despite repeated denials, on September 3rd, 2015, when US regulators threatened to withhold certification for 2016 vehicles, the car giant finally admitted to installing the cheat devices. The news reached the wider world on September 18th, disclosed not by Volkswagen but by US authorities.
The devices were fitted to what is known as the EA189 diesel-engine range, installed in 11 million cars worldwide across its brands, including 500,000 in the US and an estimated 8.5 million across Europe, among them 110,000 in Ireland.
Eithne Higgins's Seat is one of them.
VW promised to recall and fix the affected cars. It was hoped that an interim discovery order by Judge Devins on June 6th would elicit test data to show whether the fix had implications for emissions levels and fuel economy.
The walkout
He said that if the court proceeded with the hearing his client would proceed by way of appropriate judicial review.
Higgins's solicitor said that “what we have here is unruliness; it is chaos”. O'Dwyer claimed that he, his client and Castlebar District Court had been “systematically bullied” by Volkswagen's legal team “in an attempt to goad them into taking a judicial review”.
He added, “This court is as important as, if not more important than, any other court in this land, and there is decorum, there is practice, there is protocol.”
After further comments from the judge Fogarty and the two accompanying solicitors walked out of court.
“We're proceeding without Hamlet, but so be it,” Devins said. In a follow-up hearing on Wednesday she described the walkout as a bizarre stunt and the most unusual thing she had seen in her court.
Devins said that on May 27th she had accepted that Higgins's car had been bought in a Co Mayo garage from an agent of the maker and that she had thus accepted jurisdiction. Recognising the complexity of the issues, the court had granted an interim order of discovery, to be complied with within six weeks. A&L Goodbody volunteered McDonnell to respond on behalf of its client.
McDonnell's affidavit was filed late, as he was on holiday in Ibiza when the deadline arrived, and there was trouble getting a notary to certify it. (Notaries apparently don't work on the island after certain hours.)
VW's approach
Michael P Lehmann, a partner at the US law firm Hausfeld, was party to those settlement negotiations. Giving evidence in Tuesday's hearing in Castlebar, he outlined how the litigation was dealt with in the United States, before Judge Charles R Breyer in San Francisco.
“VW's counsel in the very first case-management hearing before Judge Breyer emphasised that they would co-operate, they were there to co-operate, to reach a quick resolution of the case.”
Devins asked why he thought there was a contrast with proceedings in Castlebar. Lehman said, “I have heard Matthias Müller” – VW's chief executive – “tell European commissioners that consumers in the United States are the beneficiaries of different environmental laws and regulations than those found in Europe.”
Lehman said that 12 million pages of documents have so far been produced in the United States. “Conversely, looking at what Mr McDonnell supplied, he has 33 exhibits and a summary in his affidavit, but the 33 exhibits mainly consist of public press releases by Volkswagen.”
Although he couldn't describe the content of the discovery in the US case, he could speak in general terms. “From the documentation, vitally missing from Mr McDonnell's declaration is the actual data, the testing results, the forensic information provided to US and non-US investigators.”
Lehman said, “In my view Volkswagen has taken the position in Europe that it is not going to provide compensation to consumers and it regards these courts, these cases, as a distraction and a nuisance and hopes that they will wither away.
“I think Volkswagen is fighting a war of attrition against aggrieved consumers in the hope that they won't file suits, and they will recognise that it's going to be so difficult to deal with the company and its lawyers that it may not be worth the effort for a small individual claim.”
The affected owner
“I am on a State salary. My husband is in gainful employment, but our house is in negative equity. I became annoyed and angry when I heard on one hand Volkswagen were writing to me directly and saying that they were sorry to have broken my trust, and yet their solicitors are going to pursue me for costs if I continue with my claim.”
Her affidavit explains that on May 17th she visited three garages near her home to see what value they would offer her if she traded in the car. When the garages realised that it was one of those affected by the emissions scandal, none would offer a trade-in price.
The technical side
European governments weighed up the nitrogen-oxide-versus-carbon-dioxide debate and opted to focus on lowering emissions of the latter, which is linked to global warming. Our current motor-tax regime – introduced by the Fianna Fáil-Green Party coalition on July 1st, 2008 – is designed to penalise cars with high carbon-dioxide emissions. But manufacturers must comply with EU nitrogen-oxide limits before they can sell new models in Europe.
For Higgins's engine the limit is 0.18g/km. Earlier this year a German car magazine, Auto Motor und Sport, tested a 2-litre diesel engine in a VW Amarok pickup that the manufacturer had fixed and recorded a nitrogen-oxide level of 1.5 g/km, more than eight times the European standard. Higgins's solicitor is seeking data to support VW's contention that its solution doesn't breach EU limits.
For the 1.6-litre engine fitted to Higgins's Seat Volkswagen needs to update the software and add a piece of hardware. VW refers to it as a flow transformer. Others have called it a rubber tube.
VW contends that changes to nitrogen-oxide emissions will not affect carbon-dioxide emissions. But one emission expert told the court that he does not agree. Horace Calvert Stinton said that combustion theory implies that an increase in carbon-dioxide emissions would accompany a decrease in nitrogen-oxide emissions.
He said of the fact that more than a software change is needed and that a piece of hardware has to be fitted, “Motor manufacturers do not add any components unless necessary, as extra parts cost money and add weight to the vehicle.”
The financial cost
Stiglitz cites an announcement on March 15th this year by Volkswagen Financial Services AG. It made an extraordinary write-down of €353 million to cover the potential decline in the resale value of the affected vehicles.
It's also worth noting a ruling by Judge Dr Gundula Nathschlager, in Linz Regional Court, in Austria, published in June. Although the names of both parties have been redacted from court documents, the case relates to the owner of a VW Touran with a 1.6-litre type EA189 diesel engine.
The plaintiff successfully requested the retraction of the sales contract and payment of €30,048.20, including interest, along with the return of the car. The court also granted costs. The motorist had argued that low fuel consumption had been an important factor in his decision to buy the Touran.
Outstanding issues
There are a number of other outstanding issues. Will VW continue to fight each case in what Lehman refers to as a “war of attrition” against affected owners?
As for the recall currently under way and the fixes being installed, will the car giant release the data to support its claims that it has managed to remove the cheat devices without affecting carbon-dioxide emissions or fuel economy?
Ultimately – and arguably beyond the discovery orders of the Castlebar court – the public and shareholders in the firm will still want to know who knew about the devices.
It is worth remembering that emissions levels exist to protect human health. Seemingly, a group of engineers at the auto giant set out to cheat the system. Volkswagen couldn't get its diesel engines to meet strict US standards for nitrogen oxide. Then it could. Did no senior manager or director, from a board staffed with highly qualified engineers, ask to how this game-changing innovation was achieved?
The motor industry is the world's biggest register of intellectual property and patents, ahead even of the technology sector. Did nobody suggest that such an engineering breakthrough be patented?
The lawyer: Castlebar case ‘immensely important'
With offices in Berlin, and European clients with similar complaints against the car firm, he has teamed up with Eithne Higgins's solicitor, Evan O'Dwyer.
Hausfeld says, “The importance of the decision and the proceedings in Castlebar are immense . . . and I think this decision by this court will be influential in other proceedings, not only in Ireland but throughout Europe.”
Hausfeld has a long record of handling high-profile cases, including some of the largest and most successful class actions in human-rights, discrimination and antitrust law.
Hausfeld has represented native Alaskans whose lives were affected by the ‘Exxon Valdez' oil spill of 1989, and Holocaust victims whose assets were wrongfully retained by private Swiss banks during and after the second World War; he also represented Poland, the Czech Republic, Belarus, Ukraine and the Russian Federation on issues of slave and forced labour for both Jewish and non-Jewish victims of Nazi persecution.
He was also the only private lawyer permitted to represent the interests of consumers worldwide in European Commissions' closed hearings in the Microsoft case in 2003.
He says that Volkswagen has been extremely deferential to American regulators but that “VW is paying indifference to European regulators”.
“With respect to American consumers they were very responsive in understanding their accountability and addressing it. In Europe they denied any and all accountability.”
In the US, the court-ordered discovery process garnered 12 million documents. So far in the Castlebar case it has garnered one affidavit and 33 exhibits. Volkswagen “could never have failed to respond with the paucity of data that was produced for the court in Ireland under United States laws”, Hausfeld says.
“What was made clear in the testimony the other day was that engineers are extremely detailed in their nature. From the development of the device to its manipulation to its testing results to the alleged fix, there have to be details, minute reports concerning the engineering and the results of that entire evolution. None of that was produced before the Irish court, despite the fact it was asked for.”
But state health officials have not shied away from making Texas abortion facilities pay for their shortcomings. In 2010, they levied a $119,000 fine against Planned Parenthood Trust of South Texas for failing to acquire licenses for three facilities that began prescribing abortion-inducing drugs in 2005.
Mara Posada, a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman, said the organization was under the impression that it did not have to obtain licenses for those facilities because surgical abortions were not performed there — and the organization did have a license for the facility that offered them.
The state also levied several smaller fines, ranging from $200 to $500, against clinics that failed to post their licensure numbers on their Web sites, misreported the age of gestation or failed to return a corrective action plan on time, among other violations.
The fact that most of the state's recent inspection findings point to administrative errors as opposed to medical ones has not deterred abortion opponents.
One group, Operation Rescue, has accused a Houston doctor of performing illegal, late-term abortions as recently as 2011. Harris County officials and the Department of State Health Services are investigating those allegations, but previous inspection reports have revealed no violations that presented a safety risk.
Abortion rights advocates say that even if the investigation uncovers wrongdoing, the doctor was operating an ambulatory surgical center that would have met the requirements of the new law. They and medical experts argue that the new regulations will lead to the closing of most of the state's legal abortion providers, resulting in more women seeking dangerous, illegal options.
Since January, nine abortion clinics have closed, and another facility has stopped performing abortions. Two of those that closed were Planned Parenthood clinics that operated until this month; state auditors found no violations there in their last inspections. Only six of the state's remaining 38 abortion facilities currently meet the structural requirements of ambulatory surgical centers, and it is unclear how many have a physician with hospital admitting privileges. “The goal of the bill is to improve patient safety for the woman and the child,” Ms. Horne said.
The age old argument concerning the Libertarian Party is that they are just a splinter of the Republican Party and will damage the ability of the Republican nominee to win an election.
We hear this argument played out today by people who are warped into the idea of a Trump Presidency. Many uneducated Republicans think that Gary Johnson will play spoiler for Trump and elect Hillary Clinton President.
However, the numbers show that this sentiment is not correct and actually Gary Johnson will pull more votes from Hillary Clinton than he will from Donald Trump.
Gary Johnson is his own man and does not fall into this ridiculous category as Republican spoiler. The Libertarian message is a cross-appeal message that translates across political aisles. Gary Johnson will take votes from both Democrats and Republicans in November and the country will be better off.
LONDON/GENEVA (Reuters) - Scientists hunting the Higgs subatomic particle will unveil results next week that could confirm, confound or complicate our understanding of the fundamental nature of the universe.

Seldom has something so small and ephemeral excited such interest. The theoretical particle explains how suns and planets formed after the Big Bang - but so far it has not been proven to exist.
The CERN research centre near Geneva will on July 4 unveil its latest findings in the search for the Higgs after reporting “tantalizing glimpses” in December.
Scientific bloggers and even some of the thousands of physicists working on the project are speculating that CERN will finally announce proof of the existence of the Higgs.
“It's still premature to say anything so definitive,” says CERN spokesman James Gillies, adding the two teams involved are still analyzing data and even CERN insiders won't know the answer until the results from both are brought together.
But with plans for a news conference that will be beamed live around the world and coincide with a major particle physics conference in Melbourne, Australia, anticipation of a significant announcement is hard to avoid.
For Jordan Nash, a professor at London's Imperial College and a member of one of the teams looking for the Higgs, the excitement around the experiment is justified.
“We're trying to understand the fabric of the universe itself,” he told Reuters. “It's a hugely fundamental piece of the mystery of how the universe is put together.”
SMASHING WATERMELONS
A definitive ‘we've found it' would be a surprise and a major scientific milestone.
“We too are holding our breath,” says Pauline Gagnon, a Canadian physicist on one of the teams, in her latest blog.
The action takes place in the Large Hadron Collider, the world's biggest and most powerful particle accelerator, a 27-km (17-mile) looped pipe that sits in a tunnel 100 meters underground on the Swiss/French border.
Two beams of energy are fired in opposite directions around it before smashing into each other to create many millions of particle collisions every second in a recreation of the conditions a fraction of a second after the Big Bang.
The vast amount of data produced is examined by banks of computers. But it's a messy process. For all the billions of collisions, very few of them are just right for revealing the Higgs particle.
“It's like smashing watermelons together and trying to achieve a perfect collision for two of the pips inside,” says Nash.
Last year's “glimpses” of the Higgs were from just a handful of collisions out of the many millions that were analyzed. Since then, the power inside the collider has been ramped up to increase the intensity of the particle smashing. This threw off more data between April and June than in the whole of last year.
“We're looking for something so rare, it's a sifting experiment,” Nash said. “We just made a gigantic haystack and now we are looking for the needle”.
IT'S A BIG UNIVERSE
The Higgs particle is a crucial plank of the Standard Model, which is the best explanation physicists have of how the universe works at the most fundamental level.
But the particle is theoretical, first posited in 1964 by British scientist Peter Higgs as the way matter obtained mass after the universe was created 13.7 billion years ago.
Without it, according to the theory, the universe would have remained a giant soup of particles. It would not have coalesced into stars, planets and life.
Even if its existence is finally proven, it will only apply to the relatively small part of the universe explained by the Standard Model. It won't tell us about so-called dark matter or dark energy, which scientists believe make up about 96 percent of the cosmos.
It could, however, be a step towards a theory of everything that encompasses dark matter and energy, as well as the force of gravity, which the Standard Model also does not explain.
Those early glimpses may of course not be borne out in the latest data, which would provoke serious head-scratching and debate about where to look next. They may discover the Higgs exactly as postulated.
But scientists say the most exciting news from CERN, whether it comes next week or later this year, would be the discovery of a type of Higgs particle but not quite as described in the Standard Model.
This, they say, could provide a road sign on where to look for answers on dark matter, dark energy and even esoteric concepts like parallel universes.
“Something more exotic could take us beyond the Standard Model and into the rest of the universe that we currently know nothing about,” said James Gillies.
He said just as Albert Einstein's theories enveloped and built on the work of Isaac Newton, the work being done by the thousands of physicists at CERN have the potential to do the same. “It's where we'd like it to take us,” he said.
WHO CARES?
In a hard-up world paying the bill for multiple financial crises, some question the value of big science projects like the Large Hadron Collider and scientists feel an ever increasing pressure to justify the expense to policymakers. The LHC cost about 3 billion euros to build.
CERN's highest profile gift to the real economy was the source code for the World Wide Web, written by scientist Tim Berners-Lee when he worked at the research centre in the 1990s.
Asked what the Higgs hunt could bestow on the world, Nash says the research is too leading edge and too nascent to say. At this point it's about the thirst for knowledge, something he argues the public well understands.
“We do bring a lot of things back,” he says. “But when I talk to taxi drivers or builders they never ask that.”
A 48 million year-old horse-like equoid fetus has been discovered at the Messel pit near Frankfurt, Germany according to a study in PLOS ONE.
Jens Lorenz Franzen from Senckenberg Research Institute Frankfurt, Germany, and Naturhistorisches Museum Basel, Switzerland, and colleagues completed their investigation of the fetus from a 48 million year-old horse-like equoid uncovered near Frankfurt, Germany in 2000. They evaluated the bones and anatomy and used scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and high-resolution micro-x-ray to describe the ~12.5 cm fetus.
The fetus appears to be well-preserved, with almost all bones present and connected, except for the skull, which appears to have been crushed. The well-preserved condition of the fossil allowed the researchers to reconstruct the original appearance and position of the fetus. They estimate that the mare may have died shortly before birth, but don't believe the death was related to birth.
The authors also found preserved soft tissue, like the uteroplacenta and one broad uterine ligament, which may represent the earliest fossil record of the uterine system of a placental mammal. Applying SEM, the authors discovered a bacterial lawn replacing the soft tissues, as is common with other specimens found in that area. The observable details correspond largely with living mares, which lead the authors to posit that the reproductive system was already highly developed during the Paleocene, and possibly even earlier.

In December, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) posted on its website an encouraging call for the decriminalization of atheism in countries where nonbelievers suffer persecution, and I blogged about it here. Happily, the commission has one-upped itself.
This past Sunday, the Richmond Times ran an op-ed by USCIRF's Katrina Lantos Swett and M. Zuhdi Jasser explicitly holding up the protection of atheists' rights as a cause equal with the protection of other human rights. Citing the persecution and convictions of Alexander Aan in Indonesia and Alber Saber in Egypt, they write (emphasis mine):
There is no bright line that can be readily drawn in the sand to separate them. The implication is clear. Those who stand unequivocally for other freedoms, including freedoms of speech and press, association and assembly, also must support religious freedom, just as those who stand for the right of believers to follow their conscience must do the same for nonbelievers.
Considering the lack of acknowledgement of atheists in President Obama‘s inaugural address (as opposed to his first), seeing this piece this morning is a breath of fresh air.
BEIRUT, Lebanon — He had long been one of the more optimistic anti-government residents of the besieged, rebel-held section of Aleppo, trying to buoy others' spirits even as loyalist forces closed in. But as the Syrian Army and allied militias took more and more territory in an apparently decisive offensive during the week, Yasser Hmeish, an accountant for the local medical council, grew frantic.
Soldiers seized his neighborhood on Wednesday while he worked at a clinic blocks away. Several of Mr. Hmeish's neighbors were brought into the clinic wounded, but died before he could ask what had happened to his family.
“I don't know anything, anything about them,” Mr. Hmeish said in an audio message, in one of scores of exchanges we had with people inside east Aleppo as the offensive unfolded. “We are about to die or be arrested.”
After years of bombing and months under siege, rebels had lost more than three-quarters of their territory in eastern Aleppo by the end of the week, throwing thousands of civilians and fighters into chaos. We followed the events in real time from Beirut, monitoring social media and talking via WhatsApp, Skype, telephone and other media with doctors, fighters, housewives, local council members, antigovernment activists, aid workers and others, including on the government side. All were people we had gotten to know through years of covering Syria's bloody civil war.

The scandal surrounding former Google engineer James Damore — who was fired after he wrote a manifesto claiming most women aren't cut out to work in software because they are more “neurotic” than me — has shone a spotlight on sexism within Silicon Valley.
In a New York Times report about angry Silicon Valley men who resent what they believe are forced attempts to implement gender equality, it is revealed that disgruntled tech employees are increasingly joining a fringe movement that aims to help men survive with as little contact with women as humanly possible.
Called “Men Going Their Own Way” (“Mgtow”), the movement advocates near total separation between the sexes, and encourages men to forgo marriage and children. Men in the movement are only encouraged to date women to meet their sexual needs, and are given tips for avoiding getting into committed relationships.
“On the Mgtow message boards, members discuss work (‘Ever work for a woman? Roll up your sleeves and share your horror story'), technology (‘The stuff girlfriends and wives can't stand — computers, games, consoles') and dating (mostly best practices to avoid commitment),” the Times writes.
The official Mgtow subreddit is similarly filled with posts such as “13 reasons why dogs are better than women” and “Angela Merkel wins 4th term… Germany gets cucked yet again.” Additionally, YouTube channels such as “Mgtow is Freedom” and “Angry Mgtow” — which tout the benefits of straight men living apart from women — have tens of thousands of subscribers.
Cassie Jaye, a self-described “former feminist” who is producing a documentary about the men's rights movement, tells the Times that many Mgtow followers in Silicon Valley had been avoiding dealing with women for a long time now, but only recently discovered that there were many more men out there who behaved the same way.
“I think there are a lot of guys living this lifestyle without naming it, and then they find Mgtow,” she said.
Slide Show
Good afternoon on this brutally cold Tuesday.
The low of 4 degrees this morning shattered a 118-year-old record, and wind chills fell into the negative teens.
If you must go out, here's what you need to know:
• A word of advice – layers. It will be no more than 10 degrees, with gusts up to 50 miles an hour slashing exposed skin. Tonight it will hover around 9 degrees.
• The city's Office of Emergency Management warns of “life-threatening wind chill.” People are “at risk for hypothermia, frostbite and other serious health problems.”
• How long will it take exposed skin to get frostbite? Around 30 to 45 minutes, the National Weather Service said. See this chart.
• School is open in the city. Sorry, kids, bundle up and get out there. But many suburban schools are opening late. See list.
• Sidewalks: Even clear-looking spots can be slippery. Please be careful.
• No heat? Call 311. Inspectors will begin the process of getting your heat restored.
• The city is not opening warming centers. “But we're looking at other measures and doubling homeless outreach,” said Christopher Miller, spokesman for the Office of Emergency Management.
• Senior centers: Open only for lunch, starting at 11 a.m. For homebound seniors, case-management agencies will call and check in, the city says.
• Keep dog walks brief, the A.S.P.C.A. says. Use sympathetic good judgment. Don't leave dogs outside or in the car. Consider putting a coat on them.
• Neighbors: Please check in with them, especially if they are elderly or can't get around.
• Other tips for staying warm outside? Wear mittens instead of gloves. Don't wear cotton. Here are a bunch more.
• When will it warm up? Wednesday, if the mid-20s sound warm to you. It should get above freezing on Thursday. Sunday could see 50 degrees.
COMMUTE
• Subways: Check latest status.
• Rails: Amtrak is running a reduced schedule. L.I.R.R. and N.J. Transit station waiting rooms are open round the clock.
Check L.I.R.R., Metro-North or New Jersey Transit status.
• Roads: Watch for patches of black ice. Check traffic map or radio report on the 1s or the 8s.
Alternate-side parking is suspended. “Icy conditions will make it difficult for people to move vehicles,” a city spokesman said. Meters remain in effect.
• Air travel: There may be more cold-related delays so check with your airline or FlightAware.

How do you keep a giraffe's neck warm?
Take him inside.
During the cold snap, that's what zoos will do with “temperature sensitive animals,” including giraffes, zebras and gorillas, said Jim Breheny, who heads the Wildlife Conservation Society's four zoos and aquarium in the city.
Many species will remain outdoors, at least partially.
Cold-hardy species, like deer and antelope, also have barns, Mr. Breheny said.
Amur tigers, a.k.a. Siberian tigers, snow leopards and bison?
Mr. Breheny declared them “quite comfortable in the cold.”

The hearing requested by the city of Beverly Hills on the Century City station location for the Westside Subway Extension has now concluded. As expected, the Board of Directors did not take any action on selecting a route for the subway and station location in Century City.
The basic dispute: In order to avoid active earthquake fault zones under Santa Monica Boulevard, Metro staff are recommending a subway route under part of the Beverly Hills High School campus to reach a Century City station at Constellation Boulevard and Avenue of the Stars.
Beverly Hills officials oppose that route, saying it could harm students and would hinder future underground development at the school. Metro says that tunneling can be done safely and would not interfere with future development.
Most of the hearing was dedicated to presentations by Beverly Hills' consultants, who disputed many of Metro's studies.
Among their points: There was evidence of faults on the West Beverly Hills Lineament under the Beverly Hills High School campus but no evidence of the faults being active for at least 100,000 years; that more seismic studies are needed to determine if the Constellation station would be in an active fault zone; that the Santa Monica Fault may be inactive; and that ridership would be higher for a station under Santa Monica Boulevard in the long-term due to redevelopment and riders transferring from buses.
In addition, Beverly Hills officials also distributed schematics showing three alternative routes to reach a Constellation station. All of the routes would involve tunneling under Santa Monica Boulevard until the tunnels swing south around Century Park East. An attorney for Beverly Hills also said that if the Metro Board selects a route under the high school, litigation could result and delay the subway project.
Metro did not call any witnesses. The agency instead submitted its previously published studies on the Westside Subway Extension — all of which the agency stands behind.
The hearing concluded without time for comments from the public. Those who signed up to speak at the hearing today will be allowed to provide their comments at a special meeting that will be held along with the next regular Metro Board meeting on May 24 at 9:00 a.m. That is the earliest that the Board could decide this matter, as well as the remainder of the subway alignment.
Here are Metro's responses to Beverly Hills' reports:

John Malkovich responded to more than 75 questions during a Reddit AMA session. John Malkovich / imgur Yesterday, John Malkovich did an Ask Me Anything (AMA) on Reddit.
Next week, his new film "Red 2," featuring Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, and Catherine Zeta-Jones, comes out in theaters.
The 59-year-old actor discussed everything from his feelings on privacy, to the worst scripts he's ever read. He also debunked a famous Internet rumor about a beer can throw thrown at him in "Being John Malkovich."
We've gathered his best responses below.
Check out the full AMA here.
Privacy no longer exists.
"I think, sadly, that privacy is finished. no such thing. if you're a known person, you learned to live without it long ago. that's very,very unfortunate, but such is life. i think there's no going back as that particular horse has left the barn. i have at times spoken with my peers and the head of the actors union about why we're not paid when we appear in say a tmz production, but there seems to be no real interest in combatting it. for the nsa, i've always assumed they listen to everything and read everything and see everything. France, where i've also lived for a number of years is exactly the same-possibly worse. i think it's too late."
His feelings on fame:
"It used to be fine, but it gets wearing at my age. too many cell phone cameras and doofuses who need a facebook photo with their thumb up. a few hundred a day over a 15 year period is, well, not that much fun. of course, most the people one actually gets to talk to are as interesting and fun as ever."
The worst script the actor has ever read:
"I was given a script in france, by a seemingly rather disturbed young man. let's just say it was not good. also, one night, a woman came in to our yard in france around 2:00 am. i was outside on the phone talking to my producing partners in Los Angeles. she gave me a script called elle tue,(she kills!) which was about the lead character killing a movie star. it was written like it had been done with a butcher knife in red ink. also, it wasn't very good."
He debunked the rumor about a "drunk extra" throwing a can at the actor on set of "Being John Malkovich."
Evanderson: Were you actually pissed when that extra threw that can at your head?
"On the contrary, spike jonze wanted to cut it because we were late that night and he felt no one would be able to hit me on the head with a half full can of beer from a passing car, and about 70 or 80 sets of hands shot up on the crew saying they would like to try. eventually the task fell to johnny cusack's writing partner and he nailed it on the first try."
Here's the scene.
On whether he kept the pig and a grenade launcher from last year's action flick, "Red":
"I didn't get to keep either sadly, though i was able to sneak the pig into this red 2. If they cut it i'll be so pissed."
Late-night host Craig Ferguson once asked him to be a permanent staple on the show.
"Every time i'm out here in Los Angeles, he's on a little hiatus, so i don't get to do it often. at one point he had asked me to become a semi-permanent character who lived in a fish tank. the script was very funny, too. alas. "
What it was like eating only Jell-O for four months.
"I lost seventy pounds eating nothing but jello for 4 months. but of course there is great variety in the colors! i think, if i remember correctly it's 230 calories for a whole bowl. maybe 270? in the 5th month i added fruit."
Why he's doing a television series, "Crossbones," in the fall on NBC:
"It's a very nice script. good producers and hopefully a good cast. plus, movies that are well written are hard to get made and hard to finance. plus, it will be the first time since 1990 that i will be in one place for at least five months."
Some of his other responses were pretty hilarious.
On "Red 2" co-star Mary-Louise Parker:
"Marie Louise is my hero. sharp, sad, funny, extremely gifted and quick. I love to be around her and i adore working with her. we had a beautiful vomiting in tandem on the car windshield scene in red 2, ungratefully removed by the powers that be. for the pickup line, I'm not to sure. I would counsel the direct approach. i wouldn't use the Schwarzenegger pickup line "baby your bangability is very high tonight." on 2nd thought, if you have a good styrian accent, maybe it would be perfect."
Markshlitz222: There is a bat in my apartment and it is making me nervous, how can I get rid of it?
"I had one in my house once. I think i just opened all the windows and kind of gently broomed it out. just make sure it's in your apartment and not in your head."
He even recorded a voicemail for a fan named Benjamin.

An attorney has said an Alabama death row inmate who was seeking to overturn his murder conviction has died.
Alabama death row inmate says state is ignoring his concerns over conviction Read more
Attorney Cissy Jackson said Donnis Musgrove died on Wednesday night at the Donaldson correctional facility in Bessemer, Alabama. Jackson said Musgrove was suffering from lung cancer.
“It was a privilege to know and represent Donnis,” Jackson said in an emailed statement. “My husband and I have been working for his release since 1997, and we are so sorry that he did not live to be exonerated.”
Musgrove, 67, was sentenced to die for the gunshot killing of Coy Eugene Barron in 1986.
However, he steadfastly maintained his innocence, and his attorneys contended the prosecution falsified the evidence against him, including witness statements and a shell casing that was used to link him to the slaying.
The attorney general's office previously has declined to comment on Musgrove's legal arguments.
Musgrove was trying to become the third inmate freed from Alabama's death row since April. Two other men were released after winning appeals. One, Anthony Ray Hinton, was tried by the same Jefferson County prosecutor and judge who handled Musgrove's case. The same ballistics expert was involved in each case.
Musgrove contended that the evidence of wrongdoing in his case was more extensive than in the case against Hinton.
The state had argued that rules prohibited Musgrove from making new claims about being innocent and barred him from questioning evidence used in his trial, but prosecutors didn't directly address his arguments contending he was wrongfully convicted based on bogus evidence conjured up by prosecutors and police.
In August, his defense asked the judge to rule quickly because of his illness and his hospitalisation, in grave condition.
“We would love to get him out of prison,” Jackson said then, “so he could have some peace after being wrongfully imprisoned for so many years.”
While Star Wars: Episode VIII's official title of The Last Jedi has been widely accepted by fans, the true meaning is still unclear. Does it refer to Rey? Luke? Rey AND Luke? Someone else entirely? While some cast members have given their thoughts on the title, The Force Awakens director J.J. Abrams has finally come forward to reveal what The Last Jedi actually means. SPOILERS AHEAD.
In a recent interview with our cousin site, Sci-Faux Magazine, J.J. Abrams was asked if he knew who the last Jedi was and he had this to say.
“Well, it's no longer my mystery box, so here's a spoiler. Rey was always the last Jedi. Luke was dead all along during The Force Awakens. His appearance at the end was a Force ghost. That's why Rey had visions of him throughout the film. Luke had been guiding her the whole time.”
When pressed for more info, Abrams changed the subject to panini presses, so we will speculate from here.
Does this mean that Rey is the last Jedi because she's the sole survivor of Luke's Jedi group who were massacred by the Knights of Ren? We think this will be the case.
But how and when did Luke die? We don't know but all the answers will be revealed soon enough! Come on December!

LunArtic sent me a wonderful present for my Borders Collie dog Misty. She has been a wee bit down recently and has not touched any of her other toys for a while (except the ball,She loves the ball)so I was a bit skeptical that she would entertain this gift but i was wrong. She loves it (See the pictures)and even my 4 year old son loves it. It makes a nice mechanical noise as they twist it and roll it along the floors . Thanks for this gift. I am sorry it has taken me so long to reply. I have been on holiday and busy at work but your gift warmed the hearts of me and my wife who has at last seen some good of all the hours I have trawled REDDIT
It drives me crazy to see news outlets with US maps showing the states estimated to be either going for Barack Obama or Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election based on the geographic size of those states, rather than the number of Electoral College votes they carry. There are better maps they could and should use. Below, a guide to some you should check out.
I'm not a fan of the Electoral College system, where a US presidential candidate can potentially win (and some have) even though a majority of people vote for the loser. That just seems wrong. I also dislike that despite living in a populous state, because California's typically seen as safe for Democrats, we're largely written off — as are the most other states deemed in one camp or the other. Only the few “swing” states get attention.
Still, that's the current system. If we have to have that system, let's at least have our TV news channels and publications show maps that represent correctly. A map of votes based on geography sure isn't doing the job.
Consider this map at CNN, which is similar to what you'll see aired on CNN and other news channels:
That makes it seem as if support of Romney is sweeping across the nation. Look at all that red! Victory is assured. The problem is that many of those red states are geographically large but small in the number of electoral college votes they carry. Meanwhile, some small states such as those in New England carry more votes than their geographic size suggests.
Now consider this, from the New York Times:
That's a map of the US that more accurately reflects what's happening in the election, because rather than being drawn to geographic size, it's showing voting size. States are illustrated in proportion to each other based on the number of Electoral College votes they have. Done this way, the election is more accurately seen as very close.
Maps that aren't based on geography are called “cartograms” and can be done in various ways. Here's another example from the Huffington Post, which I especially like:
Time has a hybrid of the above model, if when using its map, you're select the “Electoral vote” option:
Still want a better sense of the traditional US shape? Princeton offers once based on combined polling data plotted into a weighted map:
If you like that, then definitely check out the 2012 Electoral College Calculator blog which takes estimates from various sources done on traditional maps and applies them to ones reflecting votes:
That blog is run by Jeffrey Albertson, who wrote a great post on various ways to better map electoral votes for Daily Kos earlier this year, including some of the examples I've listed above.
Also see this article that talks about ways to produce these types of cartograms with yet another variation:
That's the 2008 presidential vote. Personally, I don't like this particular style, because I feel it's too close to a geographic map. Rather than break me out of a geographic mindset, I keep looking at it feeling it's wrong because it's so close to being “right.”
Here's hoping that CNN might decide there's a place for cartograms among its holograms and other whiz-bang tech that it's currently using for the US presidential elections. The same is true for any news outlet. Give us a map that's a true guide to votes, not to geography. After all, that's what you're trying to map out.
Rapper Kanye West took to Twitter Tuesday afternoon to reveal what he discussed with President-elect Donald Trump during a meeting at Trump Tower Tuesday morning — and appeared to postpone his own planned presidential run to 2024.
The outspoken rapper entered Trump Tower at around 9 a.m. to meet with the President-elect, after which the pair appeared together in front of reporters in the lobby.
“I wanted to meet with Trump today to discuss multicultural issues,” West wrote on Twitter Tuesday afternoon. “These issues included bullying, supporting teachers, modrenizing curriculums, and violence in Chicago.”
I feel it is important to have a direct line of communication with our future President if we truly want change,” he added.

https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/808769046208532484
West also added another tweet, simply reading, “#2024.” The cryptic tweet is most likely a reference to his own planned presidential bid, which the rapper had previously said he had planned for 2020.
https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/808769227847036941
In November, West paused a concert in San Jose to deliver a 40-minute speech in which he said that he had not voted in the presidential election, but if he had, he would have voted for Trump.
At another concert a few days later, the rapper compared himself to Trump and rebuked former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton: “It's a new world, Hillary Clinton, it's a new world. Feelings matter. Because guess what? Everybody in middle America felt a way and they showed you how they felt. Feelings matter, bro.”
West first expressed an interest in running for president at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards, while accepting the evening's Video Vanguard Award, the equivalent of a lifetime achievement award.
The rapper expounded on his plans in an August interview with the BBC, when he said that Americans had become “numb” to the ongoing violence in Chicago.
“We're numb to 500 kids getting killed in Chicago a year, we're numb to the fact that it was seven police shootings in the beginning of July,” he said.
“When I talk about the idea of being president, I'm not saying I have any political views. I don't have views on politics,” he added. “I just have a view on humanity, on people, on the truth. If there is anything I can do with my time and my day to somehow make a difference while I'm alive, I'm going to try to do it.”
West's Tuesday meeting with Trump marked one of his first public appearances since he was hospitalized in November in Los Angeles.

BALTIMORE () -- Five Baltimore police officers involved in the Freddie Gray case are facing internal charges following an administrative investigation by the Montgomery County Police Department,
According to the Baltimore Sun, Officer William Porter is the only officer not facing internal discipline and three of the remaining five -- Officer Caesar Goodson, Lt. Brian Rice and Sgt. Alicia White -- may face termination.
Two are facing five-day suspensions without pay, according to the Baltimore Sun's report; Officer Edward Nero and Officer Garrett Miller.
The Baltimore Police Department and has been reviewing the case.
“The MCPD with support from the Howard County Police Department (HCPD) was asked to conduct this administrative investigation to avoid any appearances of conflicts of interest or bias during the investigation that garnered national attention,” Baltimore Police Chief Spokesperson T.J. Smith wrote in a release on May 12. “The MCPD was tasked with rendering findings in the investigation of either: sustained, non-sustained, exonerated, or unfounded.”
Gray died in 2015, a week after his neck was broken in the back of a police van. The six officers were charged in connection with Gray's death.
Three of the officers were acquitted at trial and prosecutors dropped the remaining cases.
Police declined to comment on the report on Monday, saying that the results are a "personnel matter."
Baltimore City State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby released the following statement after the reports of internal discipline surfaced;
"Justice is always worth the price paid for its pursuit. This case has always been about providing justice for an innocent 25-year-old man who was unreasonably taken into police custody, severely injured while in police custody, and died due to a lack of care. If today's news is accurate, I am relieved to know that a majority of those involved will be held administratively accountable for their actions. And, while nothing can bring back Freddie Carlos Gray, Jr., I pray that today's announcement brings some closure to his loved ones, the City of Baltimore, and the dedicated members of the Baltimore Police Department.”

Nearly £1 million could be cut from the money spent helping some of Leicestershire most vulnerable children get to and from schools and nurseries.
Conservative-run Leicestershire County Council has proposed a series of controversial measures to save cash.
Currently some 400 special educational needs (SEN) children get discounted transport.
The moves will also affect some families whose children are in mainstream education.
Parents are asked to pay an annual contribution of £660 for this transport, but low income families are currently exempt from the charge.
Now the council is planning to reduce the level of discount available to children and young people from low income families for transport to nursery and post-16 education.
It also wants to stop offering council arranged taxis and minibuses to transport SEN students to post-16 education and offer a Personal Transport Budget instead.
That will mean parents will have to arrange their own transport with a budget offered to them rather than have council officials take care of it.
Finally the council wants to stop providing transport to post-16 education for eligible mainstream post-16 students.
In all, the proposed changes could save up to £964,000 a year.
The council says it is under increasing pressure to meet the growing costs of SEN transport to school and the demand for it.
However parents have said their families could be plunged into crisis if they lose affordable transport.
They are begging the council to drop the plans.
Annie Bannister's 18-year-old son is one of the youngsters who benefit from the financial system.
Annie, from Harborough, warned that parents would have to withdraw their children from school if the planned cuts proceeded.
She said: “Our kids can't stay at home by themselves, they simply can't.
“Families will have to give up work and it is social workers that will have to pick up the pieces.
“I know it costs everybody but the long term cost of denying them education is far, far worse.
“We want our kids to have the best opportunities in our fairly blighted lives.”
She said it would make it even harder for children to get jobs in the future if they were denied.
Labour county councillor Max Hunt said he had read some of the stories from parents who will be affected by the cuts and they had made him weep.
He said: “The pain they are going through now and the pain we are going to inflict on them is not worth consideration.
“We are hurting the most vulnerable children from the most vulnerable families.”
County Hall says it faces difficult decisions as it looks to save £66 million over the next four years.
It says no decisions have been made and a consultation on the issue runs until December 21.
Maybe Donald Trump should reconsider trying to woo Bernie Sanders' supporters.
The Vermont senator, who has endorsed former competitor Hillary Clinton, lambasted Trump in Sunday morning interviews.
Sanders was blunt in talking to George Stephanopoulos on ABC's "This Week." "To my mind, what is most important now is the defeating of the worst candidate for president that I have seen in my lifetime, Donald Trump, who is not qualified to be president by temperament, not qualified to be president by the ideas that he has brought forth," Sanders said.
The senator blasted Trump for proposed tax breaks, for denial of climate change and for insults against Mexicans, Latinos, Muslims, women, veterans and African-Americans.
"Right now we have got to defeat Trump, we have to elect Hillary Clinton," Sanders said. "We have to elect progressive candidates in the House, and in the Senate, and school boards, and city councils. And most importantly, we have got to continue the fight for an agenda to create a government that works for all of us, and not just the people on top."
Sanders told Chuck Todd on NBC's "Meet the Press" that no candidate lies like Trump. Sanders also said he would have preferred to see Sen. Elizabeth Warren -- instead of Sen. Tim Kaine -- as Clinton's running mate.
In a joint "60 Minutes" interview with Clinton, Kaine takes issue with Trump's name-calling against Clinton.
"When I see this 'Crooked Hillary,' or I see the 'Lock her up,' it's just ridiculous. It is ridiculous," Kaine tells Scott Pelley. "It is beneath the character of the kind of dialogue we should have. Because we got real serious problems to solve. And look, most of us stopped the name-calling thing about fifth grade."
The interview airs at 7 p.m. Sunday (tonight) on CBS.
Republican presidential nominee Trump gave a lengthy interview to "Meet the Press" and dismissed criticism that his acceptance speech Thursday was too dark.
"I thought it was very optimistic. To me, it was an optimistic speech," Trump told Chuck Todd. "Because we're going to stop the problems. We're going to stop the problems. In other words, sure, I talk about the problems, but we're going to solve the problems."
Trump also responded to criticism of his speech line that "I alone can fix it."
"I'm comparing myself to Hillary," Trump told Todd. "And we know Hillary, and we look at her record. Her record has been a disaster. And I am running against Hillary. It's not like I'm running against the rest of the world. I know people that are very, very capable that could do a very good job, but they could never get elected. ... I am comparing myself to crooked Hillary Clinton. And I will do a much better job. I'll do a great job. I'll bring the country back. I'll bring our jobs back."
In an interview with Ted Koppel on "CBS Sunday Morning," Trump complained that the media have been "very dishonest."
"But we put up with it. But I let people know about it," Trump added.
Yet Trump agreed with Koppel's view that the candidate wouldn't be where he is without the media.
"But you have tremendous dishonesty in the media, tremendous," Trump added. "I've never seen anything like it, more so in the last number of months, I think, than I've ever seen it. With that being said, you have to power through it, and I do that. And it seems to be working out pretty well. But I do like to expose it."
When Koppel said that the media have exposed Trump's "misstatements," the presidential candidate replied: "Well, I think that I'm an honest person. I feel I'm an honest person. And I don't mind being criticized at all by the media, but I do want them to be straight about it."
After that, Koppel observed in the narration: "Trump seems to deal with unpleasant reality by ignoring or denying it."
Oooh weeeee.

I want to thank you so much for the great items you sent me. I was not expecting all that. Hopefully your match got you something good!
Thanks again!!
Best Answer: HA!
If he doesn't love you know, he never will. Satan may FORCE him to, but it isn't real- so it isn't love. It'll all be fake, an act, manipulated by darkness.
Satan will also twist your wish around so you or your love end up dead, abused, or horrified forever.
He is evil, don't you see? No mercy, no love, PURE evil. Not one speck of goodness, like most people: He has nothing. He will eat you, limb by limb, save your blood and fork your eyes up and not even feel disgusted. He will do even worse things. He is hell, he is evil. Make a deal with him, and you're WORSE OFF THAN DEAD.
He will torture you until death seems like the best thing in the world, and you won't even give a DAMN about your lover after you make a deal with Satan. In fact, you won't have ANY time of happiness with him. Not 1 second. He will never love you, especially after you are desperate enough to go with the devil!
Also, if he won't notice you, doesn't that tell you something? It simply wasn't meant to BE, or he'd notice you. He just doesn't love you yet, or perhaps he never will- but then he isn't your soulmate! There is one person out there who loves you so much you can't even imagine, and you will love them beyond measure or words, but you'll never meet that soulmate if you sell your soul to the devil- ANY contract is selling your soul, BTW.
Your soul is the most prescious thing in the world. THE. It is invinsible, it never dies, it is yours alone and everything you believe, love, everything- you sell it, you don't even have YOURSELF. Your thoughts aren't your own, your heartbeat- NOTHING. You are nothing. When you die, even DEATH isn't your own. There is no way out.
But, fine. If you want a ritual, and i can't convince you not to kill yourself for eternity (and longer, eternity has no end, you will be tortured forever, no way out. As not even pain is yours now) then, fine, here is the ritual.
MATERIALS: (Please, don't do this!)
-Paper
-Wood
-Fire lighter
-Knife
-black coal that makes marks on the ground
STEPS: (I AM BEGGING YOU NOT TO DO THIS PLEASE, YOU WILL DO HORRIBLY)
Write the following on a piece of paper, preferrably cotton:
I, (FULL NAME), accept the following transaction without being conversed into this mutually agreement.
That upon services rendered by the second party, to which will be referred hereafter as St. Lucifer, granting me (STATE WHAT IT IS YOU WANT);
I, (YOUR FULL NAME), hereby exchange my soul and very essences to St. Lucifer as Payment In-Full, for services rendered.
(SIGN X)
(SEAL X) Below you signature, you must smear your OWN (use knife) Blood upon Three side-by-side fingers and imprint the document with this.
To deliver the contract, is not hard at all and even the Bible tells you how.
Next months New Moon, just as the sun disappears over the horizon in the West, but yet there still rays of light on the horizon, burn the paper outside in the open. BUT, Make a circle with a satanist star in the middle, with the devils symbols around it. Put the fire and paper in the middle of the star. This is called sending a prayer, as the very smell will even reach heaven!

For years, pro football has allowed cut blocking. One type of cut blocking is chop blocking. And chop blocking now may be going the way of the dodo bird, Ray Rice, and the “how many fingers?” concussion test.
At their Saturday meeting in Naples, Florida, the NFL's Competition Committee discussed getting rid of the chop block completely.
“The chop block has been banned from both the high school and college game,” NFL executive V.P. of football operations Troy Vincent recently wrote. “We have a generation of players coming to the NFL who never used the chop block, yet they may be expected to initiate this technique that could result in a career-ending injury. We strongly need to consider removing this technique from the game.”
A chop block occurs when two offensive players attempt to impede a defensive player with a high-low technique. One hits the defender above the waist, while the other strikes him in the thigh or lower.
The first reaction by some (like me) may be, “Wait, I thought the chop block already was banned?” It most situations, it is. Rule 12, Section 2, Article 3 identifies three specific circumstances where the chop block is permitted, in running plays only.
First, two players initially aligned next to each other on the line of scrimmage may do it. Second, two players not initially aligned next to each other may do it if the flow of the play is toward the block. Third, two players may do it if one player was initially aligned in the backfield and hits the defender low while another player is blocking the defender high, as long as the action occurs outside the area initially occupied by the tight end on either side of the line.
Cut blocks (i.e., blocks at the thigh or below) have received plenty of criticism in recent years for the risk of knee and other leg injuries they create. At a time when the NFL has obsessed over protecting certain offensive players from potential head injuries, defensive players rightfully have complained that the NFL has no regard for their below-the-waist safety. Eliminating the chop block completely would confirm that the NFL has decided to take the issue seriously absent the same political pressure, liability, and/or threat to the future supply of football players that concussions present.
Some would say the cut block should be completely eliminated from the game. That viewpoint overlooks the reason for its addition to football in the first place. With football players coming in all shapes and sizes based on their vastly different roles and responsibilities, a small player typically can only impede a much larger player by taking him out at the legs.
If the NFL takes out that maneuver entirely, the league may see the current balance between offense and defense slide away from the current preference for the gaining of yards and the scoring of points. To anyone who nevertheless wants to see that happen, maybe the fair tradeoff would be to eliminate the tackling of a ball carrier by diving at his knees.
Benefits of Dehydration
Dehydrating your own backpacking meals is a great way to add variety to your backpacking menu, save money, and eat a healthy diet.
But those benefits aside, I've found that dehydrated food help with backpack volume reduction, weight reduction, and fuel savings. The fact is that dehydrated foods take up much less volume in your backpack. The weight of that food is also important of course, but if you need more volume, you'll need a larger heavier backpack.
Weight reduction comes for free when you dehydrate most foods. Drying a cantaloupe, mashed sweet potatoes, canned beans, and other frozen or fresh vegetables yields unbelievable weight reductions because they're mostly water. However, you derive a negligible weight benefit by drying cooked grains or pasta. For these foods, your savings come from reduced fuel, since you dehydrate these after cooking them. Not having to boil pasta for 10 minutes can save you fuel weight, since all you have to do is to re-hydrate it in a cozy, fbc-style with hot water.
Anatomy of a Dehydrator (L'Equip 528)
The L'Equip 528 Dehydrator is the Mercedes-Benz of the dehydrator world, yet it's surprisingly affordable ($125). It's easy to use, fairly quiet, and elegantly designed. It also has a 12 year warranty. That alone makes this product stand out. I purchased mine on Amazon, but you can also find them in many cooking retail stores.
This is the first food dehydrator I've owned. I purchased it on the advice of Sarah Kirkconnell, author of Freezer Bag Cooking. She has a great post called Dehyrdrating 101 that I suggest you read before diving in.
This dehydrator's design is pretty simple. There's a base containing a motor, fan and 550 watt heating element. The drying temperature can be set from 93 degrees (F) to 158 degrees using a rotating dial on the exterior of the base.
The base model comes with 6 drying trays that are 17 inches long by 11 inches wide and provide up to 12 square feet of drying space. Additional trays, up to 20, can be stacked on one base unit, and are available for purchase separately.
Each tray comes with an additional fine meshed screen that prevents smaller foods from dropping to the lower level as they dry and shrink. In addition, the base model comes with two clear trays for making fruit roll-ups or drying extremely wet foods. These can also be purchased separately, but you can also use silconized parchment paper instead.
All of these components should be washed by hand and are not rated dishwater safe, but dried-on food is easy to soak off and cleanup between batches is pretty simple.
Practical Tips
Here are a few tips to using the L'Euip that I can pass a long:
If you're drying a wet food, like spaghetti, mashed sweet potatoes, or fruit, it's best to dry it in two stages. In stage 1, line your trays with silconized parchment paper and put the food on it. Make sure to leave some space at the end of each tray for the hot air to flow up and between trays. After the pasta hardens up, remove it from the parchment paper and dry it directly on the mesh tray liners supplied by L'Equip. This will speed up the time it takes to dry the pasta and ensure that it's properly dried all the way through.
If you plan on eating spaghetti sauce with pasta, mix them together before drying. When re-hydrated you'll have a better outcome since each piece of pasta will be covered in sauce.
Rehydrating bark (pumpkin bark, shown here) produces a better, more uniform substance, if you pulverize it in a blender after dehydrating it on parchment paper. Dry as shown here, then peel off and transfer to a blender. Don't store it too long before use or it will solidify into a hard lump.
More Advice
Drying your food takes a lot of work and over time you'll figure out that some unprepared or commodity foods are easier purchased than made at home. For example, Harmony House and Packit Gourmet provide an extensive and affordable selection of pre-dried fruit, vegetables, and textured vegetable protein. You still need to combine the ingredients into recipes and prepared meals, but if you're in a rush or don't have the time to prepare base ingredients, these folks provide a much-needed shortcut.
I hope this post was useful. If you have any advice or comments about dehydrating your own food, please leave a comment below.

Months after a virulent measles outbreak spread from one Disneyland visitor to more than 100 California residents, the state that's been described as an “anti-vaccination hotbed” is poised to pass one of the nation's toughest laws requiring immunizations.
The bill approved by the California Assembly Thursday strikes down the state's personal belief exemption, which allows parents to opt their children out of vaccinations for religious reasons. Under the new rules, only children with serious health problems (such as a compromised immune system) would be exempt from mandatory vaccination schedules, and those who opt out will have to be homeschooled.
The legislation now goes to California Gov. Jerry Brown (D). According to the Los Angeles Times, it's unclear if Brown will sign it.
“The governor believes that vaccinations are profoundly important and a major public health benefit, and any bill that reaches his desk will be closely considered,” Evan Westrup, Brown's spokesperson, told the Times Thursday.
[Disneyland measles outbreak strikes in anti-vaccination hotbed of California]
If the bill becomes law, California will become only the third state in the country to deny exemptions based on religious convictions. The other two are Mississippi and West Virginia.
But in California, many if not most of those who opt out of the state's mandatory vaccination schedules do so on the basis of “personal belief exemptions,” rather than religious ones. Though decades of studies have found vaccines to be safe, strains of vaccine skepticism are particularly high in some California communities. In January, the Post's Wonkblog found that in some school districts the fraction of kindergartners with PBES is more than half. At a handful of private schools it topped 75 percent.
Thirty-two other states bar vaccination exemptions based on personal or moral beliefs.

The debate about the vaccination bill has been vitriolic in recent weeks. According to the LA Times, Sen. Richard Pan (D-Sacramento), a pediatrician and an author of the bill, has received death threats. Protesters at the California Democratic Party's convention in Sacramento last month called the right to refuse vaccinations “a civil rights issue” and compared the state to Nazi Germany.
Hundreds of parents who converged on the Assembly this week said that the legislation would take away their right to make decisions about what's best for their child's health. And Assemblyman Mike Gatto (D-Glendale) told the LA Times that the bill was likely unconstitutional because it “infringes on the rights of children to attend school.”
[Amid measles outbreak, anti-vaccine doctor revels in his notoriety]
For their part, proponents of the legislation were not above using tear-jerker tactics to support their cause. On Wednesday, advocates for stricter requirements stood beside 7-year-old leukemia survivor Rhett Krawitt as he delivered a petition bearing 30,000 signatures to the governor. Earlier this year, Krawitt gave a rousing speech at a local school board meeting in which the first grader said “I give a damn” about mandatory vaccinations. Because his own immune system has been compromised by chemotherapy, Krawitt's parents say, he can't be vaccinated, leaving him vulnerable to measles and other infectious diseases.
The issue of vaccinations is so charged because it pits personal choices against an epidemiology principle known as “herd immunity.” As the Department of Health and Human Services explains it:
When a critical portion of a community is immunized against a contagious disease, most members of the community are protected against that disease because there is little opportunity for an outbreak. Even those who are not eligible for certain vaccines—such as infants, pregnant women, or immunocompromised individuals—get some protection because the spread of contagious disease is contained.
When the level of immunization drops low enough, diseases like measles, which is highly contagious, can spread rampantly among the unprotected population. While healthy unvaccinated kids usually survive a bout of measles (and it's worth noting that there have been no fatalities reported so far from the Disneyland outbreak), people with weakened immune systems — the elderly, children under five, immunocompromised people like Krawitt — are vulnerable to severe and sometimes fatal complications.
“Measles is not a benign disease,” Tara C. Smith, an epidemiologist at Kent State University, wrote in Slate earlier this year.
Ariel Loop, a Pasadena mother whose 4-month-old son Mobius was infected during the Disneyland measles outbreak, told the LA Times she was relieved that the bill got approved.
“I'm hoping Jerry Brown does the right thing and signs it once it gets through the last Senate [vote],” Loop said.
Singapore accounts for a disproportionate number of Asia's webpages containing images of child sexual abuse, a disturbing trend that experts say needs close monitoring.
The island's tally made up 12 per cent of nearly 2,000 such webpages hosted across the continent last year, Britain-based charity Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) found.
The majority involved children aged 10 and below. Some of the photographs and videos depicted sadism, penetrative sexual activity or such activity with an animal.
Such Singapore-hosted webpages almost doubled in the first 10 months of this year, to 412. This is up from 211 last year, and 10 and 13 in 2015 and 2014 respectively.
The jump, which comes amid a worldwide increase, worries experts here who said an attraction to child pornography could lead to paedophilia if not treated.
"Those who view sexual abuse imagery of children may start off being curious due to its availability online," said clinical psychologist Matthew Woo, who also treats sex offenders. "If they continue, it will escalate, and they could develop paedophilia."
Last year, the Ministry of Social and Family Development investigated 107 cases of sexual abuse involving children, up from 82 in 2015.

Others noted that the hosts of the webpages may not be physically based in Singapore, which is a hub for webhosting services. Therein lies the difficulty of nabbing the perpetrators.
Said Association of Criminal Lawyers of Singapore president Sunil Sudheesan: "While the police can take action if they come to learn of obscene material on Singapore-hosted URLs, the issue is identifying the perpetrators. Anyone can buy a domain space and hide behind anonymity."
Cybersecurity researcher Lam Kwok Yan said it is easy to use a complex networking approach to hide one's physical location.
IWF, which focuses on removing child sexual abuse images, said globally, over 57,000 URLs last year were found to have such images, or links to it or to advertise it. Of these, 92 per cent were hosted in five nations: the Netherlands, United States, Canada, France and Russia.
IWF data and the charity did not say how many websites the Singapore-hosted URLs belonged to. One website may have multiple URLs.
When IWF identifies such webpages, it passes the information to Interpol which then liaises with the host countries, its director of external relations Emma Hardy told ST. Local authorities work with Internet service providers (ISPs) to have the content removed if it is deemed illegal under domestic laws.
When contacted, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) said it works with ISPs to restrict public access to a limited number of sites as a "symbolic statement" and updates the list from time to time.
However, "sites that are used to facilitate illegal activities will be restricted for public safety and security reasons", said a spokesman.
She added that ISPs are required to exercise judgment to ensure that their content and services comply with the local regulations.

These include the Class Licence conditions, where ISPs, when required by the authorities, are to prevent user access to content found undesirable, harmful or obscene. Under IMDA's Internet Code of Practice, a licensee is to use his best efforts to ensure prohibited material is not broadcast here.
The police said they take action on cases where necessary, after assessing the facts after a report is lodged. ISPs StarHub, M1 and Singtel said they cooperate with the authorities to restrict access to sites containing objectionable material.
Putting up obscene content online may be an offence under the Films Act or Undesirable Publications Act, which define "obscene" films as ones that "tend to deprave or corrupt" a person. It is also against the law to keep or sell pornographic material.
I Would Like to Be Pope
Dear sir or madam,
I am writing to apply for the position of Pope. I recently received my Bachelor of Arts, or “artium baccalaureus,” from Dartmouth College, with a major concentration in Theatre Studies and a minor concentration in Computer Science. While I have been focusing on the technology and financial sectors, I have recently decided to widen my job search to include top non-profits, such as your organization. I became aware of the availability of the position of Pope through the Dartmouth listserv; I am greatly impressed by the achievements of The Catholic Church and share many of its goals. I believe my qualifications and outlook make me a unique and interesting candidate for Pope and I would be enthusiastic to grow with The Catholic Church.
Over the past four years, I have worked tirelessly to receive the kind of well-rounded education that is indispensible to today's leaders, whether in the boardroom, the operating room, or the Vatican. My thesis project, a musical King Lear that took place entirely on Facebook, integrated my chosen areas of study, including Advanced Shakespeare, Social Media and Society and 20th Century History of Latin Jazz. As social chair of my fraternity, AXA, I not only increased the attendance of our weekly No Pants Parties by 30%, I successfully persuaded the Dartmouth Disciplinary Council to permit AXA to conduct internal reviews of alleged incidents of sexual harassment and bullying. I am a problem solver.
While I have never studied Catholicism per se, I have several credits in World Religions and, as the intern supervisor at the prominent, Oakland law firm of Russ, Davies & Chalmers will confirm, I am a quick study. Additionally, I have noted your organization's expanding client base in South America. This is an area in which I am well versed, after spending an entire semester in Buenos Aires, where I became intimately acquainted with the people, their food and their culture. Well traveled and a man of the world, my Spanish language skills “hablar” for themselves.
As your website notes, the role of Pope includes “Guiding the College of Cardinals, and the masses.” Through my participation in the Freshman Buddy Program, I have helped many younger students through difficult situations, including homesickness and mono. I feel like it is important to give back, a value I believe any organization would appreciate in their Pope.
As an excellent student with advanced people skills and an exciting resume, with a desire to be part of a challenging, energetic, and reputable organization, I will be a valuable addition to The Catholic Church as your new Pope.
While I am focusing my employment search in the San Francisco Bay area, I am open to a discussion of relocation.
I thank you in advance for your consideration,
John Ortved

The Best of McSweeney's Internet Tendency
Europeans are searching for an idea: What should the Europe of the future look like? Could a federation of European nations function? How could a working government in Brussels be structured? And could a continent-wide democracy foster unity and solidarity among European nations? In a three-part series, SPIEGEL reports on new plans to restructure the European Union. This is Part 3. Be sure to also read Part 1 and Part 2.
Europe has a face. It can grin, and it has freckles. Almost everyone in Germany knows it. It's the face of Daniel Cohn-Bendit, 66, the Green member of the European Parliament and former revolutionary.
No one else can explain To Europe the way "Red Dany" can. No one but this polyglot global citizen can convince people in almost every country on the continent to listen and to pick up at least some of the enthusiasm he exudes for Europe. "There will be a United States of Europe," he says. "I'm sure of that."
Cohn-Bendit does not plan to run in the next European election. He wants to enjoy his retirement. People like him are no longer dependent on the sensitivities of member states, or on political calculations. Instead, Dany can barge straight across the traditional territory of political interests. Seen from his perspective, Europe looks simple.
The Green politician envisions a united Europe organized roughly along the lines of the Federal Republic of Germany: with a government in Brussels, the European Commission, whose members are elected by the European Parliament (EP). The European Council in Brussels would serve as a second governing body next to the parliament, and it would also be involved in writing legislation for Europe. A united Europe's foreign and defense policy, as well as its financial policy and large parts of its economic policy, would be managed in Brussels.
United States of Europe?
That's what a United States of Europe could look like. Politicians of widely differing stripes, in Brussels and in many member states, including Germany, hold similar views. But who is a other than the brightly optimistic Cohn-Bendit has the confidence to express them? Anyone who toys with such models is quickly suspected of being a traitor to his or her country. What would fellow party members and voters at home think about the idea of concentrating all the power in Brussels?
Political scientists and intellectuals in many European think tanks have already taken the notion of a European federal state a few steps further. Some say that it would make sense to emulate the United States of America and replace the European Council with a senate. As in Washington, the emissaries from the individual states would not simply be members of the government, but would in fact be elected representatives of their respective states -- senators with direct democratic legitimacy.
In the United States, where many currently fear for the future of Europe, some people are also thinking about possible solutions. For example, Joseph Weiler, a New York expert on international and European law, proposes the establishment of a European constitutional court at the head of a united continent. Using Germany's Federal Constitutional Court as a model, it would contain and, if necessary, correct the power held in Brussels, as well as giving citizens the peace of mind that someone is keeping an eye on their government. To minimize objections from national constitutional courts, the higher Brussels court would consist of judges appointed by the member states.
There are plenty of plans for how Europe, as a major power, would adopt a united position vis-à-vis the financial markets and other global powers. Academics in many disciplines are developing models for a functioning European democracy, a body politic whose citizens would feel and act as "Europeans" rather than members of an individual nation-state.
Traditional Identities Losing Influence
One of their leaders is Jürgen Habermas. "Territorial growth and numerical expansion of the population already changes the complexity of the process of formation of public opinion and the political will," says Habermas, a hugely influential thinker on democracy. Of course, he adds, the "cooperation of the citizens of all the countries involved" requires certain preconditions: a functioning "deliberation" process, a Europe-wide public sphere and "inclusion," the equal and coercion-free opportunity for everyone to take part in a society of Europeans.
Those who are optimistic about Europe believe that the necessary conditions are constantly improving. "The claim that there is no European nation contradicts the systemic convergence of multicultural global society," says Habermas. Many others agree, and point out that the world's societies of the 21st century will be completely mixed up, and while traditional identities will remain in place, they will lose their influence. The nation of the Germans will not perish, and yet its society has already lost national exclusivity, now that one in five Germans comes from an immigrant family.
It is inevitable that a shared European identity will develop in tandem with national identity, says Frankfurt constitutional law expert Erhard Denninger. Even today, he notes, there is a "consensus on basic ethical issues." Respect for human dignity, the individual and democratic law unites Europeans, as does the absolute belief in the invisible hand of the market and the absolute need to control this market through the efforts of the social welfare state.
"The ethical exclusivity that characterizes a nation state is no longer appropriate in an era of no borders," says British political consultant Robert Cooper, who feels that national patriotism is obsolete. Cooper, who worked for the European Council in Brussels for many years and is currently a consultant to the foreign service of the European Union, now feels that eurocrats are "more patriotic" than his fellow Britons.
A New Sense of Patriotism
It is the patriotism of global citizens who are concerned about human rights, not unlike the German idea of "constitutional patriotism," associated with Habermas, where citizens feel a sense of patriotism based on their shared political values rather than a shared ethnic identity or language. Such a pan-national patriotism is also based on an international consensus that has produced new institutions like the International Criminal Court in The Hague, which stands guard over the ethical values of a postnational society.
With this much commonality, cultural differences are not an impediment to a shared society. Germany's pluralistic, federally organized society has experienced this first hand. To shape common policies, one doesn't have to like the same music, or even have the same ideas about punctuality, cleanliness or order. Besides, the global communication network of the Internet already shapes the hearts and minds of younger generations of European citizens more decisively than the traditions they experience around the family hearth or at the local pub.
In 2009, researchers conducted an experiment as part of a European Union project dubbed Europolis. They brought together 348 men and women from the continent's various linguistic regions for three days. Accompanied by moderators and interpreters, the participants were to debate two challenging subjects: climate change and immigration.
The polyglot group of Europeans did not come up with any answers after three days of discussion. Nevertheless, interviews conducted at the beginning and after the end of the debate led the scientists to recognize an effect across all language barriers, namely that opinions had changed. "There are no fundamental obstacles to the introduction of deliberative democracy in Europe," they concluded. In the hothouse of the conference room, a miniature version of a European nation had begun to emerge.
This isn't terribly surprising. A look at quadrilingual Switzerland shows that democratic discourse functions across language barriers. Of course, such discourse is only attractive when it is conducted by fascinating leaders. Only then will the national media do the job that Habermas would like them to do, calling it their "responsibility for the success of Europe." According to Habermas, the media "must open the eyes of readers to the points of view of others."
Boring and Complicated
This only works, say journalists, if there is something to talk about. "It's about time that interesting people were sent to Brussels," says Alexander Graf Lambsdorff, the chairman of Germany's liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) group in the European Parliament. The "stories we tell," says Lambsdorff, are "too complicated," and the people telling them are usually too boring.
Politics in Brussels is boring and complicated because the participants, unlike politicians in the member states, are not forced to undergo the trials and tribulations of democratic elections. Neither the commissioners nor the president of the European Commission are governing in Brussels because their ideas and speeches have ever convinced a single voter. Commissioners are sent to Brussels by the national governments, not by the national parliaments.
The members of the European Parliament, who at least are now required to approve the Commission as a whole, also have little to say to their voters. They are usually unknown at home. In nationally organized European elections, the faces of the top candidates on the lists appear briefly on uninspiring campaign posters. But the text on the posters usually deals with issues that have little to do with Europe and much to do with the national positions of the respective party.
So where should these excite new European politicians come from? "Until now, Europe has played no role at all at the national party conventions," says Lambsdorff. And why should it? After all, the leadership that Europe needs is increasingly not being done in Brussels but through agreements among the leaders of the member states. The process of delegitimization keeps going. Elections to the European Parliament have become little more than a tedious but necessary task for the parties. Ordinary people, too, are equally unenthusiastic, as shown by the most recent voter turnout of 43 percent in the 2009 election.
Only an election featuring individual personalities can inspire the European public and yield respectable results. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble, long a firm believer in Europe, says: "I would like to see the direct election of a European president. Then we will already have a much stronger European consciousness by the time of the first reelection." Schäuble envisions a president for Europe who would head the European Council and Commission, and would be armed with political power and new competencies. A European public sphere could emerge as a result of the contest for such a position.
Heather Lorimer, an associate professor in genetics at Youngstown State University, helping further a Change.org petition aiming to shut down a local campus Chick-fil-A franchise for its "homophobic" behavior.
Lorimer, who spoke to Campus Reform, said that the restaurant is a veritable hotbed of "fried food for homophobes," and that she fully supports the petition created by students within the university.
She said, "I am a professor at YSU. I have not set foot up there since they became Chick-fil-A. A long time ago it used to be a respectable place where you could take an invited speaker out to lunch and even have table service. We now have no such place and I will not support Fried Food for Homophobes, which is what I think of Chick-fil-A.”
Lorimer continued, “Chick-fil-a is well known for its CEO's bigotry. Since it has been Chick-fil-A I have not set a foot in it.”
The petition reads:
"As most YSU students know, there are few places open on campus to get food past three. The main exception to this is the campus's Chick Fil A. More often than not, it's the only place to get food in the evenings. Chick Fil A has faced controversy over the years for statements by its founder regarding members of the LGBT community. Although they have released an apology for the statement, it was recently found that Chick Fil A is still donating money to anti-LGBT organizations."
Calling for 200 signatures, the petition concludes:
"Obviously, replacing the Chick Fil A would not change the company's views or anything, but it would be an act of solidarity for the campus's LGBT students."
A spokesperson for YSU provided a statement to College Reform, claiming that the university has no plans to remove the Chick-fil-A from its campus. The statement read:
"The Chick-fil-A brand is pervasive on college and university campuses throughout the nation and is an extremely popular choice for our students at YSU, as well. As part of the YSU Culture of Community initiative, the university recently formed a new Inclusion and Awareness Committee to help us better appreciate our diversity and to help us work together to overcome and prevent societal divisions. We invite those with concerns about Chick-fil-A to join in Committee discussions and participate in efforts to promote and nurture respect and to develop a campus community where everyone feels safe and secure."
Goodyear has revealed two innovative new concept tires at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show that could literally reshape the future for autonomous cars.
The concepts: the spherical-shaped Eagle-360 – a future-oriented tire – was designed with key features of maneuverability, connectivity and biomimicry for autonomous mobility, while the IntelliGrip, featuring advanced sensor and treadwear technology, is a solution for the earlier adoption of self-driving vehicles.
Both tires are designed with safety in mind, which according to recent studies, is a key concern among consumers around autonomous vehicles. They reflect Goodyear's focus on anticipating the rapidly evolving needs of its customers.
Goodyear Eagle-360
The Goodyear Eagle-360 is a spherical-shaped design concept tire that would provide self-driving cars ultimate maneuverability, connectivity and biomimicry to increase safety.
– Maneuverability: The multi-orientation of the spherical-shaped tire allows the car to move in all directions, contributing to safety for passengers, as well as coping with space limitations such as tight parking lots or city streets.
– Connectivity: Embedded sensors further increase safety by communicating road and weather conditions to the vehicle control system and other nearby cars, while tread and tire pressure monitoring technology regulate even wear of the 360-degree tire to extend mileage.
– Connected via magnetic levitation: The tires would rely on a magnetic levitation system to suspend the car resulting in a smooth, quiet ride for the passenger.
– Biomimicry: Inspired by nature, the 3D printed tread mimics the pattern of brain coral and behaves like a natural sponge – designed to stiffen in dry conditions and soften when wet to deliver excellent driving performance and aquaplaning resistance.
Goodyear IntelliGrip
The Goodyear IntelliGrip concept tire is designed to communicate with autonomous vehicle control systems, sensing road surface and weather conditions for improved driving safety and performance.
– Senses road conditions: Thanks to its advanced sensor technology and specially designed tread, the concept tire can sense many road conditions, including both surface and weather conditions.
– Active-wear technology: The IntelliGrip also uses advanced active wear technology to assess the condition of the tire and the vehicle.
– Custom algorithms: Goodyear-developed algorithms account for variables such as inflation pressure and tire temperature.
– Adapting to road conditions: When the tire senses a rainy or slippery road surface, the autonomous vehicle will adapt its speed. Additionally, the tire can shorten the stopping distance, provide a better cornering response, optimize stability and even support collision prevention systems.
– Technology adaption: Goodyear is working with a number of vehicle manufacturers to further adapt this technology to their needs, enhancing connectivity with features such as Electronic Stability Control Systems, Brake Control Systems and Suspension Control Systems.
Redskins release Clinton Portis
By Mike Jones
Updated: 2:12 p.m.
The Redskins announced Monday that they have released running back Clinton Portis, the second-leading rusher in franchise history with 6,824 yards.
"Clinton provided excitement from the very first time he touched the ball as a Redskin and we were lucky to witness every ounce of energy, effort and passion he has given ever since," Redskins Owner Daniel M. Snyder said in a statement released by the team. "We have been through a lot both on and off of the field and we would like to wish him and his family the very best. He will always be a Redskin and go down as one of the franchise's all-time greats."
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clinton Portis says that he expects to be released by the Washington Redskins on Monday.
Speaking with Washington Post columnist Mike Wise on his radio show with Holden Kushner on 106.7 The Fan, Portis said that the impending move "was a decision that was best for the both of us," and that he looks forward to continuing his career with another team.
The second-leading rusher in franchise history, Portis was owed $8.3 million for the 2011 season. But after Portis's past two seasons were shortened because of injuries, Redskins brass couldn't see retaining Portis at that price, Coach Mike Shanahan said Friday.
"If we're not going to sign Clinton to that high salary, I'll let him test the market out," Shanahan explained. "Not to say we don't want him, but for a lower price, and obviously we'll try to find the best deal."
Portis said he doesn't feel a need or desire to return to the Redskins, but money isn't his reason for wanting to leave.
"In Washington, it's nothing left me to prove," said Portis, who in eight years as a Redskin rushed for 6,824 yards and 46 touchdowns. "It's not about the money for me at this stage in my career. It's about winning. I hope to help a team win rings, and that's what I'm looking forward to. Going in onto someone else's team and not having to be worried about Portis, Portis, Portis, and just to be able to contribute in any way I can, that will be a wonderful thing."
Portis hasn't played a full season since 2008, when he rushed for 1,487 yards and nine touchdowns. The following season, he suffered a concussion and missed the last eight games. This past season, Portis played just five games. He started the first four, but suffered a third-degree groin pull in the first half of Washington's game at Philadelphia. Portis missed the next six weeks, attempted a comeback against Tennessee, but on his fifth carry of the game, he tore a lower abdominal muscle, which required season-ending surgery.
Portis, 29, has rushed for 9,923 yards in his career, which ranks 26th on the NFL's career list, but he refutes the notion that his days as a feature back are over.
More of the Portis interview is on The Early Lead.
"I think missing games the last two seasons provided me the opportunity to rest me up," Portis said. "Coming off the groin injury, being away from the game and being on the outside looking in, before that, I don't even think I was a fan of the game. I think the most exciting thing that I've seen in the last two years was the run [Tennessee Titans running back] Chris Johnson had. But I think it developed and gave me a passion for the game and an appreciation for the craft. A lot of people look at me now and it's a hype situation and who's the man opposed to having that grind for the game and approaching it as a craft, and that's something I want to bring back."
Portis later added, "I'll never do [a two-running back system]. I wouldn't adopt that mind-set."
Portis told Wise and Kushner that the passion he now feels is something that he has been missing since Joe Gibbs retired from his second stint as Redskins coach following the 2007 season. Gibbs' first major personnel move was the acquisition of Portis from Denver in exchange for cornerback Champ Bailey. Under Gibbs, Portis and the Redskins reached the playoffs two times in four years, but also endured the murder of Sean Taylor, the team's starting safety and Portis' best friend.
"I have never seen anybody give up or with their head down with Coach Gibbs," Portis said. "As many close games as we played and came up short during his era, you can't say one time that we gave up. There was a passion and toughness amongst everybody on that field to fight until [time expired]."
Portis had said last year that the arrival of Mike Shanahn in Washington rejuvenated him. Shanahan drafted Portis in Denver and coached him two seasons. But in his interview today, Portis didn't speak as fondly of Shanahan as he did of Gibbs, and says Shanahan didn't feature him in the offense this year as he did back in Denver. He said that he still believes Shanahan will rebuild the Redskins into a contender, but "I just don't think it's right now."
It appears Portis' Redskins career will end with him standing 684 yards shy of John Riggins' franchise rushing record. At one point, Portis had said surpassing that mark meant more to him than anything other than winning a Super Bowl. But today, Portis said that that mark doesn't mean as much to him as he thought it did; otherwise, he would re-sign with the Redskins for less and go after Riggins' record.
"If John Riggins is the only one you can say did more than me as a Redskins' running back, then that's pretty good company," Portis conceded.
The Redskins now must decide if Ryan Torain and Keiland Williams give them the best opportunity to succeed at running back, or if they should pursue another back in free agency or the draft. Torain, a two-year veteran, led Washington last season with 742 yards and four touchdowns in 10 games. Williams, who just completed his rookie season, accounted for another 261 yards and three touchdowns.

Where Battlefront II's new single player mode is attempting something different (both the mode and its content), the focus for the returning multiplayer component seems to be more about refinement. The last Battlefront got a lot right, but it also occasionally felt like gorgeous blueprints for something better to come. This could well be it.
Burnout creators Criterion have stepped in to take on the game's vehicles and head up a much-requested new feature; a full space combat mode. While the first game's baby steps into providing material from films other than the original trilogy have become a bold jump, this will be the first Star Wars game to include material from all three film eras (although Gungans have been studiously absent from the footage we've seen - make of that what you will).
Exit Theatre Mode
The philosophy seems to be about creating not only a picture-perfect Star Wars game, but one that offers more of the fantasy of being boots-on-the-ground in that universe. The ultimate goal is apparently to allow players to become heroes of their own, and not just by taking control of the characters they've watched on-screen before.
“ It'll have full classes, rather than changeable equipment loadouts.
While the team won't get into specifics at this point, there are some fairly telling changes from 2015's Battlefront. Firstly, we're teased with the idea that the new game will offer full classes, rather than the changeable equipment loadouts of the first. Each class will come with a shared progression system, but will change appearance depending on what map and side you're playing on - for instance, the prequels' Battle Droids and First Order troopers look very different, but are the same class with your chosen upgrades. That progression system's seemingly designed to let you feel as though you're moulding a character as you play, helping you get more attached, as well as fit your play-style.

That's going to apply to far more than grunts, however. Vehicles, heroes and “something else I shouldn't mention” (the words of creative director Bernd Diemer, who wouldn't be drawn on what that is) will all have their own individual progression systems, letting you add abilities to famous figures, or upgrade your favourite ships.
“ In Battlefront 1, being a 'hero' was a brief experience for the lucky few.
You shouldn't just feel invested in your favourite picks, but like you truly deserved to break them out mid-battle. One of the most dogged criticisms of DICE's first Battlefront game was that it rarely made you feel like you earned its biggest rewards. Accessing gadgets, vehicles and nigh-unstoppable heroes via floating holographic coins might have made things a little smoother - no more TIE Fighter bunfights as whole teams tried to climb into one cockpit - but it was hardly satisfying. The fact that collecting those power-ups was mostly a matter of good luck at the expense of other players, and that those moments could end pretty suddenly only compounded the issue.
Executive producer Matt Webster summarises that problem well: “it was a brief experience for the lucky few.” It's clearly a rehearsed line, most likely because a major part of the multiplayer team's job has been to fix it. While the devs, again, won't delve deep into exactly how the system will work, we're told that both heroes and vehicles will now work on what the team calls “a resource-based system”.

While power-ups will seemingly still be scattered around the battlefield, the implication is that players will earn some kind of in-match currency for performing well, then making the decision to trade that in for a rideable Tauntaun(!), or saving it up to step into Darth Maul's yet-to-be obsolete boots (though that specific decision won't happen in a single match, as heroes and vehicles are tied to era-appropriate maps). It should also make for a more exciting battlefield experience - the devs openly admit that they want more heroes on the field at once, but that comes at the cost of making them easier to dispatch for regular troopers.
“ Making close-quarters combat more satisfying.
Diemer explains that that the heroes - so far we know of Rey, Kylo Ren, Darth Maul, Yoda, Luke Skywalker and new single player (anti-)hero, Iden - are more physical this time around. It should make close-quarters combat more satisfying (“you cannot do Maul without him being a kick-ass melee fighter, right? That would be sad.”), but also make them feel less like the hovering laser-sponges of the last game.
There are a lot of smaller details still to learn - returning or new modes, how many planets we'll be visiting (we've been told that Yavin-4, Tatooine and Starkiller Base are included), whether the game will try to replicate the older Battlefront games' more ‘story-like battles' - but the focus is clear: the dev team wants Battlefront II to be a multiplayer game you don't just enjoy looking at, but that replicates the feeling of Star Wars' grandest moments.
Exit Theatre Mode
Matt Webster sums it up: “These are battles on a planet - that's the thing that people attach to. It's that that we've really wanted to lean into this time. It connected with people, it was a moment that connected to a fantasy in our heads. So beyond it looking awesome and being great fun, there was an emotional attachment to it. That's the power you get out of Star Wars, that was obvious and you hear the response from people - that's a great signal for us to lean into those moments.”
Battlefront's multiplayer looked right, but Battlefront II wants to feel right. The signs, right now, are pretty good.

Islamic State (IS) militants threatened to kill British hostage David Haines in a chilling video that was released on September 2, 2014 (AFP/SITE Intelligence Group)
U.S. officials are reporting that ISIS is supplying its fighters with an amphetamine called “Captagon”. This Adderall for jihadists—or as Stephen Colbert has called it, “Jihadderall”—allows soldiers to fight for days on end without sleep, and instills in them a feeling of invincibility. One captured ISIS militant told CNN that these pills have effects that “make you go to battle not caring if you live or die.” But in addition to powerful side effects that include both auditory and visual hallucinations, scientific studies show that long term amphetamine use can damage areas of the brain that lead to more psychotic behavior, as well as a hindered ability to doubt or resist instruction. As a result, Captagon may be creating an army of brainwashed, psychotic, fearless fighters who won't think twice about harming others or even themselves.
Courage Pills Or Crazy Pills?
After the ISIS attacks in Paris last month, French police raided a suburb and found needles that were used by the terrorists to inject Captagon, presumably to allow them to keep calm as they carried out the barbaric attack. Reports from Kurdish civilians who escaped ISIS forces in the Syrian city of Kobane described them as drug crazed. “They are filthy, with straggly beards and long black nails. They have lots of pills with them that they all keep taking. It seems to make them more crazy if anything.”
In recent years, the drug has become increasingly popular all over the Middle East, generating millions of dollars in revenue inside Syria alone. Many experts believe that ISIS is also trafficking the drug to help finance their war.
Captagon was originally developed in the 1960s as a drug used to treat hyperactivity disorders, but was later banned for causing serious hallucinations and being highly addictive. It is much cheaper and easier to make than most amphetamines, and is mass-produced in Lebanon for just pennies. This may allow ISIS to distribute it widely amongst its fighters, but also to make a high profit off trafficking, since the drug is often sold for around $20 a pill in Saudi Arabia.
Amphetamine And The Brain
So what kind of effects are these amphetamines having on the brains of ISIS members, and how is it affecting their behavior over the long term? Brain imaging studies from neuroscience have shown that repeated amphetamine use changes certain functions of the brain by deactivating electrical circuitry in a region known as the prefrontal cortex. This brain area is important for many critical roles, like impulse-control, rational decision-making, and the ability to doubt new knowledge.
Over time, amphetamine abuse leads to psychosis—a mental and emotional disorder so severe that one gets detached from external reality. It is quite likely that drug-fueled ISIS fighters are experiencing many of the symptoms and confused brain states commonly seen in schizophrenics. There aren't many things more terrifying than hallucinating, increasingly psychotic murderers and rapists who believe they are on a holy mission from God.
Damaged Brains = Brainwashing Made Easy
Just as disturbing is the fact that the amphetamines being constantly consumed by these blood-thirsty addicts are also dissolving their free will, making their brainwashing so concrete that all hope of reversing their mental state to a rational one disappears. Since the prefrontal cortex is necessary for the ability to doubt or be skeptical of new information, dysfunction in this area caused by Captagon is making more obedient soldiers who are precisely programmed to wage jihad and slaughter innocent civilians.
No Rationalizing With The Irrational
Determining how to fight ISIS most effectively requires understanding the mindset of the terrorists. From the reports detailing widespread Captagon use by ISIS members, we can ascertain that we are at war with drug-crazed jihadists who only become more psychotic and brainwashed over time. ISIS is creating an army of unpredictable tweekers that are progressively less concerned with the moral and ethical consequences of their actions. We cannot rationalize with this enemy, and we should not expect any sort of empathy from them. As such, there is no room for negotiation. Perhaps the only answer is to aggressively exterminate them with potent force and no dialogue or diplomacy.
Feyenoord 1 – 2 Ajax: A disappointing Classic and signs of an unwanted trend in the Eredivisie
Feyenoord and Ajax contested each other in the 164th edition of ‘The Classic' today. Regardless of actual rankings and present from, this Classic encounter remains one of the high-points of the year for both teams. The fierce rivalry between these clubs tends to bring out the best of games on the pitch ,but unfortunately also the worst of ‘supporters' behaviour outside of it. In an effort to control this violence, until 2014 the Eredivisie matches between Ajax and Feyenoord are to be played without any attending away fans, taking away much of the stadium atmosphere.
Feyenoord enters this year's Classic on the back of a 2-1-2 start to the season, leading to a ninth place at present. The debt-ridden club should prepare for a few years of the gray mid-table football, according to their outspoken director Leo Beenhakker. He continued this recent interview by stating that he considers himself to be a realist in predicting a mid-table role for his clubs in the next years. In spite of these concerning statements, manager Mario Been tried to raise confidence in his squad by stressing their home advantage and pointing at Ajax' recent tough game at the Bernabeu stadium in Madrid.
And indeed, Ajax enters this season's first Classic after a degrading 0-2 defeat by Madrid, where they played a tactically naive variant, vacating their right wing, thereby allowing Madrid to dominate the game completely. On the other hand, the performances of goalkeeper Stekelenburg, winning a place in UEFA CL Team of the Week in the meantime, and the return of Suarez and Vertonghen might install some confidence again.
Feyenoord manager Mario Been decided to punish right winger Ruben Schaken for allowing NAC right-back the freedom to score a late opening goal in their lost match against NAC Breda last week. Schaken was replaced by Fedor Smolov. Futhermore, young defender Leerdam was preferred in defensive midfield over the more experienced El Ahmadi. Feyenoord's formation was still best characterised as a 4-3-3 with Leerdam playing very close to his defense, giving Feyenoord a 5-2-3 look at times.
Ajax manager Jol also dropped one of his regular starting players. Defendive midfielder and stand-in captain Demi de Zeeuw was punished for both his positional indiscipline during the CL match against Real Madrid and for his verbal indiscipline right after that match, stating his opinion on his substitution in that match. Again, Sulejmani featured on the wing for Ajax, his preferred left one this time, meaning that Emanuelson started on the bench.
The opening phase of the match was characterised by a lack of structure. Both teams started preferred constant positional switching of their front line, but these switches were so frequent that their build-up had a difficult time finding the right players. Feyenoord's 5-2-3 lookout forced them into quite a few long balls in this initial phase of the game, where young striker Castaignos consequently lost in the air against either Vertonghen or Alderweireld.
Ajax, meanwhile, did not succeed in connecting with their forward three, lacking width and making their build-up all too transparent for Feyenoord's defense. It was no surprise that it took until the 16th minute to see a shot on target, neither was it a surprise that this chance came from an inside dribble from Suarez.
With both teams having a hard time controlling even their own build-up, the only danger was found in quick breaks after opposition errors, but given the rather high defensive line of both teams and the lack of true pace upfront, no real goal-scoring chances were created. Perhaps the best chance was seen when Smolov seemingly put Feyenoord 1-0 up, but he was correctly ruled offside.
Ajax brought some more width to the game around the 30-minute mark, when Sulejmani started to stick to the left side more, and their positional rotation was limited to Suarez and El Hamdaoui only. In addition to this change, also their defensive line took a deeper stance, offering a longer pitch and allowing more space for the four-band philosophy of the 4-2-3-1. Defensive midfielders Enoh and Lindgren, who as expected operated deeper than de Zeeuw usually does, started seeing more of the ball and found an easy outlet in left winger Sulejmani.
In line with the lack of beauty in this game, the opening goal was a result of a mishit clearance by de Vrij after an Ajax free kick. The ball fell to de Jong, who had escaped Fer's marking with a clever move, and his header put Ajax up 1-0.
Shortly hereafter, Feyenoord suffered a second blow by losing captain Vlaar due to injury. Right-back Stefan de Vrij was transferred to the centre and Leerdam to right-back. El Ahmadi entered in a defensive midfield role, and with Feyenoord forced to search for a goal, gradually developed into a box-to-box role as the match developed.
At half-time a second Feyenoord substitution was added. Pacy wing dribbler Schaken replaced Smolov, who expectedly disappointed in his out-of-position right wing role. As a result, also Feyenoord abolished their positional switches, lending more structure to their game.
In spite of these changes, it was Ajax who took the immediate initiative after half-time, and they did so by introducing the old principle of pressure. Feyenoord, thinking forward, seemed surprised and could not cope with this. The result was a series of chances both with El Hamdaoui and Suarez hitting the post, but also with El Hamdaoui scoring the 56th minute 0-2 from a beautiful Suarez through-ball.
The match seemed practically over now until Bahia scored the connecting 1-2 from a corner ). This goal, however, fits into the rather unwelcome modern trend to have another player deliberately obstruct the goalkeeper during a set piece. Diouf's obstruction against Fulham's Mark Schwarzer, allowing Blackburn's Dempsey to equalize in this Premier League match yesterday was discussed quite boldly by Alan Shearer on BBC's Match of the Day yesterday and one can only hope that these public voices contribute to the quick end of this unwanted trend.
The final ten minutes saw Ajax switching to survival tactics, aiming for possession only to play downtime and aiming to obstruct Feyenoord's play whatever way possible. However, this did not result in more than a few yellow cards for Ajax and the match ended with a 1-2 score.
Should you not have known that Ajax and Feyenoord are two high-profiled teams, in Holland at least, you would not have guessed on the basis of today's performance. The lack of width and the abundance of positional switches from both sides made for a disappointing match. In the end, Ajax ran out deserved winners, mainly based on the final fifteen minutes before and the first fifteen minutes after half-time.

Image copyright BT Image caption BT's advert confused the internet with the world wide web
An advert published by the UK's leading broadband provider indicates confusion within the firm about the internet's origins.
BT's Openreach division referred to the UK as the "country that invented the internet" in the ad, which was printed over the weekend.
However, the US is widely credited as being the net's creator thanks to a Department of Defense project that dates back to the 1960s.
BT has acknowledged the error.
"For most people, the words 'internet' and 'world wide web' are interchangeable," said a spokesman for the firm.
"We accept the language wasn't precise enough for some, but no harm has been done."
The internet refers to the millions of interlinked computer networks used to transmit data. It encompasses information sent via email, chat tools, apps and a range of other online services in addition to websites.
By contrast, the world wide web is a subsection of the internet made up of webpages, documents and other resources connected together via hyperlinks.
Birth of the net
The internet was born out of Arpanet, a US government-backed scheme that initially only connected the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) to the Stanford Research Institute (SRI), 400 miles (644km) away.
Image caption By 1971, Arpanet connected the east and west coasts of the US, but did not go beyond
It was not until 1973 that a university in the UK and a Norwegian research institute were added as the first international participants in the project.
Although University College London subsequently helped test the networking protocols that gave rise to what we now recognise as the internet, much of the original work on them had been carried out at Stanford.
"While Donald Davies and his team at the National Physical Laboratory can lay claim to having developed packet-switching that enabled the technological infrastructure of the internet, Vint Cerf and a number of Americans were the driving forces behind the Arpanet that became the internet," commented Prof Martin Campbell-Kelly, a trustee at The National Museum of Computing.
Common mix-up
It is not clear, however, that the UK can even lay claim to having invented the web.
The English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee was indeed its creator, but he was working at Cern - the European Particle Physics Laboratory in Switzerland - at the time.
Even so, one computing historian suggested BT's mistake was an easy one to have made.
"People mistakenly conflate the internet and the world wide web all the time," said Tom Lean.
"But while Britain may not have invented the internet, not only was the web co-invented by a Brit, BT themselves rolled out the world's first service that was a lot like the world wide web, Prestel, back in the 1980s.
"Sadly BT closed Prestel in the early 1990s, because they couldn't interest enough people in using it."
This country's migration patterns have hit a critical turning point with the monthly population gain from net migration down 4.8% in November compared to November last year, while the annual gain for the 12 months to November is unchanged from the previous 12 months.
Over the last few months the monthly net migration figures have been trending down compared to a year ago but the annual figures have been setting new highs.
The latest figures from Statistics NZ show that this country's net population gain from migration (long term arrivals minus long term departures) was 70,354 in the 12 months to the end of November, exactly the same as it was in the previous 12 months.
That signals an end to record annual incareses that have occurred over the last few years and there is a strong possibility that annual net gain figures will start showing declines compared to previous years over the next few months.
The turn in migration levels was caused by a slight decline in the number of migrants coming to this country, which dropped from 11,174 in November last year to 11,073 in November this year (-0.9%) but a bigger increase in the number of people departing long term, which rose from 4083 in November last year to 4322 in November this year (+5.9%).
However, although the net gain from migration is down from the previous 12 months, it is still extremely elevated compared to annual net gains of fewer than 50,000 in 2013 and fewer than 20,000 in 2012.
The biggest source country for new migrants remains China and Hong Kong, with a net gain of 11,138 in the year to November, followed by India 6787, the UK 6501, South Africa 4921 and the Philippines 4515.
There was a net loss of 1309 New Zealand citizens in the year to November, and a net gain of 71,683 citizens of other countries.
And in spite of the growing pressure the migration-driven population growth is placing on Auckland's infrastructure such as housing, transport and social services, it remains the most popular destination by far with migrants.
A net 36,294 migrants said they intended to live in Auckland in the year to November, which was up by 2758 (+8.2%) compared to the previous 12 months, suggesting Auckland may be less affected by the slow down in migration than other regions.
In addition, almost 11,000 migrants in the 12 months to November did not say where they intended to live, so it's liklely that Auckland's population gain from migration over that period was more than 40,000.
WASHINGTON ― The Senate confirmed Alexander Acosta to be the next labor secretary on Thursday, filling an important but long-vacant role in President Donald Trump's Cabinet.
Lawmakers voted 60-38 in favor of Acosta's nomination, with all Republicans and a handful of Democrats supporting the law school dean and former official in the George W. Bush administration. The son of Cuban immigrants, Acosta will be the first Latino to occupy one of Trump's Cabinet posts.
He will come to Washington to lead an agency in flux. Trump has signaled that he wants to dramatically reduce the budget at the Labor Department, which is tasked with enforcing the nation's labor laws and administering federal jobs training programs. The White House clearly envisions a more limited role for the agency in the U.S. economy, having repealed or stalled several labor regulations issued by Barack Obama.
While Democrats and labor groups brace for a more business-friendly Labor Department, Acosta, a former prosecutor, said in his March confirmation hearing that he was committed to enforcing wage and safety laws on behalf of workers. “Helping Americans find good jobs ― safe jobs ― should not be a partisan issue,” he told senators.
And yet Acosta made clear he intends to carry out Trump's agenda as it relates to labor issues, saying he would honor the White House's order to review all regulations currently on the books for potential repeal. He also indicated he's not a fan of Obama's significant overtime reforms, which would extend new wage protections to millions of salaried workers but are currently tied up in court.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) made her case against Acosta's confirmation on the Senate floor Wednesday. Warren chided Acosta for dodging her questions on issues like the silica rule, which would further limit the amount of cancer-causing dust that employers can expose construction workers to. Although that rule is projected to save 600 lives per year, the Trump administration has delayed enforcing it. Acosta made clear he would follow the administration' s orders on that.
“Mr. Acosta has had multiple opportunities in the more than two months since he was nominated for this position to demonstrate that he would stand up for workers,” Warren said. “Time after time, he has refused.”
Whatever concerns liberals have with Acosta, he is a vastly more palatable choice to them than Trump's original labor nominee, Andrew Puzder, the former chief executive of CKE Restaurants. Puzder led the Hardee's and Carl's Jr. burger chains and was a sharp critic of a $15 minimum wage and more generous overtime rules. His nomination collapsed in February amid a fierce campaign by Democrats and labor groups, leading Trump to the safer choice of Acosta.
Acosta is currently dean of the law school at Florida International University. He's been through the confirmation ringer before, having been a member of the National Labor Relations Board, which referees disputes between unions and employers. He also headed the Civil Rights Division at the Bush Justice Department, which led to perhaps the blackest mark on his government record. An inspector general report found that officials at the division had politicized hiring while Acosta led it.
“It happened on my watch,” he acknowledged during his hearing. “It should not have occurred.”
While many of Trump's Cabinet members are hostile to their agency's very missions, there's nothing in Acosta's past to suggest he wants to dismantle the department he will lead. That said, labor groups are not expecting him to be an ally. When he sat on the labor board, Acosta frequently sided with employers over unions, though former Democratic colleagues say he does have an independent streak.
The Labor Department took on a central role in the Obama administration, taking the lead on some of the White House's most consequential reforms, such as the overtime regulations that are now in limbo. That role will be greatly reduced in the Trump era, with a White House that wants to undo the administrative state.
The agency's core responsibilities, such as investigating minimum wage violations, fall on career civil servants and will continue as usual. But they may be given fewer resources, and there have already been signs that enforcement may be less aggressive under Trump. The Labor Department has all but stopped issuing press releases when employers are caught endangering workers, which was a major deterrent tactic during the Obama years.
It remains to be seen what Trump and Acosta will do regarding overtime. Obama tried to change the rules so that more salaried workers are guaranteed time-and-a-half pay when they work more than 40 hours in a week. His changes would have brought overtime protections to an estimated 4.2 million additional workers.

New video shows the moment Las Vegas performer Wayne Newton's 65-foot yacht SINKS after drainage problem
The National Park Service footage shows the luxury vessel quickly disappear underwater last fall
In February, investigators concluded that the sinking of a Lake Mead yacht owned by Mr Las Vegas was an accident
The October 18 sinking of the 65-foot vessel was traced to the failure of two hoses to drain water from a rear storage compartment
A dramatic video has emerged showing the moment Las Vegas entertainer Wayne Newton's 65-foot yacht sunk.
The National Park Service footage shows the luxury vessel quickly disappear underwater last fall. In February, investigators concluded that the sinking of the Lake Mead yacht owned by Mr Las Vegas was an accident.
The October 18 sinking of the 65-foot vessel was traced to the failure of two hoses to drain water from a rear storage compartment, National Park Service spokeswoman Christie Vanover said.

Going: A dramatic video has emerged showing the moment Las Vegas entertainer Wayne Newton's 65-foot yacht, pictured, sunk
One hose was disabled by a kink, and the other wasn't properly connected, she said.
The new footage was obtained by the Las Vegas Review-Journal through Freedom of Information Act request.
No one was on the boat and no one was injured when the 1996 Skipperliner, named Rendezvous, became swamped and sank stern-first in 49 feet of water in a slip at the Temple Bar marina on the Arizona side of the Colorado River reservoir.
The vessel and items in it were a complete loss, the park service report said.

McCrone had said that Newton and his wife, Kathleen McCrone, were vacationing out of the country when the boat sank.
The vessel was one of the largest on the vast reservoir behind Hoover Dam. A photo provided by the Park Service at the time showed the boat's bow sticking straight up from the water.
The loss of Newton's yacht came several weeks after the 71-year-old 'Danke Schoen' crooner lost a three-year ownership battle for his 40-acre 'Casa de Shenandoah' estate. Newton had lived at the spread several miles southeast of the Las Vegas Strip since 1968.
Newton had creditors at the door when he sold the property in 2010 for $19.5 million to CSD LLC, headed by investors Lacy and Dorothy Harber.
Newton, his family and their menagerie of exotic animals moved in June to a downsized nearby property with several homes on about 20 acres.
His former estate was put up for sale in September for $70 million.

Newton's sister-in-law, Tricia McCrone, confirmed at the time that the 1996 Skipperliner named Rendezvous belonged to Newton. She said Newton and his wife Kathleen were vacationing out of the country when the boat sank.
According to the Las Vegas Sun , some kind of equipment failure caused the yacht to take on water and sink within minutes.
Lake Havasu City Vessel Assist salvaged the boat later.

Wayne Newton is one of the best-known entertainers in Las Vegas and is known variously as Mr Las Vegas, The Midnight Idol and Mr Entertainment.
Some television viewers in southern California were startled on Thursday when an apocalyptic emergency alert flashed on their screens.
The Orange County Register reports a Lake Forest woman says she was watching HGTV on her Cox Communications cable service on Thursday when the alert flashed across the screen
Video shows the message included the voice of a man warning that "in the last days extremely violent time will come.''
The newspaper says Spectrum cable customers also got the message.
Laflamme said she was alarmed.
“It almost sounded like Hitler talking,” she said. “It sounded like a radio broadcast coming through the television.”
A Cox spokesman tells the newspaper that viewers should have seen a typical emergency-broadcast test but a technical malfunction caused it to go on longer than it should have. He says the broadcast picked up an audio feed that bled into the alert.
The cable companies say they're investigating.
According to the OC Register, it's not clear if the audio in the alert is related to a prophecy made by David Meade, a self-described “specialist in research and investigations” who believes catastrophic events will occur Saturday. Top News Photos: R. Kelly Leaves Jail After Paying Bond

Sometimes you can tell quite a bit about a book from its cover. On the outside, Michael Horton's Ordinary: Sustainable Faith in a Radical, Restless World (Zondervan) looks a lot like David Platt's bestseller Radical, and that's no accident. Horton, editor of Modern Reformation magazine, a founding figure behind the White Horse Inn's teaching ministry, and host of its radio show, aims to provide an alternative to trendy calls for radical living. He thinks such calls serve mainly to make ordinary Christians anxious about whether they're really Christian enough, and pastors anxious about ensuring that their ministries are radically transformative.
Horton comes to their aid with a Reformational perspective that diagnoses such anxieties as the outgrowth of works righteousness. If we are justified by faith in Christ alone, then we need not be anxious to show how Spirit-filled we are by living extraordinary, radical lives. Having already received the promise of the Spirit in baptism—God's promise, which we can trust he will keep—we are free to serve our neighbors with ordinary good works. We are freed from establishing our credentials before God or our own consciences. And we are even free, Horton states, to enjoy our neighbors as gifts rather than making them into our own projects, as if it was our job to transform their lives.
Horton argues that the underlying theology behind oft-heard calls to be wild and crazy radical believers—as if Christianity were an extreme sport—is works righteousness in a new, consumerist mode. For some time, radical has been a favorite word of advertisers and ideologues alike. Every website with something to sell now routinely promises ...

Council's executive committee voted Wednesday to force city bureaucrats and the next batch of councillors to figure out how to respond to a contentious request for a privately funded memorial, on public property, to the 1915 Ottoman genocide of the Armenian minority. Deputy Mayor Norm Kelly, a former history teacher, wanted the memorial approved. But the request faced strong and emotional opposition from members of the local Turkish community, who, like the government of Turkey, reject the scholarly consensus that a genocide indeed occurred. Turkish-Canadian residents packed the committee room. They told the councillors that no court has delivered a verdict of genocide, that Armenians also committed human rights abuses, and that a memorial would foster acrimony and lead to Turkish children being bullied in city schools. The committee then voted 8-1 in favour of a proposal from Councillor Giorgio Mammoliti to ask city officials to report back in 2015 — after the election — after seeking input from the two communities and the provincial and federal governments. Councillor Shelley Carroll, who sought approval for the donated memorial on behalf of the local Armenian community, said the community wanted to commemorate the 100-year anniversary of the beginning of the genocide in April 2015. She said the deferral means the memorial will now be approved “on the 12th of never.”

Mayor Rob Ford skipped most of the debate and did not speak on the issue. Some of the comments made by other members of the committee: Councillor Peter Leon: “We've come a long way since this unfortunate mishap occurred in that historical time. And we've come a long way with other unfortunate issues that happened after that. Toronto is truly unique because we get along with each other.” Councillor Anthony Perruzza: “When we first immigrated here — I come from central Italy. You will know that in Italy, there's a lot of animosity, and a lot of history, between the north and the south, between different clans, in the different regions of the country. But you know, when we came here — we were living on a street called St. Lucie — and along that street there were a lot of Italians. There were Italians from northern Italy, Italians from southern Italy, and all of those other different factions, and I've got to tell you, when it was wine-making time, they collaborated. They collaborated . . . to make sausages and soppressata, some prosciutto and so on, and vice-versa. So what we brought here to this country, yes is our diversity — but not our intolerance. What we left in check at the door was our animosity towards each other.”
Councillor Giorgio Mammoliti: “I've never favoured giving any of our parks to any organizations, be it for a dollar, be it for any donation — you'll recall the nudist beach issue, where I was infamous for taking off my shirt. There was a reason for it — I didn't want to give it to the nudists for a dollar a year. And until I took off my shirt, it wasn't as controversial as this issue.” “I'm sorry I don't know international law. But I'm a councillor, for crying out loud, who makes $105,000 a year … so I apologize that I don't know, Mr. Chairman, I apologize for that; I apologize if I've upset anybody. But I was elected to cut grass, fill potholes, make sure our curbs are in place, and to make sure my constituents are happy with the municipal level of government.” Councillor Frank Di Giorgio: “Trying to put it in context for myself, I think when one speaks of the Holocaust, I don't think there seems to be, historically, any disagreement, or at least any points of debate, as to whether an issue, the Holocaust actually occurred and in the numbers it did occur. The analogy that comes forward for me, with respect to the Armenian situation, is, and I don't want to bring this up again, is the situation of apartheid that we dealt with …you know, ‘is this really apartheid' and all this kind of things, where there seemed to be some conflicting views as to whether something actually exists currently … so the debate I'm looking at today is in that vein and not so much a comparison to the Holocaust, for me.” (Di Giorgio clarified in a post-meeting interview that he was referring not to South African Apartheid, about which there is no dispute, but to the debate about the phrase “Israeli apartheid,” which has been considered by council in the context of the Pride parade.)
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union states agreed on Thursday to scrap sanctions against Cuba in a move aimed at encouraging democratic reforms on the Communist island, officials said.

The lifting, agreed despite U.S. calls for the world to remain tough on Havana, will pave the way for a new dialogue with Cuba but come with calls that it address human rights concerns and free political prisoners.
Relations would be reviewed in one year, they said.
“Cuban sanctions will be lifted,” EU External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner told reporters after foreign ministers of the 27-nation bloc clinched agreement at a summit dinner in Brussels.
“Of course there is clear language on human rights, on the detention of prisoners and there will have to be a review also,” she said of the EU policy arrangements accompanying the move.
The EU measures, which triggered a so-called “cocktail war” over invitations of dissidents and government officials to European embassy receptions, were imposed after a crackdown on dissent in 2003 and include a freeze on high-level visits.
The sanctions were suspended in 2005 but their abolition is an attempt to encourage more reforms by President Raul Castro, who took over after the February 24 retirement of his brother Fidel.
There are about 230 political prisoners in Cuba, according to the illegal but tolerated Cuban Commission for Human Rights.
Unlike the 1962 U.S. embargo, the EU sanctions do not prevent trade and investment. Lifting them will put the EU at odds with Washington's advocacy of a hard line against Cuba.
“We certainly don't see any kind of fundamental break with the Castro dictatorship that would give us reason to believe that now would be the time to lift sanctions,” U.S. State Department spokesman Tom Casey said on Thursday.
“We would not be supportive of the EU or anyone else eases those restrictions at this time.”
SPAIN LED
Spain had led the push to drop the sanctions and open a dialogue with Cuba but met resistance from the bloc's ex-communist members, led by the Czech Republic.
“Countries that had less inclination to lift the measures have asked that, within one year ... the results of political dialogue on human rights be re-evaluated,” Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos said.
“What is not going to be re-evaluated is imposing the measures because they have been lifted definitively.”
Of the disparity with U.S. policy he said: “The United States has its policy on Cuba. We don't share it ... In the end, we have our interests and our autonomy in foreign policy.”
Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt said there would be strict conditions for the move.
“We haven't softened our approach,” Bildt said. The EU would ask Cuba to improve its human rights record, release political prisoners and high-level EU visitors would also meet opposition figures when appropriate, he said.
Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg stressed: “There are still people in prisons and their situation is terrible.”
A draft of the agreement seen by Reuters urged Cuba to improve human rights, including by releasing unconditionally political prisoners, ratifying U.N. rights conventions and giving humanitarian organizations access to Cuban jails.
PORTLAND, Oregon -- It's hard to get that NFL fix during the summer.
And yet, you try anyway. You waste your days mindlessly refreshing your team's page for OTA interviews, keeping track of pointless power rankings, and reading manufactured storylines that tell you more about the weaknesses of a 24-hour news cycle than the strength of your team.
If that all rings horribly true, stop what you're doing, find the Arena Football League team closest to you, and bring your kids to a game. We witnessed a Portland Thunder game at the Moda Center on Friday, and it changed our outlook on the summer football drought forever.
Certainly, the AFL TV ratings have waxed and waned since its inception in 1987. The league has churned out a few legends (Kurt Warner, anyone?), but its bankruptcy in 2009 forced it into a hard reset, its shrinking paychecks for players led to a near absence of star power, and its weird rules still take some getting used to.
But who cares? Don't watch it on TV -- the live experience is a game-changer. From the pregame show to the afterparty, the AFL smacks you in the face with high-octane entertainment, bone-crushing football (there are walls on the field, people), tons of souvenirs and even a post-game meet-and-greet with the players, all for as low as $15 a ticket. Physical attendance is up, CNBC reports, and for good reason.
The fan experience at an AFL game is better than a regular-season NFL game, hands down. Here's proof:
The Pregame Show Will Get You Super Pumped
Just look at the show before the Portland Thunder game on Friday:
Motorcycles! Flames! Motivational speeches! And the players haven't even taken the field yet. This is objectively better than, say, the clogging group that demoralized the Carolina Panthers audience last year.
You'll See Touchdowns. So Many Touchdowns.
The field is 50 yards long, any ball that bounces off nets adjacent to the field goal posts is live, and there are walls instead of sidelines. The chaos created by the small window of play lends itself to a highlight reel of awkward bounces, crippling hits and Hail Mary passes. On Friday, the Thunder lost at home to the Arizona Rattlers, 69-42, and it isn't uncommon for the combined score to reach more than 100 points in a game. That's everything you want from your wallet-busting NFL experience, right?
You can expect a touchdown on almost every play. The Rattlers, for instance, pulled off a touchdown on several kick returns:
The Weird Rules Are All About High Scoring And Fumbles
The AFL is in the business of high-scoring football, and that's important if you're looking for a summer exhibition to get over those NFL withdrawals. Here's a refresher on some of the AFL's weird rules, compiled by Men's Fitness:
Field: 85 feet wide, 50 yards long, for a faster, higher-scoring affair.
85 feet wide, 50 yards long, for a faster, higher-scoring affair. Goal posts: Nine feet wide with a 15-foot high crossbar.
Nine feet wide with a 15-foot high crossbar. Rebound nets: Kickoffs and passing plays that bounce off the nets are still in play.
Kickoffs and passing plays that bounce off the nets are still in play. Passing: Just like in NCAA, receivers only need one foot inbounds.
Just like in NCAA, receivers only need one foot inbounds. Punting: Not allowed. You gotta man-up and go for it on fourth down.
The rebound nets add a kick to an already fast-paced game, and a receiver's ability to get a 10-yard running start before a play is just hilarious:
The Fans Are Still Crazy
Portland Thunder is the AFL's youngest franchise -- though the Portland Forest Dragons were the city's first AFL team and had a tumultuous three seasons starting in 1997 -- and went to the playoffs in their inaugural season. The roster turnaround is high, but fans don't care.
They just want to watch some damn football in the summer.
"I'll follow any team that comes to Portland as long as it's not futbol -- soccer sucks," Portland native Tim Gover, 28, told The Huffington Post on Friday. "You got cheerleaders, you got football, you got a high score and cheap tickets. It's football when you got no football going on."
Fans get really into the game, and fly around the stadium as much as the players. Every ball that flies into the stands (and almost every errant pass and PAT does) is the property of the man or woman who catches it. After the game, players stick around to meet the fans and sign autographs.
You Can Actually Afford To Bring All Your Friends
Portland Thunder tickets range from $15 to $200 for field-side seats, and season tickets start at $99 a package. Everything above the 200 level was closed off for Friday night's game at the Moda Center, so there's no such thing as a "nosebleed" ticket. You can't beat that for entertainment, let alone for a football competition. We'll still reluctantly fork over a few hundred bucks for NFL tickets, but this is a chance to bring the whole crew.
It's Summer Football
Do we have to say it again? Football in the summer. Games go until August, right about the time you'll start your NFL preseason buzz.
We're not saying you should watch the AFL religiously on TV. But if you need football in the offseason, or a solid exhibition packed with entertainment for your family or friends, head to a game.
On a day of municipal elections and legal alcohol consumption at Cinco De Mayo events, local marijuana reform advocates marched to the Lubbock County Courthouse.
Members of Hub City NORML marched from 18th Street and Avenue Q to the courthouse, where they gathered to take a picture with an alternative Texas flag - a marijuana leaf replacing the star.
Lubbock's first Global Marijuana March - an annual rally where numerous cities host events - drew about 15 people, including local Libertarian activist Kerry McKennon.
NORML is an organization whose mission is to move public opinion "to legalize the responsible use of marijuana by adults," according to NORML's website.
The group wanted to raise awareness Saturday and call attention to marijuana reform, said Jake Syma, communications officer for the group.
They welcome any kind of reform such as decriminalization, legalization or allowing the medicinal use of marijuana, he said.
"Any step is a good step," said Yvette Nichols, who coordinates events with NORML.
Cities don't have to wait for national or state reform, Syma said.
Lubbock should look to Harris County as a model, said Larry Walden, executive director.
In Harris County, home of Houston, first-time offenders busted on a small possession charge are offered to be placed in a pretrial intervention program, where they can do community service, but will not have a criminal record after the program, he said.
Texas stands to make economic gains from legalization, said Syma. Colorado's legalization added to that state's economy, and Texas is much larger than Colorado, he said.
Colorado raked in $700 million in 2014, according to Christopher Ingraham in the Washington Post.
All three spokespersons for NRML agreed incarceration isn't a good solution to marijuana usage, although they varied slightly on the role of rehabilitation.
"It's a health concern, not a judicial concern," Walden said.
It can be more expensive to use a rehabilitation center than house someone in jail, at least for the short term, said Nichols. But, he said, a jail record can cause harm in a person's future employability.
Not all rehab facilities are up to date, said Walden, as he's seen 1980s literature and films being used in centers.
Hub City NORML meets about once a month at Schlotzky's, said Nichols. The group is also active in community service, helping to feed people at Tent City and the Salvation Army Soup Kitchen.

Written and directed by Paul Bettany, Shelter tells the story of Hannah (Jennifer Connelly) and Tahir (Anthony Mackie), individuals who come from two different worlds, but whose lives intersect because they're both homeless on the streets of New York. As the details of their past unfold, their journey of loss, love, hope and redemption makes them more than the nameless and faceless.
At the film's press day, first-time filmmaker Paul Bettany spoke to Collider for this exclusive interview about why this particular story was important for him to tell, what the editing process was like for him, screening the movie for fellow filmmakers and actors to get their feedback, how this ending came about, why Anthony Mackie was the right choice, and how much he'd love to direct again. He also talked about Captain America: Civil War, making an epic superhero extravaganza that also raising a really interesting social question, how Vision fits in, and what it was like to work with the Russos.
Collider: How did you go from observing and wondering about a homeless couple that you passed on the street to writing and directing this movie?
PAUL BETTANY: Well, I wanted to direct a movie. Ron Howard said to me, “Why haven't you directed a movie yet?” And I said, “I think it's because I'm waiting for the secret to be passed onto me.” He went, “What are you talking about?” And I said, “You know, the director's secret.” He said, “There is no secret, Paul. You've just got to make mistakes and get on with it.” So, I started to get on with it. I was thinking about what I'd want to make my first film about, and I'm really intrigued and worried about the nature of our judgmental culture that we live in, both on a micro and a macro level. In a world of increasing grey areas, we are becoming more and more entrenched in black and white positions. But, I didn't know how to do it. At the same time, Hurricane Sandy happened and this homeless couple who I used to see on the street right by our house disappeared. I'm ashamed to say they'd disappeared earlier. I'd stopped being able to see them. It was only in their actual physical absence that I was reminded of them again, and I couldn't stop thinking about them. I had the instinct to write about them and I thought they might make a really good template with which to discuss judgement. That's how it happened.
The film focuses on whom these people are, as human beings, as opposed to making a point to make a statement about homelessness.
BETTANY: I'm so glad you said that. I did not want to make a sweeping statement about how homelessness is bad or drug addiction is bad, or how people struggling with either situation are victims or criminals. I just wanted to get to know them better and to get to know that situation better. That's what I set out to do. These people have both done terrible things. It was really important that they'd both done terrible things that, on paper, are unforgivable, but then you spend time with people and talk to them. We passed two milestones in New York last year, with the first apartment to sell for $100 million and 60,000 of the residents sleeping in shelters every night. That's an extraordinary figure. And 24,000 of them are children, but we are all innocents, we're all worthy of forgiveness, and we're all fundamentally deserving of a home and a lack of judgment.
As a first-time director, how challenging did you find the editing process?
BETTANY: (Editor) John F. Lyons really let me find my film, which is really what you want, as a first-time director. Especially with the subject matter, I wanted it to be muscular and move at a pace. It is not a long film. I discovered some things in editing, when John and I were separated. When I finished the project, I had to go make a film, as an actor. It would be great to have that hiatus every time, but when it's your first time, you want to know if the thing cuts and you're anxious. So, I started cutting things and discovered ways, often through mistakes, to truncate time. We started off with a 15-minute sequence of [Jennifer Connelly] panhandling, which simply couldn't be. I cut it down to about two minutes, and yet made it feel like time had passed through slipping her dialogue out of sync. And then, I did that again in the dinner scene. And then, I did that again, right at the end of the movie when he's giving his final aria. It was a way to express time having gone by while keeping it taut.
You screened the film for other filmmakers and actors and got advice from them. How did you decide who you would screen it for?
BETTANY: After my actors, my next biggest resource was the people that I'd worked with or that I knew well, like Ron Howard, Darren Aronofsky, Johnny Depp and Robert Downey Jr. They watched early cuts of the movie, and gave me advice and their thoughts, and were incredibly generous with their time.
Was this ending the ending that you had always wanted to this story, or did that change?
BETTANY: (SPOILERS) There were different ways of arranging the ending, but it was always going to end with him dying. The reason was that it started off as an idea in my head about a ghost who has done terrible things wanting to go back to be with his family, and he meets a girl who thinks she's a ghost. If he can just get her back to her family, because she has something to live for, he can then go and be with his. That was the shape of the structure, which is a really classical structure. It was always going to end with his self-sacrifice.
Aside from the fact that you're both a part of the Marvel Universe, what was it about Anthony Mackie that made you see this character in him?
BETTANY: By the way, I worked with him first, as a director. We hadn't worked together as actors yet. I think he's a really fabulous actor who endlessly surprises. Part of the experiment was to create two, on paper, unforgivable people, and then make you love them. It's hard not to love Anthony Mackie. It really is.
This story is such a fascinating character journey that could have been nothing but sad and depressing to watch, and while it is a sad story, it's not just a sad story.
BETTANY: Yes, it could have, and I have no interest in those movies. I have no interest in movies that take you somewhere dark and leave you there, for no reason. It's dark, but so is Death of a Salesman. Does it stop it being a great play? There's not that many jokes in The Crucible. Not that I would ever liken myself to Arthur Miller. I don't quite understand this fashion, at the moment, for everybody going, “Dark is not really my cup of tea.” What are you talking about? Hamlet is dark. Macbeth is dark. And again, not to liken myself to those masters, but the notion that things have to be filled with light, I don't understand. However, I do think that it is a story that absolutely provides hope at the end of the movie. Whether or not I succeeded is for other people to say, but those are the only films that I'm interested in. I don't like movies that just say, “Look at this. Isn't it bad? Aren't you lucky you're not homeless?” It's really not about that. I have an interest in giving people a cathartic experience, and making them look at homeless people differently, and making them question how they judge people, in general. My father, who was a very religious man, would say, “There but for the grace of God go I,” when he passed a homeless person on the street. I love that sentiment. It is an admission of how precarious your position actually is and how it could so easily be you.
Now that you've survived the process of directing a film, is it something you'd like to jump back into again, as soon as you have the opportunity?
BETTANY: Oh, I'd love to direct again. I loved the experience of doing it. It was a new way of telling stories for me. I love telling stories, and this is a new way in which to do that. If I'm allowed to, I'd love to.
We keep hearing that the script for Captain America: Civil War is fantastic. I know you can't reveal details without the penalty of death, but what was your reaction when you read it?
BETTANY: It's going to be a lot of fun. I think it's really interesting, the way that a huge, epic superhero extravaganza is discussing a really interesting question, which is about people unilaterally going into other people's countries and their intervention there. It's actually an interesting thing to talk about in a massive forum like that.
Will Vision be playing into the changing team dynamic?
BETTANY: What I love about my character is that there are so many places for him to go. I think he's very interested in what it means to be human and what love is. The only way one can guarantee one's loyalty is love. Loyalty is beyond logic, really. Logic doesn't really provide for loyalty. If your logic changes suddenly and things not make sense, you can alter your allegiance, but love stops you from being able to do that.
How did the process of working with the Russos compare to Joss Whedon?
BETTANY: They both have a really different approach. I loved working with all three of them. The really great thing with a cast that big is that you have two directors. You can always get one of them to have a chat with about what's coming up next, and that's great. I'm really excited to see what they do with what we shot.
It's amazing how, when you think there's no way that these Marvel movie could get any bigger, they do, but they still manage to keep a sense of humanity to them that keeps you connected to the story and the characters.
BETTANY: Yeah. I think fans feel that they're in safe hands, and the reason they feel like they're in safe hands is because the films are being made by fans and they remember what it is about these stories that connected with them, in the first place. That's why they have heart.
After directing a film yourself, you must have even more appreciation for the directors who tackle such an enormous production.
BETTANY: I have no idea how those sorts of movies are made. I really don't. The puzzle pieces are huge, and then they become infinitesimal, as the shoot goes on. There are smaller and smaller and smaller pieces, and how do you know what you need? I have no idea.

Paul Baran, W3KAS -- an engineer who helped create the technical underpinnings for the ARPANET, the government-sponsored precursor to today's Internet -- died March 27 at his home in Palo Alto, California. He was 84. According to his son David, the cause of death was related to complications from lung cancer. Baran was one of the three inventors of packet-switched networks, along with Donald Davies and Leonard Kleinrock.
Baran attended the Drexel Institute of Technology (later known as Drexel University), where he earned a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering in 1949. He took his first job at the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation in Philadelphia, testing parts of radio tubes for an early commercial computer, the UNIVAC. In 1955, Baran moved to Los Angeles, where he took a job at Hughes Aircraft to work on radar data processing systems. He enrolled in night classes at the University of California, Los Angeles, where he received a master's degree in engineering in 1959.
In 1959, Baran left Hughes to join RAND's computer science department. He quickly developed an interest in the survivability of communications systems in the event of a nuclear attack. He spent the next several years at RAND under contract to the Air Force, working on a series of 13 papers -- two of them classified -- titled On Distributed Communications.
In the early 1960s, while working at RAND, Baran was working on a “survivable” communications system when he thought up one of its core concepts: Breaking up a single message into smaller pieces, having them travel different, unpredictable paths to their destination and only then putting them back together. It's called packet switching and it's how everything still gets to your e-mail inbox.
Baran's idea was to build a distributed communications network that was less vulnerable to attacks or disruptions than conventional networks. In a series of technical papers published in the 1960s, he suggested that networks be designed with redundant routes, so that if a particular path failed or was destroyed, messages could still be delivered through another. The system would be better able to withstand an attack because it lacked a central hub through which all data or messages passed.
In 1968, the technology was adopted by MIT and the DARPA -- the Department of Defense's research agency -- to create what became the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network, or ARPANET, the world's first operational packet switching network and a forerunner to today's Internet; packet switching still lies at the heart of the network's internal workings. In 1983, following the success of ARPANET trials, the military section of the network was split off into a separate entity known as MILNET, while the remaining ARPANET was eventually renamed the Internet in 1989.
In 1990, Baran was awarded the IEEE's Alexander Graham Bell Medal. This award honors exceptional contributions to the advancement of communications sciences and engineering in the field of telecommunications. It is the highest honor awarded by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers for achievements in telecommunication sciences and engineering.
In 2002, Baran was inducted into the CQ Hall of Fame for inventing packet switching, and for the development of the first telemetry equipment for NASA.
In 2007, Baran was recognized for his achievements by President George W. Bush, who presented Baran with the National Medal of Technology (now known as the National Medal of Technology and Innovation) “[f]or the invention and development of the fundamental architecture for packet switched communication networks which provided a paradigm shift from the circuit switched communication networks of the past and later was used to build the ARPANET and the Internet.” This medal is awarded to American inventors and innovators who have made significant contributions to the development of new and important technology. It is the highest honor the United States can confer to a US citizen for achievements related to technological progress.
“Our world is a better place for the technologies Paul Baran invented and developed, and also because of his consistent concern with appropriate public policies for their use,” said James Thomson, President and Chief Executive of RAND. -- Thanks to the New York Times and Wired Magazine for the information

A math education professor at the University of Illinois argued in a newly published book that algebraic and geometry skills perpetuate “unearned privilege” among whites.
Rochelle Gutierrez, a professor at the University of Illinois, made the claim in a new anthology for math teachers, arguing that teachers must be aware of the “politics that mathematics brings” in society.
“Are we really that smart just because we do mathematics?”
[RELATED: EdX no longer 'teaching social justice through mathematics']
“On many levels, mathematics itself operates as Whiteness. Who gets credit for doing and developing mathematics, who is capable in mathematics, and who is seen as part of the mathematical community is generally viewed as White,” Gutierrez argued.
Gutierrez also worries that algebra and geometry perpetuate privilege, fretting that “curricula emphasizing terms like Pythagorean theorem and pi perpetuate a perception that mathematics was largely developed by Greeks and other Europeans."
Math also helps actively perpetuate white privilege too, since the way our economy places a premium on math skills gives math a form of “unearned privilege” for math professors, who are disproportionately white.
“Are we really that smart just because we do mathematics?” she asks, further wondering why math professors get more research grants than “social studies or English” professors.
[RELATED: Prof complains about 'masculinization of mathematics']
Further, she also worries that evaluations of math skills can perpetuate discrimination against minorities, especially if they do worse than their white counterparts.
“If one is not viewed as mathematical, there will always be a sense of inferiority that can be summoned,” she says, adding that there are so many minorities who “have experienced microaggressions from participating in math classrooms… [where people are] judged by whether they can reason abstractly.”
To fight this, Gutierrez encourages aspiring math teachers to develop a sense of “political conocimiento,” a Spanish phrase for “political knowledge for teaching.”
Gutierrez stresses that all knowledge is “relational,” asserting that “Things cannot be known objectively; they must be known subjectively."
Campus Reform reached out to Gutierrez for comment, but did not receive a response in time for publication.

Bryan Singer decided to slop around in the rumor muck for awhile during an interview with SciFiWire .Singer, who directed the first two(and only good)films but left in order to direct, has made his return to the mighty mutants as producer of X-Men: First Class. At one time he was up to direct the film, but his schedule was simply too heavy and there was no way he could get out of his previous obligations.Those same issues turned up again as Singer was asked about the prospects of him directing the sequel to X-Men Origins: Wolverine...Singer:"It's not what I'm going to do right now. The next project for me next year, in London, is Jack the Giant Killer. That is set in the 1300s, and it's very fun. It will be a big movie."It also looks like it was true that Fox made a play to get Taylor Lautner on the team as well, but as you can imagine the teeny bopper heartthrob has a lot on his plate right now...Singer: I wanted Taylor [Lautner] to do it, I really did," Singer said in an exclusive interview. "He's doing a movie in Pittsburgh called Abduction, and then he's got the next Twilight movie. We talked about it a lot—he is a friend—and I really wanted to make it work. It just doesn't look like it's possible to do it."Singer also makes a passing reference to Meagan Good( Waist Deep ) as a possibility for a role as well. Since there are maybe...3 African-American female mutants running around the Marvel Universe I'm going to assume she's a young Storm.
It was reported today that Steve Borowiec, a homosexual reporter for the LA Times, has been forced to withdraw a tweet in which he expressed the hope “to see Donald Trump's life end”. Early on in this Presidential campaign we wrote that if it looked likely that Trump would win the Presidency, he would be in great danger of assassination. Well, it looks (barring a last-minute MSM giant lie or outrageous ballot-rigging) like Trump is building a lead that will grant him and America's hard-working people a victory in the polls.
The reality is that Donald Trump's Nationalist program is counter-Revolutionary, and if implemented, will halt and reverse the Media Class/Far Left Revolution stealthily achieved over the last 20 or more years. A Trump Presidency will result in the overthrow of our Ruling Class and its Far Left allies. That makes this election and its result startlingly different from the past two Presidential elections when the Republican candidates were proven ‘moderates' (i.e. certain collaborators).
Trump's initial ill-defined Nationalism in the primaries was sufficient to arouse intense antipathy in many quarters, even though he was not taken seriously as a Presidential candidate. But, as we predicted then, the subsequent Presidential campaign and the viciousness and desperate dishonesty of the Media Class attacks on him and his followers, has given him a political education.
Trump is now both a skilled and coherent campaigner, and a radicalized Nationalist. He has grown and grown with each attack upon him, and his determination, resilience and energy have been matched by an awareness of who are the internal enemies of the American people.
The Media Class has revealed its identity and power through the Mainstream Media's seamless propaganda onslaught. Big Business, by funding the Clinton campaign, has revealed its self-interested internationalist political anti-American agenda that ties it to this Far Left Obama government. The Government machinery has abandoned its pretense of political neutrality. The elite of the Republican Party and Conservative movement has disclosed its fear and contempt of its grass-roots, and acted out its eagerness to collaborate with the new Ruling Class. Finally, thanks to WikiLeaks, Washington has proven to be the stinking swamp that Trump denounced from the start.
Trump is now a seasoned warrior with a clear understanding of what needs to be done to make America great again, and he has ignited a mass movement. If he enters the White House in January, it will not be as a shallow showman, but as a swamp-drainer and retributive sheriff with a posse of patriots. For many enemies, crooks and traitors, the game will be up.
The Far Left has always been ready to use violence to win and retain power. Few emerging Ruling Classes give up power peacefully. The Media Class has created a climate of intolerance, defined its enemies, and strained to demonize Trump and his American followers. Mexican cartels, Muslim fanatics, sick perverts, Black street thugs and Far Left misfits will all sense a Ruling Class permission to violently prevent Trump from taking office.
We must hope that Trump is heavily protected, not only in these last few days of the campaign, but, if he wins, in the period before taking office.

Two hundred years ago, before the advent of capitalism, a man's social status was fixed from the beginning to the end of his life; he inherited it from his ancestors, and it never changed. If he was born poor, he always remained poor, and if he was born rich-a lord or a duke-he kept his dukedom and the property that went with it for the rest of his life.
As for manufacturing, the primitive processing industries of those days existed almost exclusively for the benefit of the wealthy. Most of the people (ninety percent or more of the European population) worked the land and did not come in contact with the city-oriented processing industries. This rigid system of feudal society prevailed in the most developed areas of Europe for many hundreds of years.
However, as the rural population expanded, there developed a surplus of people on the land. For this surplus of population without inherited land or estates, there was not enough to do, nor was it possible for them to work in the processing industries; the kings of the cities denied them access. The numbers of these "outcasts" continued to grow, and still no one knew what to do with them. They were, in the full sense of the word, "proletarians," outcasts whom the government could only put into the workhouse or the poorhouse. In some sections of Europe, especially in the Netherlands and in England, they became so numerous that, by the eighteenth century, they were a real menace to the preservation of the prevailing social system.
Today, in discussing similar conditions in places like India or other developing countries, we must not forget that, in eighteenth-century England, conditions were much worse. At that time, England had a population of six or seven million people, but of those six or seven million people, more than one million, probably two million, were simply poor outcasts for whom the existing social system made no provision. What to do with these outcasts was one of the great problems of eighteenth-century England.
Another great problem was the lack of raw materials. The British, very seriously, had to ask themselves this question: what are we going to do in the future, when our forests will no longer give us the wood we need for our industries and for heating our houses? For the ruling classes it was a desperate situation. The statesmen did not know what to do, and the ruling gentry were absolutely without any ideas on how to improve conditions.
Out of this serious social situation emerged the beginnings of modern capitalism. There were some persons among those outcasts, among those poor people, who tried to organize others to set up small shops which could produce something. This was an innovation. These innovators did not produce expensive goods suitable only for the upper classes; they produced cheaper products for everyone's needs. And this was the origin of capitalism as it operates today. It was the beginning of mass production, the fundamental principle of capitalistic industry. Whereas the old processing industries serving the rich people in the cities had existed almost exclusively for the demands of the upper classes, the new capitalist industries began to produce things that could be purchased by the general population. It was mass production to satisfy the needs of the masses.
This is the fundamental principle of capitalism as it exists today in all of those countries in which there is a highly developed system of mass production: Big business, the target of the most fanatic attacks by the so-called leftists, produces almost exclusively to satisfy the wants of the masses. Enterprises producing luxury goods solely for the well-to-do can never attain the magnitude of big businesses. And today, it is the people who work in large factories who are the main consumers of the products made in those factories. This is the fundamental difference between the capitalistic principles of production and the feudalistic principles of the preceding ages.
The development of capitalism consists in everyone's having the right to serve the customer better and/or more cheaply. And this method, this principle, has, within a comparatively short time, transformed the whole world. It has made possible an unprecedented increase in world population.
In eighteenth-century England, the land could support only six million people at a very low standard of living. Today more than fifty million people enjoy a much higher standard of living than even the rich enjoyed during the eighteenth-century. And today's standard of living in England would probably be still higher, had not a great deal of the energy of the British been wasted in what were, from various points of view, avoidable political and military "adventures."
These are the facts about capitalism. Thus, if an Englishman-or, for that matter, any other man in any country of the world-says today to his friends that he is opposed to capitalism, there is a wonderful way to answer him: "You know that the population of this planet is now ten times greater than it was in the ages preceding capitalism; you know that all men today enjoy a higher standard of living than your ancestors did before the age of capitalism. But how do you know that you are the one out of ten who would have lived in the absence of capitalism? The mere fact that you are living today is proof that capitalism has succeeded, whether or not you consider your own life very valuable."
In spite of all its benefits, capitalism has been furiously attacked and criticized. It is necessary that we understand the origin of this antipathy. It is a fact that the hatred of capitalism originated not with the masses, not among the workers themselves, but among the landed aristocracy-the gentry, the nobility, of England and the European continent. They blamed capitalism for something that was not very pleasant for them: at the beginning of the nineteenth century, the higher wages paid by industry to its workers forced the landed gentry to pay equally higher wages to their agricultural workers. The aristocracy attacked the industries by criticising the standard of living of the masses of the workers.
Of course-from our viewpoint, the workers' standard of living was extremely low; conditions under early capitalism were absolutely shocking, but not because the newly developed capitalistic industries had harmed the workers. The people hired to work in factories had already been existing at a virtually subhuman level.
The famous old story, repeated hundreds of times, that the factories employed women and children and that these women and children, before they were working in factories, had lived under satisfactory conditions, is one of the greatest falsehoods of history. The mothers who worked in the factories had nothing to cook with; they did not leave their homes and their kitchens to go into the factories, they went into factories because they had no kitchens, and if they had a kitchen they had no food to cook in those kitchens. And the children did not come from comfortable nurseries. They were starving and dying. And all the talk about the so-called unspeakable horror of early capitalism can be refuted by a single statistic: precisely in these years in which British capitalism developed, precisely in the age called the Industrial Revolution in England, in the years from 1760 to 1830, precisely in those years the population of England doubled, which means that hundreds or thousands of children-who would have died in preceding times-survived and grew to become men and women.
There is no doubt that the conditions of the preceding times were very unsatisfactory. It was capitalist business that improved them. It was precisely those early factories that provided for the needs of their workers, either directly or indirectly by exporting products and importing food and raw materials from other countries. Again and again, the early historians of capitalism have-one can hardly use a milder word-falsified history.
PIXMA PRO-100 Wireless Professional Inkjet Photo Printer is rated 4.6 out of 5 by 1950 .
Rated 5 out of 5 by Ratledge from Without question the best entry for true professio Canon makes a wide variety of printers, in size, style and capabilities. The Pixm a Pro 100 is the perfect place to start your quest for top end professional printing! You simply can't go wrong with the optimal multiple know which by using multiple greys,black and CMY plus (two levels of each) gives you the absolute optimal combination of inks for precision perfection in high-end super pro printing. As many things that have already been written here, I only need to add that I started here, and unless you are truly beyond "simply" professional -I was done, and you should be,too!I Without question the best investment you can make.
Rated 5 out of 5 by jcleare from I love this printer I have used this printer for the past 3 years. Its an awesome printer. I have every level of canon printer photo paper for this printer. Pro Platinum is my favorite. Ive gone through 5 sets of ink cartridge. Never had a misprint or paper jam. I use this printer to make prints from my 5diii and 5div. Prints are always exceptional. After the first set of ink cartridges i have mastered printing on this printer. I have ordered prints from ALL the major online companies. My home prints are equal or slightly better. There is a learning curve for any printer. I really enjoy printing for my personal use.
Rated 5 out of 5 by Chip from Unsurpassed Quality After 3 weeks of use my PIXMA PRO-100 is without a doubt the highest quality photo printer I have ever used. Because of the significant improvement in picture quality I have found myself re-printing several of my photos. The photo that validated my assessment was an 8 x 10 fall landscape scene done in sepia. The PIXMA PRO-100 provided a much better array of brown tones that was clearly observable. When comparing the PIXMA PRO-100 with other photo printers it is more costly - but you certainly get a much improved document and worth every dollar spent. The proof is in the output !!
Rated 5 out of 5 by Gregory from Excellent Value Printer I have not used my own color printer for about 10 years, but the B&H price and rebate offer for the PRO-100 was too good to pass up. Once I figured out how to use Canon Print Pro Studio as a plug-in to Lightroom, I started to obtain prints that fairly match what I see on my display. Thus far I have printed about 10 8.5x11 prints, and it appears that the ink levels are holding up fairly well. As others have commented, this is a BIG printer. I was able to set it up in my basement and connect it to my home network via a wireless connection. Until I set up a 2.4 GHz network, it was not recognized by my dual band router. But all is now well!
Rated 4 out of 5 by Robert from The Good, The Bad, The Cost This is my second Canon Pixma Pro-100? and I really didn't need it as I am still using my first one after several years.? For its print quality and large print size it a very good printer when compared with other printers in its price and print size.? I will put it in storage for backup.? The real reason I purchased this printer is the egregious cost of ink cartridges, as it is with all printers in this category.? It was time for me to order another ink set which is about $130.00.? When I saw this printer on sale (with a full set of ink) with a rebate? and free paper with a final cost to me of $150.00, the printer was free.? Not a bad deal.
Rated 5 out of 5 by Claude from Excellent Printer I have had nothing but beautiful prints from this machine. There can be no argument ... it does use a lot of ink ($$) but my clients love the results. Note: I bought this machine to replace another PIXMA PRO-100 that I purchased 4 years ago. After 4 years of service, and almost NO maintenance, it started to produce black streaks on the prints. While waiting for this one to arrive, I tried professional cleaning on the old one ... nothing to lose since the new one was on the way. The professional cleaning, which I now know how to do, fixed the problem. The old PIXMA Pro-100 is back to producing outstanding prints. And I have a spare.
Rated 3 out of 5 by Ron from Software is the pit's I've had the Pro-100 for two months. The Printer does a good job of printing on various mediums. The Software that comes with it is pathetic. You cannot size an art print on a piece of medium with the software that comes with this machine. If you want to print an 11 x17 or a 12 x 16 on a 13 x 19 piece of photo paper , there is no way to do this !! It will print in some oddball size that you cannot buy a frame for. All my old printers at least came with software that allowed you to select the actual size of the print on the page. Does nobody at Canon try this stuff ??? There is a reference to buying photo shop to do this along with the monthly charge for the program.
When the child identified in court papers only as "M.C." was 16 months old and a ward of the state, doctors and health officials in South Carolina decided that he would become a girl. Born intersex (a term that encompasses individuals with some variation of both male and female sexual and reproductive anatomy), M.C. had "ambiguous genitals" and "both male and female reproductive organs," according to Reuters.
Doctors removed M.C.'s male reproductive organs and eliminated any potential he had "to procreate as a male," said court filings.
But that surgery did not so neatly turn M.C. into a girl. Now age 8, he identifies as a boy.
A lawsuit filed earlier this month by M.C.'s adoptive parents contends that medical professionals sworn to protect the child failed him catastrophically.
Represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center and Advocates for Informed Choice, they argue that doctors convinced the child's state-appointed guardians to go through with surgery without fully disclosing the procedure's enormous risks, which include sterilization and diminished sexual sensation.
The lawsuit also alleges that the state of South Carolina in turn violated M.C.'s constitutional rights by failing to hold a court hearing to determine whether surgery was in the child's best interest. The plaintiffs go on to argue that beyond questions of procedural due process, the government does not have any legitimate, defensible claim to the kind of life-altering power that South Carolina exercised over M.C.
That last bit is most crucial when evaluating the case's implications, because to see this simply as an instance of medical malfeasance and negligence is to miss the larger cultural point. Doctors didn't just treat a condition or a disease incorrectly or too hastily. They didn't treat a medical disease at all. The procedure was done without any medical justification whatsoever, as is historically the case with most intersex infants who undergo such operations.
Instead, they treated a social illness, for which the remedy is making bodies deemed "abnormal" conform to society's strict sex and gender guidelines, and in the process they mutilated a child in their care.
M.C. will spend the rest of his life paying for his caretakers' actions. Should he choose reparative surgery, he'll face multiple expensive operations that might be categorized as elective procedures by an insurance carrier determined not to cover them. He also faces psychological peril. As sociologist Sharon Preves writes in an essay titled "Intersex Narratives: Gender, Medicine, and Identity," "intersexuals who [unknowingly] underwent medical sex assignment in childhood experienced consistently negative and confusing messages about their bodies and their identities."
However, putting aside for a moment the instinct to mourn the fact that M.C. is a boy without a penis, we should recognize that M.C. was violated and victimized long before his identity as a boy emerged. The tragedy is not only physical and psychic; his disfigurement symbolizes his denied right to control his own body and identity. Even if M.C. had grown up to identify as a girl, identify with her surgically altered genitalia and live out her days as a female-bodied woman, the surgery would have been just as problematic and alarming.
To think otherwise is to consent to systemic forces that force us into boxes of pink and blue. These are the same forces that justify reparative therapy or gay "cures," limit women's reproductive rights and so dehumanize intersex bodies that, like M.C., they essentially become science experiments.
After all, it's easier to alter or defile a vulnerable body like M.C.'s to enforce an entrenched social norm than it is to change that norm. For decades, doctors rationalized these surgeries by saying that they saved children from a lifetime of torment. Granted, medical consensus is now a bit vaguer. In 2006, around the time of M.C.'s surgery, the journal Pediatrics published a paper signed by 50 international experts that stated that no proof exists that infant cosmetic genital surgery improves the recipient's quality of life.
Obviously, we have a long way to go from that. And M.C.'s case only challenges the state's ability to take such medical action. It does not address the wide legal dominion that parents have over medical decisions for their children. Either way, the lawsuit will send a strong message. It's fair to assume that parents want what's best for their children, but too often, "best" is interpreted as forcing children (of any stripe) to fit social expectations.
Instead, we need to fight against the norms that rationalize violence against those who, like M.C., fail to fit within arbitrary boundaries of what's "normal," or who present a threat to those boundaries, more precisely. Make no mistake: M.C., with his heretical little body, was a threat. And as an infant unable to give consent and articulate what he wanted, he was, and is, a victim of institutionalized violence, not just bureaucratic error and negligence.
There's nothing Earth-shatteringly new about the current way society polices sex and gender, or about the fact that many find it unnerving when they can't read a human being's gender or, in the case of infants, aren't privy to his or her sex. (Perhaps the internalized debate goes something like, "Do I pick up this mushy body mass gently or really gently?")
For proof, one need only look at the hostile response over the last few years to parents who refused to reveal the sex of their children. They were ridiculed, ostracized, even accused of child abuse, simply because they didn't want to limit their kids to such arbitrary and strict gender distinctions.
Why such an outcry? Infants and, until a certain age, toddlers all look and act pretty much the same. The only things that notably differ are our own reactions to their blue or pink bows, their short or long hair or their skirts or pants.
An end to Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump's candidacy? It could be within reach. Could be.
Trump's closest rival, Texas Senator Ted Cruz, celebrated his victory in the Wisconsin primary on Tuesday night as a "turning point" in the race for the nomination.
For pundits, two other words came to mind: brokered convention. That's when no candidate has enough delegates to win during the first round of voting.
Here's why that matters.
Good news for the establishment
It's not a sure thing. But a scenario that would involve wheeling and dealing for an alternative nominee looks more probable than ever so far this year, reviving arguments that a "Dump Trump" option remains viable.

At the very least, the odds of Trump securing enough delegates to win a simple majority on the first ballot at the national convention in July have slimmed.
The Republican brass are hedging their bets on an open convention. If they get their way and neither Cruz nor Trump has a majority of delegates locked up before the end of primary season, "that's when that gambit gets dangerous," warns Steve Jarding, a public policy professor with Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.
A little on delegate math
There's a number that Republican candidates keep on referencing in their stump speeches: 1,237.
That's how many delegates any GOP candidate needs to nab 50 per cent, plus one, of the 2,472 delegates. In other words, a simple majority that would win the nomination outright.

Before the Wisconsin primary — in which Cruz added 36 delegates and Trump took six — Trump would have needed to win 61 per cent of all remaining delegates going forward. Even then, he was tracking to underperform in the West, according to political statisticians with the FiveThirtyEight blog.
With the Wisconsin loss behind him, the incline tilts steeper. Trump now needs to take 63 per cent of delegates in the states that have yet to vote in primaries or caucuses, according to updated number-crunching by the Washington Post.
How likely this scenario will play out
Delegate analysts agree that Cruz prevailing in Wisconsin has bumped the Republican Party closer to a contested convention. But they split on the degree to which that's likely.

Former Republican National Convention chief of staff Mike Shields told CNN it looks "very unlikely" that Trump will avoid such a scenario by meeting that 63-per-cent threshold.
Jarding is less certain.
"I don't think 63 per cent is out of the question," he says. "It's a little on the out range, a little at the high end, but the system is so prone to momentum."
If Trump racks up big delegate counts in the coming northeastern states, including his home state of New York on April 19, Jarding expects the momentum will swing back to Trump, quashing speculation of an open convention.
When a convention is 'brokered'
Both contested and brokered conventions qualify as "open" conventions, as both follow scenarios in which no candidate wins the nomination on the first ballot, forcing another round of voting.

What drives a brokered convention, Jarding notes, is mediation and deal-making, which historically occurred in "smoke-filled rooms."
"You literally would go in the backroom and you try and cut some deals. So, for example, Marco Rubio could cut a deal and say: 'Put me on the ticket, and I'll swing my delegates to Ted Cruz,'" Jarding says.
The concept operates on the assumption that delegates will follow their chosen candidate's lead.
When a convention is 'contested'
Contested conventions involve releasing delegates after the first ballot, allowing them to become "free agents."

"Although they were with you on the first ballot, without committing anybody, there are no guarantees they have to follow you [on the next ballot]," Jarding explains. "You effectively just open the thing wide."
Ohio Gov. John Kasich is keen to see either of the multi-ballot scenarios. Despite being pressured by Trump and Cruz to drop out and make it a two-man race, Kasich has vowed to stick it out until the national convention in Cleveland this July. He hopes multiple ballot calls will cause delegates to drift his way and give him the nomination.
"It's going to be so much fun," Kasich told ABC's This Week.
Why multi-ballot conventions are rare
If there's a secret ingredient for a multi-ballot convention, it's divisiveness.
That doesn't bode well for a party that has called for unity in order to defeat likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in a general election come November.
Usually by the time the primary calendar winds down, the parties have a clear idea of who will emerge as their nominees, making conventions little more than what U.S. historian James Paterson called "scripted, anachronistic rituals."
Not so in this election cycle. As the Republican field winnowed during the primaries, a strong anti-establishment base has resisted backing candidates viewed as ideologically moderate insiders. No obvious delegate favourite has yet materialized.
The last time this happened

Republicans were last forced into a brokered convention in 1948, when it took three ballots for the party to nominate former New York governor Thomas Dewey.
Nobody won the first ballot in the 1952 Democratic national convention either and it again took until the third ballot for delegates to coalesce behind then-Illinois governor Adlai Stevenson.
The nightmare scenario
The most contested convention was the infamous 1924 Democratic national convention, a 16-day contest that at times devolved into fistfights, obscenity-laced screaming and even a gathering of tens of thousands of Ku Klux Klan members, according to historical accounts.
After an absurd 103 ballots were called, the party finally settled on relative outsider John W. Davis, former U.S. ambassador to the U.K.

The rowdy conclave was held in July at the old Madison Square Garden in New York City.
Davis was finally chosen as a compromise candidate to break a deadlock between the two front-runners: then-New York governor Al Smith, a Catholic who was despised by the KKK, and former treasury secretary William McAdoo, who was endorsed by them.
Davis was handily beaten in the general election by Republican candidate Calvin Coolidge.
What Republicans should worry about

As Jarding warned, the prospect of a brokered Republican convention this year is "dangerous" because it risks alienating a large voter base. "There has been no precedent for this level of rejection for the will of the people," he says.
Cruz has said he sees no problem with a contested convention allowing delegates to align themselves with whomever they wish if a first ballot goes undecided. But he slammed a brokered convention as "the fevered dream of the D.C. establishment," in which a party approves another candidate and "swoops in with their White Knight."
Unless Trump or Cruz becomes the nominee, the Texas senator warned "you would see an open revolt, and it would all but concede the election to Hillary Clinton."
Trump going forward
It's not the end of the road, though, not by a long stretch.
Five winner-take-all-states remain for the Republicans, giving Trump several opportunities to mount huge delegate totals. California is a big prize on June 7, with 172 Republicans delegates.
April 19 is another big day — the day of the New York primary — and Trump is expected to reap some big returns in his home state.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The grandson of Josef Stalin is suing the radio station Ekho Moskvy, it said on Saturday, in a second attempt to stem media criticism of the leader whom many Russians still revere for victory in World War Two.
Yevgeny Dzhugashvili is seeking 10 million roubles' ($326,900) compensation and an apology from Ekho Moskvy over comments made by presenter Matvey Ganapolsky on a program in October, who said:
“Stalin signed an order that children can be shot from the age of 12 as enemies of the nation. Which of the bastards dares say a single word in his defense?”
Ekho Moskvy said it had been notified of the lawsuit.
Earlier this year a Russian court threw out a similar case by Dzhugashvili against Novaya Gazeta newspaper which said Stalin had personally ordered the killings of thousands of Soviet citizens.
Historians said at the time the court's decision was a victory in Russia where they say there is a creeping attempt to paint a more benevolent picture of the Soviet Union's most feared leader, under whose rule millions perished.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin weighed into the fierce national debate on Stalin's legacy this month, praising him for industrializing the Soviet Union and winning World War Two, but condemning his repression.
Some 37 percent of Russians look on Stalin with respect, sympathy or even admiration, according to a WCIOM poll published this week. Roughly a quarter of the population dislikes, fears or hates him and the rest are indifferent.
Research deserves our support for one simple reason: it improves societies and the lives of their citizens. Researchers discover what was previously unknown and they use that knowledge for innovation - they use it to make a difference.
Several hundred scientists and policymakers have gathered at the European Parliament in Brussels today to discuss how research can be even better. They are working to create the conditions for higher quality results for you and me. And the key, as they see it, is gender.
The European Gender Summit will enhance its participants' understanding of how gender balance makes research organizations better. It will also let them see how the results of research projects are better for everyone when gender is included in our research questions. These two different but related challenges can improve the productivity of researchers and the quality of their results.
The daily grind of research happens of course in the context of a workplace. We know that productivity is affected by employee satisfaction. And we know that employees in organizations with gender balance in their management teams have higher job satisfaction than those in organizations with only male managers. Therefore, gender balance gives higher productivity. And in the private sector, gender balance has been shown to give increased profits.
One topic at the Gender Summit is how to get more women to the top; it isn't difficult, but in research organizations there are challenges that play out differently for men and women, such as the importance of self-promotion for career advancement. Heightened awareness of those differences will lead to better balance at the top.
Independent of gender balance in management, there are well-studied advantages to prioritizing gender balance in research teams. One example comes from researchers studying group intelligence -- the ability of a group to collectively solve complex problems. Group intelligence turns out to be unrelated to the intelligence of the individuals in that group. But it is related to several other factors, one of which is gender balance. Mixed groups do a better job of solving cognitive problems than groups that consist only of one sex.
Another advantage of diversity in groups is that it leads to better decisions. Groups that are diverse are more likely to experience a diversity of opinions in decision-making contexts. This allows them to avoid the pitfalls of groupthink -- bad decisions coming homogeneous groups. Studies have shown that a diversity of opinions leads to decisions of a higher quality.
The participants at the Gender Summit will also hear about the importance of including issues of sex and gender in their research questions. Some simple examples come from medical research. First, the cost of bringing new drugs to market is enormous, yet over half of those that are subsequently withdrawn have had the problem of unanticipated side effects in women because of inadequate testing on women.
Second, heart attacks affect men and women differently; women have been under-diagnosed because the protocols have been developed by studying men alone. Third, men have been diagnosed for osteoporosis according to standards developed by studying women, and they have been given treatments developed through research on women.
There are also important examples beyond medicine. Every year, in utero babies are injured or killed in car accidents as a result of the design of seatbelts. The development of crash test dummies that simulate pregnant women is leading to new seatbelt designs that will be safer for everyone.
When we focus on gender, we can get more and better science from universities and other research institutions. The goal of the European Gender Summit is to make this happen.
The European Gender Summit 2012 is taking place today and tomorrow in the European Parliament, Brussels.

The Bank for International Settlements, the world's most prestigious financial body, has warned that years of loose monetary policy has fuelled a dangerous credit bubble, leaving the global economy more vulnerable to another 1930s-style slump than generally understood.
"Virtually nobody foresaw the Great Depression of the 1930s, or the crises which affected Japan and southeast Asia in the early and late 1990s. In fact, each downturn was preceded by a period of non-inflationary growth exuberant enough to lead many commentators to suggest that a 'new era' had arrived", said the bank.
The BIS, the ultimate bank of central bankers, pointed to a confluence a worrying signs, citing mass issuance of new-fangled credit instruments, soaring levels of household debt, extreme appetite for risk shown by investors, and entrenched imbalances in the world currency system.
"Behind each set of concerns lurks the common factor of highly accommodating financial conditions. Tail events affecting the global economy might at some point have much higher costs than is commonly supposed," it said.
The BIS said China may have repeated the disastrous errors made by Japan in the 1980s when Tokyo let rip with excess liquidity.
"The Chinese economy seems to be demonstrating very similar, disquieting symptoms," it said, citing ballooning credit, an asset boom, and "massive investments" in heavy industry.
Some 40pc of China's state-owned enterprises are loss-making, exposing the banking system to likely stress in a downturn.
It said China's growth was "unstable, unbalanced, uncoordinated and unsustainable", borrowing a line from Chinese premier Wen Jiabao
In a thinly-veiled rebuke to the US Federal Reserve, the BIS said central banks were starting to doubt the wisdom of letting asset bubbles build up on the assumption that they could safely be "cleaned up" afterwards - which was more or less the strategy pursued by former Fed chief Alan Greenspan after the dotcom bust.
It said this approach had failed in the US in 1930 and in Japan in 1991 because excess debt and investment built up in the boom years had suffocating effects.
While cutting interest rates in such a crisis may help, it has the effect of transferring wealth from creditors to debtors and "sowing the seeds for more serious problems further ahead."
The bank said it was far from clear whether the US would be able to shrug off the consequences of its latest imbalances, citing a current account deficit running at 6.5pc of GDP, a rise in US external liabilities by over $4 trillion from 2001 to 2005, and an unpredented drop in the savings rate. "The dollar clearly remains vulnerable to a sudden loss of private sector confidence," it said.
The BIS said last year's record issuance of $470bn in collateralized debt obligations (CDO), and a further $524bn in "synthetic" CDOs had effectively opened the lending taps even further. "Mortgage credit has become more available and on easier terms to borrowers almost everywhere. Only in recent months has the downside become more apparent," it said.
CDO's are bond-like packages of mortgages and other forms of debt. The BIS said banks transfer the exposure to buyers of the securities, giving them little incentive to assess risk or carry out due diligence.
Mergers and takeovers reached $4.1 trillion worldwide last year.
Leveraged buy-outs touched $753bn, with an average debt/cash flow ratio hitting a record 5:4.
"Sooner or later the credit cycle will turn and default rates will begin to rise," said the bank.
"The levels of leverage employed in private equity transactions have raised questions about their longer-term sustainability. The strategy depends on the availability of cheap funding," it said.
That may not last much longer.
I am in the midst of reading the book Hot, Flat, and Crowded 2.0 by Thomas L. Friedman. Within five pages of starting (I am now 70 odd pages in) my mind started going numb. Why? There's just way too much information being “crowded” into this book without stirring my heart or motivating me. I keep thinking, “stop burying me in moribund statistics, move me to action.”
While much of the data and quotes are informative, the text tends to come across to me like reading facts out of an almanac or definitions out of dictionary. The overkill in details reminds me of the quote by Erich Maria Remarque which said,
“The death of one man is a tragedy — the death of millions is a statistic.”
The topic needs to be personalized to motivate people to change.
I found the book Hot, Living Through the Next Fifty Years on Earth by Mark Hertsgaard to be much more engaging because the author personalized the same distressing kinds of information by linking it to how his daughter and her generation will have to cope with climate change. That correlation made the book a very compelling read.
At least thus far, Hot, Flat, and Crowded 2.0, just piles on the bad news over and over again without reaching out and touching the soul. Basically, the whole premise seems to be, “things suck all over and here's why.” Yippee! Tell me something I don't know, like how to correct the mess we have gotten ourselves into.
Perhaps I am wrong and before the end of the book Mr. Friedman will launch into a stellar series of ideas and proposed solutions. If he does, I will gladly eat crow. Otherwise, I will feel like the time I read Hot, Flat, and Crowded 2.0 could have been spent doing more important things like volunteering my time to help others.

Gartner Issues Apology For Pure Storage's Wildly Inaccurate Sales Data
Yesterday Pure Storage started the process of going public, filing their S1 with the SEC. This process means Pure will soon have access to a large pile of cash, likely in the $300-400 million range by the time the issue starts trading. On the flip side the company now has to disclose all sorts of financial data including sales, marketing expenses and operational losses. This double-edged sword means the company extends their runway by a year and a half or so based on the current burn rate, but this also opens the company up for their competitors to pick on. That's exactly what happened when Pure revealed their product sales to be $154,836,000 for 2014 where Gartner had posted data showing revenues of $276,329,000 for 2014. It took Twitter only minutes to react, calling out the gaping difference of over $120,000,000 for 2014, and a gap of roughly $75,000,000 for 2013.
As a point of clarity, Pure Storage reports on a fiscal year that ends January 31st, where the Gartner data is based on calendar year. This minor difference is not entirely relevant given the gap, but one worth noting for data accuracy. Gartner also tracks product revenue only, not services or support.
Pure Storage Income Statement from the S1 Filing
The immediate question then is what happened and who's to blame. For Gartner's part, Joseph Unsworth made this statement about getting the numbers wrong and provided details around Gartner's methodology:
Simply put: I got it wrong. I have already been working on restating market share and that will likely happen next week. This is Not an excuse, just an explanation. Here is my methodology - We review all public comments about financials and have offline models on quarterly sales (bookings and product revenues) as well as system units all done at by raw capacity for every vendor. I am fortunate that I track the entire supply chain of Solid State Arrays: chips, SSDs and systems which allows me visibility into the supply chain (of course, this doesn't help me know what is a PoC and what was actually purchased – a big challenge). Lastly, we speak to end-users daily and Pure is one of the leading vendors of interest with our customer base (evident through our inquiries but also analytics of end-users searching on Pure Storage on our website). *We send all estimates to vendors for review and publish under Gartner estimates*. [emphasis not added]
Okay, so Gartner made a mistake, is owning it and will forever get Pure correct because from here on out Pure will have to disclose their numbers. But that's just part of the issue. The last statement Joseph makes is the one that most should have a problem with. It's evident that Pure didn't overtly lie in feeding Gartner incorrect data, but they still apparently didn't say anything about the inflated data during the process nor after it was made public. Pure has always been on the IPO track, so this lapse in judgment is bizarre, someone internal to Pure had to know this reconciliation would eventually take place. Either way here we are. The Gartner data was bad, Pure didn't say anything, and now they'll have to deal with the fallout at exactly the wrong time as shareholders look to cash out and competitors look to expose Pure Storage as untrustworthy.
We reached out to Pure for this story but did not get a response.

An Alternative Plan
Michael Kimmelman, New York Times architecture critic
Train stations are more than just a bunch of platforms for getting places. They're portals. New York used to have two of the world's most ennobling entrances, announcing the city in all its ambition and glory, Grand Central Terminal and the old Pennsylvania Station. Half a century ago, it lost the latter to the wrecking ball, getting a shameful rat's maze instead.
The governor of New York, Andrew M. Cuomo, channeling his inner Robert Moses, has lately been promising to remedy what ails the city's crumbling transit hubs. And this week he announced a plan to revamp Penn Station. Still entombed beneath Madison Square Garden, it has become the hemisphere's busiest train station, serving 650,000 riders a day, three times the number it was conceived for — a figure equivalent to the population of Boston. They must stagger through crowded, confusing subterranean passageways to find the Long Island Rail Road, New Jersey Transit, the subways and Amtrak.
The governor's initiative prompted editors of The Times's Op-Ed page to approach Vishaan Chakrabarti, who founded Practice for Architecture and Urbanism, a New York architecture firm. Mr. Chakrabarti, who explains his plan in detail below, ran the Manhattan office of the Department of City Planning under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, and he is a veteran of earlier Penn Station refurbishment proposals. The challenge: Can we go further than what the governor is doing? What would it take to truly transform Penn Station?
As many weary observers of the site point out, a nicer station is all well and good, but nothing matters more than Gateway, a multibillion-dollar project to dig new rail tunnels under the Hudson River. After unconscionable delays by Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and others, the plan seems finally to be inching forward.
In fact, Gateway makes major changes at Penn Station all the more necessary. It requires improvements to the station, which it will need to handle added capacity, as well as the creation of a linked facility where Gateway's tracks would arrive to the south of the existing station.
Skeptics may roll their eyes at Mr. Chakrabarti's proposal, since even cosmetic improvements have been hard to come by, and the governor already has his own plan. But in recent years, momentum for change has been building. In 2013, after significant public protest, the City Council attempted to spur the Dolan family, which owns Madison Square Garden, to consider moving the arena from its site above the station.
Then Gateway started gaining steam.
Now Mr. Cuomo has announced his $1.6 billion vision to make the east end of the James A. Farley Building home to Amtrak and (this bit was new) to the Long Island Rail Road, with a train hall and immense retail and office space. Completion date: 2020.

Skidmore, Owings & Merrill are the architects. As with other big infrastructure proposals by the governor, design doesn't seem to be his top priority. Vornado Realty, Related Companies and Skanska AB, the construction management giant, are the developers. They will contribute $600 million to the project, according to the governor. The rest comes from Empire State Development ($570 million) and a mix of the railroads, the Port Authority and the federal government ($425 million).
So Mr. Cuomo assured everyone. That said, Amtrak accounts for just 30,000 passengers a day, the Long Island Rail Road, 230,000, but only a fraction of them will use Farley. The governor did not predict how many. With the neighborhood to the west of the station booming, Farley is conceived to serve more and more riders, while providing quicker access to and from trains, opening space and relieving strains on the existing station, which will be upgraded. That's the argument, anyway.
But the Garden remains an obvious obstacle to a hub serving all riders, one worthy of the city. Mr. Chakrabarti participated in negotiations during the mid-2000s when the Dolans, Vornado and Related spent years and many millions of dollars exploring the possibility of demolishing the aging Garden and building a new arena inside Farley. The goal was abandoned after Gov. Eliot Spitzer, a supporter, was forced to resign, and the Dolans concluded they couldn't lose more time before fixing up the existing arena.
Mr. Chakrabarti's plan reconsiders that mothballed idea. Unlike earlier proposals, PAU's doesn't envision demolishing the Garden but repurposing it, using its stripped skeleton to make a glass pavilion, which becomes a neighborhood gathering spot, not just a station. As opposed to a wholly new building, this one wouldn't require any huge cash outlay for a new superstructure or even a new roof. It gets rid of many columns and other obstructions that today make the station a menace to public health. Its passive heat and cooling system would lower operating costs and let smoke escape through the top in an emergency. Independent cost consultants estimated the price tag to be around $1.5 billion.
So let's round it up to $2 billion. Even at that amount, the project's emphasis on reuse and resilience for a heavily trafficked station make it the opposite of Santiago Calatrava's shopping mall/transit facility downtown, the $4 billion Path Station at the World Trade Center, which serves relatively few.
The design may bring to mind Philip Johnson's New York State Pavilion for the 1964 World's Fair in Queens, with its ellipse of concrete piers and giant map on the terrazzo floor. Here, the ceiling presents the map of the city. Just as the new Amtrak train hall for Farley, designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, reuses the catenary structure of the building's original trusses to bring in natural light, this plan foresees a sunny public space, open to the street, framing views of Farley, its height dwarfing Grand Central Terminal's main concourse. It reclads the arena's facade with double-skin glass, doing away with doors into and out of the building, letting commuters, long lost in the existing warren, know where they are and see where they're going.

Mr. Chakrabarti argues that PAU's idea doesn't step on but complements Gateway, and that a new Garden could find a home, among other places, as the anchor tenant in Farley, alongside Amtrak, a concept official in Mr. Cuomo's office considered when shown the PAU plan. “They chose not to pursue it at this time not because the Garden wouldn't move,” Mr. Chakrabarti reported back, “but because they have advanced the Farley station annex and want to see it through. I respect this, of course, but hope they view this proposal as the logical next step.”
Mr. Cuomo may not agree or want to think that far ahead. But the plan is presented nonetheless as a provocation, to keep up the drumbeat for a better station. Because even with the announcement this week, there's still a long way to go.
How to Do It
Vishaan Chakrabarti, Founder of the architecture firm Practice for Architecture and Urbanism and a professor at Columbia University
Penn Station is much more than a transportation center. As the heart of the Northeast Corridor rail system, it has the potential to link downtown to downtown along the Eastern Seaboard in a way far more economical, expedient and environmentally sustainable than air travel.
But while the governor's recently announced plan is a step toward this goal, more must be done. What we propose in addition is a completely new commuter station on the site of Madison Square Garden, one that makes use of the Garden's structure and foundations, in much the same way that the current station makes use of the tracks and underground mezzanine levels of the original Penn Station.

The destruction of the old Penn Station building in the 1960s has been called one of this country's most egregious acts of public vandalism. We propose to right this wrong by using the original station's subterranean platforms and infrastructure as the base for the new station.
But equally important, “recycling” what's there allows for the building of an ambitious new station at minimal cost and disruption. We could restore a gateway to New York with a scale consistent with other great public spaces in the city.
Critics of this plan will focus on the difficulty of moving Madison Square Garden. But it would be much more difficult to move the center of the platforms serving the station from beneath the Garden to under Farley. This is why under the governor's plan, approximately 80 percent of Penn Station commuters will continue to use the tracks and platforms under the Garden — which means that any effort to improve their experience significantly has to start with a radical rethinking of that site.
And it's not just about current users, who now number 650,000 a day. Amtrak's Gateway project would add two sorely needed tunnels under the Hudson as well as four new platforms under the block south of Madison Square Garden. All of this means more trains and thousands more Amtrak travelers entering and leaving the station each day.
Without a reconfigured Penn Station, these travelers will pour into the maze of the commuter concourse under the Garden, especially if they are transferring into the subway system.
The Garden, which is getting old and has problems of its own, has compelling reasons to move. Given fair incentives, its owners, who have shown themselves to be reasonable and civic-minded, could be willing to move the arena 800 feet to the west end of the Farley Building, where there is over one million square feet of underutilized space.
Once the Garden is in its new home, its structure and foundations would be “recycled”: We would take off its unsightly concrete cladding, demolish the interior, rebuild the mezzanines and vertical circulation to the platforms below, and remove many of the support columns on the train platforms that passengers have to dodge today.
The concrete cladding would be replaced by a “double skin,” a blastproof glass facade that would allow in light and views while enabling passive heating and cooling. (A very different version of this idea was proposed by Columbia University students in 2008.) The engineering firms Thornton Tomasetti and Level Infrastructure established the structural, security, and sustainability design for our proposal.
Imagine an open, light-filled station, with no need even for doors, much like King's Cross station in London (special shutters would deploy during inclement weather), instead of one reached only through dark passages. Commuters now languishing in a fluorescent-lit cave would see natural light and city views.
The familiar cylindrical form of the Garden could be transformed into a monumental yet transparent pavilion. We propose that the ceiling, which is the roof of the existing arena, feature a map of New York to orient travelers, a contemporary update of the stars on the ceiling of Grand Central.
This is a realistic, economical plan to create a grand civic space, lifting today's 11-foot ceilings to over 150 feet high, with a small number of shops lining the side streets, a small park to the southwest, and much-needed taxi access to the east.
It would cost substantially less than the train stations at the World Trade Center and Hudson Yards, but with similarly effective results. According to an outside estimate by Dharam Consulting, our proposal would cost about $1.5 billion. Building a new arena would cost a similar sum, so the entire project would cost approximately $3 billion. A variety of public and private funding sources, from air-rights sales to tax-increment financing and bonds, are available to pay for the proposal. Given the potential to radically improve central Manhattan while creating a safe and dignified new station for all of Penn Station's users, this is a small price to pay.
By making Penn Station an attractive focal point for the neighborhood, we would increase the value of the area's office, residential and retail properties.
For the health, safety and vibrancy of our city, Penn Station should be transformed into a world-class transit hub with enhanced rail capacity and enduring public architecture, a place that rejuvenates its surroundings, just as has been done in other parts of the city, like Grand Central, Bryant Park and Columbus Circle.
Too often the general public relegates mental illnesses like depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia to just that, mental illness, diseases of the mind. However, with modern science, we are beginning to see more and more the folly of this simplistic viewpoint. We are now seeing the science behind these illnesses; the changes in brain form, function, and chemical balance that alter how our brain functions and perceives the world around us. For the next month or so, in my “Exploring the Science of…” mini series, I will be talking about how what happens in our brain impacts what happens in our mind. In this post, I will be talking about how subtle changes in the brain can lead to bipolar disorder.
What is Bipolar Disorder?
Bipolar disorder consists of hyperactive episodes called “manic” episodes, as well as episodes of depression called “depressive” episodes. During manic episodes, a person may feel unstoppable, stop sleeping, and generally feel extremely happy, active, and outgoing, sometimes engaging in high risk behaviors. Depressive episodes are similar to those found in depression, and the person may feel tired, in slow motion, or hopeless for extended periods of time.
There are several sub-diagnoses within bipolar disorder. These include Bipolar I, categorized by full blown manic episodes, as well as Bipolar II, in which depressive episodes and more mild manic episodes are present. Other diagnoses include Cyclothymia and Bipolar Disorder – Not Otherwise Specified (BP-NOS).
It's All in the Genes
Like so many things, mental illness is often impacted by genes. This has been shown through familial studies for mental illness, along with ever helpful twin studies. These studies give a strong case for mental illness having a genetic component, helping to explain why mental illness so often runs in families. Bipolar disorder is no exception, in fact over half a dozen genes have been implicated in the formation of bipolar disorder. These genes affect everything from your biological clock to how your body handles neurotransmitters like serotonin. Mutations of these genes can cause anything from anxiety, to depression, to increased chance of alcohol abuse, and leaves the person at a higher risk of developing bipolar disorder.
Those of you who have extensively studied mental illness may have noticed an underlying similarity between the symptoms of many disorders. For instance, psychosis can be present in schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, and sometimes even (in milder forms) extreme anxiety. Similarly, some of the gene mutations in bipolar disorder are the same gene mutations implicated in schizophrenia. Furthermore, mutations in specific genes cause the same symptoms across both disorders. For example, a mutation in a certain gene causes hallucinations in both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
Think On It
As mentioned previously, often people with bipolar disorder engage in high risk behaviors during manic episodes. With modern technology, we are now getting a glimpse into why this might be. The (potential) answer lies in two parts of the brain, and their function relative to healthy subjects. These two parts are the medial prefrontal cortex, responsible for decision making and memory, and the anterior cingulate gyrus, correlated with emotional response and control.
In those with bipolar disorder, the medial prefrontal cortex is under active compared to healthy controls, while the anterior cingulate gyrus is overactive. This basically means that less energy is going into decision making, and more into emotion. This difference, however subtle (we're talking about minor differences in tiny parts of the brain), may lead to clues about the poor decision making often found in bipolar disorder.
Tick Tock
Sleep is an integral part of our mental health, especially so when it comes to bipolar disorder. A decrease in sleep is almost always correlated with an increase in bipolar symptoms, and a return to a normal schedule is usually met with decreased symptoms. But what explains this phenomenon? What exactly is going on in our brain when we go without sleep?
The most important change that happens when we forgo sleep happens inside our amygdala, the brain's center for emotion. Without sleep, the amygdala becomes overactive, meaning it is more sensitive to emotional stimuli. Remember when we talked about overactivity in the anterior cingulate gyrus which also controls emotion? Now imagine that plus an overactive amygdala. That spells trouble. It's no surprise then that going without sleep worsens symptoms in those with bipolar disorder.
The Takeaway
Bipolar disorder is a complex disease that is just beginning to be understood by scientists. As we begin to learn more about this disorder, we may find clues into the treatment and early identification of the disorder. With this information, we can help better the lives of millions who have bipolar disorder. Also of interest is bipolar disorders link to other disorders such as depression and schizophrenia. Already scientists have discovered similar genetic roots for these disorders, and who knows what the future holds.

Astralis were the first to advance to the ELEAGUE Major grand final with a 2-0 win over fnatic, as they picked up a tough Cache in overtime before decimating the Swedes 16-5 on Nuke.
Astralis answered a few questions at their press conference
ELEAGUE held a press conference following the match, in which Astralis' players answered several questions, some more serious than others:
Steven Cropley, WWG: I just wanna start off by asking how the banana was...
Peter "dupreeh" Rasmussen: The banana was good. I didn't know if the cameraman was on me or not, but I was like "I'm not gonna stuff this in my mouth if the camera was watching", with like a million people watching, then the crowd started chanting "eat it, eat it", so sure, why not... But it tasted really good, thank you.
Lukas "gla1ve" Rossander: Mine was a little brown, actually, it was pretty bad.
Justin Groot, Glixel: Keeping with the food thing, we were talking to fnatic about what they were eating when they were here, what were you guys eating and did it play into your victory?
Peter "dupreeh" Rasmussen: Bananas.
Lukas "gla1ve" Rossander: We eat different food, it depends on the person, we had some eggs in the morning (chuckles) and then we had some chicken sausage, I think. That's probably it.
No barbecue?
Lukas "gla1ve" Rossander: Fuck barbecue. I don't like barbecue, actually.
Vince Nairn, Slingshot: I know you guys think the job isn't done yet, but what's it like to get to the finals and have a chance to take a Major championship now?
Nicolai "device" Reedtz: Obviously, we have three guys with their tenth time, and it's actually unbelieveable in a way that we actually haven't realized it. Also, as you say, the job isn't done, we all want to focus on the match tomorrow and have no regrets after that match.
Milan Švejda, HLTV.org: device, did you learn from your yesterday's Red Bull mistake? (He had been late for Astralis' previous press conference due to feeling unwell after drinking too much Red Bull)
Nicolai "device" Reedtz: Oh yeah, I actually didn't touch Red Bull today, shoutout to no caffeine. I actually felt pretty off, so tomorrow I don't care, I'll drink two liters if that's what I need to be on my game.
Vince Nairn, Slingshot: What played into your decision to play Nuke?
Andreas "Xyp9x" Højsleth: We knew they were either going to ban Overpass or Nuke, and we would pick either of those maps depending on what they banned. I don't think they've been playing Nuke much, we could see that they didn't really have proper smokes, proper tactics. We know they were praccing it a little bit, but they didn't feel confident on it, so that's why we picked it.
Lukas "gla1ve" Rossander: And we said before the event that we play all seven maps, and we wanted to show that as well, that if you ban one of our strongest maps and we play one you don't ever play, you're going to lose.
Milan Švejda, HLTV.org: Cache was a close affair; dennis likes to call very loosely, let's say, was there anything that caught you off-guard during the match?
Markus "Kjaerbye" Kjærbye: I don't think they caught us off-guard, but it was one of our first real tests on Cache, we've been practicing it and did pretty well. They didn't really catch us off-guard, and I'm really happy that we won it in the end.
Eddie Plaut, Gamurs.com: What were the comms like during the 30th round on Cache where you took the bomb back to B site while device stayed on quad?
Lukas "gla1ve" Rossander: The comms were actually pretty calm, it wasn't that hectic, device made sound on A and I rotated to B. It's a thing we like to do if it's possible, because people don't expect it and people like to stay together when they're on 2-on-2 situation, or even 2-on-1 situations. So, we made a really good decision about that, I should've won the round, I made a stupid plant, it was lucky he had a smoke, if he didn't have it I would've won it.
Milan Švejda, HLTV.org: In that situation you pulled away from the spray and after you lost it, it looked like there were some words exchanged, did someone tell you he was off the bomb...?
Lukas "gla1ve" Rossander: I heard him defusing in the smoke, and then I thought I heard a step. I heard the crowd, and they started to cheer, so you know he's still defusing, you hear it like right when he's done defusing, it's not like you can hear in the beginning. Xyp9x said he is defusing and right after he said that, he was done.
Peter "dupreeh" Rasmussen: I screamed it as well, but I had muted my microphone, so... Well, intentionally, because gla1ve said sometimes you can hear the crowd and stuff when you're playing with voice activation, so he was like "if you can, mute your microphone" so he can get all the sound he can, so I had done it and when I heard him tap the bomb, obviously I said "he's defusing", but all I heard was "microphone muted".
Lukas "gla1ve" Rossander: It's also a good thing that you can't hear it in the beginning, because that would ruin the game, it's only in the end. It was just a chaotic moment, I just didn't think he was defusing.
Bryce Bobula, Esportspedia: As you can see, the other match is on between Virtus.pro and SK, which team would you prefer to play and why?
Nicolai "device" Reedtz: For me, personally, I would like to face SK, because they are my good friends, so I'd like to see them in the final, and I also see them as the weaker team at the moment, because with the map pool they have, they can't play Nuke, while we play it. It will play into our advantage that they have to ban that, and we have a permaban against both of those teams, so the map pool will play into our advantage. Individually as well, I feel like we can outaim them.
For many SUV owners, the "Utility" in "Sport Utility Vehicle" simply means being able to hold lots of groceries or haul the kids to and from school every day. However, there are plenty of owners who realize the capacity of SUVs for off-roading and put whatever four-wheel-drive system they have in their vehicles through its paces. The new Ford Expedition has already proved that it can handle itself in the wild, but now Ford Motor Company is recognizing that a sizable percentage of Expedition owners love the car for its all-terrain potential. Now, Ford is offering a new package for 2018 Expeditions to enhance it's adventure capabilities and make playing in the dirt that much more fun.
Ford announced Friday that the FX4 Off-Road Package for the upcoming 2018 Expedition will attempt to appeal to the car's adventurous demographic. The package will include better shocks, bigger off-road tires with new 18-inch wheels, a limited-slip differential, and a strengthened underbody to prevent damage from terrain to key suspension and engine components. The FX4 will also feature a smart 4x4 system, seven dynamic driving modes for different situations, and slightly different badging to differentiate it from the regular Expedition.
All of these features pair well with the Expedition's potent 3.5L EcoBoost V-6 making 350 horsepower and 470 lb-ft of torque; this combination will take you on the ultimate camping adventure. The FX4 will still get all of the available technology that the standard Expedition gets, so this package is a must-buy for those looking for the quintessential all-terrain experience.
You can pick up a brand new 2018 Expedition and its FX4 Off-Road Package this fall.
What do Top Gear, Parts Unknown, Tiny Troopers and pornography have in common?
They appear to be among the favorite downloads in Pyongyang, data analysis shows.
Open source data provided by the torrent network analysis site Scan Eye has provided a list of recent Torrent files apparently downloaded from IP addresses registered in Pyongyang.
The torrents are exclusively listed as coming from the Ryugyong-dong neighborhood in the northeast of the capital, and consist of a variety of content: pornography features prominently, as does the cookery-travel program Parts Unknown, British motoring program Top Gear, and mobile/computer games Tiny Troopers and Far Cry 3.
Tech experts were divided on what to conclusions to draw from the results.
While it is possible that the results could be due to individuals using a virtual private network (VPN) for the purposes of protecting their identity online, Ernesto Van Der Sar said that “the IP-addresses in question are registered to North Korea and there is no known VPN provider operating from that range.”
“This makes it likely that the traffic is indeed originating from the area,” Van Der Sar, editor of BitTorrent-focused blog TorrentFreak, told NK News. “Technically it's always possible that the IP-address has been spoofed, but there are also entries that list the client ID which suggests that this is real.”
“The client ID suggests that Scaneye actually connected to this IP-address which excludes simple spoofing strategies,” he continued.
The Ryugyong-dong is an overwhelmingly administrative district, hosting the Ministry of Metal and the Pyongyang International Communications Center, which hosts the main office of Koryolink, North Korea's mobile network provider. Koryolink is run by the Orascom Group's Global Telecom Holding, an Egyptian conglomerate.
Every IP address registered in North Korea is listed as coming out of this neighborhood, but the distinct lack of Korean-language content suggests that it is not locals doing the downloading.
But Martyn Williams, who runs the North Korea Tech blog, expressed skepticism that the torrents were actually being downloaded by individuals in North Korea, saying “the shows being torrented seem unlikely to be hits in North Korea and they are so varied that they appear random.”
“If any of it is real, I expect it's foreigners in Pyongyang,” he said, “but I really wonder whether people would be bothered to torrent and if the bandwidth would support it.”
Sebastian Anthony, a senior editor at ExtremeTech, told NK News that “it's totally possible that people in North Korea are torrenting games, movies, TV shows. It's probably the easiest way to get them into the country.”
Anthony said those behind the downloads were “probably people working at big offices, governmental agencies, universities, etc,” which could explain why the torrents were listed as being from one neighborhood. “It could also be just one or two people downloading lots of stuff – hard to say.
“Someone might've masqueraded/spoofed their IP address somehow (but unlikely)”.
Internet access in North Korea is sporadic: Most citizens can use an intranet system called Kwangmyong, which offers no connection to the Internet beyond the DPRK's borders.
Only high-ranking officials are allowed unfettered access to the global Internet.

MANAGUA, Nicaragua — The crowd erupted in wild cheers as the caravan of cattle trucks lumbered into Managua carrying several thousand cowboys to join today's march against a $50 billion Chinese canal that's scheduled to break ground on Dec. 22.
The caravan from the interior of the countryside took nearly 20 hours to arrive, and was stopped eight times by police roadblocks. Drivers' licenses were confiscated and several people were arrested. Similar police roadblocks along choke points to the north and south of the capital succeeded in preventing hundreds of other protesters from arriving in the capital.
But the cowboys from the interior of the country — those living along the canal route mapped for Chinese expropriation next month — pushed past the police blockades without a second thought. It was just the first shove in what's gearing up to be a long fight.

“Here we are — Chontales, Nueva Guinea, Rio San Juan — giving you people from Managua a lesson in how to defend your country!” yelled one muddy-booted cowboy as he jumped down from the back of the truck.
The cowboys' arrival breathed new energy into Nicaragua's anti-canal movement, and lent an immediate gravitas to the march. Some of the campesinos came looking for a fight. “Where are the motorizados! Bring ‘em on!” yelled one cowboy, referring to the Sandinista motorcycle gangs that usually terrorize opposition marches.

The Sandinistas, however, ceded the streets — for the first time in many years.

With no one to fight, the marchers turned their energies to chanting and singing songs with lyrics that are unabashedly anti-Chinese, anti-Ortega and anti-Russian.

“We don't want communism, socialism or Chinese; we don't want to eat rat like they do!” 76-year-old protester Dagoberto Gadea shouted into a bullhorn.

“Nicaragua is for Nicaraguans, and not for the Chinese. They need to respect our rights, because the people will defend themselves with guns in hand —and that goes for any asshole who tries to establish a dictatorship here in Nicaragua,” said ex-combatant Carlos Funes. “I might be old, but I'm not stupid!”
Others directed their messages at President Daniel Ortega. “If you want peace in Nicaragua, don't force Nicaraguans to go back to war like you did in the 1980s. Because we are not going to hand over our land,” said Pablo Ramos Duarte, of Nueva Guinea.

“Chinese get out! And stick Daniel Ortega in your suitcase before you leave though the back door!” yelled songwriter Gaby Baca.
A northern Idaho senator says he stands by his comments after law enforcement video showed the Republican lawmaker in a confrontation at the Latah County Fair.
The Moscow-Pullman Daily News reported Tuesday that it had obtained bodycam video from the Latah County Sheriff's Department showing Sen. Dan Foreman of Viola in a heated exchange with an unseen and unidentified male on Sept. 14 — the first day of the county fair in Moscow.
Video footage shows a deputy approach Foreman, who told the deputy that the unseen man was rude. The footage does not show what the unidentified man was saying to Foreman before the lawmaker became agitated.
"This guy says I'm not doing my job, and he's lecturing me on the Constitution," said Foreman.
Foreman then shouted insults and cursed at the man after the deputy asked both of them to move along.
"Go straight to hell, you son of a bitch," Foreman can be heard saying out of the view of the camera.
Foreman later told the newspaper that he won't return to the fair until he gets an apology from management for how he and other Republicans were treated.
Foreman, who ousted an incumbent Democrat in the 2016 general election, says Moscow is the only town in his legislative district where he doesn't feel welcome. He also described the man as "an example of the nuttiness of the loony left" that he describes is all too common in Moscow.
Only Foreman can be heard yelling in the video.
This isn't the first time Foreman has raised eyebrows for his blunt behavior. During this year's legislative session, Foreman unsuccessfully attempted to introduce legislation that would allow that would have classified abortion as first-degree murder for mothers and doctors.
Foreman also faced scrutiny over an email response to a constituent's concerns over climate change. Foreman called global warming "nonsense" and said it was a scam used by left-wing fanatics to raise taxes.

Image caption Syntagma Square (photo from 1 May) is the symbolic heart of political life in Greece
Police in the Greek capital Athens have stopped the far-right Golden Dawn party from handing out free food only to Greeks on the city's main square.
Riot police used tear gas to prevent activists distributing food from a lorry on Syntagma Square, where the country's parliament is located.
Athens Mayor Giorgos Kaminis says a Golden Dawn MP later tried to assault him for banning the gathering.
Golden Dawn, once a fringe movement, is now Greece's fifth-biggest party.
It was staging the handout to celebrate Greek Orthodox Easter, which falls this weekend. At past events, the anti-immigration party asked recipients to show ID cards proving they were Greeks.
Golden Dawn reportedly managed to hand out some food before police moved in, and it later continued the distribution elsewhere in the city.
Mr Kaminis said no party could use the square for such purposes and vowed to prevent "thuggery".
The mayor told the BBC that a Golden Dawn MP tried to attack him at a charity centre he was attending later in the day.
Bodyguards managed to restrain MP Giorgos Germenis, he said, although a 12-year-old girl was injured in the process.
Mr Kaminis says he plans to sue the MP over the incident, which was reportedly caught on camera.
Speaking to the BBC, the mayor called members of Golden Dawn "criminals".
The party, whose neo-Nazi ideology has been condemned by human rights groups, has soared in popularity during the financial crisis.
Greek authorities have been accused in the past of failing to take action against hate crime and attacks on immigrants.
Mr Kaminis said Thursday's police action was a "victory for the democratic state".
"Thuggery will not prevail in this city as long as I am mayor," he was quoted as saying by the Greek newspaper Kathimerini.
Hawthorne Mayor Chris Brown, twice the target of eviction orders after he quit paying rent to his landlords, also has dodged debts to a charter airline service based in the city and campaign consultants who helped get him elected in 2013, the Daily Breeze has learned.
And at City Hall, Brown has been spending taxpayer funds freely during his 16 months in office, taking 30 trips around the country — some without documentation as to the purpose — and sneaking through a $20,541 remodel of his office, according to city officials and records obtained by the Breeze.
Meanwhile, Brown thus far has made little progress on his campaign promises to attract economic development to Hawthorne, streamline expenses, and improve transparency in a city beset for years by budget deficits and poor management. The previous two mayors, Daniel Juarez and Larry Guidi, left office due to theft and political pay-to-play scandals.
Brown joined the subscription-based Surf Air in February, shortly after it established a base at Hawthorne Municipal Airport. For a monthly fee, members of the start-up airline get unlimited flights between regional airports.
Brown took several personal flights but never paid the $1,350-a-month fee, according to an invoice from the company to Brown obtained by the Breeze. The company gave him a discount but was still never paid, according to airport officials and a Surf Air invoice seeking $8,100 from the mayor.
California Republic Bank also is seeking about $20,000 loaned to Brown, according to a Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit.
Brown reportedly blew off two campaign consultants who were crucial in getting him elected to public office for the first time, partly on the strength of clout from regional political heavyweights who threw their support behind him.
The mayor did not pay about $10,000 owed to Liberty Campaign Solutions until he was sued for the money after the November 2013 election. Then, according to court records, he settled the debt.
Another consultant, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear it could negatively affect his business, said Brown would not have been elected if not for his work. Yet Brown still hasn't paid him $2,500. A Liberty Campaign Solutions representative also confirmed that Brown still owes the consultant money.
“I was the one who put the campaign team together for him,” the consultant said. “I definitely bought into what he was telling me about how he wants to change the city. But once I started to get to know him, I saw he's just a big show-off.
“He likes to let people know how much money he says he makes. He told me he was in the ‘securitization' business but I never saw any evidence of the business.”
Brown has alternately described himself to the public as a business owner, as self-employed and as a former mobile phone account executive, but has never provided proof of employment or evidence of his business.
Once Brown began working at City Hall, he embarked on an ambitious travel schedule and quietly pushed through a pricey upgrade to his first-floor office with the backing of City Manager Michael Goodson. The remodel was buried at the end of a March 10 staff report to the City Council about the demolition of two dilapidated Hawthorne Boulevard properties.
On the fifth page of the report on the properties to be demolished is a “Proposal for Hawthorne City Hall City Treasurer Office Room Renovation.” Typically, such a proposal would receive its own agenda item for council consideration, and this one hardly was noticed by council members, said Councilman Alex Vargas.
The proposal passed, but the work actually was done on the Mayor's Office — not the treasurer's, Vargas said.
Brown received new carpeting, furniture, a suspended ceiling, new lighting fixtures and had a wall removed to be better connected to an adjacent office. New paint, electrical wiring, and locks were included.
“I'm just concerned that this renovation was not presented in a transparent manner,” Vargas said. “I am also concerned that this incident may demonstrate excess in the Mayor's Office.”
Goodson and Brown both refused several requests to comment for this article. But last month, the mayor told the Los Angeles Sentinel: “I've made a lot of progress since coming to office. I was elected at a time when the residents of Hawthorne felt betrayed and let down by some of their elected officials.
“I've brought the city out of an $8 million deficit and into a nearly $2 million surplus,” Brown told the news outlet. “I campaigned on promises to fix the budget, provide financial transparency with how the city spends taxpayer money and to enhance public safety and I've delivered on each and every one of those promises.”
The budget is structurally balanced this year, but it's not due to any policy changes, increased revenue or decreased expenses. The city last year hired a dedicated finance director for the first time in years.
Finance Director Rickey Manbahal said he was able to balance the budget by reducing the percentage of money set aside for future employee sick and vacation leave. By reducing the accrual from 50 percent to 25 percent, he was able to ensure that the city's revenue this year will be greater than its expenses, he said.
Brown, who promised an end to back-door politics and poor management, was hailed as the city's first African-American and youngest-ever mayor when he was ushered into office with wide support from well-known Democratic politicians.
Sen. Isadore Hall took Brown under his wing and vouched for him as part of the next generation of young black leadership that would revitalize economically depressed communities in the south part of Los Angeles County, and he was compared to Compton Mayor Aja Brown and Inglewood Mayor James Butts.
Brown, elected to a two-year term in 2013, recently kicked off his campaign for a second term in the November city election.
But despite Brown's pronouncements of success, he hasn't enjoyed much political success to move the 6.1-square-mile city forward. Instead, and with the consistent support of Goodson, he has focused his energies on his busy travel schedule, which has included expensive meals, hotel room service, hefty bar tabs and some in-room movies, according to city expense records.
The city spent more than $22,000 in the past 16 months on Brown's airline and hotel bills, according to a review of expense records.
When Brown organized a trip to meet with federal lawmakers and other government officials in search of funding for transportation and infrastructure projects in the city, council members Vargas and Nilo Michelin weren't told about it until afterward. Councilwoman Angie English, several staff members and a lobbyist joined the mayor on the trip, which cost a total of $12,000, according to city staff.
Vargas and Michelin also opposed passage of this fiscal year's $62.5 million general operating budget, which passed with Brown's support on a 3-2 vote in July, because it called for seven new positions, including a public information officer, planning assistants and other administrative jobs — even though the city faced a deficit.
Brown suggested closing the deficit by allowing a casino to open in town but that idea was voted down after his council colleagues and residents complained that wasn't in the city's best interests.
The new mayor has traveled nearly every month since he was elected and, in many cases, took multiple trips a month. The travels were paid on a city credit card in Goodson's name, and were all approved by the city manager.
Brown took numerous short trips to Sacramento and the Bay Area without providing documentation about the city business involved. He also flew to Las Vegas for the International Council of Shopping Centers convention, and to Santa Barbara for the Independent Cities' Association winter seminar.
In late June, Brown went to Dallas for the 82nd annual meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. He stayed at the W Hotel and enjoyed expensive in-room meals and bar drinks. On June 21 and 22, he spent more than $250 on room service, drinks at the hotel's lounge, and pool service, according to city records.
He spent $234 on food and drinks during a July 24 stay at Sheraton San Diego Hotel & Marina.
From Oct. 29 to 31, he stayed at the W Hotel in New York City's Times Square and dined on more than $200 in sushi. Though there is no official reason for the trip listed in the city's expense reports, Goodson approved the trip and expenditures.
The city also paid $641 for Brown's two-night stay at Hyatt The Pike Long Beach from July 20 to 22.
While Brown was traveling the country, he was racking up big debts at home.
In November, he was evicted from a $2,350-a-month town house where he lived with his wife and two children after ignoring court orders to leave the premises. He then rented a $3,500-a-month two-bedroom, three-bathroom condominium at one of the city's nicest developments, ThreeSixty at Southbay.
He then promptly stopped paying rent and has refused to leave. Both landlords are seeking in court nearly $30,000 in arrears owed them.
Correction: An earlier version of this story erroneously reported the city paid for Mayor Chris Brown's wife, Hedako, to fly to Washington, D.C. for the U.S. Conference of Mayors. The city did not pay for airfare for Hedako Brown.

Every time India test-launches a new ballistic missile, officials from the defense industry go giddy about the next missile, which they say will be bigger, more accurate, fly longer, and carry more nuclear warheads.
Until now, all Indian ballistic missile types have carried only one warhead each, an important feature that has helped constrain India's so-called minimum deterrence posture.
But the newest missile, the 5000+ kilometer-range Agni V, had not even completed its second test launch last month, before senior officials from India's Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) declared that the next Agni variant will be equipped to carry multiple warheads.
While the single-warhead Agni V is a major defense weapon, the multiple-warhead Agni VI will be a “force multiplier,” declared the former head of DRDO.
Moreover, the DRDO chief said that all future missiles will be deployed in large canisters on a road- or rail-mobile launchers to get “drastically” shorter response time with an ability to launch in “just a few minutes.“
It still remains to be seen if these are just the dreams of excited weapons designers or if the Indian government has actually authorized design, development, and deployment of longer-range missiles with multiple warheads and quick-launch capability.
If so, it is bad news for South Asia. The combination of multiple warheads, increased accuracy, and drastically reduced launch time would indicate that India is gradually designing its way of out its so-called minimum deterrence doctrine towards a more capable nuclear posture.
This would almost certainly trigger counter-steps in Pakistan and China, developments that would decrease Indian security. And if China were to deploy multiple warheads on its missiles, it could even impede future reductions of U.S. and Russian nuclear forces.
MIRVforia
Indian defense contractors, engineers, analysts and news media reports have for years described efforts to develop multiple-warhead capability for India's ballistic missiles. Some have even claimed – incorrectly – that some current ballistic missiles are capable of delivering MIRV. A couple of definitions will help:
Multiple warhead (MRV – Multiple Reentry Vehicles) missiles deliver two or more warheads against the same target. The warheads all impact within a circle of a few kilometers around the target in order to destroy it more effectively.
Multiple Independently Targetable Reentry Vehicle (MIRV) missiles deliver two or more warheads against different targets. This requires a Post-Boost Vehicle, or bus, that can maneuver in space to release the reentry vehicles individually so that they follow different trajectories, allowing them to hit separate targets. Some MIRVs can hit targets separated by over 1,500 kilometers.
MRV is relatively simple to deploy but MIRV is a much more complex and expensive technology. News reports and private web sites rarely differentiate between the two but automatically equate multiple warheads with MIRV. Similarly, multiple payloads don't necessarily mean warheads but can involve penetration aids such as decoys or chaff. MRV might involve 2-3 warheads but 4 or more warheads imply MIRV.
For reasons that are still unclear, Indian defense industry officials have for several years described development of multiple warheads for future Agni variants. In 2007, about a year after Agni III failed its first test launch and before Agni V had even left the launch pad, Avinash Chander, who has since been appointed to head the DRDO, said the next Agni variant would have a range of over 5,000 kilometers and “be a multiple warhead missile with a capacity to carry four to 12 warheads.”
So far that hasn't happened and DRDO leaders have been unclear about what Agni version would receive the MIRV they are so busy working on. Vijay Kumar Saraswat, for example, made the following statement to NDTV shortly before he retired in May 2013 as DRDO chief:
“Saraswat: Agni Series of missiles are in an advanced stage of production. Today, as you remember, we have completed development of Agni I, Agni II, and Agni III. Agni IV and Agni V are in an advanced stage of development. And this year, you will see two more launches of Agni V, which will culminate its complete developmental activity and it will be led to production. Agni IV is already getting into production mode. So with this – Agni I, Agni II, Agni III, Agni IV, Agni V – getting into production mode, the next logical corollary as far as the long-range ballistic missile deterrents capability of this country is concerned, we will switch over to force multiplication. Force multiplication in the case of ballistic missiles will be by way of multiple independently manouevreable [sic] re-entry vehicles (MIRV). NDTV: Meaning one missile which can carry many warheads? Saraswat: Carry multiple warheads. Our design activity on the development and production of MIRV is at an advanced stage today. We are designing the MIRVs, we are integrating it with Agni IV and Agni V missiles, and that would also give us the capability to cover a vast area plus deliver in the event any activity requires a number of payloads at a required place. NDTV: So will the next test be with a multiple warheads system or… Saraswat: No. The present task, as I was mentioning, will be only with the normal configuration of Agni V. But there will be an experimental test in which we will be testing the MIRV capability. NDTV: So that would be what? Agni VI or… Saraswat: No we are not naming it Agni VI… it will be Agni V missile with MIRVs. NDTV: So Agni V plus? Saraswat: You can name is Agni V plus or Agni VI, but certainly it is not Agni VI. NDTV: It is not Agni VI but Agni V will have multiple warheads so we can have a single missile going and hitting several targets at the same time? Saraswat: Yes it will be in that category.”
But only three months earlier, Saraswat was quoted by numerous newspapers as explicitly crediting the Agni VI, not the Agni V, with multiple warhead capability: “Agni-V is a major strategic defence weapon. Now, we want to make Agni-VI, which will be a force multiplier.” The new Agni variant “will have force multiplier capability by the MIRV approach which would enable us to deliver many payloads at the same time using only one missile. Work is on in this area and designs have been completed. We are now in the hardware realisation phase,” he said.
ZeeNews quoted an unnamed “top scientists from DRDO” saying “Agni-VI missiles will carry four or six warheads depending upon their weight.”
After Agni IV and Agni V are handed over to the armed forces, DRDO's “two major focus areas will be maneuvering warheads or reentry vehicles to defeat enemy ballistic missile defence systems and MIRVs (multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles),” Chander said.
Shorter Launch Time
Ignore for the moment that none of India's potential adversaries have missile defense systems that can intercept Indian missiles, DRDO is also working on making the missiles more mobile and quicker to launch by deploying them in “canistered” Transportable Erector Launchers (TEL).
The new canister-launchers “will reduce the reaction time drastically…just a few minutes from ‘stop-to-launch',” according to Chander. “We are committed to making [the missiles] much more agile, much more fast-reacting, much more stable so that the response can be within minutes,” he said. In an interview with India Today, Chander explained: “In the second strike capability, the most important thing is how fast we can react,” he claimed and said: “All future strategic missiles will be canisterised,” with the first canister Agni V launch scheduled for early 2014.
Contrary to the DRDO chief's claim, however, “the most important thing” in a second-strike posture is not how fast India can react but simply that it can retaliate. The ability to launch quickly is only relevant for two scenarios: One, if India's adversaries have military forces that are capable of destroying Indian missile launchers on the ground before they can be used. China faces such a capability from the United States and Russia but neither China nor Pakistan has a capability to conduct a disarming first strike against India's nuclear forces.
The second scenario where a quick-strike capability could be relevant is if India planned to conduct a first strike against its adversaries, but only if the adversaries were able to detect preparations to strike. But planning for first strike would contradict India's no-first-use policy.
Nor is a quick-launch capability necessarily “more stable,” as Chander asserts. On the contrary, it could significantly decrease stability both in peacetime – by stimulating Chinese and Pakistani planners to further increase the responsiveness of their nuclear missiles – and in a crisis by shortening decision time and increasing risk of overreaction and escalation.
In addition to increasing warhead loading and responsiveness, DRDO is also working on improving the accuracy of warheads delivered by the missiles, although media reports about “pinpoint accuracy” are probably greatly exaggerated. Even the statement by the Ministry of Defense that the payload from the recent Agni V test reached the target area “within a few meters of accuracy” seems over the top. In contrast, back in 2007 when the Agni V was being designed, Chander said: “We are trying to attain an accuracy level of 100 metres.”
There is probably some overlap with conventional missions (the Agni missiles are dual-capable), but accuracy of 100 meters (300 feet) would bring Agni V well within range of the accuracy of the best U.S. and Russian ballistic missiles (in itself a reason to be skeptical). But their accuracy was pursued in support of highly offensive counterforce strategies designed to target and destroy each other's ICBM silos, missions that are incompatible with India's minimum deterrence doctrine.
Conclusions and Recommendations
Statements made by Indian defense officials over the past few years about increasing the payload, responsiveness, and accuracy of nuclear ballistic missiles are worrisome signs that India may be designing its way out of its minimum deterrence posture towards one with more warfighting-like capabilities.
This includes development of multiple-warhead capability to move India's nuclear missiles beyond “a defense weapon” to “a force multiplier” that can strike more targets with each missile. It includes upgrading launchers to “drastically” shorten the launch-time to “minutes.” And it includes increasing the accuracy of the reentry vehicles to more effectively strike their targets.
Where these requirements come from and who sets them is anyone's guess, but they demonstrate a need for the Indian government to constrain its weapons designers and more clearly reaffirm its adherence to a minimum deterrence doctrine. Not only does the combination of multiple warheads, increased accuracy, and quick-launch capability challenge the credibility of minimum deterrence. It also sends all the wrong signals about India's intensions and will almost inevitably trigger weapons developments in the nuclear postures of India's neighbors – developments that would decrease Indian security and that of the whole region.
India is, to be fair, not alone in taking worrisome nuclear steps in the region. Pakistan is developing short-range nuclear missiles envisioned for tactical use below the strategic level that appears to envision potential use of nuclear weapons sooner in a conflict. China is mixing nuclear and conventional missiles that could trigger misunderstandings in a crisis and researching MIRV capability that may well be motivating Indian planners to follow now rather than catch up later.
Together, India, Pakistan and China have embarked upon extensive nuclear arms development and deployment programs with no apparent or declared end in sight. They seem to be making many of the same decisions (and mistakes) as the United States, Russia, Britain and France did during their Cold War. Now it is necessary to complement the nuclear postures with nuclear arms control measures for the region to constrain the forces.
A first step could be to block deployment of multiple warheads on ballistic missiles to prevent what otherwise appears to be a dangerous new phase of the nuclear arms competition in the region.
For its part, the Indian government should make a pledge not to deploy multiple warheads on its missiles a formal part of its minimum deterrence doctrine. Pakistan could easily join such an initiative.
China should join its southern neighbor in a no-multiple-warhead pledge, which would reaffirm its existing minimum deterrence posture and also help reduce India's interest in multiple warheads. Moreover, a Chinese pledge not to deploy multiple warheads on its missiles would ease U.S. and Russian concerns about China's potential to “sprint to parity” and therefore help ease the way for further U.S. and Russian reductions – something that both Beijing and Delhi favor.
All sides would seem to benefit from banning multiple warheads on ballistic missiles and India could take the first and honorable step toward a safer future.

Theo Wargo via Getty Images Part of the power of "Hamilton" is the fact that the white founding fathers are played by ﻿non-white ﻿actors.
On Wednesday, a casting call for the Broadway juggernaut that is “Hamilton” drew criticism from members of the Actors' Equity theater union for specifying a need for “non-white” actors. To the union, and to many others in and outside of the theater world, the idea that the show would exclude white performers in its auditioning process is wrong: the auditions should be open for everyone.
OK, but no.
To be clear: from a legal standpoint, this is really a question of semantics. According to the rules of professional theatre, the use of “Non-” anything is considered discrimination. What they should have done was specified what races they wanted, not what race they did not want. That was their mistake.
However, criticizing the show's poorly-worded casting call is very different than criticizing the show's desire for actors of color. Because that is how casting calls work. Casting directors want to fill a specific role, a character with a certain height, a certain age, a certain hair color or, yes, a certain race ― and then they make a casting call that spells out all the details so that they only have to see actors who would actually work for the part.
And that's not to say that the system is inherently OK just because it's always worked this way. There is, of course, a case to be made for the importance of colorblind casting, the practice of choosing actors for parts based solely on their ability and not on race or ethnicity. And if you think about it, “Hamilton” is perhaps as colorblind as castings come ― when else would black and Latino actors get to play the Founding Fathers?
“What if they put an ad out that said, ‘Whites only need apply?'” --Man who has never seen a casting call before. https://t.co/kq3VYJJZG2 — Havilah McGinnis (@littlebirdwords) March 31, 2016
But what makes "Hamilton" work so well is the fact that it's a commentary on America's past through the prism of America's present, its future. It works because the historically white, male founding fathers are being played by a predominantly non-white cast of blacks and Latinos (there are also plans to cast women in the roles of men).
Now, what would the musical look like if Alexander Hamilton wasn't played by Lin-Manuel Miranda, and Aaron Burr wasn't played by Leslie Odom, Jr, but instead the characters were played by two capable, talented white actors? The show would likely still be entertaining, but the context and the conversation would change. It's like suggesting that "For Colored Girls..." or "The Color Purple" have an all-white cast. It's a completely different show.
This isn't a case of reverse racism. This isn't a case of people of color excluding white people despite bemoaning their own lack of inclusion in media. That's the whole point. "Hamilton" has created a space on Broadway for black and brown performers that otherwise wouldn't exist. Opening up roles designed specifically to be played by performers of color means encroaching on that space.
And no. The campaign for a black Spider-Man or a black James Bond cannot be equated to this. You can't scream "double-standard!" and suggest that having a white Spider-Man is just as integral to his story as having Lin-Manuel Miranda play Hamilton. Whiteness is not tied down to Spider-Man's character or his ever-evolving mythology. Neither is James Bond's.
But "Hamilton" is a musical that lives and breathes hip-hop. Its music and diverse cast, juxtaposed with the story of a country just beginning to find its voice, perfectly reflect the complex racial history and identity of America. That's integral to the story. That's a non-negotiable.
What's fascinating is the fact that so often there are casting-calls that exclude actors of color, and very rarely is there anyone calling out the producers or writers as racist. Or, some casting calls will be demeaning to actors of color -- remember when "Straight Outta Compton" perpetuated racial stereotypes about black women when it asked for "light-skinned, long haired" girls to play hot video vixens and dark-skinned actresses to play "poor, not in good shape" slobs?
On Thursday, the producers of "Hamilton" conceded, stating that the casting call will be changed to "welcome people of all ethnicities to audition" for the show. It makes sense why people would want a cultural phenomenon like "Hamilton," not to specify only non-white actors for the casting of some of its most key roles. A chance to be a part of the musical would be both career and history-making.
It's amazing that "Hamilton" has managed to capture the hearts and minds of so many people, but it's also important to remember that, at its core, the show is exploring the ways in which race, ethnicity, and nationality intersect. Just like Beyonce's "Formation" was enjoyed by all when it dropped in February, there was still the implicit understanding that what made it so unique was its inherent, unapologetic blackness. "Hamilton" is most definitely an inclusive show, an inclusive experience. But the fact of the matter is, quite frankly, not everything is about white people.
The mayor of Kansas City, Kansas, in an address to the radical socialist organization National Council of La Raza, bragged that his city is no longer majority white and the city's schools now have students who speak 62 different languages.
According to the 2010 U.S. Census, Kansas City, Kansas, was 52 percent white.
But in a speech before the La Raza National Affiliates Luncheon earlier this week in Kansas City, Mayor Mark Holland boasted that only five years later his city's white population has been reduced to 40 percent.
He seemed to suggest that La Raza was at least partly responsible for the progress. But he also cited the refugee resettlement work of the United Nations and U.S. State Department for the city's transformation into a gleaming example of multicultural diversity.
Kansas City, he said, “is very proud of the work of National Council of La Raza.”
“Kansas City, Kansas, is a city with no ethnic majority. Kansas City, Kansas, is 40 percent white, 28 percent Latino, and 26 percent African-American,” Holland said. “Our school district speaks 62 different languages by the children every single day. And Kansas City, Kansas, has a proud heritage of welcoming all people into the community, people who are not welcome in other places.”

Latinos started coming with the Santa Fe railroad more than 100 years ago, to build the railroad, he said. Another railroad, the Underground Railroad, brought African-Americans to Kansas. “If they could get across the river they were free and settled in a township of Quindero.”
“We continue to have a number of groups of refugees from around the world,” he added, mentioning the large Hmong community that came in the 1970s and 80s following the Vietnam War.
In recent years, the city has welcomed more refugees from other parts of the world, including Muslim Somalia, Afghanistan and Iraq, Hindus from Bhutan and Buddhists and Muslims from Burma.
LGBTs welcome in KC
Kansas City has also thrown open its arms to the LGBT community, Holland said, even though most of the state of Kansas leans Republican.
He said the city is the home of another “persecuted group – the Democrats.”
“The Democrats still have a foothold in Kansas City and we're very proud of that,” said the Democrat mayor. “And because Democrats are in Wyandotte County, we welcome our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters and celebrate their life and their love, and always will.”
Holland, an ordained Methodist minister, then went on the attack against any Christians who don't share his liberal theological views on same-sex marriage.
He applauded the recent 5-4 Supreme Court decision that redefined marriage for all 50 states.
“But we cannot let our guard down. This religious freedom component, I believe is the Confederate Flag of religious bigotry, being flown long after the fact,” Holland said. “As an ordained United Methodist pastor myself, I'm offended to note, when they say Christians are offended by the ruling. In fact, many of us Christians celebrate the ruling and the continued welcome and recognition of all people. But I want to close by saying we just couldn't be more proud that La Raza is here in Kansas City and it's an honor to be able to greet you.”
Police, fire departments lagging in diversity
In August 2014 Holland told city commissioners that the Kansas City police and fire departments were too white, reported KMBC-TV 9.
Holland said he was working with the U.S. Department of Justice to fix that problem and bring more diversity to the fire and police forces. He said he did not like the fact that only 40 percent of the city's population was white yet whites made up 72 percent of the police department and 82 percent of the fire department.
The theme of the recent La Raza conference in Kansas City was “Empower, Lead, Connect.”
The U.S. State Department, working with the United Nations, has sent 2,371 international refugees to Kansas City, Kansas, since 2002. The State Department's database does not include U.N. refugees dispersed throughout the U.S. before 2002 but the program has been ongoing in its current form since 1980. The U.N. picks about 95 percent of the refugees sent to the U.S. The State Department, working with nine major contractors such as the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society and Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, distributes about 70,000 refugees annually from mostly Third World nations into 190 U.S. cities and towns.

U.N. sends KC 2,371 refugees since 2002
The refugees, unlike most other classifications of immigrants, immediately qualify for a smorgasbord of state and federal welfare benefits and are placed on a fast-track toward full citizenship, which is obtainable within five years.
Since 2002 Kansas City has received 1,090 refugees from Burma, 577 from Bhutan, 190 from Somalia, 126 from Iraq, 47 from Liberia, 37 from Eritrea, 36 from Russia, 34 from Burundi, 33 from Afghanistan, 26 from Vietnam, 24 from Sudan, 18 from Uzbekistan, and 11 from Iran, according to State Department data.
The city's overall population has been in decline for four straight decades since reaching its peak of 168,000 in 1970, Census records show. By 2010 that population had fallen to 145,786. But, by using the refugee program and a general “welcoming” approach to all immigrants, the city has been able to recharge its population somewhat, with an estimated 149,636 residents as of 2014.

The smart fortwo electric drive proves that emission-free driving in an urban environment is already feasible today. The initial series production will begin now with 1,000 vehicles, the first of which will be delivered to customers by the end of this year. As of 2012, the smart fortwo electric drive will then be part of the regular product program of the smart brand. With our decision to locate production here at the parent plant in Hambach, we are setting the course both for series production of electric vehicles and for the future of this highly innovative assembly plant.
France is on a roll, it seems. Not long after announcing a $2.2 billion (1.5 billion Euros) investment in electric car charging stations , Daimler is announcing that it has selected a factory in Hambach, France, to mass produce its Smart Fortwo Electric Drive starting in 2012. Président Sarkozy (nice smile) was present for the announcement, and said that the French government would support the project with various measures adding up to about 15% of the costs.Dr. Dieter Zetsche, Chairman of the Board of Management of Daimler AG, made the announcement:

The Plano Real ("Real Plan",[1] in English) was a set of measures taken to stabilize the Brazilian economy in 1994, during the presidency of Itamar Franco. Its architects were led by the Minister of Finance and succeeding president Fernando Henrique Cardoso. The Plano Real was based on an analysis of the root causes of hyperinflation in the New Republic of Brazil, that concluded that there was both an issue of fiscal policy and severe, widespread inertial inflation. The Plano Real intended to stabilize the domestic currency in nominal terms after a string of failed plans to control inflation.
Background [ edit ]
According to economic academics, one of the causes of inflation in Brazil was the inertial inflation phenomenon. Prices were adjusted on a daily basis according to changes in price indices and to the exchange rate of the local currency to the U.S. dollar. Plano Real then created a non-monetary currency, the Unidade Real de Valor ("URV"), whose value was set to approximately 1 US dollar. All prices were quoted in these two currencies, cruzeiro real and URV, but payments had to be made exclusively in cruzeiros reais. Prices quoted in URV did not change over time, while their equivalent in cruzeiros reals increased nominally every day.
Solution [ edit ]
The Plano Real intended to stabilize the domestic currency in nominal terms after a string of failed plans to control inflation. It created the Unidade Real de Valor (Unit of Real Value), which served as a key step to the implementation of the new (and still current) currency, the real. At first, most academics tended not to believe that the Plan could succeed. Stephen Kanitz was the first public intellectual to predict the future success of the Real Plan.
A new currency called the real (plural reais) was introduced on 1 July 1994, as part of a broader plan to stabilize the Brazilian economy, substituting the short-lived cruzeiro real in the process. Then, a series of contracting fiscal and monetary policies was enacted, restricting the government expenses and raising interest rates. By doing so, the country was able to keep inflation under control for several years. In addition, high interest rates attracted enough foreign capital to finance the current account deficit and increased the country's international reserves. The government put a strong focus on the management of the balance of payments, at first by setting the real at a very high value relative to the U.S. dollar, and later (in late 1998) by a sharp increase on domestic interest rates to maintain a positive influx of foreign capitals to local currency bond markets, financing Brazilian expenditures.
Result [ edit ]
The real initially appreciated (gained value) against the U.S. dollar as a result of the large amount of capital inflows in late 1994 and 1995. It then began a gradual depreciation process, culminating in the 1999 January currency crisis, when the real suffered a maxi-devaluation, and fluctuated wildly. Following this period (1994–1999) of a quasi-fixed exchange rate, an inflation-targeting policy was instituted by new central bank president Arminio Fraga, which effectively meant that the fixed-exchange period was over. However, the currency was never truly "free", being more accurately described as a managed or "dirty" float, with frequent central bank interventions to manipulate its dollar price.
The currency's appreciation was crucial to keep inflation under control. Mainly, it assured the supply of cheap imported products to meet the domestic demand and forced domestic producers to sell at lower prices in order to maintain their market shares. This was especially important in the period immediately following the adoption of the new currency, when the sudden drop in inflation caused a surge in demand. The increased imports, therefore, were essential to avoid demand-side inflationary pressures that would undermine the stabilization plan.

In this screencast, Derek walks us through a couple of examples where traditional approaches to responsive content may actually hamper people from achieving their goals online. He proposes some alternative approaches that keep user experience top of mind.
One of the main benefits of responsive content is that it flexes to the browser's viewport width so it's easily consumed on different sized screens. But is this always the best approach? In some cases, scaling and flexibility may make the content harder to perceive. As always, it's important to consider how people actually use the content to achieve a goal or complete a task.
User experience is our gold standard for judging any solution's effectiveness.
In the following screencast, we take a look at two scenarios where approaching responsive content differently makes it simpler for users. The first example we look at is an image containing a lot of visual detail and information. The second, and our main focus, is tabular data where being able to compare different data points or ranges of data is important. While you're watching these demos, think about the impact that changing the display has on someone's ability to compare data.
Feel free to download the transcript (txt).
Comparison is key
While we can maintain at least some sense of semantics in a responsive layout for tables, making sure people can still compare data relationships is critical, especially in the following use cases:
Think of a person using a screen reader to compare a value in a cell to the value directly below in another cell. That might only take one keystroke in a full table, but when that same table is viewed responsively in a stack, that person may need to hunt a lot more to to get the same data. For someone with low vision who uses screen magnification, those same two adjacent table cells may now be hundreds or even thousands of pixels apart in a stacked layout. Someone who needs that visual two-dimensional grid to make sense of the data from a cognitive standpoint may really struggle trying to understand the data when we turn that table into stacked sets of name value pairs.
In cases where the visual display of something is fundamentally important to completing a task, we need to carefully consider how best to change the display (or perhaps not change the display) of that content. We're looking forward to testing these approaches on real sites with people with disabilities. In particular, we're curious about how the pop-out approach works for tasks like getting at details in a content image, or examining data points in a table.
Have you seen situations where a traditional responsive approach doesn't seem quite right? Or actually makes completing certain tasks more difficult? Share your experiences in the comments below.

The Seahawks will begin their defense of their Super Bowl championship at home against the Packers on Thursday, Sept. 4. It's one of four prime-time games on Seattle's 2014 regular-season schedule, which was announced Wednesday.
Another highlight is a Thanksgiving-night road game against the 49ers at brand-new Levi's Stadium. That will be the third and final game on the NFL's Thanksgiving slate, the NFL saving what has become the league's best rivalry for last. Seattle will host San Francisco two weeks later.
The Seahawks will host Denver in Week 3 in a rematch of Super Bowl XLVIII, and after a Week-4 bye they will travel to Washington to play the Redskins on “Monday Night Football”. Seattle's final prime-time game is against the Cardinals in Glendale, Ariz. in Week 16.
Seattle finishes the regular season at home against St. Louis for the third consecutive season.
Also of note: Seattle's schedule includes three games starting at 10 a.m. PST, only one of which (Week 8 at Carolina) is on the East Coast.
The complete schedule, with home games in bold:
As technology continues to grow by leaps and bounds each year, so does our human urge to reach the sky. When the Empire State Building was finished in 1931, it stood as the tallest building in the world for over 40 years. The Sears Tower in Chicago took up its reign for the next 25 years, but as you'll see from the list below, the fight for the tallest title has grown and all of the current top ten buildings have been built in the last 20 years. Even though the list is bound to change, let's take the time to appreciate the works of art that have managed to defy gravity and a nasty fear of heights.
A disclaimer: All of the buildings on this list have been completed. There are several buildings under construction that could land on this list, so much so that by the time I submit this article it may already be outdated, but I can't include them on this list until they have been stamped with “DONE.” Structures are measured to the top of their spires, not including antennas, and I have omitted towers and memorials. All of these structures are able to be inhabited.

10. Zifeng Tower — Nanjing, China — 1, 476 ft. — Completed: 2010
The Zifeng Tower, or Greenland Square Zifeng Tower, is one of the older buildings on our list, even though it was completed only four years ago. It sits in downtown Nanjing, only about two and a half hours away from Shanghai. Currently, Zifeng Tower functions as an office and hotel, complete with restaurants and retail shops, and even a public observatory.

9. Petronas Tower 1/Petronas Tower 2 — Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia — 1,483 ft. — Completed: 1998
On the second item and already a wrench has been thrown into the mix! Technically, 8th and 9th place belong to the twin Petronas Towers. (We'll let you decide which one is designated as 8th and 9th accordingly.) For six years, the Petronas Towers held the title of the Tallest, taking the title from the Sears Tower in 1998. Built as a testament to Kuala Lumpur's surge into the 21st century, the Petronas Towers were constructed using mostly reinforced concrete, instead of the usual (and more expensive) steel. Because of this, the Petronas Towers are heavier, but the concrete grants the building sway reduction. Throughout the design are several Islamic motifs, meant to connect the structures to Malaysia's Muslim religion.

8. International Commerce Centre — Hong Kong, Hong Kong — 1,588 ft. — Completed: 2010
Had the architects been able to stick to the original plans, the International Commerce Centre would actually sit at 1,883 feet, putting it at 4th on our list. However, due to regulations that buildings in Hong Kong could not be taller than the surrounding mountains (I repeat, taller than mountains), the construction had to be scaled back. If judging solely on floors, the ICC is the world's third tallest, but because the building doesn't have a spire like most of the buildings in the top ten, it comes in a bit shorter.

7. Shanghai World Financial Center — Shanghai, China — 1,614 ft. — Completed: 2008
The Shanghai World Financial Center was designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox, the architect firm that was also responsible for the International Commerce Centre in Hong Kong. The most interesting feature of the SWFC is its trapezoidal peak, with some even likening it to a bottle opener. However, it does allow for a truly unique design which includes three separate observation decks.

6. Taipei 101 — Taipei, Taiwan — 1,670 ft. — Completed: 2004
Taipei 101 held the Tallest title for six years, snatching it from the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur. Even though it has since lost that title, Taipei 101 is still considered the largest green building in the world, being awarded LEED Platinum certification in 2011. It is the only LEED-certified building on our list. The 101 floors were chosen intentionally, as a sign of the constant renewal of time. 100 is considered a perfect number, so by going one better, Taipei 101 sets a higher standard for all buildings and its home country.

5. Chow Tai Fook Centre (Guangzhou East Tower) — Guangzhou, China — 1,740 ft. — Expected completion date: 2016
The Guangzhou East Tower is one of the newest skyscrapers that are being constructed in… you guessed it, Guangzhou. It will be overlooking the Pearl River and is the second half of the Guangzhou Twin Towers (the first twin was completed earlier). Expected to be completed in 2016, the final height of this mega building is 1,740 ft! That's a whopping 111 floors!

4. One World Trade Center — New York City, USA — 1,776 ft. — Completed: 2013
The One World Trade Center is the only western structure on our list, and is the second newest. Also known as the Freedom Tower, the One World Trade Center sits on the site of the original 6 World Trade Center, and is meant to memorialize the attacks of September 11, 2001. The spire tops the building at 1,776 feet, another symbolic gesture, referencing the year the United States signed the Declaration of Independence.

3. Makkah Royal Clock Tower Hotel — Mecca, Saudi Arabia — 1,971 ft. — Completed: 2012
Also known as Abraj Al-Bait, the Makkah Royal Clock Tower Hotel holds several records, including being the world's largest clock tower. It was built to modernize the city for the pilgrims who come to visit the Masjid al-Haram and Kaaba every year. The Makkah Royal Clock Tower Hotel complex is so large that it can house over 100,000 people at once.

2. Shanghai Tower — Shanghai, China — 2,073 ft. — Completed: 2014
The Shanghai Tower is part of three skyscrapers that are meant to showcase the Lujiazui Financial district in Shanghai. The other two buildings are the Jin Mao Tower and Shanghai World Financial Center. (It seems Shanghai is monopolizing all the tall buildings.) Shanghai Tower is one of the world's most sustainable structures, using several green architecture constructs that allowed them to build with 25% less steel than most skyscrapers of a similar size.

1. Burj Khalifa — Dubai, UAE — 2,717 ft. — Completed: 2010
And here we are at the end! Towering almost 700 feet taller than its competition, the Burj Kalifa is part of Dubai's downtown renovation project, intended to bring a more modern look to the city. Like many of its predecessors on this list, the Burj Kalifa uses Islamic architecture (such as the spiral minaret) as a base for its sleek design. Being the tallest in the world, the Burj Khalifa is a go-to site for many experienced BASE jumpers. The building is so large that it takes 36 workers three to four months to clean the entire facade (not including the top 27 floors, which are cleaned by machine).
New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is demanding the Obama administration increase enforcement of the nation's gun laws, escalating his longtime push on the issue in the wake of the last month's shooting rampage in Arizona.
The mayor's office hired private investigators to buy guns at a gun show in Phoenix, and Bloomberg then played video of the sting at a press conference on Monday in New York. It depicts a man who is sold a gun even after he acknowledges that he would not be able to pass a background check, which would violate federal law.
It's not clear the ease of buying guns at these shows would have prevented the shootings in Tucson, as alleged killer Jared Loughner legally purchased a Glock 19 semiautomatic handgun from a gun store in November.
But Bloomberg has long advocated increased funding and attention to enforcing gun laws, arguing many crimes in New York City and other major cities involve the use of guns by people who should not be allowed to purchase them because of criminal records.
And he is now on a media blitz to push Obama on the issue. The White House has said Obama will soon "address" the issue of gun control, but it has been vague on exactly what he will say or whether he will propose any additional funding or new laws.
"The president should stand up" on gun issues, Bloomberg said in an appearance Tuesday on "The Rachel Maddow Show." He added, "It's one of the issues he can build a legacy on."
Obama today
The president will sign the START nuclear weapons treaty with Russia that he strongly pushed in November and December. He will also hold a private meeting in the Oval Office with one of his strongest opponents, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). Aides said the pair will speak about a broad range of issues.
Happy talk
Outside of Obama's very serious words about Egypt, the White House has adopted an optimistic tone, while leaving Republicans to sound the alarm about problems such as the growing deficit. Here's a look at the difference in rhetoric by John Dickerson of Slate:
"Now, instead of tough talk, the president is offering stirring slogans. 'Win the future' was the theme of his State of the Union address. 'We do Big Things' is now on T-shirts available to Obama donors. 'Startup America' was unveiled Monday to encourage entrepreneurs. If the first lady hadn't taken "Let's Move" for her anti-obesity campaign, it could have been used for the president's push for high-speed rail.
"The president has decided that he'll let Republicans be the dour ones. A credible deficit-reduction plan is no longer a precondition for weeks of talk about plans for government investment. Let Rep. Paul Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee, do all that gloomy talking about the grim fiscal picture. As one GOP aide put it after the president's State of the Union speech and Ryan's official response: 'He's the optimistic one, and we're the ones that want to lock up your children.' "
India has urged the IITian diaspora to invest in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Startup India campaign to promote a culture of innovation in its ancestral land.
Speaking at the 2016 International Conference of the IIT Alumni Canada which brought over 400 IITians from the US, Canada and Australia to Toronto, Indian Consul General Dinesh Bhatia urged the IITian diaspora to make the Startup India campaign a success.
India is now an over $2 trillion economy and there are huge offers huge opportunities for IITians to become part of its success story, Bhatia told the techie conference, which, this year, is focused on “Towards a Sustainable and Prosperous Future: Focus on Technology, Health and Environment”.
Canadian Science Minister Kirsty Duncan, MPs, and mayors joined in welcoming the IITian gathering which also included the director of IIT-Hyderabad and the deans of IITs in Mandi and Chennai.

Duncan, who was dressed in a sari for the occasion, lauded the role of the IITians in promoting innovation and entrepreneurship in Canada. She said the theme of the conference is in tune with agenda of the Canadian government, which wants to promote innovation and entrepreneurship.
Linda Jaffrey, mayor of the Indian-dominated city of Brampton on the outskirts of Toronto, invited the IITians to become partners in the progress of her city which is one of the fastest growing in Canada.
One of the highlights of the conference was a live toy-making demonstration by India's famous IITian Arvind Gupta who chucked his job with Tatas in 1978 to promote the love of science and innovation among India's underprivileged children.
Showing his fellow IITians how he engages poor children by turning discarded household items -- such as newspapers, matchboxes, broom sticks, rubber slippers, electric bulbs, film roll box, and pencil boxes -- into toys, Gupta made an impassioned plea to the IITian diaspora to contribute to the education of India's poor children.
Conference co-chair Raghu Nayak said” “IITians stand for innovation and these bright brains at the conference have highlight how we can integrate innovation to solve global problems of poverty, diseases and pollution. Since technology caused most of the current problems facing mankind, we think it is the technology that will solve these problems.”
Canada is home to over 1,000 hugely successful IITians, including billionaire Prem Watsa who is called the Warren Buffett of Canada.

WWE News: First Raw of 2014 has a theme
Dec 24, 2013 - 03:51 PM WWE is advertising the January 6 Raw television show as "Old School Raw." The show will be held in Baltimore, Maryland at Baltimore Arena. [Thanks to Dot Net reader Danny Mays]
Powell's POV: It seems a little odd to me to open the new year with the Old School theme, but WWE usually makes those shows fun. The dark main event of the show is listed as John Cena vs. Randy Orton for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship with Booker T as special referee.

NEW DELHI: India's oldest warhorse may now be creaking at all her numerous joints but she is still game for a show of strength, a wee bit of power projection on the high seas for the last time. The 56-year-old aircraft carrier INS Viraat has now set sail for what will be her last operational deployment.The 28,000-tonne INS Viraat, which embarked six Sea Harrier jump-jets as well as six Sea King and four Chetak helicopters from Goa on Wednesday, is headed for Visakhapatnam to take part in the International Fleet Review (IFR) from February 5 to 8.“This will be INS Viraat's last journey, a cross-coast deployment signalling the end of her yeoman service for India before she is retired later this year. On her way back to Mumbai, she will call on all major Indian ports as a final salute,” said a senior officer on Wednesday.Originally commissioned in the British Royal Navy as HMS Hermes in November 1959, the 13-storey high carrier was inducted into the Indian Navy as INS Viraat on May 12, 1987. “Mother”, as she is still affectionately called, packed quite a punch in her days of glory. She represented two acres of sovereign Indian territory cruising on the high seas, ready to unleash her fighters and other weapons against enemies in a jiffy.With age and high maintenance costs, the world's oldest operational aircraft carrier has lost most of its teeth. But the Navy has managed to cannibalize together six Sea Harrier jump-jets, which are always a sight to watch since they land vertically on the warship deck after taking off from its angled ski-jump.Commanded by Captain Puneet Chadha, INS Viraat will be joined by the country's other carrier, the 44,570-tonne INS Vikramaditya with her integral MiG-29K fighters, for the IFR. But INS Vikramaditya, or the refurbished Admiral Gorshkov acquired from Russia in late 2013 after a $2.33 billion refits, will have to soldier alone as the country's solitary carrier after that.The 40,000-tonne indigenous aircraft carrier or INS Vikrant being built at Cochin Shipyard will be ready for induction only by 2018-2019 at the earliest. India will then achieve its long-standing aim to have two fully-perational “carrier battle or strike groups" (CBGs), with their accompanying fighters, patrol aircraft, destroyers, submarines frigates and tankers.CBGs project raw combat power like nothing else. The US has 11 Nimitz-class nuclear-powered “super-carriers”, each over 94,000-tonne and capable of carrying 80-90 fighters, deployed around the globe.China, too, is fast building new carriers after inducting the 65,000-tonne Liaoning in September 201, even as it is develops “long legs” with naval deployments spreading to the Indian Ocean and beyond.As reported by TOI earlier, the defence ministry has sought a response from all nine maritime states if any one of them has “a workable proposal” to convert INS Viraat into a docked museum. The Navy is even willing to hand over a few old aircraft for display on its deck to make it a first-class museum.The Navy does not want INS Viraat to go the way of INS Vikrant, the country's first aircraft carrier that was acquired from the UK in 1961 and later decommissioned in 1997.

He is, after all, your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man.
Lucy Day, who's pregnant with her second child, was rushing her partner, Stephen Grant, to the hospital when he had an accident that saw his finger cut off from a lawnmower. However, the car they were driving in suddenly caught on fire.
Pulling off and in the middle of nowhere, a man dressed in full Spider-Man attire and complete with mask, stopped beside them and rendered assistance. “I did think it was a bit strange, but in the heat of the moment I wasn't really thinking about it," explained Lucy following the incident.
The Spider-Man in question was Tom Roche, a children's entertainer who was heading to a party for work and saw the car catch fire. "We could smell unburnt petrol and could see smoke pouring out from under the car.... She was saying ‘we need to go to hospital', so we drove over there as quick we could."
All this happened while Tom was dressed in a full-latex Spider-Man costume. Tom, who was travelling with his girlfriend, brought the couple to the A&E in the nearby hospital where they were looked after and Tom headed off to the kids' party. "We are so grateful for their help. He was only a young guy and I think he was a bit shaken up by the whole thing. I really want him to know how much it meant."
It's all in a day's work for Not Spider-Man, folks.

The Orlando Magic had their most proactive offseason in over half a decade this summer, but how much have they improved their roster for the future?
With five straight seasons of finishing bottom of their division and no All-Star level talent emerging from their numerous draft pics, the Orlando Magic had to shake things up this summer.
They did just that, and moved quickly to can previous general manager Rob Hennigan mere days after the regular season ended.
In came respected GM John Hammond, formerly of the Milwaukee Bucks, and new president of basketball operations Jeff Weltman, who spent the previous four years with the Toronto Raptors.
Despite remaining quiet in the lead up to the NBA Draft, once they took Jonathan Isaac with the sixth pick, moves came at a more rapid pace. Here we grade each move for the team.
[Steve Collins] is a regular around Hackaday. He's brought homebrew LIDARs to our regular meetups, he's given a talk on a lifetime's worth of hacking, and he is the owner of the most immaculate Hackaday t-shirt we've ever seen.
For the 2016 Hackaday SuperConference, [Steve] took a break from his day job of driving spacecraft around the Solar System. As you can imagine, NASA plans on things going wrong. How do you plan for that? [Steve] answers all your questions by telling you what happens when things go wrong in space.
Space is the worst possible place for hardware. Not only do you have temperature swings of hundreds of degrees, solar radiation, and limited bandwidth, but you also can't fix a space probe once it's in orbit. Anyway you look at it, everything needs to go perfectly or you need to be exceptionally clever. Muphry's Law will inevitably crop up to defeat the former, leaving the latter par for the course. This is what it's like to work at the Jet Propulsion Lab.
Most satellites that go up are, surprisingly, very standardized. GPS satellites are built around a two or three common ‘busses', or models. When a company wants to launch a few dozen communications satellites, the first one-off the pad won't be much different from the last. Whenever SpaceX gets around to launching four thousand of their low orbit Internet satellites, all of those birds are going to be the same.
Deep space satellites are completely different. Each one is a custom build, and the best examples of twin deep space probes – Spirit and Opportunity on Mars, and Voyager 1 and 2 – are the exception rather than the rule. A unique piece of hardware flying around the Solar System presents a few challenges for the hardware designers. Power is always an issue, you need to plan for redundancy, and every piece of hardware needs some sort of fault protection system. Everything is a challenge in designing a deep space probe, and you need to plan for every contingency.
This is the theory of designing hardware that has to work perfectly in the worst environment imaginable, but how about some practical examples of what to do when things go wrong in space?
Throughout [Steve]'s storied career, he's been a part of a lot of NASA missions. In the 90s, one of his jobs was planning the Deep Space 1 mission. This was a mission to a comet done on the cheap — only about $150 Million – used to demonstrate up and coming technologies like ion propulsion. While in the planning stages, [Steve] and his colleagues discussed what could go wrong. Since this was a very inexpensive mission, only one-star tracker was flown on this tiny satellite.
This star tracker is important, as it's the only thing on the spacecraft that tells the computer where it's pointing. In the planning stages, [Steve] discussed what would happen if that star tracker died. The hypothetical solution to this problem used the science camera to point at a single star and determine the probe's orientation. This solution sat around in the back of [Steve]'s mind for a few years until — you guessed it — the star tracker died. It wasn't pretty, but the hack of using a science camera to determine the spacecraft's orientation worked.
That's a sample of what happens when things go wrong in space. What happens when things go right? Check out the video below. That's a car, landing on Mars, with the help of a rocket-powered crane. It's Curiosity dropping into Gale crater, and [Steve] was in the control room for this astonishing feat of engineering. He'll be doing it again in late 2020, and with this guy at the helm we shouldn't have much to worry about.
Prefecture-level city in Shandong, People's Republic of China
Weihai (Chinese: 威海; pinyin: Wēihǎi), formerly called Weihaiwei (Weihai Guard) (traditional Chinese: 威海衞; simplified Chinese: 威海卫; pinyin: Wēihǎiwèi), is a city in eastern Shandong province, China. It is the easternmost prefecture-level city of the province and a major seaport. Weihai borders Yantai to the west and the Yellow Sea to the east.
Weihai's population was 2,804,771 as of the 2010 census. Amongst them, 844,310 lived in the current built-up (metro) area (Huancui district) even though Wendeng district is soon being conurbated. Rongcheng, a county-level city within Weihai, has a built-up area with 714,355 inhabitants. A subway is planned with 4 lines and 204,6 km to link all city districts. The first phase, Line 1 and 2 is planned for 2025.
Between 1898 and 1930, the city was part of the British leased territory of Weihaiwei; during this time, the city itself was known as Port Edward and served as the capital of Weihaiwei.[1]
History [ edit ]
Weihaiwei was the base for the Beiyang Fleet during the Qing Dynasty. In 1895, the Japanese captured it in the Battle of Weihaiwei, which is regarded as the last major battle of the First Sino-Japanese War. The Japanese then evacuated on 24 May 1898, when it was then occupied by the British.[2] Since 2003, the Chinese battleship Dingyuan has been anchored here as a museum ship and memorial honouring Chinese personnel who fought in that war.
Weihaiwei was under British rule from 1 July 1898, under lease agreement with the Chinese empire, until 1930, with 'Port Edward' (Weihaiwei city) as capital. A Royal Navy base was built on Liugong Island. Weihaiwei became a special administrative region after it was returned to the Republic of China in 1930,[3] but Liugong Island and its facilities were leased back to the U.K. until 1940.[2]
In 1938, the Roman Catholic Independent Mission of Weihai was promoted to Apostolic Prefecture of Weihai but it has been vacant (dormant) since 1970.[4] Weihaiwei was occupied by the Japanese from 1938 to 1945.[5] There was a withdrawal of most British forces and supplies from Liugong Island, and finally a Japanese military landing and occupation of the island in 1940.[6]
The region was formally incorporated into Shandong province on 10 May 1945.[5] In 1949, Weihaiwei City was established, and its name was shortened to Weihai after the Communist revolution.
Economy [ edit ]

Its nearest port is Weihai Port, and the airport closest to the zone is Wuhai Airport.[7]
Weihai Export Processing Zone (EPZ) was set up by the approval of the State Council on April 27, 2000. Weihai EPZ is located in Weihai Economic & Technological Development Zone with programmed area of 2.6 km2 (1.0 sq mi). Weihai EPZ belongs to comprehensive export & processing zone. The EPZ is located 30 km (19 mi) from Weihai Airport, 3 km (1.9 mi) to Weihai Railway Station and 4 km (2.5 mi) from Weihai Harbor.[8]
Weihai Torch Hi-Tech Science Park is a state-level development zone approved by the State Council on March 1991. Located in Weihai's northwest zone of culture, education and science, the Park has the total area of 111.9 km2 (43.2 sq mi), a coastline of 30.5 km (19.0 mi) and 150,000 residents. It is 3 km (1.9 mi) away from the city center, 4 km (2.5 mi) away from Weihai Port, 10 km (6.2 mi) away from Weihai Railway Station, 30 km (19 mi) away from Weihai Airport and 80 km (50 mi) away from Yantai Airport.[9]
Transportation [ edit ]
Weihai Dashuibo Airport serves the city with regular service to Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Harbin domestically and the Korean cities of Seoul and Pusan, as the fourth busiest airport in Shandong following Qingdao, Jinan and Yantai.
Qingdao–Rongcheng intercity railway offers the high-speed rail services directly to Shanghai Hongqiao, Beijing South, Jinan, Jimo North (Qingdao North soon) and Yantai, with five rail stations, Weihai, Weihai North, Wendeng, Wendeng East and Rongcheng.
As for conventional rail services, The K8262 train depart every day at and 10:18 PM respectively for Jinan, the provincial capital, the K412 goes directly to Beijing at 8:54 PM, and the No. K1068 train leaves at 9:38 AM for Hankou, one of the three railway stations of Wuhan, Hubei. Internally, the city is served by more than 50 bus routes.
Administrative divisions [ edit ]
The prefecture-level city of Weihai administers four county-level divisions, including two districts and two county-level cities.
These are further divided into 66 township-level divisions, including 52 towns and 14 subdistricts.

Weihai is located on the north-eastern seashore of Shandong, and its administrative area includes Chengshantou (成山头), the eastern tip of the Shandong Peninsula (or Shantung Peninsula). The city is surrounded by sea on three sides and its harbour is protected by Liugong Island.
Weihai lies in the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen Cwa) in terms of latitude, but as it is at the eastern end of the Shandong Peninsula, its climate is strongly influenced by the surrounding Yellow Sea as well as the Siberian high and therefore experiences a humid continental climate. Springtime warming and autumn cooling are delayed by one month, winds are generally high, and the average diurnal temperature variation throughout the year is small—at only 6.73 °C (12.1 °F). Winters are cold and dry, but still warmer than inland places located at the same latitude; the average temperature in January is −0.9 °C (30.4 °F). Summers are hot and humid, and August averages 24.7 °C (76.5 °F); the annual mean is 12.48 °C (54.5 °F). More than two-thirds of the annual precipitation occurs from June to September, and there are nearly 2,540 hours of sunshine per year.

Earlier this week, security research firm FireEye pointed to a flaw that it called Masque Attack, which could allow malicious apps to be installed on iOS devices, replacing official third-party apps to mine data.
Apple has now responded to the issue. In a statement to iMore, it says: “We designed OS X and iOS with built-in security safeguards to help protect customers and warn them before installing potentially malicious software. We're not aware of any customers that have actually been affected by this attack.
“We encourage customers to only download from trusted sources like the App Store and pay attention to any warnings as they download apps. Enterprise users installing custom apps should install apps from their company's secure website.”
So there you have it: you'd need to ignore all the built-in security features to be caught by the Masque Attack.

LAWRENCE, Mass. - A heartbreaking video has gone viral showing a 2-year-old child screaming in despair after her mother overdoses and collapses in a store aisle.
The child is seen pulling her mother's limp body in the video taken Sunday.
According to the person taking the video, the woman's eyes were rolling into the back of her head.
First responders were able to revive the woman with two doses of Narcan, a drug used to block opioids like heroin or fentanyl and can reverse the effects of an overdose.
Police found drug paraphernalia in the mother's bag and believe she overdosed on a oral dose of heroin.
The woman is being charged with child endangerment while her daughter has been placed in protective custody and the video is now being used as evidence.
Officials are also condemning the person who shot the video for not helping the child.

An electric car has been tested that managed a huge 1,100 mile range on a single charge. A massive jump from current electric cars like the Tesla Model S which tops out at around 300 miles.
The secret to this super range is a type of battery technology called aluminium-air. This uses oxygen naturally occurring in the air to fill its cathode. This makes it far lighter than liquid filled lithium-ion batteries to give car a far greater range.
Phinergy, who created the battery, is an Israeli company who worked with aluminium specialist Alcoa Canada to create the batteries. To keep costs low the batteries were made in Canada where hydro-electricity is rife, making manufacturing more affordable.
Aluminium-air batteries drain turning the metal into aluminium hydroxide which can then be recycled to make new batteries. That will mean swapping out batteries every few months. But since it's so much lighter and cheaper than current efforts it should offer huge mileage and be affordable.
Tesla has already demoed its battery swap-out service which would automatically do it in just 90-seconds. All the drivers would need to do would be to add tap water every month or two to help feed the reaction.
The test car used also had lithium-ion batteries working in a sort of hybrid battery. The proposed end result would be a car that uses lithium-ion for short range drives and has the aluminium-air battery kick in for long hauls. This would preserve the life of both batteries while keeping weight down and maximising range.
It may still be a while before we see these batteries in cars but at the rate Tesla is moving anything is possible.

“The North Koreans are now using the propaganda in an extreme form to try to damage foreign direct investments into South Korea,” said Thomas L. Coyner, a member of the American Chamber of Commerce in Korea and the author of “Doing Business in Korea.” “They are, in a sense at this point, winning in an asymmetrical psychological warfare, attacking the economic strength of South Korea.”
John Delury, an American who teaches at Yonsei University in Seoul, said that the economic impact of the conflict posed a “serious challenge” to President Park, who was elected on promises to bolster the economy and build trust with the North.
“The relentless show of force on a daily basis by not just North Korea but also the U.S. and South Korea as part of their annual military exercises has captured the attention of the world, and made the Korean Peninsula a place associated not with ‘Gangnam Style' but with nuclear weapons and stealth bombers,” Mr. Delury said.
And even though many analysts and diplomats believe the North will not follow through on its most dangerous threats — pre-emptive strikes against the United States and South Korea — he noted that the continuing alarm could still cause problems.
“Markets hate risk, even if it is the perception rather than reality of risk,” Mr. Delury added.
South Korea's economy has suffered far worse disruptions, most recently during a global financial meltdown in 2008, and proved resilient. But the conflict is an additional drag on the economy at an inopportune time.
The once-supercharged economy took a blow in 2011, during the global financial downturn, when the growth rate dropped to 3.6 percent from 6.2 percent in 2010. It has since slowed further, in part because of China's increasing power as an exporter and, more recently, as the weakened Japanese yen allowed Japan's exports to better compete with South Korea's. The government revised its growth forecast for this year to 2.3 percent from 3 percent.
In a report on Friday, Citi Research said that “barring an outbreak of wide-scale military conflict, we think North Korean brinkmanship will not impact the South Korean economic fundamentals.” Thomas J. Byrne and Steffen Dyck at Moody's Investors Service expressed similar views last week, but also warned of “a heightened risk of military adventurism or miscalculation by the 30-something Kim Jong-un.”
Let's get things kicked off for a fresh morning of trading in the bitcoin price. Action overnight was pretty volatile. We set up against price with a relatively wide range, but despite this width, we still saw numerous entry points as price ran up and down through our respective key levels. For the session today, we are going to attempt to emulate last night's approach. That is, we are setting up against price with a slightly wider range than normal on a narrower timeframe chart and we will look to get in and out of the markets according to the rules of our intraday strategy at numerous breakpoints during the session.
So, with this noted, and as we kick things off for the start of the European session, here is a look at where we are looking to get in and out of the markets. As ever, take a quick look at the chart below before we get started to get an idea of what is on and what happened overnight to bring us to the current point. It is a three-minute candlestick chart (as we said, this is a slightly narrower timeframe than we normally use) and it has our key range overlaid in blue.
As the chart shows, the range we have in focus right now is defined by support to the downside at 2300 and resistance to the upside at 2339. Standard breakout rules apply today, so we will be in long on a close above resistance towards an immediate upside target of 2355. Conversely, a close below support will have us into a short trade towards a downside target of 2280. A stop loss on both trades is necessary to ensure that we are taken out the positions in the event of a bias reversal, and somewhere in the region of five dollars either side of entry looks good to that aim.

Humans produce more than 300 million metric tons of plastic every year. Almost half of that winds up in landfills, and up to 12 million metric tons pollute the oceans. So far there is no sustainable way to get rid of it, but a new study suggests an answer may lie in the stomachs of some hungry worms.
Researchers in Spain and England recently found that the larvae of the greater wax moth can efficiently degrade polyethylene, which accounts for 40 percent of plastics. The team left 100 wax worms on a commercial polyethylene shopping bag for 12 hours, and the worms consumed and degraded about 92 milligrams, or roughly 3 percent, of it. To confirm that the larvae's chewing alone was not responsible for the polyethylene breakdown, the researchers ground some grubs into a paste and applied it to plastic films. Fourteen hours later the films had lost 13 percent of their mass—presumably broken down by enzymes from the worms' stomachs.
When inspecting the degraded plastic films, the team also found traces of ethylene glycol, a product of polyethylene breakdown, signaling true biodegradation. Their findings were published earlier this year in Current Biology.
Study co-author Federica Bertocchini, a biologist at Spain's Institute of Biomedicine & Biotechnology of Cantabria, says the larvae's ability to break down their dietary staple—beeswax—also allows them to degrade plastic. “Wax is a complex mixture of molecules, but the basic bond in polyethylene, the carbon-carbon bond, is there as well,” she explains. “The wax worm evolved a mechanism to break this bond.”
Jennifer DeBruyn, a microbiologist at the University of Tennessee, who was not involved in the study, says it is not surprising that an organism evolved the capacity to degrade polyethylene. But compared with previous studies, she finds the speed of biodegradation in this one exciting. The next step, DeBruyn says, will be to pinpoint the cause of the breakdown. Is it an enzyme produced by the worm itself or by its gut microbes? Bertocchini agrees and hopes her team's findings might one day help harness the enzyme to break down plastics in landfills, as well as those scattered throughout the ocean. But she envisions using the chemical in some kind of industrial process—not simply “millions of worms thrown on top of the plastic.”
Just a heads-up. With the system implemented in Star Wars: Battlefront 2, it will take you quite a big wallet, or tons of free gaming time on your hand, to unlock the whole game.
Here is the break down:

Notes
I'm assuming that all cards are already possessed, are at level 3, and that the player has 0 credits and crafting parts left over. I'm also assuming that all one time rewards but you can get a William Hill promo code here. (challenges and level rewards) were used while getting the cards to level 3, so they are not factored in.
Cards from loot crates are assumed to be level 1 55% of the time, level 2 40% of the time, and level 3 5% of the time. Duplicate credit values are assumed to be 200 for a level 1, 400 for a level 2, and 600 for a level 3, this makes the average card level 1.5 and makes the average duplicate worth 300 credits. Loot crates are assumed to provide an average of 2 cards. Crafting parts are assumed to average 50. This makes the value of a crate (once you have every card in the game) worth 600 credits and 50 crafting parts. The credits are accounted for by reducing the cost of hero crates from 2,200 to 1,600.
The cost of upgrading a level 3 card to a level 4 card is 480 crafting parts. Only hero crates are bought because they are the cheapest source of crafting parts.
Players earn credits at a rate of 1,100 credits per hour.
Loot crates required are rounded up. All totals for gameplay hours are rounded to the nearest whole number.
This estimate ignores the time required to get all cards to level 3, the time required to unlock all heroes, and daily crates.
Troopers
There are 17 cards for each of the 4 base troopers. This totals 68 cards and will require 32,640 crafting parts. This will require opening 653 loot crates which will require 950 hours of gameplay (238 hours for a single base trooper class).
Enforcers
The enforcer class type has 5 cards. Upgrading This requires 2,400 crafting parts. This will require opening 48 loot crates which will require 70 hours of gameplay.
Aerial
The aerial class type has 5 cards. Upgrading This requires 2,400 crafting parts. This will require opening 48 loot crates which will require 70 hours of gameplay.
Armor
The armor class type has 6 cards. Upgrading these will require 2,880 crafting parts. This will require opening 58 loot crates which will require 84 hours of gameplay.
Speeder
The speeder class 6 cards. Upgrading these will require 2,880 crafting parts. This will require opening 58 loot crates which will require 84 hours of gameplay.
Starfighters
Each of the three starfighter classes has 9 cards. This totals 27 cards which requires 12,960 crafting parts. This will require opening 260 loot crates which will require 378 hours of gameplay (126 hours for a single starfighter class).
Heroes
There are 14 infantry heroes with 9 cards and 9 starfighter heroes with 9 cards. This totals 207 cards. Upgrading these will require 99,360 crafting parts. This will require opening 1,988 loot crates and will require 2,892 hours of gameplay (126 hours for a single hero).
Grand Total
There is a grand total of 324 cards. Upgrading these will require a total of 155,520 crafting parts. This requires opening a grand total of 3,111 loot crates which will require 4,528 hours of gameplay.
Final cost in crystals
The 600 credits received from a hero crate is worth 27% the cost of a hero crate. This is equivalent to 30 crystals. To account for this, I reduced the cost of a hero crate from 110 crystals to 80 crystals. 12,000 crystals can be bought for $100.
Opening the required 3,111 loot crates requires 248,880 crystals. If you only purchase $100 crystal packs, this will cost $2,100.

.- Leaked emails from the Democratic National Committee show efforts to arrange a meeting with a key NGO working to end religious liberty protections.
The emails were among thousands that surfaced on the website WikiLeaks July 22. The leak included emails to and from several DNC lead staffers during the period from January 2015 to May 25, 2016.
Two May 16 emails from DNC lead staffers, titled “Who do you want at the religious exemption research meeting?”, discuss a presentation from the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBT advocacy group which has challenged religious freedom protections as harmful.
The emails follow up on an April 11 email from Mike Gehrke, vice president of the Benenson Strategy Group consulting firm, to DNC communications director Luis Miranda and Mark Paustenbach, the DNC's deputy communications director and national press secretary.
Gehrke said his colleague Amy Levin has been working with the Movement Advancement Project “over the past couple years” to develop “messaging and creative executions around religious exemptions laws” such as Religious Freedom Restoration Acts.
Religious Freedom Restoration Acts and other provisions have provided key protections for Catholics and other religious organizations against laws that would otherwise require them to violate their religious and moral beliefs.
The broad email leak resulted in the resignation of DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz following controversy over revelations of apparent collusion against Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.).
The leak has also revealed the influence of other political actors.
Gehrke's email to the DNC communications officers said the Movement Advancement Project's research on religious freedom messaging has “some interesting findings on talking about the issue.” The project “would very much like to share it with you all and anyone you think would find it useful,” he said.
He added that Levin would be “making the rounds” in the District of Columbia and would like to set up a time “for a briefing with those who might benefit from this messaging work.”
Miranda responded April 11: “Hi Mike, that sounds interesting and helpful.” He copied DNC press assistant Rachel Palermo “to help coordinate and include others from our political and community engagement teams.”
The Movement Advancement Project plays a role in a multi-million dollar effort to counter religious freedom protections. The project has close links with Tim Gill, a wealthy Colorado-based businessman who for decades has organized and funded a politically savvy LGBT activism campaign through his Gill Foundation.
CNA research into foundation grant listing and tax forms has found a massive effort using at least $5 million in strategic spending to target religious freedom protections. The funding comes from several influential foundations including the Gill Foundation, the Ford Foundation and the Arcus Foundation.
The Movement Advancement Project has received specific grants targeting religious exemptions. In 2014, the Arcus Foundation gave $100,000 to the Gill Foundation to support the project's “research and messaging on religious exemptions.” The Evelyn & Walter Hass Haas Jr. Fund made $100,000 grant to the Gill Foundation in 2014 to support the project's work, including “research to develop messaging around gay rights and ‘religious liberty' issues.”
That messaging research may also influence Democratic Party leaders, the leaked emails suggest.
Levin followed up in an April 12 message to Miranda, the DNC's communication director: “glad to hear you are interested. We've been able to do a really deep dive with this research which, once all synthesized [and] boiled down, led to very clear (if sometimes surprising!) message and target imperatives.”
On May 16, Palermo asked Miranda who he wanted at the religious exemption research meeting. Miranda replied “Mark, Tom, and Marilyn Davis.” Davis is the DNC's director of community engagement, while Mark Paustenbach was copied on Palermo's email.
Gehrke's April 11 message said that the research to be presented to the DNC leaders was a 501c3 project “independent of any of the message work we have done on campaigns.” He said no candidate or specific situation would be presented.
CNA searches of the DNC e-mails published by WikiLeaks did not reveal further discussion on the meeting with the Movement Advancement Project.
A spokesperson for the Movement Advancement Project told CNA July 26 that Benenson Strategy Group is “a contract researcher that has done work with MAP.” It had arranged the meeting to share recommendations from its messaging guidance “Talking about Religious Exemption Laws.”
“Further information around the messaging recommendations can be found in the guide,” the spokesperson said.
“MAP does not have a relationship with the DNC beyond being invited as a guest to that meeting. MAP also provides messaging briefings to a myriad of allies on both sides of the political aisle,” the spokesman continued.
The Movement Advancement Project has published several editions of its messaging guidance, which lists as partners both Benenson Strategy Group and the Center for American Progress. The guide's 2016 edition aims to build “effective conversations” about “harmful” religious exemptions that it says undermine public safety, legal protections for people who identify as LGBT, and women's “reproductive freedom.”
Other leaked e-mails from the DNC mention Tim Gill and Jon Stryker, the Arcus Foundation founder and wealthy heir. Their names are mentioned in the context of invitations to the White House, donor outreach, and using LGBT advocacy to engage millennial voters.
The Movement Advancement Project has organized strategy to advance LGBT advocacy within U.S. religious denominations, seminaries, clergy coalitions and media “to counter religious opposition,” the Gill Foundation's 2006 annual report said.
The Gill Foundation and the Arcus Foundation are also backers of groups like Catholics United. The Arcus Foundation has funded Equally Blessed, a coalition of Catholic dissenting groups including Call to Action, Dignity USA, and New Ways Ministry. Some funding aimed to shift the narrative on LGBT issues at the Catholic Church's Synod on the Family.
The source of the leaked emails is uncertain. In previous months, the Washington Post reported that some cybersecurity experts believed the hackers who had penetrated the DNC's computer network had links to Russian intelligence. Robby Mook, Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, also cited these claims about the leaked emails in a Sunday appearance on CNN's show State of the Union.
WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange told NBC News there is “no proof whatsoever” that his organization acquired the emails from Russian intelligence. He said DNC servers have had security holes for years and many sets of documents have been made public through multiple sources.
CNA contacted the DNC and the Benenson Strategy Group for comment but did not receive a response by deadline.
[img_assist|nid=3197|title=|desc=|link=none|align=right|width=80|height=100]JRuby is by far the most popular Java implementation of the Ruby programming language. The 1.1.2 version has just been released with improvements in startup time, performance and threading. Thomas Enebo, one of the main JRuby developers, recently talked to me about the popularity of the language, the JRuby project, and when it's right to use Ruby over Java.
James Sugrue: For those of us who aren't familiar, can you give a quick overview of Ruby?
Thomas Enebo: Ruby is a pure object-oriented dynamically-typed programming language. It was written around feeling natural and fun to the programmer as opposed to being written to be productive (or substitute with another industry term). As a result, it is a beautiful, productive language that seems to make a fan out of most people who try it.
Ruby has a comprehensive set of libraries which come in a Ruby distribution (like JRuby). This is similar to Java in that you can expect a decent selection of APIs which you know will be in any Ruby installation. Additional libraries are installed by a simple packaging facility known as ruby gems. You are just one command away from having the new library you want (and no classpath nightmares).
Ruby has largely been popularized by the Ruby on Rails full-stack web framework. Ruby itself started as a language in 1993 whereas Ruby on Rails was started in 2004. Rails is currently the "killer app" of Ruby and it is helping to attract lots of new Rubyists. People wanting an overview of Rails should go to http://www.rubyonrails.org/.
Sugrue: What are the major changes since JRuby1.0?
Enebo: JRuby 1.1 was largely focused on performance. JRuby 1.0 had a partial compiler and JRuby 1.1 ended up havng a full compiler which works in AOT or JIT modes. The compiler is a boon for performance. Beyond the compiler we went over most of our standard libraries, from Array to Zlib, and tuned them to be faster.
During this time we also fixed thousands of compatibility issues. Our confidence in Ruby compatibility is at an all-time high. People can run their app written against the C implementation of Ruby and it just works in JRuby.
Sugrue: What's coming up in the next few months for JRuby?
Enebo: The next big task is rewriting/refactoring our Java Integration (JI) support. JI is our ability to talk to Java classes from within Ruby. JI works well enough for anything I have done with it and I think most people are happy with it, but we have lots of issues filed for more obscure corner cases. The implementation is also messy. We need to go back through and clean things up much in the same way we did for our other subsystems while developing JRuby 1.1.
We also are on a never ending quest to improve performance. Expect continued improvement in speed as the year progresses.
And bugs... :)
Sugrue: What are the biggest challenges you've come across while writing JRuby?
Enebo: A huge issue with implementing an alternate Ruby implementation is that the Ruby specification is the C implementation. There is no formal specification for the language or core libraries. This involves developing lots and lots of tests. It also involves picking up a library that doesn't work and then just hack away until it does. After years of development we have conquered this area, but it has been a painful process.
This has also been my first time I worked on a language implementation. Picking stuff up and learning on the way is fun, but also challenging since it may mean that you end up changing the implementation of some piece every time you learn something new.
Sugrue: When is it the right move to go from Java to Ruby? What use cases does Ruby have the edge?
Enebo: I think these can be difficult questions to answer. I program in Java and Ruby daily and I am sometimes not sure which one I will pick. I will say it is difficult to beat Java in terms of speed in an apples to apples comparison. OTOH, Ruby is much more expressive so you can probably make a more sophisticated solution to beat Java in an apples to oranges comparison. Ruby feels more light weight in terms of restrictions it puts on you as a programmer. I can write something in a fraction of the number of lines in Ruby that I can in Java. I also believe it can be more readable. OTOH, Java's static typing allows another degree of sophistication in its tooling support; so things like refactoring are pretty simple in Java. So having a larger less readable solution is not as much of a detriment.
Basically, I would recommend people try the language out and see how they like Ruby as a language. I love the language and would not be spending so much time working on a Java implementation of it if I didn't (so I am biased).
Sugrue: Is the future bright for Ruby?
Enebo: YES! Seriously, it is a fantastic language that is good for much more than writing just web applications with. With that said, I believe Ruby on Rails will be the largest driving force for programmers learning Ruby for time being. For people who bothered to read this all....Ruby is a tremendously powerful language with a decent set of APIs. You DO NOT need to learn Rails to be able to use Ruby. Here is a snippet of an image manipulation library for JRuby (which is only 200 lines of Ruby+Java2d called image_voodoo [actually probably less than 60 lines makes up what this example does]):
require 'image_voodoo' file = ARGV[0] ImageVoodoo.with_image(file) do |image| image.cropped_thumbnail(100) { |img2| img2.save "#{file}_cropped.jpg" } image.resize(100, 150) do |img2| img2.save "#{file}.jpg" img2.save "#{file}.png" end end
I am sure everyone can read this code without ever seeing Ruby. Can you also imagine writing something as powerful as expressive as this library in 60 lines of Java?
There's perhaps no other species of plant in North Carolina as recognizable as the Catawba rhododendron. Its shiny leaves and gorgeous blooms are ubiquitous throughout the North Carolina mountains.
Yet the familiar shrub isn't necessarily beloved by experts concerned about the uncertain impact of climate change on the forests of Southern Appalachia. Its shallow root system can easily conquer and dominate steep slopes where other trees and plants struggle to gain a foothold after a fire, landslide or other natural or human disturbance. That's one reason tangles of rhododendron cover mountain slopes from waterways to ridge crests.
Senior geologist for geohazards Rick Wooten of the NC Geological Survey in Asheville told Carolina Public Press that the combination of more dramatic rain events and the expansion of weakly rooted species can destabilize mountain slopes.
“Healthy forests hold the soil in place,” Wooten said. “Deep-rooted trees contribute more to slope stability. What concerns me about climate change is, if there are more frequent storms that result in more intense and prolonged periods of rainfall then we can expect an increase in flooding and landslide activity in the mountains.”
But landslides are just one of an array of the possible effects of a changing climate on one of the most biodiverse and complex forest ecologies on the planet. There's also the spread of invasive plants, pests and animals; difficult to predict rainfall and drought patterns; and the threat of more frequent and damaging forest fires.
“You can see the direct impact of climate change on our ecosystem services and how they change in response to a variety of threats; they're all inter-related in this complex system,” said Jim Fox, director of UNC Asheville's National Environmental Modeling and Analysis Center based at the Collider in downtown Asheville. “We're seeing a different reality in our forests.”
Those prospects have captured the attention of Wooten, Fox and other experts who are attempting to understand the near and long-term effects of climate change on Western North Carolina's forests.
Of course, warmer temperatures and changing rainfall patterns are beyond the control of forest managers. Planner Michelle Aldridge of the U.S. Forest Service said developing strategies to respond to the impacts of climate change is a building block of the draft Pisgah-Nantahala National Forest Management Plan, which addresses the long-term health of the forest. Currently the Forest Service is revising the plan, which is slated to be finalized in 2019. A draft plan and a draft environmental impact statement are expected to be released next spring.
“Climate change has the potential to influence biodiversity, forest health, water resources and even recreation in the national forest,” Aldridge said. The agency's aim is to apply the best available science to understand how climate change influences the ecological integrity of the forest, she said. Among their available tools to address the threats of climate change is TACCIMO (Template for Assessing Climate Change Impacts and Management Options), a web-based application designed to connect land managers with updated peer-reviewed science about managing healthy forests.
Fox said his organization has collaborated with the Forest Service on several projects that use climate and weather data, maps, and satellite imagery to understand how the wooded landscape of WNC is changing over time. For example, NEMAC is a partner in developing the Landscape Dynamics Assessment Tool (LanDAT) designed to help resource managers analyze landscape and forest changes using satellite imagery.
“We can look at areas smaller than a football field to see where trees are stressed, where forests have burned and what plants are replacing them,” he said. “We also have 15 years of data to see how forests are changing through time.”
Fox explained that while a warmer climate may be likely, greater weather variability particularly perplexes forest managers, with potentially high rainfall periods followed by relatively long dry spells.
“You have a natural system already stressed by land-use changes, invasive plants and insects, and population growth,” Fox said. “The worry is all of these things coming together and adding climate variability on top of it.”
While their climate data and tools may be useful, Fox said it requires people with the expertise to apply it. “Our role is to provide climate information at the right scale and the right tools for local forest managers to integrate into their planning and management,” he said.
While some forest plants and animals may thrive despite an unpredictable climate future, Southern Blue Ridge stewardship project manager Adam Warwick of The Nature Conservancy said that species that depend on specific growing conditions may be in peril. The impact of climate change may be most evident, he said, in high elevation habitats, such as spruce-fir forests, or other environments that have unique micro climates, including mountain bogs.
“The spruce-fir forest have a diverse set of species that have adapted to colder high-elevation micro climates,” he said. The strain of higher temperatures and long, dry periods can make the trees that live above 4,500 feet more susceptible to insect outbreaks or disease. Warwick said that Southern Appalachian bogs are dependent on groundwater and harbour a rare set of species, such as the mountain sweet pitcher plant that can only thrive in a narrow set of growing conditions which can be altered by variations in rainfall and temperature.
“If we have lower water tables, then you start to get competition from other species, so we'll have to work harder to nurse these unique islands of habitat,” Warwick said. “They will have a tougher time surviving. If these rare species disappear, then we lose part of our biodiversity.”
To adapt, Warwick said that more hands-on management is necessary to keep pioneering species out and the rare species in.
In fact, one of the goals of the Pisgah-Nantahala forest management plan revision process has been to define forest-wide strategies to manage the national forests, after a lack of oversight has allowed the forest structure and composition to change dramatically over the past century. While there have been plenty of clashes among forest advocates and users in the planning process, one thing most can agree on is that suppressing wildfire has been a major force in altering the ecological composition of WNC's forests.
“We have some of the largest relatively unfragmented swaths of forest land on the east coast, but there are certain forest types that are ecologically out of whack,” said Warwick, including the highly flammable rhododendron that has spread from areas near rivers where they belong to slopes and ridges where they provide fuel for fires, making blazes far more dangerous and destructive.
In 1915 the North Carolina General Assembly authorized the first state fire wardens to fight fires and clear brush along rail lines to keep sparks at bay and to protect forests that were prized for their timber value. In 1935, the U.S. Forest Service developed a so-called “10 a.m. policy” which mandated fires be snuffed by the next morning. However, research in the 1960s and 1970s led to a shift in Forest Service policy to a “let-burn” policy. While forest managers now generally view fires as vital to the health of a forest, state forest managers are still mandated to suppress wildfires to protect people and property.
Wooten of the NCGS said his agency is cooperating with the U.S. Geological Survey, the forest service, and Chimney Rock State Park to study the stability of steep slopes affected by last year's wildfires. In 2016, 51 wildfires burned over 50,000 acres throughout the mountains.
“It's a big concern if we have recurring seasons of drought-related wildfires followed by active hurricane seasons where storms track over the mountains,” Wooten said. In 2004, for example, the remnants of Hurricanes Frances and Ivan passed through the region, triggering more than 400 landslides.
While extreme weather events and fires have a glaring impact on the forest, there may be less evident, yet just as worrisome threats to the forest.
In addition to the spread of rhododendron, the absence of fire and warmer growing seasons have also allowed other tree species that tend to require more water, such as the fast-growing tulip poplar, to colonize forests and dominate the canopy in place of trees that process moisture more efficiently, such as oak.
“That's a large quantity of water we're talking about when that trend is pervasive across 1 million acres of national forest. If you couple that with increased drought, there's less water coming from the forest,” Warwick explained. “When you consider how many people are moving to the region and that Asheville and Charlotte get their water from (rivers that rise in) the national forest, then forest health is definitely a human problem too.”
The Hyrule Gold New 3DS XL that has been exclusive to GameStop will be making its Japanese debut this January alongside the release of Hyrule Warriors Legends.
Although the game does not appear to be packaged with the system, Japan's Hyrule Gold 3DS LL will still come with a couple incentives for it. A promotional code with each special New 3DS LL will grant access to the Classic Tunic costume for Link, as well as a fairy decked out in similar fashion.
The costume is not brand new, as it was given away freely as DLC for the original Hyrule Warriors. The fairy, however, is part of the My Fairy feature that may be exclusive to the New 3DS title. Also, she's pretty cute.
Hyrule Warriors Legends and the Hyrule Gold New 3DS LL are both scheduled for a 21st January release in Japan. There is no word yet as to whether these promotions will be made available to anyone outside Japan, but we'll have to see when the game is released elsewhere in March. In the meantime, GameStop is still selling the Hyrule Gold New 3DS XL, sans above bonuses.
– Let's just say that Heath Farwell didn't set the bar for his career quite as high as Super Bowl XLVIII.
"Going undrafted by the Vikings in 2005, just to make the practice squad as a rookie coming out of Mankato was a dream come true," said Farwell, the Seahawks' special teams leader. "I remember thinking what an unbelievable accomplishment that was."
Five weeks into his rookie season, Farwell was being considered for a promotion from the Vikings practice squad.
"We had some injuries and some of the older guys, [linebackers] Sam Cowart and Keith Newman, were guys who is a kind of went into coach [Mike] Tice's office and said, 'We should activate this kid. He can help us on special teams,' " Farwell said Wednesday during Seattle's media access period at The Westin hotel in Jersey City. "They did it on a one-week, trial basis. I survived the week and I've been active ever since. It's been an unbelievable ride."
It also reached the top of the football world when the Seahawks beat the 49ers in the NFC Championship Game two Sundays ago. For Farwell, that win was particularly gratifying because of how the Vikings turned the ball over five times while blowing the NFC title game in overtime at New Orleans during the 2009 season.
"We came so close in '09 and came up so short," Farwell said. "Myself, [quarterback] Tarvaris Jackson, [receiver] Percy Harvin, [receiver] Sidney Rice, even though he's on injured reserve, and [offensive coordinator] Darrell Bevell were all on that team. So when we beat San Francisco, yeah, I think it was a little extra special for us considering how tough that loss in '09 was. I think we all wondered then if we'd ever get another opportunity and here we are. Living the dream."
Farwell said the '09 Vikings and '13 Seahawks have some similarities, but a lot of differences.
"On that team in 2009, there was a lot of star power, a lot of future Hall of Famers," Farwell said. "This is a younger group here. There are Pro Bowlers here and I'm sure there are future Hall of Famers, too. But we don't have Brett Favre, Jared Allen, Steve Hutchinson and some of those guys I played with in Minnesota. It's just a bunch of up and coming superstars who happen to play well together. Top to bottom, the roster is unbelievable here. The 53rd guy is a heck of a player here."
Farwell isn't sure where he ranks among those 53 players, but he really doesn't care. He's a former Pro Bowl special teamer who is about to play in the Super Bowl.
"I never expected any of this," Farwell said. "I guess that's the beauty of it and why I enjoy it so much. I can't describe how unbelievable this feels."
Farwell also thinks at least one former Viking will have a significant say in what happens against the Broncos on Sunday at MetLife Stadium.
"To get Percy on our team is going to pay off, just wait," he said.
"He's going to have a heck of a game and make a big impact on the game. I know he's only played two games all year. But Percy with fresh legs in the Super Bowl is going to be scary. Very scary."
Who says women don't like whisky? Certainly not Heather Greene, a petite whisky expert who travels the world extolling the virtues of single malt Scotch for Glenfiddich. Greene, who stumbled into her career in liquor while traveling through Scotland as a musician, recently launched a "Women & Whisky" campaign, a series of events and tastings designed to get discerning ladies to spread the good word about the brown stuff. Her next event, the so-called “Single Malt Speakeasy,” is tomorrow, November 16, at 8 p.m. 1534 bar in Soho. (RSVP here if you'd like to attend.) We sat down with Greene to talk about why women should love whisky and her favorite places to drink it in the city.
Can we talk a little bit about women and whisky? Women sort of get the short end of the whisky stick; it's not really marketed towards us. Why should women drink whisky? Well actually it wasn't traditionally marketed to men. It was something that women were very comfortable drinking in the '30s, '40s, and '50s, and around the world there are women who drink whisky. Bourbon drinkers are women; women don't have any problem drinking bourbon in the south. I mean, mint juleps are made with bourbon. If you look at classic cocktails like old-fashioneds and Manhattans, those are whisky-based cocktails. So this sort of question of how and why the single malt scotch becomes a male thing, I don't really know. It was most likely advertising in the '60s and '70s that implicated whisky with power and that's why men ended up drinking more of it.
So what's the Women & Whisky campaign all about? I'm just trying to make women comfortable, show them an arena in the food and beverage world that they can explore and really enjoy. Women tend to have an incredible, wonderful sense of nosing and tasting and they traditionally, in many studies, outscore men in their ability to identify aroma and flavor. So, that said, whisky has an incredible amount of aroma properties, more so than any other liquid beverage or spirit, more so than wine, more so than beer, more so than champagne. So it's something that women can actually really enjoy and get into. I just think that women should drink it and enjoy it because why not—they enjoy wine, they enjoy food, they enjoy so many other things and there's no reason that they should be shut out of this really great arena.
For women who might not know a lot about whisky what sort of baby steps would you recommend? One thing I would tell them to do is buy a bottle with some friends and split it. I would recommend a Glenfiddich 12, which is a really classic Socttish bottle, a very nice, classic whisky. Get a bottle of 12 with your friends. Make a classic cocktail, have it on ice and have it straight or mixed with bitters or diluted with a little bit of water, and use that to actually experience it in different ways. That's a fun at-home after work on Friday kind of thing. If you're at a bar, I mean the same thing, that whisky is in every single bar. If you're with a friend or two I would order two whiskys from the same region and just ask the bartender to split it. There are lots of ways you can experiment.
Where do you go in New York to drink whisky? If you're downtown I think the Highlands and Mary Queen of Scots, great whisky bars. The Rye House. 1534, which is holding the event on Wednesday, if you go there and ask Justin the bartender to make you a whisky cocktail and tell him you're new to it, he'll totally make you what you want. And he's amazing. If you want super posh and high-end, you could do the bar at Daniel on the Upper East Side with Xavier Herit. He just wrote a book about cocktailing and he makes an incredible cocktail so if you want to some kind of really special cocktail night go sit at his bar and ask him for a whisky cocktail. There are so many. For exploration there's the Brandy Library in Tribeca and Ward III down in Tribeca, which have huge selections. I'd say those are my favorite ones.
What kind of feedback have you gotten from women? It's been amazing. I've done a lot of projects for 5 years. I've been traveling and stuff and this whole Women and Whisky thing, not just from women but from guys who say their events are more fun. I did just do an event at Whisky House and it was called Why Your Wife Should Drink Scotch and we talked about how aroma properties are an aphrodisiac, like there are studies that show that spice and nuttiness and pumpkin increased blood flow to a man's region shall we say.
The women have been really receptive like, “oh thank you so much” and “gosh now I know a little bit about it” and “thank you for spending the time”. They have less hang-ups than men do. Women come to the table with no preconceived notions of how whisky is "supposed" to be enjoyed, and they just enjoy it how they want to.
Hillary Rodman Clinton (“HRC”)‘s campaign for President has been wrought with controversy. But the most telling issue is Hillary's direct run-in with national security. This article shines a bright light on why Colin Powell said: “Don't Pin It On Me!”
Important questions remain concerning how the DOJ checked and verified classified information given to HRC. Who from the White House, National Security Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Defense or Central Intelligence Agency authorized & approved Confidential, Secret, Top Secret and SAP (“classified”) information to be given to HRC and her staff? What periodic checks and counter-checks were in place to ensure such classified information given to HRC and her staff was properly marked, dated, secured and stored according USG mandates and EO safeguards?
HRC created untold national security risks by comingling State Department, Clinton Foundation and personal business on her unsecured private server and hand-held devices. It now appears evident that HRC's private server and hand-held devices did not comply with the Insider Threat Task Force (“ITTF”) and Senior Information Sharing and Safeguarding Steering Committee reporting requirements imposed by Executive Order 13587 (10/7/11); nor had HRC's private server and personal devices been approved for classified information “special situation” deviations by the Director Of Information Oversight Office (“ISOO”).
It is quite apparent that HRC did not have adequate safeguards in place for classified email transmissions. Even the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”)‘s investigatory findings revealed “Confidential,” “Secret,” “Top Secret” and “Special Access Program” (“SAP”) information appeared in email transmissions on her private server.
It's truly mind boggling how enemy nation-state players and sophisticated hackers could have gained access to HRC's confidential information describing covert personnel, operations, foreign sources and sources' families. Indeed, nefarious players had a myriad of creative ways (multiple access points) to hack & tap (hacking and wiretapping) back and forth, between and around the State Department, the Clinton Foundation, HRC's private server, and HRC's family & friends' personal computers and devices, not to mention other espionage tradecraft means. This should not have been permitted to occur where American lives were at stake!
HRC's storing of non-classified information with classified information raises other serious questions: Who was doing what with the high-impact classified information? Where was it being done—at home or abroad? Who now possesses such information and can the possession of it cause immeasurable damage? Did the DOJ question HRC about these matters and were her responses satisfactory?
The non-classified “brats,” “dogs” and “burgers”-type “cook-out” information HRC kept on her unsecured personal server was stored with “Confidential,” “Secret,” “Top Secret” and “Special Access Programs” information. Had the national security classified information protection system to which HRC was subject been functioning properly, it would not have permitted these two distinct information types to be conflated or commingled. At the very least, it would have prevented the practices that had rendered the classified information HRC had possessed from falling vulnerable to sophisticated hackers to steal!
Failure to Very Classified Information Whereabouts, Disposal and Security Clearances
We do not know where classified information ended up. Aside from being in the possession of Hillary Clinton, classified information may have appeared on the computers and/or personal devices of HRC staff members both inside and outside of the U.S. government domain. Classified information may have been mixed in with non-classified information involving personal family, friends or close associates, Clinton Foundation personnel, donors or outside contractors, or with a variety of other individuals with whom the Clinton family does business.
Had the national security classified information protection system to which HRC was subject been functioning properly, it would have ensured that sensitive information was carefully disposed of. It still remains questionable whether only non-classified information had been deleted from HRC's server(s) and personal devices, apart from the classified information. If non-classified information alone had been deleted, the company that had been paid to delete such information, presumably, would not have bragged about how it had “Bleachbit” the information prior to the FBI investigation. In other words, if, as the FBI concluded, HRC lacked the requisite intent to violate the law, why then did she permit the use of such a software program?
HRC was first investigated by State Department Inspector General, Steve Linick and the First Intelligence Inspector General, Charles McCoullough, and then by the FBI Director James Comey. However, these investigations failed to determine definitively whether strict security mandates for disposal of classified information had been followed. It is not clear, for example, whether HRC, Cheryl Mills, David Kendall, Heather Samuelson or other individuals had sought counsel or attained approval from the inspector generals, the source agency or the FBI to review and then dispose of the information on HRC's unsecured private server. It also remains uncertain whether Cheryl Mills, David Kendall, Heather Samuelson or other individuals had disclosed the identities of those (Huma Abedin, Jake Sullivan, Datto, Inc, and Platte River Networks (State Department employees/contractors)) who had handled, reviewed or deleted HRC's classified information, and whether they had secured the appropriate security clearances to do so.
This raises numerous red flags about the potential for gross negligence and criminality in connection with the marking, dating, handling, storing, securing and then deleting (destruction) of classified information. Indeed, it has not yet been confirmed whether a flash drive holding thousands of the deleted pieces of information exists, and whether that information was later downloaded to another computer at another location!
National Security Undermined and Personnel Exposed
The DOJ did not publicly address how Hillary had primed herself for espionage attacks. With possible disclosure of Top Secret and Special Access Programs, dire consequences exist for intelligence personnel who can be targeted, tortured and killed. Covert intelligence and military operations can be compromised. Our enemies can kidnap, hold ransom, torture or kill covert agents' family members traveling overseas or at home in San Diego, Chicago and NYC. In other words, U.S. national security can be seriously compromised at multiple levels inside and outside of government agencies in the United States and around the world.
Justice Department's Inability to Secure Answers to Most Questions
How is it possible that the DOJ did not find that any of HRC's actions ran afoul of at least one of the many provisions of the Espionage Act of 1917 (as amended), the Hiss Act of 1954, the Patriot Act, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act? Surely, HRC's actions as a Cabinet member should have triggered some form of sanction, rather than the slap-on-the-hand admonition she received. Her actions were at the very least negligent, and these negligent actions contravened E.O.s 13526 and 13587 and their implementing directives and guidelines.
Even deeper national security concerns arise regarding the extent to which the whole USG inter-related computer system network infrastructures at the Executive Branch and on the Hill are and remain “cybersecurity-sound.” If Hillary, a cabinet member, can easily operate outside-the-security-box, it is likely other exceptions have been made and security mandates undermined. Every cabinet member and USG official entrusted with Secret, Top Secret and Special Access Program information must adhere to the highest standards so innocent lives are not sacrificed by sloppy and misguided notions of national security. What security gaps now exist at the Executive Branch and on the Hill?
Hillary Clinton's Fiasco to Publicly Account for Classified Information
Had HRC publicly accounted for the failures in protecting her private server and personal hand-held devices and those belonging to her personnel and USG assistants/staffers, and had HRC's follow-up actions prevented the national security compromises that have since occurred, this article would not have been written.
Hillary and Bill Clinton have been around the national security block for at least twenty-one (21) years: President/First Lady (8 years), Senator (8 years), and Secretary of State (5 years). Consequently, the American people expect that Hillary Clinton, as Presidential Candidate, will be able to thoroughly explain what duties and responsibilities she will bear to preserve U.S. national security if she were elected President of the United States of America.
In order to appear credible in providing such an explanation, however, Presidential Candidate Hillary Rodman Clinton must also thoroughly explain to the American People how her prior actions, as former Secretary of State, had failed to ensure that national security would not be compromised. To do this, she needs to answer the following important national security questions before and at the first debate:
Did your private server and personal devices meet the NSA Suite B and Fed FIPS 140 certification for voice, text, emails, and teleconferencing (seamless mobile encrypted communication)—protecting from sensitive data loss, infiltration, espionage or sabotage. If not, why not?”
Were your private server and personal devices set up to withstand vulnerabilities from a) passive radio attacks, b) active radio attacks, c) insider attacks, d) network attacks, e) and device attacks?
Were your private server and personal devices set up to withstand unwanted attacks, taps 3rd party exploits, tower spoofing and surveillance by domestic/foreign corporations or foreign governments? If not, why not?
Were your private server and support team able to instantly identify an attacker which aligns enterprise defense to the adversary's offense 24/7 real time reporting and analysis and engagement metrics along with giving detailed technical and strategic analysis of adversary capabilities? If not, why not?
Were your private server and support team able to identify the adversary tradecraft/activities (adversary-in-motion, reconnaissance, exploitation, privilege escalation, lateral movement and exfiltration)? If not, why not?
Presidential Candidate Hillary Rodman Clinton's ability to adequately respond to these questions will speak volumes about her fitness to become the next Commander in Chief.

**Warning: Video contains explicit language and content that may be offensive to some viewers.**
Bullies have been known to victimize individuals they're almost sure will never retaliate. Believe it or not, in some cases, the bully may actually be more afraid than the victim, but the shocking revelation isn't discovered until they've pushed an innocent person too far. One bully recently suffered the consequences for pushing a victim way too far. Based on the footage, the bully got exactly what he deserved. Now, the victim's knockout punch has gone viral.
The two-minute clip begins with the two guys, presumably teenagers, in mid-confrontation. The bully can be seen following the victim through what appears to be a library or classroom, teasing and pressuring him to fight. The victim can be heard saying, “You're trying to start something. This isn't what you want to do.”
It's quite obvious the victimized teen has no interest in fighting – until he's absolutely fed up with the mistreatment. At that point, he flips out completely, and attacks the bully. One vicious blow quickly becomes an assault. The bully is knocked to the ground where the victim jumps on top of him and continues the attack. “I told you,” the victim said of his forewarning to the bully. Unfortunately, since he didn't heed the warning, he suffered the consequences.
The shocking attack definitely shows the victim had a lot of pent-up aggression towards the bully. It also shows how quickly a person can explode when pushed. The video, which was uploaded to FlyHeight on Saturday, May 2 has received more than 60,000 views. Most of the viewers have agreed that bullies should definitely be careful when tormenting innocent people. Some aren't as defenseless as they may seem.

The Trudeau cabinet is expected to "very soon" debate the size and scope of the country's reorganized mission against the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, but precisely how much latitude those military trainers will get is going to be one of the most divisive elements of the discussion.
Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan will, at the same time, present cabinet with a timetable for ending the bombing campaign and bringing the country's contingent of CF-18 jetfighters home from Iraq, according to several defence sources.
In its place, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau committed last fall to a "more robust" training mission that would include additional special forces, over and above the 69 soldiers already on the ground.
Cabinet is set to consider a series of options and scenarios with troop numbers that could range between 150 and 300, which defence experts say is an indication that conventional army trainers would be needed.
[Sajjan's] been there. He knows what needs to get done - Steve Day, former special forces commander
But more important than numbers, experts say, is what the trainers will be allowed to do. Will their mandate continue to include the dirty, dangerous work of going to the front and guiding airstrikes?
Steve Day, a former special forces commander, says he trusts Sajjan understands there is going to be the risk of firefights, but he's less confident others around the cabinet table get that.
"He's been there. He knows what needs to get done," said Day. "I'm just not at all convinced that the other folks around the cabinet table will have even a remote understanding of what needs to happen."
Similarly, Dave Perry of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute said the Liberals reacted nervously when it was revealed last year troops had exchanged fire with ISIS fighters.
"I would hope whenever the government announces the new mission it will take the time to do what the last one didn't and say what the primary focus will be and also what might happen," Perry said, referring to the political uproar about whether Canadian trainers were engaged in combat in Iraq.
Changing situation
Sajjan said Monday that he believes "the current mission is working," but the decision will require policy-makers to anticipate how the conflict will evolve over the next year. He didn't explain what that meant, other than to say the troops will always retain the right for self-defence.
It is expected the Liberals will keep the CP-140 Aurora reconnaissance plane and the CC-150 aerial refuelling jet in place, as part of the strategy.
But sources also say there will be a substantial humanitarian component to the strategy — something Sajjan himself has hinted repeatedly.

There also appears to be interested in participating in a NATO-led training mission that is expected to set up shop with camps in Turkey and Jordan, but insiders say it won't form part of the immediate strategy, because the military alliance has yet to get it organized.
But Trudeau and Sajjan have had a couple of conversations about the necessity of making sure fragile nations, other than Iraq and Syria, don't slide into anarchy.
One country that's already there is Libya.
And there are indications the U.S. and its allies are gearing up for a possible intervention to prevent the further spread of the Islamic State, which has gained a foothold in the country. There have been increased reconnaissance flights and intelligence collecting — classic signs of preparations for airstrikes and commando raids.
Day and Perry are skeptical that Canada would participate in such an operation.
Conservative defence critic James Bezan accused the Liberals on Monday of abandoning the country's allies — something Foreign Affairs Minister Stephane Dion denied, saying Canada's actions will strengthen the anti-ISIL coalition.
Is that an assault weapon in your pants, or are you just happy to see me?
The Sun-Sentinel reports that police in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, say a man tried to rob a pawn shop in broad daylight on Tuesday by stuffing an assault weapon down his pants.
Marlon Paul Alvarez, 19, now faces grand theft charges stemming from the incident.
Alvarez appeared in court Wednesday, where Broward Judge John Hurley described the defendant's dumb plan.
"You allegedly went into that pawn shop and removed an AK-47 rifle on display and stuck it down your pants," Hurley said, reading from an arrest report. "After a while, [you] pulled it out, put it back, then grabbed another assault rifle off another display [and] put that down your pants."
The Associated Press reports that the owner of the shop stopped the alleged thief when he saw him limping out the door with the $850 rifle down the leg of his pants.
Although the circumstances of Alvarez's arrest are silly, stolen guns are a serious threat to law enforcement.
Earlier this month, New York authorities cracked down on illegal firearms after investigators learned that an NYPD officer killed in the line of duty was shot with a revolver stolen from a Georgia pawn shop. Police also busted a high-volume gun trafficking ring this spring that allegedly ran guns into New York City from Maine, Connecticut and upstate New York.
"This is the way that criminals get guns that they use to murder police officers and murder other New Yorkers,” New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said at a press conference on May 6, after the crime ring bust. "People who do this for a living, we will pursue as aggressively as we can."
Alvarez was held on $25,000 bond for grand theft and the violation of a domestic violence injunction.

NSW's decision to run a new coal mine has been widely criticised
Updated
The New South Wales Government's latest move on the electricity industry seems to fly in the face of government policies (including its own) to reduce greenhouse emissions.
Its decision to run a new coal mine in order to lock in cheaper coal prices for domestic electricity generators has sparked both puzzlement and criticism.
The formal announcement, that the New South Wales Cabinet had agreed to run the planned Cobbora Coal Mine in the state's central west, was made in a tender update about the sale of government-owned electricity retailers.
Cobbora is expected to have an annual output of 30 million tonnes.
The government had selected a private owner-operator, but could not reach agreement over coal prices, hence the takeover.
Now Greenpeace is outraged that taxpayers could be underwriting cheap coal for companies that want to buy the electricity retailers.
Spokesman John Hepburn says the Government is encouraging dirty coal mining pollution and increasing greenhouse emissions.
"They don't seem to be embarrassed by that fact," he said.
"It is possibly the most outrageous public policy decision in a generation."
The Opposition Treasury spokesman Mike Baird says the state's management of power generation and the retailer sale has gone from bad to awful.
"They knew that coal mining contacts were maturing. They did nothing to extend them," he said.
"Unfortunately people in New South Wales now have to pay for it and that is coming in the form of whatever discounts they are offering on the coal price."
However, investors know that the deliberate market-distorting mechanism of carbon pricing - to make high-emission energy generation less attractive - will eventually be put in place through federal policy.
New South Wales electricity generators already trade under the state Green House Gas Reduction Scheme which costs carbon emitters about five dollars per tonne.
The Climate Institute says the Cobbora decision creates what it calls a 'negative carbon price' as, while the state's emission scheme makes coal more costly, the government-run mine will supply coal at below market prices.
"China does the same thing, by subsidising coal while investing in renewable energy," says Deputy Chief Executive Officer Erwin Jackson.
"The government is making it hard for investors in renewable energy to come into the market by depressing the price of coal fired electricity."
Mr Jackson warns that New South Wales could miss out investments which will be created through the Federal Renewable Energy Target.
"Most companies are making strategic decisions about the low-carbon future, they are looking to the new industrial revolution - subsidising coal producers is looking in the wrong direction." he says.
The New South Wales Government is under pressure to receive much needed revenue from its troubled power sale and to keep electricity supply up, and prices down, but the Opposition Mike Baird says they will achieve the opposite.
"There's going to be upward pressure on prices, there's going to be significant inefficiencies in the market which in the long term is going to hurt us all," he said.

It won't be a smartwatch, and it won't be a tablet. So what new product category does OnePlus plan on entering this April?
The startup's co-founder, Carl Pei, on Tuesday teased the company has something on the horizon, but, of course, refrained from spilling all the details. There's been a lot of hope the company would introduce a tablet a la its OnePlus One, but it appears Pei has no such visions of grandeur.
So what will the company announce? There are a number of possibilities—some crazy, some not so much. An activity tracker could be one possibility, or maybe its own set-top box? What about the possibility of a VR headset? One would think the company would keep it in the mobile realm, though Pei could completely surprise us with something we haven't even thought of.
The company really impressed with its first smartphone, the OnePlus One, so we're excited to see what the company is cooking up. Outside of testing out new waters, the company has already said it's hard at work on a OnePlus Two, which will supposedly come with some major “hardware surprises.”
A OnePlus speaker? OnePlus Chromebook? Computer? We don't know, but it's supposedly coming in April, so we'll just have to wait and see.
JAMIESON, Ore. (KBOI) -- Heidi Kirschbaum didn't believe the details of the phone call were real.
Or, maybe it was a joke.
But Heidi's sister-in-law, Charlan, who was down at the family farm, wasn't joking.
"It wasn't alive when we saw it," Kirschbaum said. "But it had one neck, two ears and four eyes."
Kirscbhaum told KBOI 2News that a two-headed calf was born on the family farm in Jamieson, Ore., in Malheur County on Monday. When Heidi and the rest of the family arrived in the field, the calf was already dead. The calf's mother is doing fine.
"You do a double-take and say, wait a minute, whoa," she said.
Word has spread throughout the farming community about the two-headed calf -- especially after kindergarten class. Heidi's daughter, Holly, asked if she could share the calf for show and tell.
"We brought pictures to her class -- the kids and the teacher really enjoyed it," she said.
The family isn't sure what it plans to do with the head. It's now ice cold in a freezer at the family farm.
"We know it doesn't happen very often, but it happened to us," she said.

Pop star Justin Bieber turned down a $5 million offer to perform near the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, according to a Friday report from TMZ.
GOP donors offered what would have been Bieber's biggest-ever payday for a 45-minute performance near the Quicken Loans Arena last week. Donors were reportedly also willing to cover production costs.

A promoter told Bieber the event was “not political,” adding he need not endorse Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say he should get less than 10 years in prison MORE or any GOP policies.
TMZ said Bieber's team disagreed, with agency CAA and manager Scooter Braun both finding the event “100 percent political.”
Braun, who supports Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonSanders: 'I fully expect' fair treatment by DNC in 2020 after 'not quite even handed' 2016 primary Sanders: 'Damn right' I'll make the large corporations pay 'fair share of taxes' Former Sanders campaign spokesman: Clinton staff are 'biggest a--holes in American politics' MORE, then suggested Bieber display Black Lives Matter banners during his performance.
The GOP's donors rejected this compromise, however, insisting Bieber only showcase “All Lives Matter” banners instead. They also ruled out Bieber disparaging Trump or any Republican positions onstage.
TMZ added Bieber's band, which is made up entirely of African-Americans, did not want to perform after the disagreement.
Bieber ultimately ruled out the gig upon discovering Cleveland Cavaliers star LeBron James had done the same for another GOP event.
Braun welcomed Clinton, rapper Kayne West and reality television star Kim Kardashian to his Los Angeles home last year for a fundraiser benefiting Clinton.
Stewards will resolve a post-race investigation involving Craig Lowndes and Cameron Waters from Race 4 of the Tyrepower Tasmania Super Sprint at the next event at Phillip Island.
The two drivers were involved in a heated battle for position inside the top 10 which resulted in contact.
Television footage appeared to show Waters edge Lowndes wide at Turn 5 which sparked a reaction from the Triple Eight drivers.
Lowndes tapped the rear of Waters' Monster Energy Falcon at Turn 7 which forced him wide and allowed the Triple Eight drivers through.
Stewards have confirmed any breach of rules will now be decided at the WD-40 Phillip Island 500.
Likewise an investigation involving Nick Percat (Brad Jones Racing) and Todd Kelly (Nissan) has also been deferred to Phillip Island.
Meanwhile, the deputy race director conducted post-race investigations into three other incidents and determined that they did not warrant referral to the Stewards because no driver was wholly or predominantly at fault.
The incidents included contact between Alex Rullo and Jason Bright at Turn 2, Shane van Gisbergen and Mark Winterbottom at Turn 4 and a clash between Scott Pye and Winterbottom at the same corner.
Let me guess, you don't want to bother with any of this and just want a ready-made Ubuntu VM with all QEMU stuff setup and ready-to-play. Very well. The first Azeria-Labs VM is ready. It's a naked Ubuntu VM containing an emulated ARMv6l.
This VM is also for those of you who tried emulating ARM with QEMU but got stuck for inexplicable linux reasons. I understand the struggle, trust me.

This hammock arrived in a small package via the US Postal Service and we eagerly opened it.
We purchased this for our entire family, but primarily for my 10-year-old daughter who had been wanting a hammock for some time.
I was hesitant to purchase a hammock with this type of fabric due to reviews of the fabric easily being nicked and tearing. After several weeks of her reading, talking on the phone and hanging out in it for hours at a time, my fears are, so far, unfounded.
We used the included tree straps to easily hang it in less than five minutes. You'll want to hang it a bit higher than you intend for it to be as there will be some stretching of the material, ropes, straps, etc. You can also expect the straps to slide down the tree a little depending on how tight you're able to cinch it down. We have left the straps on the tree and taken the hammock down using the included S hooks to store it inside at night avoiding the rain and potential for falling limbs/branches we get during storms here in Vermont.
Now that we have seen this hammock perform to our standards, we are interested in getting another that is larger and will hold more weight.
It was a legal battle worthy of a Federation starship taking on a Klingon destroyer.
On one side was Axanar Productions, which raised $1 million to make an amateur fan film called “Axanar” that was influenced by an episode from “Star Trek,” the popular science-fiction television series that originally was broadcast from 1966-69.
On the other side: Paramount Pictures Corporation and CBS Studios, which own the copyrights for the six “Star Trek” television series and 13 movies.
“Axanar” was the brainchild of Alec Peters of Los Angeles, an avid “Star Trek” fan. He was 8 years old when its show time moved to 10 p.m. So he could watch an episode, his mother put him to bed at 8 p.m. and woke him two hours later.
Axanar Productions made a 20-minute movie called “Prelude to Axanar” that was posted on YouTube in 2014 and was meant to be a springboard to a 90-minute movie called “Axanar.”
This article discusses the potential format for the All-Stars event this year. With its new spot in the offseason, the All-Stars event can be emphasized as more of an exhibition event rather than a full-fledged competitive tournament.
First, let's examine formats of years past:
Shanghai 2013: The inaugural event spanned 3 days, featured 1v1 / 2v2 tournaments for mid laners, duo laners, and junglers. The main tournament featured teams of 5 fan-favorite players from each premier league, with the winning region receiving an additional spot at the WC later that year. Given the event's new timeslot, it is unlikely that there will be any Worlds implications.
Paris 2014: This iteration was a combination event featuring an invitational tournament and an All-Stars challenge. The invitational tournament evolved into this year's MSI tournament, so let's focus on the challenge portion of the event. Each of the 5 premier leagues sent 2 fan-favorite players to form 2 teams of 5 that would play on past featured modes (e.g. Ultra Rapid Fire).
With these two events in mind, let's now discuss the logistics of All-Stars.
Venue: All-Stars has visited China and EU, and this year's MSI took place in NA. This leaves the premier leagues in Taiwan and Korea; this article proposes that the latter be chosen such that an international event will be held in the East in 2015. Seoul not only features a large population and convenient transportation access, but as a side benefit, renowned broadcaster OGN can also help organize the event. The event should be a minimum of 4 days but ideally should span 6 days.
Main Event Format: The event should feature a 5v5 tournament as its predecessors have done, and the 2013 format could easily be resurrected. However, the competitive scene has expanded significantly since Shanghai 2013; more leagues have popped up all over the world, and there has been a significant transfer of players across regions. This article suggests that 8 teams participate, organized by either of the following:
Leagues (EU LCS, NA LCS, LCK, LPL, LMS, TCL, CBLOL, GPL) – All players eligible
Regions (EU, NA, Korea, China, Taiwan, Turkey, Brazil, Vietnam) – Teams must be limited to players who permanently reside within that region
Each participating league/region should send a team of 5, plus 2 or 3 additional players for the event's show matches or as substitutes in the main tournament. The main tournament will follow the standard format established by IWCI and MSI: Bo1 group stages into a Bo3 bracket stage.
1v1 Tournament Format: The World Championship determines the best team in the world; this fun tournament determines the most adept player in the world. Before All-Stars, each major region will have a qualifier to determine the representative at the final international bracket. Best-of-three single elimination throughout.
Showmatches: Every day begins with a match commemorating several of Riot's past featured game modes. Each of the four supported maps gets featured as follows:
Ultra Rapid Fire (URF) – Summoner's Rift
Hexakill – Twisted Treeline
Ascension – Crystal Scar
Legend of the Poro King – Howling Abyss

The Hastings Borough Council in East Sussex has found the ultimately reusable energy source: people. It is the energy version of Soylent Green. The city will be drawing heat from the burning of bodies from crematoriums.
The plan will require a £800,000 refit to the crematoriums. It will ultimately not just be used for heat but electricity, so that you can work out on that treadmill while being powered by Uncle Fred. If the idea of being turned into a human briquette is not appealing, consider the discount you can receive by leaving your body not to science but to your power company. After all, when you call yourself the “power people,” you are perfectly set up for the transition from fossil fuels to cce, cadaver combustible energy.

Cultural respect is vital to reduce health disparities and improve access to high-quality healthcare that is responsive to patients' needs, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Nurses must respond to changing patient demographics to provide culturally sensitive care. This need is strikingly evident in critical care units.
“As an emergency room nurse in a small rural hospital, I was present when an elderly Native American man was brought to the emergency room by his wife, sons, and daughters,” Deborah Flowers says in Critical Care Nurse. “He had a history of 2 previous myocardial infarctions, and his current clinical findings suggested he was having another. During the patient's assessment, he calmly informed the emergency room staff and physician that, other than coming to the hospital, he was following the ‘old ways' of dying. He had ‘made peace with God and was ready to die' and ‘wanted his family with him.'”
“The emergency room physician ordered intravenous fluids, a dopamine infusion, a Foley catheter, and transfer to the intensive care unit of a regional hospital 3 hours away. The patient died 2 weeks and 2 code blues later, and was intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation for most of that time. No family members were present when he died except for his wife. The rest of his family members were unable to afford the cost of traveling to a healthcare facility that far from home. This man's cultural values and preferences in relation to dying were disregarded.”
In contrast, promoting culturally competent nursing care helps nurses function effectively with other professionals and understand the needs of groups accessing health information and healthcare.
Examining Culturally Competent Nursing Care
Definitions
Cultural competence can be defined as “developing an awareness of one's own existence, sensations, thoughts, and environment without letting it have an undue influence on those from other backgrounds; demonstrating knowledge and understanding of the client's culture; accepting and respecting cultural differences; adapting care to be congruent with the client's culture,” according to Larry Purnell in his book Transcultural Health Care: A Culturally Competent Approach (1998).
Another definition states that cultural competence “describes how to best meet the needs of an increasingly diverse patient population and how to effectively advocate for them,” says Barbara L. Nichols, former CEO of the Commission on Graduates of Foreign Nursing Schools, in NSNA Imprint.
Explanations of culturally competent nursing care focus on recognizing a patient's individual needs, including language, customs, beliefs and perspectives. Cultural sensitivity is foundational to all nurses. “The nurse practices with compassion and respect for the inherent dignity, worth, and unique attributes of every person,” states the American Nurses Association's Code of Ethics for Nurses.
Relevance
More than one-third (37 percent) of the U.S. population consists of individuals from ethnic and racial minority groups, and by 2043, minority groups will become the majority, according to research from the American Association of Colleges of Nursing. However, nurses from minority backgrounds represent 19 percent of the registered nursing (RN) workforce. Men account for 9.6 percent of the RN workforce.
There is a “challenge presented by the health care needs of a growing number of diverse racial and ethnic communities and linguistic groups, each with its own cultural traits and health challenges,” the NIH says. Nurses and other healthcare providers must account for these differences through cultural respect to support positive health outcomes and provide accuracy in medical research.
“The development of cultural competence in the nursing practice first requires us to have an awareness of the fact that many belief systems exist,” says Lanette Anderson, executive director of the West Virginia State Board of Examiners for Licensed Practical Nurses. “The beliefs that others have about medical care in this country, and sometimes their aversion to it, may be difficult for us to understand. We must remember that we don't need to understand these beliefs completely, but we do need to respect them.”
Developing Cultural Competence in Nursing
Framework for Delivering Culturally Competent Nursing Services
Campinha-Bacote and Munoz (2001) proposed a five-component model for developing cultural competence in The Case Manager.
Cultural awareness involves self-examination of in-depth exploration of one's cultural and professional background. This component begins with insight into one's cultural healthcare beliefs and values. A cultural awareness assessment tool can be used to assess a person's level of cultural awareness. Cultural knowledge involves seeking and obtaining an information base on different cultural and ethnic groups. This component is expanded by accessing information offered through sources such as journal articles, seminars, textbooks, internet resources, workshop presentations and university courses. Cultural skill involves the nurse's ability to collect relevant cultural data regarding the patient's presenting problem and accurately perform a culturally specific assessment. The Giger and Davidhizar model offers a framework for assessing cultural, racial and ethnic differences in patients. Cultural encounter is defined as the process that encourages nurses to directly engage in cross-cultural interactions with patients from culturally diverse backgrounds. Nurses increase cultural competence by directly interacting with patients from different cultural backgrounds. This is an ongoing process; developing cultural competence cannot be mastered. Cultural desire refers to the motivation to become culturally aware and to seek cultural encounters. This component involves the willingness to be open to others, to accept and respect cultural differences and to be willing to learn from others.
Tips
Nurses should explain healthcare jargon to patients whose native language is not English, according to Monster contributing writer Megan Malugani. A breast cancer awareness program for U.S. immigrants demonstrated that women were too shy to say they didn't understand certain terms. Some assumed that Medicare and Medicaid were forms of cancer.
Many people from other cultures seek herbal remedies from traditional healers — and they can be harmful or interact poorly with Western medicine. Nurses should ask patients about any alternative approaches to healing they are using. Another example of cultural sensitivity involves nurses understanding the roles of men and women in the patient's society. “In some cultures, the oldest male is the decision-maker for the rest of the family, even with regards to treatment decisions,” Anderson says.
The most important way for nurses to achieve cultural competency and promote respect, according to Anderson, is to gain the patient's trust for a stronger nurse-patient relationship. This requires sensitivity and effective verbal and non-verbal communication.
Pitfalls
Nurses should never make assumptions or judgments about other individuals or their beliefs. Instead, nurses can ask questions about cultural practices in a professional and thoughtful manner.
Common pitfalls to avoid involve stereotyping and labeling patients, according to Flowers.
Nurses should avoid unintentionally stereotyping a patient into a specific cultural or ethnic group based on characteristics like outward appearance, race, country of origin or stated religious preference. Stereotyping refers to an “oversimplified conception, opinion, or belief about some aspect of an individual or group of people,” she says. Additionally, many subcultures and variations can exist within a cultural or ethnic group. For instance, the term Asian-American includes cultures such as Chinese, Japanese, Taiwanese, Filipino, Korean and Vietnamese, and within these cultures, there are variations in geographic region, religion, language, family structure and more.
Nurses should be careful about labeling patients. For instance, citizens in the United States may refer to themselves as Americans, but that term can also apply to individuals from Central and South America. Flowers recommends referring to a person from the United States as a U.S. citizen.
Responding to Higher Standards in Nursing
More hospitals across the United States now require that nurses have a bachelor's degree. Rising educational standards are emphasized to increase the quality of care that patients receive. Alvernia University's online RN to BSN Completion Program is designed to improve patient outcomes and help nurses meet each patient's needs, including those unique to the patient's cultural background. The degree program takes place in a convenient online learning environment that accommodates students' work and personal schedules.
The RN to BSN Completion Program includes a class — NUR 318 Developing Cultural Competency & Global Awareness — which offers students “an opportunity to begin their lifelong journey to becoming culturally engaged.” This course has existed at Alvernia University for more than a decade, and demonstrates how Alvernia is leading the way in preparing culturally competent nurses.
Around 541 members of the Taliban, including military commanders, escaped from Kandahar city's main jail via a 320 metre-long tunnel.
A Taliban official on Monday confirmed the overnight escape, boasting that the prison break had been "very well-planned" and that it was five months in the making, Al Jazeera's Qais Azimy, reporting from Kabul, said.
However, police in Kandahar claimed later on Monday that they had recaptured 26 prisoners, and that two of them were killed. They said among those recaptured were eight Taliban commanders.
Toryalai Wesa, the governor of Kandahar, said even though they were caught unawares, the manhunt was continuing.
"Checkpoints are activated, all the units are mobile and they are checking every single person and soon we will start checking some of the housing," he told Al Jazeera.
"There is no change [in the situation] so far ... 24 are back in detention."
'Unimaginable feat'
According to a Taliban statement, the tunnel was not dug by the inmates but by fighters outside the prison.
"Mujahideen started digging a 320 metre-long to the prison from the south side, which was completed after a five-month period, bypassing check posts and the Kandahar-Herat main highway, leading directly to the political prison," the statement read.
"The tunnel reached its target last night, from where the prisoner Mujahideen were led away through the escape route by three previously informed inmates in a period of four-and-a-half hours, starting from 11pm last night and ending at 3:30am this morning. Mujahideen later on sent vehicles to the inmates who were led away to secure destinations."
"They all have made it safe to our centres and there was no fighting," Yousuf Ahmadi, a Taliban spokesman, said. Ahmadi said that 106 were Taliban commanders while the rest were foot soldiers.
The Taliban said the prison guards did not notice the escape until four hours after the operation was completed.
The prison in southern Afghanistan typically holds drug dealers as well as Taliban fighters captured by NATO forces, our correspondent said. The break constitutes a "big success" for the Taliban and would "have a dramatic effect on the fight against the Taliban in the region", Azimy said.
Afghanistan's country's justice mister said the Taliban used "modern technology" in digging the tunnel, adding that it was probable that prison guards were in involved in the operation.
'Security not weak'
Defending the capability of Kandahar's security forces, Wesa, the provincial governor, told Al Jazeera they are not weak. "The digging of the tunnel was beyond anybody's expectation," he said. "I'm sure there were some smart people [among them]. This was a smart move.
"We were not able to [imagine] that someone would be able to dig a tunnel from such a long distance. It was not something we were even thinking of."
There have been previous escapes from the same Kandahar prison. In June 2008, Taliban fighters attacked the facility, blasting through its entrance and engaging in a gun battle with police.
Nearly all of the estimated 1,150 prisoners, including some 400 Taliban, escaped, according to Afghan officials.
The prison was also the scene of a mass hunger strike by hundreds of inmates in May 2008 during which 47 inmates sewed their lips shut after complaining they had been tortured and denied fair trials.
Kandahar city and the surrounding province, considered the birthplace of the Taliban, has been the scene of some of the worst fighting in Afghanistan.
Humans can be relatively stupid and gullible creatures. We will believe anything if you put the right sales spin and fancy marketing on it.
So here we are over 100 years after the snake oil peddlers were done away with by the 1906 Food and Drug Act, which attempted to regulate medicines and curb the abuses of “travelling “doctors” with dubious credentials, selling fake medicines with boisterous marketing hype, often supported by pseudo-scientific evidence.” Sound familiar? Yes….Look around you. History is indeed repeating itself and the cannabis snake oil salespeople are out in full force to sucker you out of your hard earned cash before prohibition ends.
The ruse was simple. Wander into a town of unsuspecting people proclaiming to have the cure all for their illness and disease and sucker the townspeople into buying up all of your bullshit snake oil preparations. The way they would pull off the trick is to have accomplices in the audience that would claim that the preparation had really helped them. They would sucker people into believing their bullshit based on the testimonies of those who had supposedly used this new cure all and had been healed. Yeah…Let that soak in for a minute. Check the landscape and you can see that this ruse is more alive than ever, and the internet and social media have made it easier than ever to pull off. The quasi-legal state of cannabis and the lack of oversight or regulation make it extra easy picking for these modern day medical hucksters.
What we have is a perfect storm for fraud, corruption, and deception.
So how is this happening in the modern age of strict medical oversight and regulation? Simple….Because cannabis s first and foremost an illegal Schedule 1 narcotic it is in no way regulated. But because of the growing acceptance for medical cannabis in many states and a level of tolerance for these programs by the USDOJ, what is happening is people are pushing the boundaries of medical truth and ethics to sell hemp/weed oil products. Since the regulators cannot regulate the market without ending the complete prohibition of cannabis and acknowledging it does need oversight, people are left to make their wild claims and sell their bogus oils on the open market with very little fear of prosecution. It is disgusting.
The saddest part is that a lot of the new hype we see is aimed directly at children. Take the group “Realm of Caring” from Colorado lead by Josh Stanley and his brothers. They did a really shitty TV reality show called American Weed where they acted like some experts in weed and overacted their “reality” scenes to a point of nausea. They then were gifted a strain of cannabis which was high in CBD and found it to work well for cases of children with severe epilepsy and other conditions. Enter Dr. Sanjay Gupta and his highly watched program called “Weed” where he shifts his professional opinion on medical cannabis and does a great close-up spot on the efficacy of this medicine for a young girl named Charlotte. It is a well-done and touching piece that was informative and helped people to understand that cannabis did indeed have special healing properties. All good so far, right?
Leave it to the American value of money over morals to step in and take over though. Instead of being grateful they had discovered a remedy that could help others and working to make sure parents of these kids had access to these types of medicines, the brothers Stanley decided that they had found the magic beans and were going to keep them for their own gain. Because of the media they received they became a go-to resource for parents who were desperate for relief for their children. The RoC group has truly let their minimal success based on limited sampling and over-hyped media go to their head. Parents have reported being forced onto a waiting list for care for many months and being forced to sign non-disclosure/non-compete agreements that only allow them to discuss their care and receive medicine from Realm of Caring. They are selling what amounts to a good high CBD strain dissolved in olive oil for big money to parents desperate to make their child's suffering stop. It is pretty fucked up from an ethical standpoint on many levels. If there really was any “realm of caring” in there they would share the strain with parents in need and allow them to cultivate low cost medicine for their child; or at the very least allow other people with more production capability produce it in a higher volume to meet demands and not have to wait months because they believe everything Dr. Sanjay Gupta says on CNN.
NOTE TO PEOPLE SEEKING OIL: There are far higher quality and less expensive products available than are being offered to most caught up in the hype game.
As I dig deeper into the Stanley's background and operations, more and more questions are raised. Now the RoC group is working to push CBD only legislation in states to ensure their place in the market by playing on drug war and prohibition fears. The Stanley's go out of their way to play into the hype and propaganda, as they try to differentiate themselves from the average “stoner” or “pothead.” Check out these classic quotes from the Stanley's and their mission from God:
“We are not a bunch of stoners, and we do not associate with the stereotypes of what people would like to associate with us,” Joel Stanley said. “We care about what we do.”
So you are suggesting that because one is a “stoner” that they do not care about what they do? And then there is this classic:
“If we were growing psychoactive plants for a bunch of potheads, then that would be the question,” he said. “But what people should ask is ‘How did a group of Christians come to grow a plant for sick people?'”
So now you are using your religion as a moral higher ground for your cannabis production? You are throwing the entire cannabis culture (which your friends say you were indeed a pretty deep part of…former deadheads) under the bus to play yourself as literally “God's gift to weed?” This is the making of the modern day Snake Oil Salesman. Some fancy marketing, a little media push, and some good old fashion Jesus hyperbole for the folks in the cheap seats. It is insane that such a transparent group of charlatans has successfully bullshitted public officials and unsuspecting parents into buying their shitty story.
But they are far from the only ones. There are almost too many to mention. Swing a dead cat around and you will probably hit a person trying to push their latest miracle cure; but let's stick to the big dogs.
The other big scam popping off is the questionable hemp derived products being pushed most notably by Hempmeds PX RHSO (Real Scientific Hemp Oil). The company claims that their product is legal to distribute in all 50 states because it is derived from hemp paste that is legal to import. Their claims are dubious and are moving targets. The parent company, Medical Marijuana Inc. (MJNA) has a lot of affiliated companies that have made a lot of strange moves on the stock market, which is a totally different but related story. There is a good article entitled “Medical Marijuana, Inc. Definitely A Dope Opera” on Seeking Alpha that is worth checking out to get a better breakdown of the complex bullshit workings of this company, and their former partnership with Dixie, a Colorado based company also offering similar hemp derived preparations. It is extremely bizarre and frustrating. These con-artists have exploited the popularity of cannabis and zero regulation to make crazy marketing claims about their products.
The product itself is a low quality product that is produced under conditions that reportedly leave a lot to be desired. Here is a quote from one of the scientists hire by Dixie, then a part of MJNA, to help create these product lines:
I am tired of so-called CBD companies claiming that what they provide is medicine. Anyone using a CBD from hemp product please be aware of what you're actually getting because it is not what you think. These formulations start with a crude and dirty hemp paste (contaminated with microbial life! I have seen this and these organisms decompose the paste. The paste perhaps even contains residual solvent and other toxins as the extraction is done in China ) made in a process that actually renders it unfit for human consumption. What these companies are doing is criminal and dangerous. In fact MJNA's RSHO is literally just this hemp paste diluted in hemp seed oil. No refinement at all!!! And what Dixie Botanicals is offering is beyond disturbing. I cannot keep quiet any more. And since I formulated most of these products as head of Dixie science, I feel responsible for spreading the truth. I left Dixie for ethical reasons but it is not enough to just walk away. These frauds need to be exposed for what they are. Look out for my tell all article coming soon and feel free to contact me directly with questions as it is time to blow the whistle. Let's keep this industry pure and safe.” — Tamar Wise, formerly head of Dixie Science.
Sound good? Yeah…now check out the price tag:
That is right. For only $550 a tube or six tubes for $3,000 you too can have some shitty hemp paste black oil that comes from who knows where and is overseen by absolutely no one. You say, “Well Mickey….they haven't exactly sent in people pretending to have been healed to sell their products have they?” Great question. I am glad you asked.
Check out this new MULTI_LEVEL MARKETING scam being put out by the MJNA group called Kannaway. Does it sound like some Amway pyramid scheme? Well it is. Unbelievable right? Check out this conference call the company has where this unsuspecting guy finds this great opportunity to sell these awesome products and make some extra money! How convenient. LOL:
THIS VIDEO WAS MADE PRIVATE BY THESE COWARDS AFTER THIS STORY BROKE. THEY MUST BE ASHAMED OF SOMETHING? IT HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH ANOTHER VERSION.
Still not sold that is a scam yet? Listen to this bullshit fake news interview with known MJNA spokesperson Charles Vest (friend of #bitchface) where he explains the great opportunity. It is ripe with Snake Oil Salesman double-speak and bullshit:
They have posted messages like this all over social media and especially in forums where parents with sick children go to discuss their situation, often using very similar stories of success with people to lure them in:

I am not sure how clear I need to make this, but these folks are making a big press to separate you from your money by providing false hope at inflated prices before the veil of prohibition is lifted and they are found out to be frauds.
Snake Oil selling is alive and well, complete with fake people who have been miraculously cured, fancy marketing, misleading labeling, and arm twisting. These bold faces liars and fraudsters are here to do one thing…make money and lots of it. They are using these schemes to boost their stock profiles as well. It is all a very twisted and ugly game to sucker investors and people who want to believe, but who do not live in a medical cannabis state, out of their hard-earned cash.
It is fucked up and we as a community should not allow for this to go on in our name. There are people's loyalties being bought and sold on the open market to give some credence to these bullshitters; and it never ceases to amaze me what losers will fall into the traps of these frauds. But it is happening and many choose to stand back without saying a word in hopes that the whole deal does not collapse before our eyes and dismantle the work we have done so some bastards can have their get rich quick scheme based on lax supplement laws and misleading marketing.
This story is so big it is hard to write in one piece and it is only growing by the day. More to come on CBD only legislation, stock scammers, and inferior oil products in their own rights later. But it is up to us, as a community, to begin asking the tough questions and exposing these scams before good people get hurt any more.
Calgary police have laid charges after using DNA evidence to identify the suspect in a Beltline sexual assault that happened 20 years ago.
Charges were laid against Charles Henry Desjarlais, 54, a repeat offender who is serving time for a similar crime.
Staff Sgt. Bruce Walker of the sex crimes unit said the victim has been informed of the charges. He said it is a comfort for her to know the case has been solved.
"She is doing as well as can be expected," Walker said Thursday at a news conference. "There is satisfaction that we can find closure for the victim."

The Beltline sexual assault happened around 5:30 a.m. on Aug. 14, 1997. A woman was walking along Eighth Street S.W. when a man approached her somewhere between 10th and 11th avenues.
He pulled the woman into the alley, threatened her and sexually assaulted her, police said. The perpetrator made the woman walk through alleyways with him before fleeing.
The case remained unsolved until recently, police said.
The breakthrough happened last November when Desjarlais, who was in custody, contacted the Innisfail RCMP to turn himself in for a sexual assault that happened sometime in the late 1990s.
The information was passed on to the Calgary Police Service. Detectives reviewed several unsolved cases from that period. DNA evidence led the investigators to lay charges against Desjarlais.
He has been charged with sexual assault, sexual assault with a weapon, uttering threats and kidnapping.
Last year he was sentenced to five years in prison on another cold case. Desjarlais was arrested two years ago when DNA evidence linked him to the assault of a 16-year-old Calgary girl who was on her way home from school in 1995.
His lengthy criminal history includes a sexual assault conviction in 1994 and a death threat conviction in 2002.
The sex crimes unit has three investigators dedicated to looking at cold case files. Walker said they have looked at Desjarlais in connection to other unsolved sex crimes in the 1990s but have not opened any new investigations.
If you're meeting with a client for the first time or starting a new job, you want to make a great first impression. But aside from the obvious (be friendly, polite, and dress well), is there anything you can do to get someone to like you immediately?
Famed psychologist Robert Cialdini says one of the most overlooked strategies is to rapidly seek out commonalities with the person you're meeting, which creates a level of shared trust. The connection doesn't have to be that unique or meaningful – perhaps you're both runners, or you both grew up in the Midwest. But it serves a powerful psychological purpose and can dramatically enhance your chances of being liked immediately.
If you know who you'll be meeting in advance, Cialdini told me in a podcast interview, you shouldn't hesitate to research them. “Go on Facebook, go on LinkedIn, and see what information this person has freely given about him or herself,” he advises. “It's not secret if they're talking about it online, and if you find that commonality or two, you can go there and zero in.”
If your meeting is spontaneous (for instance, talking with someone at a conference), you can steer the conversation to identify shared interests. Don't hesitate to offer information about yourself as long as it's appropriate to the workplace, says Cialdini: “There's research that shows that self-disclosure is reciprocal.” That means that if you share details about yourself, “people will tell you about themselves and when you hit on a commonality, all of a sudden there's rapport.”
This “small talk” may seem trivial to some, but Cialdini believes it's central to business effectiveness: “A weakness of Americans is that we tend not to do what is done in many other cultures – spending sociable time interacting with other people so there is a context of commonality recognized by both parties, so subsequent interactions go more smoothly.” The next time you're hoping to make a great first impression, your best bet may be to find common ground – fast.
What are your strategies for getting someone to like you immediately?

A Yellowknife man is warning others to be careful after a pack of foxes chased him through a patch of woods in downtown Yellowknife Sunday night.
Christian Lyons had just seen Mission Impossible with a friend and was walking towards his home on School Draw Road around midnight. He took a shortcut on a path behind Sir John Franklin High School, just in behind some town homes.
"It's dark, with a little bit of an air of foreboding," he says of the trail.
When he saw the first animal, about three metres away, he thought it was a nice wildlife sighting.
"Then another one came right after it. And then another one. And then there was another one and another one. There was five I counted."
Lyons waited for them to cross the path and carry on through the woods. They did, and he carried on his way.
"Lo and behold, as I came over a ridge, I saw that these, at least five foxes, had circled back and were back on the trail."
He began to feel disconcerted. The foxes weren't fleeing or trying to avoid him.
"It's almost like they looped back to come in front of me so I took stock of the situation. I'm not afraid of foxes. Who would be?"
The pack approaches
The animals began to approach as a pack, loping towards him from about 10 metres away.
"I just kind of jogged backwards in retreat. Not in full-panic flight at this point."
Another five metres down the road, Lyons turned back.
"They were then closing the gap toward me with some intent," says Lyons, a practising lawyer.
At this point, he says, "it was unequivocal flight response. I just started to sprint away from these things."
Lyons, who's not ashamed to admit he's a "very fast runner," made it over a small hill. Glancing backwards, he saw one fox right behind him.
"He'd actually have to run after me to still be that close. I was actually scared at that point, thinking this thing could be rabid."
Lyons sprinted for another 85 metres with at least one fox chasing him the whole way.
"My heart was thumping."
Looping around to reach his house, Lyons kept his eyes peeled for any more "errant foxes" and spotted one, just a few metres from his front door.
"I was like, is this a fox-zombie apocalypse or something?"
He headed straight for the door, nervously jammed his key into the lock, stepped inside and breathed a sigh of relief.
'Full blown mangy beasts'
Lyons says he walks that trail often, and has never seen foxes, or signs of a den, in the area before.
He doesn't think the foxes were rabid, or young.
"I didn't see any baby foxes. They all looked like full blown mangy beasts to me in the dark."
A redhead, he admits the foxes may have had a special interest in him. "Maybe they were trying to bring me into the fold," he jokes.
But the whole encounter has put him somewhat on edge.
"There are a lot of kids that live in the neighbourhood that play in that area," he says.
"It gave me pause that these foxes aren't always benign as we think they are."
In early 2016, BYU came under intense public scrutiny for its handling of student sexual assault cases. The Title IX office, which should have been protecting victims of sexual assault, coordinated with the Honor Code office who then further penalized victims. In April, BYU promised to study its policies and procedures, and the school launched a website to publically solicit suggestions for improving its practices. However, after four months, the school has not announced its progress or introduced any initiatives to address the problem. On August 9 2016, BYU announced that the Office of Civil Rights had launched an inquiry into the school's compliance with the Title IX requirements set by the US Department of Education. As Steve Evans of BCC noted in a Star Tribune Op-Ed today, this apparent lack of movement on the part of the school is highly troubling, and begs the question about whether BYU is taking the issue of protecting it students from assault seriously. Is the organization even capable of the significant self-criticism needed to fix the problem?
I believe BYU should take steps to accomplish two goals. The first and most important goal is to better support victims of assault and to protect the student body from assault perpetrators. This requires breaking the unhealthy link between the honor code office, Title IX and law enforcement.
The second goal is for the University to re-established trust with its student body, alumni, law enforcement, and the Church at large. Evidence mounts that the administrative processes and culture of the Y demonstrate a long and systemic tendency to mishandle sexual assault in far, far too many cases. Its unclear to me whether the BYU administration perceives this second goal as a legitimate concern, since the school continues to eschew the language and actions of accountability beyond claiming it is studying the matter in some internal and inscrutable way. I submit to that the school administration that their actions thus far are simply insufficient to address the fractured trust with its community, especially given the severity and depth of the institutional problems being brought to light by investigative journalism, and most importantly, by the brave victims willing to tell their stories. The first 4 of my suggested measures are frankly quite obvious for anyone who seriously intends to address these issues at an organizational and should have been done before “study” was needed. The last two suggestions for driving change outside of formal BYU administration changes that I believe would have a significant impact in addressing the problem of sexual assault in the BYU community.
1) Remove the head of the Title IX office as well as any staffer involved with processing sexual assault reporting, and replace them with credible, unimpeachable candidate from outside the Church school system.
1a) Remove the head of the Honor Code Office and any staff who participated in inappropriately accepting or using protected material. Replace the head with a strong candidate.
The fact this hasn't happened already is astonishing. The public statements of the current director alone should have been cause for serious consideration of her removal. She now appears to be in charge of the investigation into her own office's misconduct. The mounting revelations of repeated coordination with the honor code office make this simply obligatory. Just as the Title IX director has overseen lapses in judgment or bureaucratic control, the administrators of the honor code office who willingly accepted confidential information from local law enforcement and the Title IX office should not be protected from these lapses in safeguarding victim confidentiality.
To my knowledge, no one in the Title IX Office or the Honor Code Office have been held personally accountable for the severe violations of trust in any of the documented cases. If such actions have been taken, BYU owes it to its constituents who fund these offices and to the parents who place their trust in them to keep their kids safe to do their jobs and follow legal, professional procedures. What trust can any alumni, current student, or prospective student/parent have that the individuals who have shown such poor judgment will not repeat the same mistakes, especially since their positions do not suit themselves to public audit or observation? Given the historic opacity with which the entire BYU administration operates, the only way to demonstrate some sort of accountability is to remove the current individuals from their positions. This is simply a consequence of running institutions that operate with high levels of opacity.
2) Buy a separate database and software system for tracking Title IX claims.
The link between the Honor Code database and Title IX computer system, while potentially “convenient” or “cost efficient” for administrators, has been acknowledged as creating uncertainty for how systematically sexual assault reporting and Honor Code investigations are linked. Off-the-shelf Title IX reporting software systems are readily available. The BYU Title IX Office should buy one and implement it without delay.
3) Move either the Title IX or Honor Code office out of the Wilkinson building to create physical and social space between the administrators and staff of these two groups.
Currently, these offices are located only 1 floor apart in the same structure, increasing the likelihood of formal or informal information sharing. Creating physical separations has both important symbolic and practical impact in creating the information barrier that should sit between these two organizations.
Also, imagine a victim of sexual assault who might walk into the Title IX office to report an assault after her perpetrator threatened to report her to the Honor Code Office. The office established to protect her would be one short elevator ride away from the office that would expel her. This should and can be easily avoided by moving the offices far apart.
4) Contract with a credible outside party to conduct the formal review of the Title IX and Honor Code offices, and task them with creating a publically accessible report.
At this point, the BYU administration simply does not have the credibility to conduct an internal review, as the very administrators who would be undertaking the review appear to be those who had direct authority over the offending offices. Currently, the only announced members of the advisory council are BYU current or former faculty/staff. Besides, an outside perspective would be valuable to school administrators, as it has become clear that deep-seated cultural issues are an important part of the story. The nature of culture often makes it hard – if not impossible – for insiders to examine their own systems honestly without the help of external observers.
5) Contract a credible outside vendor to create and deliver training on sexual assault which be required for every BYU bishop and stake president.
I would suggest that such training should be made regularly available and annually required for ecclesiastical leaders over any student ward in the church. So much unnecessary pain and misery have been caused by poorly trained volunteer ecclesiastical leaders who are trying to do their best. It makes complete sense to increase training on matters germane to those with stewardship over our student populations, a demographic which is going through the difficult process of exploring and setting boundaries in their dating and romantic relationships.
6) Host a regular conference on the study of the dynamics of sexual assault in religious communities.
It is good to remember that this important issue gained much-needed attention through dialogue that happened at a small rape awareness event hosted at the Y. While it has forced our community to face hard issues, the provenance is deeply symbolic of what the best of college education and academia can be. So why stop there? BYU should embrace this opportunity to make its scholastic community the center of a broader discussion. Invite academics and practitioners together not only from the LDS community but also other religious communities and secular scholars to continue the dialogue. We know that sexual assault and abuse within religious communities are often driven by, and empowered in, unique ways that deserve serious, sustained study (here is a very informative podcast on these dynamics by a prosecutor who specializes in trying abuse cases within religious communities). As we have seen in our own community, the sunlight of rigorous study and serious professional practice is desperately needed.
What Do You Think?
Do any of those steps seem unreasonable? If BYU were to follow such a course, even if it may be uncomfortable or hard, do you think it would significantly help the university do better at addressing sexual assault? Would it help make significant progress in restoring a shaken trust in the institution? What would you add to the list?
(Edit: Sarah Westerberg is not leading the Advisory Council. Jan Sharman, Student Life Vice President is. Janet is the administrator that oversees both the Title IX and the Honor Code office. Ms. Westerberg's association with the investigation is unclear. However, the general point remains – that the council is headed by an administrator under whose purview the systematic failings have occurred.)
After spotting the post about Marty McFly's Nike's on eBay last week, loyal Geekologie reader (and all around handsome devil) Dave was kind enough to inform me that THE FREAKING HOVERBOARD IS UP FOR SALE TOO!
This is one of the hero Mattel Hoverboards used by Michael J. Fox in his most famous role as "Marty McFly" in the Robert Zemeckis classic 80s trilogy, Back to the Future. Two styles of Hoverboard were made for and employed in the film - lightweight boards of styrofoam construction and thick and durable wood-based props - this example is the latter, and is recognized as the best example of all wood Hoverboards to have survived the rigors of filming.
It is in used but outstanding condition, and is very rare in that it is entirely complete and intact. Given the wood build and use of metal components, it looks and feels like a "real" prop. This piece has the complete fully functional and rear ballbearing-mounted footpad that rotates 360 degrees, as well as the bottom "magnet plates". Of the two styles of stickers used for the effects, this prop has the "photoboard"-style sticker affixed. In addition, there is other textured styling and hand painting. This Hoverboard also features the hole in the top, representing where the handlebars were that "Marty" pulled off after borrowing the "toy" from the little girl in the film.
Oh man, I need it. You think it still works? Unfortunately the bidding starts at, are you sitting down -- $30,000. So yeah, what I'm gonna do is this: Build a time machine, travel to the future, pick up a sports score book, travel back to now, place some huge bets, and then buy that mother. I'm original!
Hit the jump for a couple more pictures of the board in the movie, ALONG WITH A VIDEO OF THE WHOLE CHASE SCENE BECAUSE I LOVE YOU ALL SO MUCH. KISSES!
Thanks to "Hey, McFly, you bojo! Those boards don't work on water!" Dave
To diagnose any memory problems, Garbage Collection log file is the best place to start. It provides several interesting statistics:
When scavenge (or Young generation) GC process ran?
When full GC process ran?
How many scavenge GCs and Fulls GCs ran? Did they run repeatedly? In what interval?
After GC process run, how much memory was reclaimed in Young, Old and Permanent generations?
How long did GC run?
What was the total allocated memory in each generation?
How to generate GC Log file?
In order to understand GC log, you first need to generate one. Passing the below mentioned system properties to your JVM would generate GC logs.
-XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCDateStamps -Xloggc: where file-path: Garbage Collection log file path.
Example:
-XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCDateStamps -Xloggc:/opt/app/gc.log
-XX:+PrintGCDateStamps would print the absolute time stamp in the log statement i.e. “2014-11-18T16:39:25.303-0800”
-XX:+PrintGCDetails property would print the details of how much memory is reclaimed in each generation
Passing above system properties would generate Garbage Collection log file that would look like:
2014-11-18T16:39:25.512-0800: 76.592: [Full GC [PSYoungGen: 26560K->0K(233024K)] [PSOldGen: 632024K->658428K(699072K)] 658584K->658428K(932096K) [PSPermGen: 2379K->2379K(21248K)], 3.0978612 secs] [Times: user=3.09 sys=0.00, real=3.10 secs] 2014-11-18T16:39:31.536-0800: 82.616: [Full GC [PSYoungGen: 116544K->0K(233024K)] [PSOldGen: 658428K->684832K(699072K)] 774972K->684832K(932096K) [PSPermGen: 2379K->2379K(21248K)], 3.2582136 secs] [Times: user=3.23 sys=0.03, real=3.26 secs] 2014-11-18T16:39:37.728-0800: 88.808: [Full GC [PSYoungGen: 116544K->12164K(233024K)] [PSOldGen: 684832K->699071K(699072K)] 801376K->711236K(932096K) [PSPermGen: 2379K->2379K(21248K)], 3.4230220 secs] [Times: user=3.40 sys=0.02, real=3.42 secs] : : Heap PSYoungGen total 233024K, used 116544K [0x00000000eaab0000, 0x0000000100000000, 0x0000000100000000) eden space 116544K, 100% used [0x00000000eaab0000,0x00000000f1c80000,0x00000000f1c80000) from space 116480K, 0% used [0x00000000f1c80000,0x00000000f1c80000,0x00000000f8e40000) to space 116480K, 0% used [0x00000000f8e40000,0x00000000f8e40000,0x0000000100000000) PSOldGen total 699072K, used 699071K [0x00000000c0000000, 0x00000000eaab0000, 0x00000000eaab0000) object space 699072K, 99% used [0x00000000c0000000,0x00000000eaaafff0,0x00000000eaab0000) PSPermGen total 21248K, used 2409K [0x00000000bae00000, 0x00000000bc2c0000, 0x00000000c0000000) object space 21248K, 11% used [0x00000000bae00000,0x00000000bb05a740,0x00000000bc2c0000)

Let's pick up the one single log statement and examine each field in it:
2014-11-18T16:39:37.728-0800 – Time stamp at which GC ran
Full GC – Type of GC. It could be either ‘Full GC' or ‘GC'
[PSYoungGen: 116544K->12164K(233024K)] – After GC ran young generation space came down from 116544k (i.e. 113mb) to 12164k (i.e. 12mb). Total allocated young generation space is 233024k (i.e.227mb)
[PSOldGen: 684832K->699071K(699072K)] – After GC ran old generation space came down from 684832k (i.e. 669mb) to 699071k (i.e. 682mb). Total allocated old generation space is 669072k (i.e. 682mb)
801376K->711236K(932096K) – After GC run overall memory came down from. Total allocated memory space is 932096k (i.e.910mb)
[PSPermGen: 2379K->2379K(21248K)] – After GC ran there was no drop in perm generation space
3.4230220 secs – GC took 3.42 seconds to complete
[Times: user=3.40 sys=0.02, real=3.42 secs] – Real is wall clock time – time from start to finish of the call. This is all elapsed time including time slices used by other processes and time the process spends blocked (for example if it is waiting for I/O to complete).
User is the amount of CPU time spent in user-mode code (outside the kernel) within the process. This is only actual CPU time used in executing the process. Other processes and time the process spends blocked do not count towards this figure.
Sys is the amount of CPU time spent in the kernel within the process. This means executing CPU time spent in system calls within the kernel, as opposed to library code, which is still running in user-space. Like ‘user', this is only CPU time used by the process.
In your case if the CPU time (3.4 sec) is considerably higher than the real time passed (3.42 Sec), we can conclude that the GC was run using multiple threads.

Trayvon Martin (left) and George Zimmerman CBS/AP
(CBS/AP) ORLANDO, Fla. - George Zimmerman's DNA was the only one that could be identified on the grip of the gun used to fatally shoot 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, according to forensic tests made public Wednesday.
Pictures: George Zimmerman crime scene photos
The results rule out Martin's DNA from being on the gun's grip. Zimmerman's DNA also was identified on the gun's holster. The tests were inconclusive as to whether Martin's DNA was on the gun's holster.
Zimmerman is charged with second-degree murder for fatally shooting Martin during a confrontation in a gated community in Sanford in February. Zimmerman is pleading not guilty, claiming self-defense.
Zimmerman says Martin was on top of him, slamming his head against the ground when he grabbed his gun from a holster before Martin could get it.
Other records being released today include a photo of Zimmerman's head that was taken by a witness following a confrontation with Martin.

Qatar court finds Dutch woman, Syrian man guilty of illicit sex
Shabina S. Khatri
Updated with more information about the charges and remarks from Laura's mother
A Dutch woman in Qatar has been ordered to pay a fine and serve a suspended jail term after being found guilty of having illicit consensual sex and being drunk in a public place.
The 22-year-old woman made headlines around the world over the weekend after her mother told Dutch media that police arrested her in March when she reported being raped.
The defendant, known as Laura, will now be deported and be on probation for the next three years, only serving jail time if she returns to court on any other charges.
Meanwhile, her alleged attacker, a Syrian man identified in court as Omar Abdullah Al-Hassan, pleaded guilty to charges of illicit consensual sex and for drinking alcohol.
Because he is Muslim, he was sentenced to 100 lashes and 40 lashes, respectively. However, he faces no jail time.

According to a legal source who cited court documents, Laura denied both charges leveled against her.
The penalty for sex outside of marriage is a one-year suspended jail term and the drunkenness carries a fine of QR3,000.
Issuing the verdict in a packed courtroom full of international media and in the presence of the Dutch ambassador to Qatar this morning, the court ordered both defendants to be deported after serving their terms.
Neither were in court for the hearing.
Laura's family went public with the story of her jailing on Saturday, ahead of the verdict.
The news has sparked an international outcry and thousands have been posting online under hashtag #FreeLaura calling for her release.
Speaking to Doha News outside of the courtroom, the Netherlands Ambassador to Qatar Yvette Burghgraef-van Eechoud said she hoped Laura would be released from prison in the coming days.
“We will do everything we can to get her out of the country as soon as possible to where she says she wanted to go.”
She added that she spoke to Laura extensively on the phone and she is fine given the circumstances. She has asked people to respect her privacy, however.
Conflicting reports
Laura had apparently been on vacation in Qatar and attended a party at a hotel in West Bay in March.
According to her mother's lawyer, she felt unwell after drinking and woke up in an unfamiliar apartment and feared she had been raped.

However, a legal source told Doha News that the two were drinking in a bar at the W Doha and then left the hotel and went back to her home.
The source said that according to Al-Hassan, Laura asked him for money, which he refused. She then asked for his mobile phone, and he gave it to her, and then they had sex.
It is unclear how the police heard about the case, and if she reported a rape to authorities. But after the encounter, both Laura and Al-Hassan were jailed for having sex outside of marriage.
‘Set up'
Several stories published yesterday in Dutch media asserted that Laura was working for an escort service and had gotten into a disagreement with her alleged attacker about payment after having sex.
Speaking to Doha News last night from the Netherlands, Laura's mother Marian said this was untrue, adding, “She was set up, I believe it was a scam.”
She added that she hadn't known about the alleged rape until about a week ago. Before that, her daughter had only told she'd been robbed.
Laura waited to tell her about the sexual assault because she was ashamed, the mother said.
Speaking to Doha News after the verdict today, the mother added: “I'm so happy, I'm beyond happy. How great is this? She's coming home.”

DEPRESSION – AN ADAPTIVE MECHANISM
Contrary to the APA's assertion, depression is not an illness. In fact, depression is an adaptive mechanism which has served humanity well for millions of years. When things are going well in our lives, we feel good. This good feeling is nature's way of telling us to keep doing what we're doing. When our lives are not going well, we feel down or depressed. This is nature's way of telling us to make some changes.
This is very similar to pain. Pain is a signal that tissue is being damaged and that urgent action is needed. For instance, if you touch a hot stove, the pain induces an immediate reaction to pull your hand away. Usually this is accomplished with minimal damage to the skin. Without pain, we would not respond as quickly to these kinds of situations, and we would incur a great deal more tissue damage than is actually the case.
Depression or despondency is not as acute a sensation as pain. It is more generalized and it signals – not imminent tissue damage – but problems of a more general nature. In order to feel good, the following eight factors must be present in our lives.
– good nutrition
– fresh air
– sunshine (in moderation)
– physical activity
– purposeful activity with regular experiences of success
– good relationships
– adequate and regular sleep
– ability to avoid destructive social entanglements, while remaining receptive to positive encounters *
SOURCES OF DEPRESSION
When any of these factors are missing, or are present to only a slight degree, we begin to feel despondent or depressed. When many of these factors are missing to a large degree, we become very depressed. Over the years, I have worked with hundreds of people who were depressed. To all of these people – without exception – I could say, “If I were in your shoes, living the life you are living, I would be depressed too.”
Many of these individuals lived on a diet which was generally poor. Others drank enormous quantities of alcohol. Few ate fruits or vegetables regularly. Many stayed indoors a good deal of the time. Physical activity was low. Purposeful activity – i.e. activity directed towards some kind of goal – was seldom present, and good honest, open relationships often non-existent.
The point here is not to disparage or castigate people who are depressed, but rather to point out that depression is essentially and fundamentally a function of what we are doing – how we are living our lives. It is not an illness. It is the body's natural feedback system. It is nature's way of trying to induce in us some motivation to make changes in our lifestyle – to eat better; to abstain from toxic substances; to get out in the fresh air and sunshine; to identify goals and pursue them; and to talk to friends and family honestly and openly about the things that trouble us. If we do these things consistently and regularly – if we integrate these things into our daily routines, then we will start to feel good. If we don't do these things, we will feel depressed. Or as Peter Breggin, MD, puts it in Antidepressants Cause Suicide and Violence in Soldiers: “The principles for overcoming depression are exactly the same principles required for living a good and happy life.”
Everybody experiences an occasional down day. But we also know what to do about it – get out for a walk; start a project; talk to a friend or loved one, etc. Chronically depressed people, however, are individuals who have been neglecting these areas for years. They spend most of their lives indoors. They are often over-weight, have no goals other than the next TV show, and although they may have many acquaintances, they tend not to share their concerns and worries in an open and honest manner.
Of course, not all depressed people are deficient in all these areas. Some depressed people eat well, but never share their worries or concerns with anybody. Others share their worries, but have no purposeful activities. Others have purposeful and rewarding jobs, but never get outdoors and never engage in physical activity, and so on.
To feel consistently good, we need to have all of these factors present in our lives to a substantial and significant degree. Nor is this such a daunting proposition. A person who eats moderately from the five main food groups; who controls his intake of sugar and alcohol; who doesn't smoke; who has a job or hobby that provides challenges and a sense of fulfillment; who gets outdoors most days for exercise or even for a brisk walk; and who has at least one other person with whom he is open and honest, will feel generally positive. A person whose life is lacking in one or more of these areas will feel generally negative. This latter is not an illness – it is not an instance of something going wrong in our bodies. Rather it is an instance of something going right. Depression is a message from the organism calling for change. Induction of negative feelings is the only language the organism has to express the need to make changes.
DEPRESSION DUE TO LOSS
Severe losses can, of course, precipitate depression even in otherwise very orderly and functional lives. Even when all eight factors are present to a substantial degree, the loss of a loved one will usually result in profound feelings of depression. Similarly, the loss of one's career, health, home, etc., will generate some measure of depression regardless of previous lifestyle. People who have been living functional and productive lifestyles, as described above, however, will normally come to terms with the loss in a reasonable time frame. They will talk about the loss to the people in whom they confide; they will continue to eat well and to exercise, and will continue with the various purposeful activities they have always pursued. Gradually the sense of loss will recede and the ability to enjoy life will return. When it seems as if life is coming apart at the seams, it is our routines that save us – provided we have established good functional routines which incorporate the eight factors mentioned above.
However, for people whose lifestyles are deficient, or only marginal, in terms of the eight factors mentioned earlier, a major loss can put them “over the edge,” and they sink into a state of chronic long-term despondency. In this regard it is worth noting that all human lives are, sooner or later, touched by major tragic losses. What matters is: how equipped are we, in habits and lifestyle, to handle these losses. When a person goes to a mental health center and asks for help with depression, the first priority should be a detailed assessment of the person's lifestyle, habits, relationships, history, etc., to determine the source of the depressive feelings. From this assessment, a remedial program should be developed and active support and assistance provided to the client in the implementation of this program.
In practice this almost never happens. The client who mentions depression is routinely shuffled off to the psychiatrist. He gets a prescription for an antidepressant and is told (falsely) that his depression is an illness “like diabetes,” and that he must take his pills in the same way that a diabetic must take insulin. If supportive or adjunctive therapy is provided at all, it usually takes the form of patronizing pats on the back or reminders to take the “medication.”
DEPRESSION AND NEUROCHEMICAL DEFICIENCIES
Despite decades of highly motivated research on the part of pharmaceutical companies and university departments funded by pharmaceutical companies, no evidence has ever been presented that depression is caused by a physical problem in the brain. Yet this assertion is routinely presented to clients and their families as justification for the drug prescription. Elliot Valenstein, Professor Emeritus of Psychology and Neuroscience at the University of Michigan, having reviewed the various biological theories of depression, summarizes the results as follows in his book Blaming the Brain:
“Although the often-repeated statement that antidepressants work by correcting the biochemical deficiency that is the cause of depression may be an effective promotional tack, it cannot be justified by the evidence.” (p. 110)
The fact is that antidepressants are mood-altering drugs (essentially in the same general category as alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines, etc.). All of these drugs have in common that they alter people's moods. They make people feel better. That's why people take them! But it doesn't mean they are a good idea. There are two ways to get drugs in the United States. You can go to the street corner and buy them illegally; or you can go to a physician and tell him you are depressed, or anxious, or both. Either way, you'll get something that will give you a temporary “fix” for whatever negative feelings are troubling you. But you will not get any real help with your problem. In this regard it is worth noting that anti-depressants are only about as effective as placebos (sugar pills). Whatever lift people get from these products actually comes from within themselves, not from any pharmaceutical correction of brain chemistry.
FREE DEPRESSION SCREENINGS
In recent years many hospitals and clinics have been offering free depression screenings. If you go in for one of these screenings, it's obvious that you have been experiencing some depression, and the interviewer will quickly establish (through insultingly simplistic questionnaires) that, yes, you are indeed depressed, and that you would benefit from one of the many wonderful antidepressants currently available, and wouldn't you like an appointment to see our psychiatrist. These “free” screenings are almost invariably paid for by a pharmaceutical company. They are a form of marketing and have been a major factor in the promotion of psychotropic drugs. The hospital staff who participate in these charades are well-intentioned, but in fact are mere cogs in an enormous drug-marketing scheme.
The purpose of the DSM is to promote the false notion that depression is really an illness, and to legitimize the prescription of mood-altering drugs. The manual lists several different kinds of depression. Acute, severe depression is called Major Depressive Disorder. Persistent though less severe depression is called Dysthymia. Depression that comes and goes and is interspersed with periods of mild mania is called Cyclothymic Disorder. And so on. And, of course, if a client doesn't meet the criteria for any of these – there's always Depressive Disorder Not Otherwise Specified: a residual category to broaden the scope of the diagnostic net. In fairness to the APA, all of the several diagnoses require a fairly significant level of severity. In practice, however, the precise criteria are routinely ignored. In fact, most of the staff working in the mental health system have only a vague notion of the criteria. A client who says he's depressed is assigned a diagnosis and is given antidepressant drugs.
There are, of course, small numbers of mental health staff who although constrained by regulatory agencies to work within the DSM context, nevertheless ignore the implications of the sickness model and provide real help to their clients. These staff members are a very small minority and, the vast majority of mental health workers embrace the DSM taxonomy wholeheartedly and believe unquestioningly in the ontological validity of the diagnostic categories.
DEPRESSION'S MESSAGE: GET UP AND GET GOING
It is sometimes argued that depression can't be an adaptive mechanism, encouraging us to make changes, because many depressed people, in fact, sink into inactive, lethargic despair. What's being missed here, however is that in almost all cases, feelings of boredom, blues, depression etc., do in fact serve as a spur to action. A person sitting around sluggishly on a rainy Saturday afternoon, for instance, starts to feel down and shakes it off by getting up and doing something, or calling his mother, or putting on a raincoat and taking a walk, etc., etc… But all the messages we receive from our bodies can be eclipsed by counter-productive training. We are all born with a strong drive to preserve our own lives. But soldiers, through training and various pressures, can overcome this drive and continue fighting even though the message from within is to run. Similarly, when our stomachs are full, we get a message from our bodies to stop eating. It's clear that this message often gets eclipsed.
Whether the depression message gets eclipsed or not depends largely on our childhood experiences. If we grow up in a family where depressive feelings are dealt with by getting up and getting going, then that's probably how we will respond to these feelings as adults. But if we grow up in a situation where the depressive nudge is routinely ignored, then there's every chance that we'll continue to ignore these nudges in later life.
When a person's life is characterized by strong functional routines, episodes of depression are rare, but when they occur, they are responded to in a positive manner. But when functional routines are largely absent, and where the depression message is generally ignored, then people sink deeper into despondency.
A good analogy here is our response to cold weather. If I'm outdoors working in the yard, and it starts to get cold, my body encourages me to take some action. So let's say I go get a jacket and continue with the job. If it now gets a good deal colder, perhaps I'll go in and get a heavy coat, then continue work. If the temperature continues to fall, I may simply give up and come inside. What I'm doing here is responding appropriately to messages from my body, and it is clear that the precise nature of my responses were shaped by my earlier training and experience. If I ignore the messages from my body, however, and stay outside as the temperatures falls, I become hypothermic and perhaps die. But nobody would conclude from this that the sensation of cold is an illness! The sensation of cold is an adaptive mechanism that encourages us to take appropriate action in response to falling temperatures. Similarly, the sense of depression is an adaptive mechanism that encourages us towards greater functionality in our daily routines. It is not an illness.

When Danish engineering firm Grundfos started researching the best ways to distribute water in Nairobi, Kenya, they found that access to clean water wasn't the problem. In most communities, people could go to central spigots and pay a fee for access to groundwater that's both drinkable and readily available.
The real issue, it turned out, was collecting the money to put it back into the water purification process. “The man opening and closing the valve does it for a price,” says Grundfos's Jesper Ravn Lorenazen, “And his motivation to pass on the money to water utility is limited.”
To solve the problem of dispensing water while also creating revenue for the local community, the company developed AQtap. It's a machine that essentially functions like an ATM for water: users get a “water card” where they can collect points, either by making a purchase from a vendor or making a payment on their phone. When they swipe their card at the machine, a simple interface will allow them to select the amount of water they want and then deduct the points from their card. A hose below the screen dispenses the selected amount of clean water.
That way, Lorenazen explains, “the money that they invested can be collected and reinvested into supplying water. And at the same time [the local government] is incentivized to keep them operational, because if it's not operating, there's no income.”
The project is still in its pilot stage, but being tested in Kenya, Uganda, Thailand and Nigeria. In the slums of Nairobi, where the company has worked with the local government to set up four ATMs, community members pay 3 Kenyan shillings ($0.20 USD) for a 20-liter jerry can of water.
The AQtap machines look just like a typical ATM, with a steel cabinet and a touch interface. “The physical design is characterized by robustments—we know that these will be in tough environments,” says Lorenazen. A blue water drop indicates where to slide in the blue water card, making it very intuitive for users who might not read or haven't used an ATM before.
Besides collecting revenue, the machines can also collect data about how often they are used and how much money is being dispensed. “Most water projects in Africa are funded by water development programs or NGOs, and they need to be able to document the impact and effect on the developing world. The machines make sure we capture all data so that the funders can see it documented,” says Lorenazen.
Federal agents raided two suburban businesses as part of an investigation that appears to involve human bodies donated for medical research.The FBI is not offering many details, but said their presence at a Schiller Park crematorium on Tuesday is connected to an ongoing criminal investigation.Several boxes of evidence were removed from a a second location: a Rosemont office building home to a company called Biological Resource Center, which arranges human body donations for medical research, according to its website.The company is self-described as a "...bridge between those individuals who donate their body and the medical research and education community..."Records show that company's owner also owns the Schiller Park crematorium, a company called Cremation Service Inc. FBI agents and CDC officials were seen here on Tuesday, according to others who work in this office complex.In the last several months, there have been similar raids in Arizona, Michigan, and other states at companies bearing the same name, Biological Resource Center. Those investigations centered around whether donated bodies intended for research were used for other purposes.In Phoenix last February, bodies on gurneys were wheeled into vans. And in December 2013, workers were seen in HAZMAT suits at another body donation company in Detroit, where scores of body parts were found on ice, instead of embalmed.The Phoenix and Detroit cases center around the alleged misuse of bodies donated for research.The FBI wouldn't say whether Tuesday's raids in Rosemont and Schiller Park are part of that probe.Eyewitness News has not been able to reach the owner of the two businesses, and there was no answer at the companies' phone numbers.
As a community, we need to acknowledge that female privilege exists. It's real.
In fact, it's every bit as real as male privilege; yet as a community, we seem reticent to even acknowledge it; and even less likely to talk about it rationally or openly.
I believe one of the reasons that the sex positive community in general (and feminists in particular) doesn't like to acknowledge “female privilege” is because they believe doing so somehow “cancels out” the inequities created by “male privilege.”
But that's not true.
And that's something important — revolutionary, even — that we need to incorporate into the adult discussion about gender and equality.
Men and women are equal, yes – but they're different; and the fact that female privilege exists doesn't mean male privilege doesn't.
The fact is, you can't line up male privilege and female privilege and expect to connect the dots. They don't exist like that. Take the female privilege of giving birth, for example — there simply isn't an equivalent male privilege. That's why acknowledging one doesn't eliminate the importance of addressing the other.
And even today, many of the perceived “inequalities” created by so-called male-privilege are being addressed — so much so, that the concept of “the patriarchy” might be flipped on its head within our lifetime.
Today, for example, more women graduate college than men. Twice as many women get a post-graduate degree than their male counterparts. Women are more likely to find a job after leaving college and 51 percent of all business and financial professionals are now female.
Women might be a boardroom rarity today; but that will be very different in ten years time. In all other aspects of society, women are already eclipsing men professionally.
Even as recently as 2008, women fared better than their male counterparts in the recession; 30 percent less likely to get laid off. Even with unemployment rates as high as they are currently, women are almost 20 percent less likely to be unemployed than men (and that's even including those who choose to be. The choice to be a “stay at home mom” without being judged, of course, is another female privilege).
It's no longer a man's world, and becoming less and less so every day. When the gender rebalance has happened, the question will be whether feminists will put their money where their mouth is and address female privilege as seriously as they did so-called male privilege.
No audio has yet been posted – nor seems likely to be – on the ABC 666 website of the fiery interview with crusading journalist John Pilger on March 6, an unhappy encounter morning host Genevieve Jacobs tactfully describes as a “train wreck”.
“From almost the start of the interview, Mr Pilger spoke over the top of me constantly, was patronising, arrogant and dismissive – for no apparent reason I could discern, other than I had actual questions to ask him … “The listeners were horrified – there was a deluge of texts from people who said how spectacular it was to watch him shooting himself in both feet at the same time, completely and wilfully misunderstanding the point of the interview. “One listener rang in tears, another sent me flowers from her own garden the next day.”
Anyone who actually heard the interview will know Ms Jacobs' account to the CityNews is an incomplete version at best. Ms Jacobs thinks she was steamrolled by a nasty man who didn't want to play nice. And, according to Ms Jacobs, her listeners were also so upset with Pilger that they shared tears and homegrown flowers with her! Good grief! Fact of the matter is, she was ill-prepared for the interview, and Pilger does not suffer fools gladly. In the interests of transparency, all Ms Jacobs has to do is simply post the audio to her website, and let people judge for themselves. It would be standard procedure to do that, unless you don't want the world to hear what a trainwreck it was. And it was paid for by the taxpayer, after all.
Lefty warfare between John Pilger and ABC radio host Genevieve Jacobs:According to Jacobs:Reader Marcus V. happened to catch this audio battle and sends a review:It might be the best thing ABC radio has run all year. Let it be heard!
I once watched a group of grade school children put on a play for their community, mostly their parents as most elementary productions draw, about the dangers of climate change. It was a PSA to their relatives: be cautious with how much wood you burn or our planet will be uninhabitable. You'd think this message would be to large consumers, but it was not. They were in rural Uganda. Most don't even own a car and take a public van into the city once per week to use the internet. Their electricity is hydroelectric, coming and going with the rain.
These families have some of the smallest carbon usage on the planet. Yet, their children pleaded for care in how they pollute, because their lives are at the heart of the climate change battle. Their rainy season is becoming less predictable, destabilizing the steep hills on which they live. They live in fear of mudslides.
In my second month there, the unthinkable but entirely predictable happened: a giant mudslide took out groups of homes. Children that had been playing in the streets the day before slipped away, down the mountain, with the ground beneath their homes. Whole communities disappeared into the earth.
It can be hard to connect to the devastation of such tragedy. It can be even harder to accept our role in its cause. The changing world is not the fault of these people, living simply and with little waste. We are the ones outputting carbon dioxide. I couldn't help but feel guilty about my flight to Africa to meet these people, polluting in an irreversible way, without really understanding the impact the collective of such actions has on the real lives of real children there.
Let us not be fooled. Failing to do our part to curb climate change is an act of violence. We may not be dropping bombs, but we are actively choosing to continue on a course that will cost more lives. More areas will become destabilized, in the earth, in their food supplies, in their water, and people will suffer. There is scientific consensus that our carbon emissions are a major cause of the climate change that leads to such death.
So as Trump considers withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement, we MUST respond as I believe that withdrawing would be an act of violence. It would harm the most vulnerable first, but eventually us. We are all benefactors of a stable world. Withdrawing from our allies in this effort is to commit violence against the global community, as though we actively choose to disregard the lives of these children.
As a representative for the 7th district of Pennsylvania, I will work for legislation that honors our duty as a nation to improve the quality of our environment, both at home and abroad.
Image copyright Glasgow University Image caption New software tracked facial expressions through a range of emotions
All human behaviour can be broken down into four basic emotions, according to research by Glasgow University.
The study has challenged a commonly-held belief that there are six basic emotions of happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise and disgust.
Researchers used a new technique and software programme, developed at the university, to examine expressions.
They said fear and surprise shared the "signal" of wide open eyes, while anger and disgust shared a wrinkled nose.
The team from the Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology claimed these early signals could represent more basic danger signals.
Later in the signalling dynamics, facial expressions transmitted signals that distinguished all six "classic" facial expressions of emotion, they said.
In comparison, the facial expression signals of happiness and sadness were clearly distinct across time.
'Evolutionary pressures'
Lead researcher Dr Rachael Jack said: "Our results are consistent with evolutionary predictions, where signals are designed by both biological and social evolutionary pressures to optimise their function.
Our research questions that human emotion comprises six basic categories. Instead we suggest there are four basic expressions of emotion. Dr Rachael Jack, Lead Researcher
"What our research shows is that not all facial muscles appear simultaneously during facial expressions, but rather develop over time supporting a hierarchical biologically-basic to socially-specific information over time."
In compiling their research, the team used special techniques and software to synthesise facial expressions.
The Generative Face Grammar uses cameras to capture a three-dimensional image of people who have been specially trained to be able to activate all 42 individual facial muscles independently.
From this, a computer can then generate specific or random facial expressions on a 3D model based on the activation of different muscles - or Actions Units as researchers referred to them - or groups of units.
By asking volunteers to observe the realistic model as it pulled various expressions - thereby providing a four-dimensional experience - and state which emotion was being expressed, the researchers were able to see which specific Action Units observers associated with particular emotions.
It was through this method they found that the signals for fear/surprise and anger/disgust were confused at the early stage of transmission and only became clearer later when other Action Units were activated.
Dr Jack said: "Our research questions the notion that human emotion communication comprises six basic, psychologically irreducible categories. Instead we suggest there are four basic expressions of emotion.
"We show that 'basic' facial expression signals are perceptually segmented across time and follow an evolving hierarchy of signals over time - from the biologically-rooted basic signals to more complex socially-specific signals."
She added: "Over time, and as humans migrated across the globe, socioecological diversity probably further specialised once-common facial expressions, altering the number, variety and form of signals across cultures."
The researchers intend to develop their study by looking at facial expressions of different cultures.
They said East Asian populations interpreted some of the six classical emotions differently - placing more emphasis on eye signals than mouth movements compared to Westerners.
NEW DELHI - The newly ordered Russian T-90MS tanks for the Indian Army will come without advanced protections systems, prompting India to weigh the acquisition of these defenses from domestic sources.
"We are exploring the possibility of a domestic company producing these systems (active protection) in a tie-up with an overseas equipment manufacturer," a senior ministry of defense official said.
The Indian Army wants the advanced protection systems on the 464 T-90MS tanks ordered for $2 billion in November 2016, said an Indian Army official.
"The new active generation protection system is one of the most advanced in the world; India could do well to acquire the same in whatever mode rather than going in for a mix-and-match approach as in the past," says Rahul Bhonsle, a retired Indian Army brigadier and defense analyst.
The active protection system in question is a tank-mounted radar that detects the launch of an antitank missile and then engages an interceptor to destroy the incoming round or deflect its trajectory.
So far the tanks have been dependent mainly on the armor of their outer shells. At the moment, no tank in Indian Army service has an active protection system.
The MoD official said efforts were made last year to procure advanced protection systems from the overseas market, but the Russian system was rejected on technical grounds, and the second competitor from Israel would have led to a single-vendor situation. The Indian government avoids purchasing weapons and equipment on a single-vendor basis.
India already operates around 800 T-90S tanks, first delivered by Russia in 2001.

Despite the newly ordered tanks lacking active protection systems, the Indian Army is satisfied with the purchase of the upgraded T-90MS tanks from Russia.
The new batch is equipped with thermal imaging night sights to allow the tank commander to fire at enemy locations even during night battles, the Indian Army official said. The tank features an improved chassis and new modular turret which for the first time in Russian battle tank design history factored in better crew comfort and survivability.

(WASHINGTON-AFP) - Hailo, the taxi app launched with the help of London cab drivers, is pulling out of North America, citing tough competition from rivals such as Uber and Lyft.
Tom Barr, co-chief executive and president, said Hailo would concentrate on markets in Europe and Asia and enhanced products such as payment technology and a "concierge" service.
"In the next phase of our growth, we have decided to put all of our energy and resources into these areas," Barr said in a statement to AFP on Wednesday.
"We have therefore decided to end our operations in North America, where the astronomical marketing spend required to compete is making profitability for any one player almost impossible."
The news comes with apps and ride-sharing services shaking up the traditional taxi landscape, drawing protests from cab drivers in cities around the world.
Uber, which operates in 45 countries, recently received venture funding at a valuation of $17 billion, making it one of the highest-priced technology startups.
In North America, Hailo had been operating in seven cities: New York, Boston, Washington, Atlanta, Chicago, Toronto and Montreal.
Hailo operates in Britain, Ireland, Spain, Singapore and Japan.
Pain? Did one of the Trump supporters leave a piece of chalk behind and you slipped on it causing you to sprain your ankle? Do they not realize that this is chalk? You could erase the “T” in “VOTE TRUMP” and have it say, “VOTE RUMP.” They could get their own chalk and draw a circle around where they are saying and write “SAFE SPACE,” and this magical force field will protect them from all those scary chalk words.
Many students carried signs featuring slogans such as “Stop Trump” or “Stop Hate” and an antiphonal chant addressed to University administration, led by College sophomore Jonathan Peraza, resounded “You are not listening! Come speak to us, we are in pain!” throughout the Quad.
The scribes of these vile monsters was so extremely abhorrent that it prompted 40 students to gather at Emory's Administration Building at around 4:30 p.m. to voice their concerns.
Sorry Brussels, no time to #JeSuisBruxelles. We'd love to mourn the 34 people slaughtered and 270 injured in the terror attacks by murderous jihadists with death-dealing suicide bombs, but we have our own frightening and nerve-racking crusade that we must fight, there are nefarious demons who are scribbling the name of a legitimate political candidate with a writing utensil used by a 4-year-old girl.
On Monday, students protested at the Emory Administration Building, but before you jump on their case, they had a valid reason for their passionate indignation – some person had the audacity to write “Trump 2016,” “Vote Trump,” and “Trump!!!” in erasable chalk around the campus the night before.
There is an article detailing the struggles of students at Emory University claiming that they were “in pain” and felt “unsafe” after they discovered pro Donald Trump graffiti written in chalk around campus. The publication that shared this story was The Emory Wheel , and I immediately thought that they must be one of those parody news sites that posts outlandish and fake articles like The Onion. To my stunned disbelief, The Emory Wheel is a real publication that is the student-run newspaper of Emory University that reports on real news regarding the institution of higher learning in Atlanta, Georgia.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom,” shouted Peraza. “It is our duty to win. We must love each other and support each other. We have nothing to lose but our chains.”
Chains? Chains? Really? You are not being held against your will at your $60,000 a year college that you chose to be at and may leave at any time your feeble, little heart desires. You are not forced to vote for Donald Trump. In this fine Democracy you can vote for your candidate to help Trump not get elected. I'm sure actual slaves from the last 10,000 years would like to smack you upside your head with your figurative “chains” for undermining how truly awful an institution slavery is.
After about ten minutes of this nonsense, the protesters were actually ushered into the Administration Building because in 2016 everyone with feelings need to have everyone else hear how butthurt they are.
“I'm supposed to feel comfortable and safe [here],” one female student said of the chalkening. “But this man is being supported by students on our campus and our administration shows that they, by their silence, support it as well … I don't deserve to feel afraid at my school.” I gotta get me some chalk, this shit sounds more powerful than an AK-47.
The chalk scribblings were done last night, relax.
What happens when these children turn on the television or visit a website covering the presidential election and there are photos and videos of Trump rallies with hundreds of “Trump 2016” signs? They must jump like a cat who just saw a cucumber, piddle their SpongeBob underoos, then run and hide under their bed weeping into their favorite Anna and Elsa Frozen blankie. I feel sorry for anyone who gets triggered by something that is so absolutely harmless.
The university's administrators including University President James W. Wagner entertained these babies even more by inviting them into the Henry L. Bowden Board Room. Then Peraza pandered to his band of milquetoasts, suckling toddlers by asking, “What are we feeling?” Responses of “frustration” and “fear” were yelled out by the toddlers. Surprisingly, the feeling of needing to be coddled in the bosom of a mommy was not one of the replies.
“How can you not [disavow Trump] when Trump's platform and his values undermine Emory's values that I believe are diversity and inclusivity when they are obviously not [something that Trump supports],” one student said tearfully. Another student openly ponders, “Banning Muslims? How is that something Emory supports?”
One student had the audacity to request that the Emory send out a university-wide email to “decry the support for this fascist, racist candidate,” but thankfully some semblance of logic returned to the building and Wagner replied, “No, we will not.”
One student made a compromise, but it was still insane. “The University doesn't have to say they don't support Trump, but just to acknowledge that there are students on this campus who feel this way about what's happening … to acknowledge all of us here.”
Under this ridiculous proposal, it would mean that Emory University would have to send mass emails for every time someone had a feeling. “Dear Emory University students, we would like to make you aware that some students prefer Nutella to peanut butter. Please be sensitive towards their feelings when you are making your peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Thank you.”
Somehow, this ludicrous discussion about chalk writings morphed into demands by students for the university to improve diversity in the “higher positions,” including the Board of Trustees. A request that is unconstitutional as stated by Mizzou's Vice Chancellor Of Diversity told Concerned Student 1950 when they made similar demands earlier this month.
“[Faculty] are supporting this rhetoric by not ending it,” a student said. “People of color are struggling academically because they are so focused on trying to have a safe community and focus on these issues [related to having safe spaces on campus].” From a “Trump 2016” chalk drawing?
Assistant Vice President for Community Suzanne Onorato didn't want to get fired like so many other administrators for not agreeing with protesting students so she coddled them. “I think it's wonderful that students are taking a stand for something that they're passionate about, for something that's so much about themselves — and we want to support that,” Onorato said. That's like giving a screaming baby his binky so they shut the hell up and stop crying.
However, now that the innocuous graffiti has garnered such notoriety, the university is going after those impassioned Trump supporters.
The University will review footage “up by the hospital [from] security cameras” to identify those who made the chalkings, Wagner told the protesters. He also added that if they're students, they will go through the conduct violation process, while if they are from outside of the University, trespassing charges will be pressed.
The problem is that we shouldn't need a pacifier to mollycoddle young adults. These are people who are in their late teens and early 20s who are preparing to go into the real world. They should not be “triggered” by harmless things like words written in chalk because there will be actual “Trump 2016” signs in the real world and there is no safe spaces and no shoulders of university administrators for you to run to and cry on every time you see something that you don't agree with.
Best Drunk Fails
A look ahead at the week's TV schedules.
AFTER a few weeks away Doctor Who returns for the second half of series six, on BBC One, Saturday at 7.10pm.
The last time we saw the gallivanting Gallifreyan, he found out River Song was actually Melody Pond, the daughter of Amy and Rory.
He also discovered she carried a few Time Lord traits thanks to the fact she was conceived in the Tardis and was on a mission to kill him.
But River isn't the only icy killer.
The Tardis has landed in Berlin, 1938, and its inhabitants have inadvertently saved the life of Adolf Hitler, who's been targeted by a mysterious alien robot which has the ability to duplicate any human form.
It isn't long before it turns its attention to River, who needs the Doctor to save her life — which he'd be able to do easily, if only she hadn't just poisoned him.
If all you've got to worry about is how to fill your social schedule for the rest of the week, then inspiring documentary Losing One of My Giant Legs: Extraordinary People, on Five, Wednesday at 9pm, should leave you with food for thought.
Mandy Sellars has a lot more on her plate.
She suffers from a condition which is so rare, despite the best efforts, doctors aren't able to diagnose it.
Since her birth, Mandy's legs haven't stopped growing and three years ago they reached a combined weight of 15 stone.
The problem is so severe doctors believe her legs are starving her upper body, which itself weighs even less than six stone.
The situation took a turn for the worse recently, though, when Mandy developed a potentially fatal infection in her left foot, which resulted in the amputation of her leg.
Mandy's remarkable story is followed in this programme as part of the extraordinary bodies strand and cameras follow her as she learns to walk all over again — this time with a prosthetic leg.
Thanks to same great guests, there's no wonder The Rob Brydon Show, on BBC Two, Friday at 10pm, has become one of the highlights of the schedules.
However, while it's great to see big names sharing anecdotes or belting out their latest single, it's often the rising stars who steal the show.
Ventriloquist Nina Conti, Australian stand-up Celia Pacquola and comedian Elis James have all proved they deserve more screen time, so let's hope producers give them a chance on other shows.
This week's main guest is Frank Skinner, the Midlands comic who spent a decade hosting his own chat show, so he may have a few tips for Rob on the fine art of the genre.
Plus, there is comedy by Joe Wilkinson and music from Manchester electropop duo Hurts.
The latter have gone down a storm thanks to their work with Kylie and the Scissor Sisters, so there's a good chance they should win over a new wave of fans.
Having been a mainstay in the top 10 cryptocurrency market capitalization since December 2017, ADA – the crypto token of the Cardano blockchain – is poised to make a run at the market leaders. The next generation blockchain technology has many people excited about its potential growth over the next several years. Some even project it to overtake Ethereum, sooner rather than later.
To get in before the next bull run, you'll want to know how to get your hands on ADA tokens. This guide is going to show you how to do that, so you can start trading on a popular exchange like Binance .
What is Cardano?
Dubbed part of “Blockchain 3.0”, Cardano is a smart contract platform aiming to be an extension of what Ethereum started. The platform was founded by Charles Hoskinson, one of the original core team of Ethereum.
Cardano utilizes a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, an alternative to the power-hungry Proof of Work systems used by earlier blockchain iterations. It consists of two layers – the Cardano Computational Layer (CCL), on which smart contracts and decentralized applications are run. And the Cardano Settlement Layer (CSL), an accounting layer which employs ADA to provide complex financial applications.
The scope of what Hoskinson and his team are attempting to do with Cardano is why it has generated so much hype. Not only are they trying to create a self-sustainable, decentralized computing system. ADA and the Settlement Layer focus on bringing financial services to the billions around the world living in emerging markets with little to no access to reliable banking systems.
Now let's see how to get your first ADA tokens, and start trading.
Cardano Wallets
Keeping crypto held on an exchange is risky. For that reason, you'll want to get a secure wallet that supports ADA, to hold your coins while not trading.
The Daedalus wallet is currently the only wallet to officially support Cardano. Developed by the Cardano team themselves, Daedalus is an open-source desktop wallet. The future roadmap for Daedalus calls for the addition of Android and iOS versions and support for more coins such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. It will eventually become an app store for decentralized apps built on the Cardano blockchain.
To get the Daedalus wallet, head to their website and download it for free. Set up secure authentication and your recovery phrase, and once the wallet syncs with the Cardano blockchain, you'll be ready to go.
As Cardano's market share grows, it's possible more will add Cardano. The Ledger Nano S , one of the most popular hardware wallets today, has announced plans to add Cardano, though as of writing this no date has been specified.
How to Buy Cardano
While the ADA token is not as accessible as other Large Caps (particularly Bitcoin, Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash), you can still get your hands on it quite easily. The best method depends on whether you want to buy in (paying for ADA with Fiat, such as USD or EUR), or you already hold crypto and are looking to trade your existing coins to Cardano.
I already hold crypto
If you're already invested in cryptocurrency, and are looking to trade or move some of your portfolio into ADA, you'll need an exchange that lists ADA. While not all exchanges have support for Cardano trading, there are certainly a number of high-volume exchanges that do. Huobi and Bittrex are two examples, as is the world's largest crypto exchange, Binance .
Binance is a great place to trade crypto, as they offer trading between Bitcoin or Ethereum for almost every coin worth knowing about.
If you haven't signed up yet, you'll need to create an account.
The registration is a similar process to any crypto platform. Enter your details, set up your security measures and authentication (2-Factor Authentication is always recommended for the most security), and submit several KYC documents.
Once you are logged in and your account has been verified, you'll need to make a deposit to Binance. Since Binance doesn't offer crypto purchases with Fiat, you'll have to deposit crypto to the platform. Bitcoin or Ethereum is best, as these coins can easily be exchanged directly for the altcoin of your choice. You can deposit altcoins too, but they'll have to be converted to a coin like Bitcoin or Ethereum before you can buy Cardano.
Binance will give you an address to send whatever crypto you wish to deposit. Make sure you double-check the address is correct before sending, and make sure you only send the specified coin. I.E., if you're depositing in Bitcoin, send only Bitcoin to that address, nothing else.
Once you've made a deposit to Binance, you can start trading.
Click on the “Exchange” link in the header to start trading. It will offer you two options, a Basic or Advanced view. The Basic exchange is recommended for most.
Once you're in the Exchange, search in the top right for “ADA”. You can search for pairs with Bitcoin, Ethereum, USD Tether or Binance Coin (Binance's native cryptocurrency).
Once you're here, you'll have several in-depth pricing charts for the pair you've chosen. Underneath the charts, you have the option to buy or sell ADA.
You can choose how much you want to buy, and the transaction will be completed within minutes. You also have the option to trade a specific percentage of your Binance wallet for ADA (25%, 50%, 75% or 100%), or set a Stop-Limit order. The Stop-Limit order will automatically execute a trade to buy or sell when the coin hits a price you specify.
I don't hold any crypto/want to buy more
At this stage, very few exchanges offer direct ADA-Fiat pairs, which can make it a little tricky for beginners to start trading ADA.
Coinmama is the savior for investors looking to get into crypto through ADA. Cardano is one of the 8 coins they have available to purchase with credit or debit card. After signing up and completing the KYC process, Coinmama users in almost 200 countries can instantly buy crypto with either USD or EUR.
The alternative is to purchase a coin like Bitcoin or Ethereum on an exchange with Fiat pairs – such as Kraken or Liquid . Once you have either BTC or ETH, you can deposit to Binance and start trading ADA.
In Summary
The future is exciting for Cardano and ADA. Even though it already has a total market capitalization in excess of $2 billion (it was as high as $33 billion in January 2018), Cardano is still in a relatively early stage of development.
As more exchanges add ADA pairs, and the Cardano platform comes out with more development initiatives, the price could very well reach the heights of January 2018 again… or even more. Now is a great time to invest in Blockchain 3.0.

Aston Villa are set to install Roberto Di Matteo as their new manager by the end of the week.
Di Matteo has held productive talks with the club and will be confirmed as Remi Garde's successor once the finer details of his contract are ironed out.
The former West Bromwich Albion and Chelsea boss, who turned 46 at the weekend, is the man Villa have turned to to launch their Championship revival.

Sources close to the club last night confirmed that Di Matteo's appointment was imminent, but insisted it was "not quite done yet".
The former Italian international midfielder faces a hectic summer cleaning up the mess he will inherit following Villa's relegation from the Premier League.
His first task will be to finalise the club's pre season plans before turning his attention to as big an overhaul of the squad as finances will allow.
Di Matteo's arrival will come at a time when prospective owner Tony Xia is trying to push through his takeover of the club, subject to approval from the Premier League and Football League.
A Long Beach police detective appeared in court earlier this week after filing suit against the City of Long Beach, alleging gender discrimination and bias.
Attorneys for the plaintiff and defense stated their case during the trial's opening statements.
In the suit, Wendy Starbird, a 19-year-veteran of the Long Beach Police Department (LBPD) whose father flew choppers for the department, alleges she was twice denied positions as a helicopter pilot; the first time because of her gender and the second because she filed a lawsuit against the city.
“Her filing this lawsuit was not a simple thing for her to do,” Starbird's attorney Gregory W. Smith told the Los Angeles Superior Court jury. “She comes from a law enforcement family.”
Deputy City Attorney Haleh Jenkins, said Starbird's case was unfounded, stating she had not fully proved herself in previous positions and made little effort in re-applying to the job after failing to secure the position the first time. Meanwhile, Jenkins said the only action Starbird made in re-applying was forwarding her resume in 2015.
Smith opened the trial stating that Starbird joined the LBPD in 1997 and was promoted to detective in 2002. She served in a number of ancillary duties, including working as an AR-15 rifle instructor, driving a tactical armored vehicle and being a hostage negotiator. Currently, she protects Mayor Robert Garcia as part of her duties, according to Smith.
In 2014, Starbird applied to a helicopter pilot job after working as a tactical flight officer, assisting helicopter pilots in the air by operating the spotlight and tracking suspect vehicles. When she did not receive the position (which instead went to a male applicant), Starbird's supervisors told her she had frozen during a mock scenario staged during emergency medical training, which was conducted to assess her decision-making skills under duress.
However, Smith alleged no other candidates were subject to the same level of scrutiny.
Jenkins said Starbird was a solid employee with an “exceptional” career, but had weakened her chances of obtaining a job by leaving established positions.
“She literally quit every ancillary position,” Jenkins said. “Instead of proving that she was worthy, she did the opposite.” He followed by stating her 2015 application consisted of simply forwarding her resume.
The air-support unit consists of about six members in a department of about 800, according to Jenkins.

The Metropolitan building at 1509 Broadway in Detroit. (Photo: Max Ortiz / Detroit News)
A downtown Detroit building that's been empty since the late 1970s will become an extended-stay hotel with ground-floor retail.
The Metropolitan, a tall, narrow Gothic structure at 33 John R, has been graffiti-riddled and thoroughly vandalized for decades. It will be re-opened as Element Detroit at the Metropolitan Building with 110 rooms. Target opening date is July 2018, according to a press release issued Monday by the developers.
Element Hotels are part of the larger chain Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc.
The Metropolitan is about a half block east of Woodward and John R, the intersection where the John Varvatos store is located. The Metropolitan is less than a block away from the Detroit Opera House, the Boll YMCA and the People Mover stop on Broadway.
The building will be owned and developed by Metropolitan Hotel Partners LLC, a joint venture between Detroit-based Means Group and Detroit-based Roxbury Group.
The 100,000 square-foot building will have 2,000 square feet of meeting space on the second-floor mezzanine level, about 7,000 square feet of retail on the ground floor and lower level, and an outdoor patio on the 11th-floor rear rooftop.
“Element Detroit at the Metropolitan Building is a highly-anticipated addition to the brand's rapidly growing portfolio and will present travelers with an appealing, new option for short and long stays,” said Allison Reid, senior vice president of North America Development, Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc.
The Metropolitan Building was built in 1925 and for many years was home to jewelry businesses, a dress shop and other retailers.
It's highly decorative facade is composed of terra cotta, granite and brick. The building lost its last tenant and became empty around 1977 or 1978. The city foreclosed on the structure shortly afterward, shutting it down, according to the website historicdetroit.org.
The city has spent tens of thousands to board up its broken windows as well as set up scaffolding and netting to prevent pieces of the exterior from falling onto passersby. The historic building was at risk of being demolished two years ago.
The development group has been cleaning out the building and securing its facade for more than a year.

Economic growth is driven by new ideas, by discoveries that result in better products and more efficient production technologies.
Human capital is the engine of this process: a better educated labour force increases the return on research and development and ensures that discoveries are more readily absorbed in the productive structure of the economy. In the end, more education equals more economic growth.
Or so goes the theory.
In practice, researchers and policymakers have often questioned the effective aggregate return of spending on education.
Simply put, the question is: does government spending on education promote economic growth?
Some stylised facts
Using data available from The World Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI) database, it is possible to estimate the bivariate relationship between government education expenditure and GDP across a large sample of countries.
The estimates show that for every dollar the government spends on education, GDP grows on average by $20.
When the estimate is run for Australia only, the multiplier is slightly higher: an extra $1 of education expenditure increases Australian GDP by $21.
While intuitively appealing, these results raise some questions. An obvious concern is that a country with a larger GDP must also spend more on education. This introduces the risk of reverse causality; that is, the model might pick the effect of GDP size on education expenditure and not vice-versa.
The graph below somewhat addresses this limitation.
In the chart, GDP is measured by its rate of annual growth between 2000 and 2010 and education expenditure is measured as a share of total GDP over the period 1990-99. This time lag reduces the risk of reverse causality.
The dots indicate combinations of education expenditure and GDP growth for each of 151 countries for which data are available from the WDI.
The red line provides the best statistical approximation of the bi-dimensional scatter plot. The positive slope indicates that countries that spent more on education as a proportion of GDP in 1990-99 experienced faster growth in the subsequent decade.
More precisely, an increase in education expenditure by 1 point of GDP (eg from 4.5% to 5.5%) increases GDP growth by 0.9 percentage points (eg from 4.5% to 5.4%).
What do academics have to say about this?
A lot of research has been devoted to the analysis of the effects of education on economic growth.
Academic research in this area is characterised by a certain degree of technical complexity and results often differ across studies depending on the methodology used, the sample considered, or how education is measured.
A survey of this vast literature identified 57 studies, many of which measure education in terms of outcomes (eg enrolment rates, literacy rates, years of schooling in the workforce) rather than expenditure.
But the studies that did look at educational expenditure as a proxy for education generally reported a positive effect of education on growth.
A recent a meta-analysis considered 29 papers that specifically look at the impact of government education expenditures on economic growth. Of these 29 studies, 14 report a positive and statistically significant effect of government expenditure on growth, 12 report a negative effect, and 3 report no statistically significant effect.
Averaging across all studies, the effect of educational expenditure on growth is positive - albeit modest - in the order of a 0.2-0.3% increase in growth for an increase in expenditure by 1% of GDP.
All these studies typically look at the direct effect of educational expenditure on growth. However, if education outcomes affect growth, and educational expenditure affects education outcomes, then expenditure also has an indirect effect on growth.
Recent estimates that use US data suggest that this indirect effect can be large: a 10% increase in per-pupil spending each year for 12 grades of public school was found to lead to 0.27 more completed years of education, 7.25% higher wages and 3.67 percentage point reduction in the annual incidence of adult poverty.
An important aspect that only recently has been addressed by some studies is the one of “quality” of education, as measured for instance by test scores.
One such study uses international student achievement tests to construct a measure of cognitive skills that ranges from 3 to 5.5. It reports that an increase in this measure by 0.6 is associated with a two percentage point higher average annual growth rate in GDP per capita across 40 years.
The question is then how to produce quality education. The authors of this study consider some of the drivers of test scores, but do not include education expenditure in their analysis. This represents an interesting avenue of future research.
Instead of completing a massive federal study that would recommend a permanent solution to the Asian carp problem by 2015, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will release an array of preliminary options to Congress by next year, officials announced today.
The timeline of the Great Lakes Mississippi River Interbasin Study had come under fire from some members of Congress and Great Lakes states, who criticized regulators for dragging their feet on an urgent issue.
Now, instead of unveiling a detailed proposal in about three years, the Corps will draft several alternatives by the end of 2013 and seek reaction from Congress and the public, said Jo-Ellen Darcy, Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works.
"We're going to be able to get feedback on (it) before we make a final decision or recommendation so that we know that we have support," Darcy said Tuesday during a conference call with reporters.
Darcy said that the Corps does not yet know how many alternatives it will present. Although they believe the new timetable will speed up the process, there is no guarantee that Congress will take action on it any sooner than under the original plan.
"What it does is it starts the discussion earlier," Darcy said. "The ultimate decision will be made by the Congress and hopefully informed by a few of their stakeholders."
Asian carp, a voracious species of fish introduced into the U.S. from China in the 1970s, have overwhelmed native fish populations in the Mississippi and Illinois rivers on its 30-year trek toward Lake Michigan. However, the carp are just the latest in a long line of invasive species that have threatened or upset the environmental balance of the Great Lakes.
Congress initially directed the Corps in the Water Resources Act of 2007 to evaluate options and technologies available to stop invasive species like Asian carp from transferring between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River basins.
The Obama Administration has invested more than $150 million to fight Asian carp. Ongoing efforts include electric barriers in the Chicago Area Waterways System near Lockport.
But some environmental groups have long argued that such measures are costly and may ultimately be flawed and ineffective.
Last week the electric barrier system experienced a 13-minute power outage, though officials hastened to point out that there is currently no evidence of Asian carp nearby.

General Motors' volume Chevrolet brand is in the midst of advertising for two key car models: its newest-generation Malibu and the 2013 Spark.
Chevy says the Malibu is the auto industry's longest-running mid-size nameplate, having first arrived in 1964 as the top model in Chevelle's line. So the newest generation of the sedan in the competitive mid-size category deserves a top-shelf send-off.
The Spark mini car is aimed at a younger crowd who could be the next wave of loyal GM buyers.
Both cars have gotten decent reviews.
It's not unusual for a mass-market car brand to have two very different kinds of campaigns for different models. The rub here is the blitz for the Malibu doesn't do the car justice. The work out there, so far, is shallow. It doesn't run deep. But the Spark campaign is much more creative and entertaining.
What's puzzling is the work comes from the same ad agency- Commonwealth, which seems to have a split personality.
That's entirely possible since Commonwealth was created earlier this year with a 50-50 venture between agencies from two different public holding companies: Omnicom Group's Goodby, Silverstein & Partners and Interpublic Group of Cos.' McCann Erickson Worldwide. Both ad agencies were already on GM's roster, but this new entity is handling Chevrolet in most parts of the world.
The new Malibu campaign is in full swing. Check out this national Malibu television commercial, called “State of Mind”
There's nothing compelling about this commercial. It's like Commonwealth just phoned in this car-on-road, B-roll video with narrator Tim Allen talking about product benefits. And what exactly is this mysterious “Malibu state of mind?”
Malibu is also chasing women shoppers with a separate, integrated blitz featuring fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi. He's created his new Chevy Malibu collection, which he and Chevy are touting all over the internet in videos like this
His collection is now being sold on Living Social, which has good reach with 70 million members around the world. There's also an online promotion offering a $5,000 shopping spree. Chevy's marriage to Mizrahi is interesting to say the least. It's certainly not the first time GM has partnered with a fashion designer. From 1996 through 2000, GM teamed with the Council of Fashion Designers for Concept:Cure, a fundraiser for breast cancer research. Every year several designers would get a single GM model from across its brands to rework with interior and exterior colors and fabrics. Chevy's now-defunct Cavalier was a mainstay of Concept:Cure.
GM's new media agency, Aegis Group's Carat, put the deal together with Mizrahi. Time Inc. produced some 50 online videos for the blitz- yes 50!. The videos can be seen on Time-Warner's stable of sites, which certainly makes the whole deal seem like a giant media buying deal, although the effort does include non-Time-Warner sites such as Facebook and Twitter.
Mizrahi said “each piece of my capsule collection was inspired by the features of the car, from the leather seats that feel like they are hugging you, to the ice-blue interior lighting.”
That interior lighting color is the inspiration for his Malibu Blouse, a $140 robin-blue number made of silk crepe.
Mary Kubitskey, Malibu's advertising manager, said “collaborating with Isaac Mizrahi on this collection has helped us speak to women who embrace style, but want a smart product to make their lives easier.”
Okay, but not sure how a $140 blouse will make anyone's life easier.
There's been some hand-wringing on LinkedIn auto groups that this tie-in positions the new Malibu as a “chick car.” Such fretting isn't warranted, since Chevy is balancing media buys for the Malibu with heavy rotations during NFL and post-season MLB games. It's doubtful most men will even catch onto the Malibu-Mizrahi marriage. Despite this, the whole tie-in seems a bit forced.
Let's move onto the Spark.
The little city car, an import from GM's South Korean operations, first arrived here in 2009. Chevy is now giving the 2013- model Spark a digital-only push, with no plans to take the videos to television.
Since the Spark is a global car, Chevy wanted the videos to have a global feel. So the campaign is themed “Importing our Export.” The first online videos of the 2013 blitz started on YouTube and Chevrolet.com/Spark, featuring ads from around the world.
Here's one the first, called “Anthem”
The video is a compilation of online spots that are generally fun and engaging. I especially like this video, dubbed “Hurdy Gurdy” that touts the car's movie-watching capabilities from the USB port
What a creative way to show off that feature!
Although the Spark is aimed at a younger crowd, some of the videos have a lot of cross-generational appeal.
Chevy said the campaign has already gotten over a million views and lots of positive feedback.
Commonwealth hits it out of the ball park for the Spark, but strikes out for the Malibu. A mass market car like the Malibu doesn't and shouldn't have to have bland, mass-market advertising.

MAKING TRACKS: Stay tuned to see who will fill two major car marketing jobs in Detroit. Ford Motor Co. is looking for a marketing chief for Lincoln, after moving C.J. O'Donnell, group marketing manager, to head marketing of Ford's electric vehicles. And GM is looking for a global VP to oversee Chevrolet brand management, advertising, and marketing, with sales and service also expected to be part of the job. Earlier this month, GM tapped its lobbyist, Bob Ferguson, to that same newly-created global post at Cadillac. Currently Chris Perry heads Chevrolet marketing globally and is said to be a candidate for the newly-created job.

Cruz surrogate Glenn Beck is once again encouraging Americans to join him in a fast in the run-up to a crucial primary vote and to spread the word with the hashtag #Tuesdayfast.
In a Sunday night Facebook post, Beck wrote: “I would like to ask that you, your family and friends join me for a day of prayers, fasting and humility. To beg the Lord to not remove His hand from us. To turn to Him and ask that He will heal our land. Beginning Monday night and running for 24 hours ending on Tuesday will you pray and if possible fast like you have never done before?”
Beck noted that, “I have asked for this in the past and was mocked. It is okay.”
Beck is a fervent supporter of GOP candidate Ted Cruz and has been campaigning with the Texas senator for months across the country, including in Indiana on Sunday and Monday in advance of the primary there, which many regard as a make-or-break moment for Cruz.
Following Cruz's defeat in the South Carolina primary, Beck invited America “to join me and my family Monday in a fast for Ted Cruz, our country and the Nevada caucus.” Cruz lost the Nevada caucus three days later.
It's been a difficult past week for Beck, following news of another round of mass layoffs at his troubled media empire. On Friday, after giving an impassioned “farewell address” of sorts to his 40 laid-off employees from his replica Oval Office, the former radio shock jock joined his co-hosts in donning swim goggles and rubbing his face in a bowl of crushed Cheetos to see if they could “look like Donald Trump.”
Read Beck's complete Facebook post below:
It was on April 30th 1789 when George Washington raised his right hand and placed his left on the Bible which had been opened randomly to Genesis 49 due to running behind. He then walked a few blocks to attend a service as passed in a congressional resolution two days prior: Resolved, That after the oath shall have been administered to the President, he, attended by the Vice President and members of the Senate and House of Representatives, shall proceed to St. Paul's Chapel, to hear divine service. This chapel is now known as “the little church that stood”. It still stands as the oldest Church in NYC across the street from the World Trade Center. It is here that Washington spent four hours in prayer and made a covenant with God. “He will be our God and we shall be His people.” I believe this covenant is still in effect. It has protected us and this land for a great while. We are shunning God, and now openly mocking Him. We have chased Him from our public spaces and conversations, His laws are not recognized anymore in most of our courtrooms, schools, business' nor our homes and not only can we as a people not name the basic ten laws of God, we break them as individuals and as a nation on a regular basis. We have become lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, revilers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy, unloving, irreconcilable, malicious gossips, without self-control, brutal, and haters of good. We wonder why our nation is in trouble. It has nothing to do with DC as they are nearly a reflection of us. Have you ever seen an election like this before? I am in a courtyard inn in Ft Wayne Indiana after speaking to maybe 6 thousand people today. I will be away from my family and my business until Wednesday night. Because I believe that this may be our last chance. The Supreme Court judges that will be appointed are enough to seal our fate alone. But, I believe this is an individual choice. There is no collective salvation and He is asking each of us to choose. We all agree, America is at a cross road. If we choose a King, he will give us one. He always does. But because we are the only nation since ancient Israel to have actually made a covenant with Him, it must be broken, I believe by all of us. I realize many will mock this theory, but in a way that will prove my point. We have become such an unholy people that he wants to see each of us, each state to choose – who will you serve? Principles, truth, kindness, and decency or those who deal in greed, hate, anger and fear. Tuesday Indiana is making its choice. All will be counted. It strikes me as an important “coincidence” that the election will be held just a few days after the anniversary of the original covenant. I have asked for this in the past and was mocked. It is okay. I would like to ask that you, your family and friends join me for a day of prayers, fasting and humility. To beg the Lord to not remove His hand from us. To turn to Him and ask that He will heal our land. Beginning Monday night and running for 24 hours ending on Tuesday will you pray and if possible fast like you have never done before? “Cry out to Him”. Join me and my family in praying and fasting for our nation and our God to look down and forgive us of our misguided ways. “Help us Lord to return to you and have the bravery to do the hard thing – to Trust in You and to do our part by standing firm in the eternal truths that Got us here in the first place.” Let us renew our covenant with Him and as George Washington did and humbly seek his face, guidance and protection. Please help spread the word. ‪#‎Tuesdayfast

Tacos are like politics or religion. Everyone has an opinion on the subject, but voicing it brings out the claws, the eye rolls and the jeers, even among the best of friends. And I can hear it already: “You think who makes the best barbacoa?” “You didn't pick my favorite al pastor?” “Pff!”
So be it. What follows is a list of the best and worst tacos I've eaten in Orange County in recent months. This is still a work in progress, a temporary snapshot of a never-ending quest for the perfect taco. Corn tortillas or flour? Large or street-style? Carne asada or carnitas? There's no right or wrong ideal. I'm willing to give most styles a shot. And while I vehemently dislike prefabricated hard-shells, I do not discriminate against crispy tacos or yellow cheese. A good taco is a good taco. A bad one is a bad one.
SOME OF THE BEST SO FAR
My favorite place thus far is probably Carnitas Los Reyes in Orange. I like all the tacos here: al pastor, chorizo, chicharrones, carne asada … . But as the name suggests, the thing to focus on is the carnitas, which are filled with so much delicious pork fat it's hard to get through a taco without the double-stacked tortillas falling apart. That's why they have forks. That's also why they wrap their tacos with tissue paper on one end, to give you something to hold onto without getting it all over yourself.
Whenever I meet someone who says crispy tacos aren't legit – and it happens regularly –I send them to La Choza in Huntington Beach to taste the shredded beef crispy tacos. It's hard not to fall in love with these ultra-thin tortillas that are fried until barely crisp, then stuffed with slow-cooked beef and heaped with shredded iceberg lettuce and finely grated cheddar.
Roman's Taqueria in Costa Mesa makes my favorite barbacoa. The beef is braised for hours with dried red chilies, resulting in an intoxicating barbecue that is spicy and earthy and unapologetically greasy. Stuff it into a tortilla, and the tortilla instantly turns orange. And your fingers will, too. Bonus: The salsas here are some of the best and spiciest I've found.
El Campeon in San Juan Capistrano makes some of the finest al pastor I've found. This is not the type of barbecue pork that's sliced from a slowly rotating spit – I'm still looking for the best of that genre. Rather, this is the kind of pastor that is chopped and marinated, then cooked on a flat-top griddle. It is rich and fatty and intensely flavored with chili sauce. I like the stewed goat meat and beef tongue here, too, but whenever I get a plate of all three, it's always the pastor that I find myself eating first.
In the mobile arena, I find myself returning again and again to Mulitas Original Grill, a truck in Santa Ana that parks at Main and Bishop for lunch then moves to Walnut Street for dinner. The menu is vast, so it's sometimes hard to think strictly about tacos when you're standing in line – and you will have to stand in line, salivating all the while. The pastor and chorizo tacos are definitely worth the wait. Mulitas serves the same wet, sautéed style of pastor as El Campeon, and it's just as good. That said, I actually prefer their chorizo, which pairs so perfectly with their spicy arbol chili sauce. Ask for sautéed onions on the side.
And on the gourmet end of things, I keep coming back to Red O at Fashion Island, which is a lovely restaurant at lunchtime, and the tacos are terrific. Among my favorites: house-made corn tortillas stuffed with achiote-marinated skirt steak and fried potato chips, or crispy pork belly with shredded cabbage and cotija cheese.
El Gallo Giro is a bakery, taqueria and tortilla factory with locations all over, and I frequently find myself at the 24-hour branch on Bristol in Santa Ana after everything else has closed. Day or night, I've always encountered a crowd, and it seems like most people are lined up to buy carnitas by the tub with tall stacks of freshly made corn tortillas. They have a vast selection of meats, including pig lips and beef head, neither of which have I learned to love. I frankly do not like their barbacoa, either, which is studded with bones. But the carnitas? Oh, yeah. That's what you need to order here.
At The Original Taco Factory in Tustin, I was surprised to see far more customers eating burritos than tacos. But when I sampled both, I understood. Yes, the carne asada tacos are good. The steak that fills the restaurant's namesake is nicely charred and crispy around the edges while retaining its juices and integrity. But dang if the wet burritos aren't even better, especially the chili colorado beef.
THE MEH AND THE DOWNRIGHT BAD
I really wanted to love George's in Huntington Beach. Their crispy shells are truly beautiful, fried to that perfectly precarious state halfway between soft and crispy. Sadly, the shredded beef stuffed inside of those amazing shells tasted like shoe leather. I also wanted to like Taco Mesa in Costa Mesa. More people have recommended this place to me than any other taqueria, so I've tried it several times. But on every visit, I've come away unimpressed. The meat always seems dry, whether I've ordered the pastor, carnitas or carne asada – and the overly timid salsas don't help much.
I like Avila's El Ranchito for enchiladas and margaritas, and their tortillas are very good. But why are their tacos so bland? Their carne asada tastes like it's been steamed instead of grilled, and it's begging for some seasoning. And to make matters worse, the salsa tastes too much like Pace Picante Sauce.
The worst tacos of the year? That dubious distinction goes to Two Madres, a new quick-service restaurant from the owners of Wienerschnitzel. It's a blatant ripoff of Chipotle but with even less emphasis on authenticity. The tacos at Two Madres taste like something from a bad airport cafe a million miles from Mexico. I'm guessing the madres are fictional.

Edit, Thu. 5/12/11: Last chance to puzzle through the map yourself! Cuz here are the answers. Also: aLp returns next week. Gonna make this happen.
If it seems like all the movies you've ever seen take place somewhere in New York City, that's because they do. New York is where the aliens must attack, where landmarks are destroyed, where the world ends, and where good-looking people go to find other good-looking people. It's practically a law.
This is an illustrated 18″x24″ map of the history of films set in New York – more specifically, all the movies I could cram into a tiny 12-square-mile chunk of Manhattan. There's exactly 91 movies on here. Can you name them all?
(Edit: Deadline's over!) I'll be giving away a FREE copy of this poster to the first person who sends me the names of all the movies, numbered 1-91. AND also winning free posters will be 3 randomly selected people from the rest of the correct lists sent to me within this first week, before next Wednesday, May 11. Here's a high-res version of the map with each movie numbered from 1-91.
After a week I'll release the full list here; follow me on Twitter to make sure you catch it.
This took about 5 months of researching and watching a ton of old movies, and about 3 weeks of drawing. The best movies I watched included The Warriors (on the map), Escape from New York (on), and an old one called A Thousand Clowns (not on). The worst movie I watched was Sex and the City, holy goddamn. A big thanks to the sites On the Set of New York, The Worldwide Guide to Movie Locations, TV Tropes, and Scouting New York for their awesome info, and to my buddies Dean, Stu and Noah for their advice.
I'LL BE AT TCAF IN TORONTO THIS WEEKEND! Sitting with the rest of the Topatoco crew. Hopefully I'll have copies of the poster on hand for you! See you there, ok yes?!
So yeah, this is one of the things I've been doing since November instead of working on aLp. It hasn't kept me from doing comics per se, but it sure didn't help. I got this idea back in December and just felt like I needed to do it. Now that it's out of the way I think I can get back on the comics horse, but yeah we'll just see about that, won't we. In any case the best ways for me to keep you updated are if you follow me on that Twitter, join that aLp Facebook page, or get up on that RSS feed.
Nick Clegg's announcement today that the government will go ahead with the implementation in April of Labour's plans to allow parents to share between them six months of maternity leave (three months of it paid) is an important one. This is not so much because of the reform itself, which is largely symbolic and will have limited practical effect, but because of what it says about the future of family policy.
Allowing parents to share leave between them is fine in principle, but for most families it will make little economic sense for the father to take time off work. The gender pay gap means that, for the vast majority of households, it is rational for mothers to stay at home. That is why the government itself estimates that only 4-8 per cent of eligible fathers (10,000 to 20,000 individuals) will take up the new right. And though the leave remains transferrable – for mothers to transfer to fathers – it reinforces assumptions of women as primary carers and men as breadwinners.
That is not to deny that increased choice and flexibility for families are important. But a liberal approach alone will not tackle the structural inequalities that shape those choices – in particular, the fundamental inequality in the division of work and care responsibilities between men and women. To tackle these inequalities, we need a more ambitious and extensive reform agenda that simultaneously advances childcare, employment rights and equal pay at work.
At the same time, elsewhere in government policy, spending cuts are pulling policy backward. Cuts in the childcare element of the tax credit reduce work incentives, while the design of the Universal Credit penalises dual-earner families. Meanwhile, Sure Start centres are being closed or refocused on poorer families, and despite the welcome expansion of nursery places for two-year-olds, support for children in their first year of life is being reduced as the baby element of the tax credit and Sure Start Maternity Grants are abolished.
For all that, however, Clegg is right to focus on narrowing the gap between the rights of women and men in our parental leave entitlements. The gap between what mothers and fathers can take in the UK – currently two weeks' paternity leave paid at the statutory rate for men, versus 12 months for women (nine months of that paid at the statutory rate) – is among the widest in the OECD. Unless fathers have more rights to paid leave, more fundamental inequalities will persist. The modern route to gender equality is to extend fathers' entitlements.
Under current fiscal constraints, bigger reforms – affordable universal childcare, better paid parental leave, and the "use it or lose it" fathers' leave that Clegg points to – are off the agenda for the foreseeable future. But it is important that policymakers do not simply account for these as public expenditure or business costs. With better childcare and parental leave rights, more women are enabled to work and use their skills productively after having children, rather than take up poorly paid part-time work. This increases the employment rate and improves the tax take. Full employment in the future will rest in large part on these foundations, which will therefore be fundamental to the affordability of the welfare state.
There is a broader political lesson here, too. Across Europe, the decade before the financial crash brought big increases in the female employment rate, particularly in the Catholic member states such as Spain. Countries with historically low levels of childcare provision, such as Germany, took a "Nordic" turn, significantly boosting their state support for families. In part, this was motivated by natalist concerns about declining birth rates. But it also reflected pressure from female voters who were no longer prepared to trade off their career aspirations against their desire to have children.
This dynamic is at work in different ways in all advanced economies. It provides an underlying momentum to reforms that strengthen family-friendly employment rights, childcare provision and gender equality in the workplace. The process of securing these goals is most advanced in the Scandinavian countries, which started down this path in the 1970s. Elsewhere, the "revolution is incomplete", as the sociologist Gosta Esping-Andersen puts it. But everywhere the pressure is the same: families want more rights to flexible work and childcare support, with more equity between men and women.
That is why the conventional conservative model of male breadwinners and female care-givers, buttressed by marriage tax breaks, is a political dead end. It has no underlying support from the deeper social and economic trends that are remaking our society. On this issue, at least, the future is progressive.

A further education college focusing on learners with complex autism aged 16-25 has opened its doors for the first time.
Ambitious College is the first independent specialist college in London to be located on the same site as a general further education college – Barnet and Southgate College – and will cater for those who are often ruled out of education after leaving school.
Recent research by charity Ambitious about Autism, which runs the college, showed that fewer than 1 in 4 young people with autism access education beyond school while more than 85% of adults with autism are not in paid full-time employment.
Vivienne Berkeley, principal of Ambitious College, said: "Ambitious College is a ground-breaking service in many ways. The reality for many young people with complex autism when leaving school is they are out of education, employment and training, or have to leave their home and family to access provision. With the launch of Ambitious College they will be able to access specialist education nearer home and alongside their peers, which is a huge step forward."
Ambitious College will seek to provide learners with an individualised curriculum focused on the development of work and life skills. By co-locating with Barnet and Southgate College at its Grahame Park campus, learners have access to a wider range of learning and social opportunities alongside their peers in mainstream further education.
The college, which will take referrals from across north London, also aims to enable learners to gain the knowledge, skills and confidence they need to live, work and contribute as part of their community.
Jolanta Lasota, chief executive of Ambitious about Autism, added: "Ambitious College will provide a vital service for the growing number of young people with complex autism who need to access further education and training opportunities.
"The recent Children's and Families Act means that some young people with autism will now be able to access support in further education and training until they are 25 but there is very limited community-based provision available for those with complex needs. Ambitious College will help to address this growing need and provide the education and training that these young people need to transition successfully to an adult life as part of their communities."
Sports is essentially the world's biggest pastime. So people have generously expanded their interest by collecting sports cards. Baseball has been in the forefront of such endeavors but soon enough –with shrewd marketing strategies and the rise of cable TV, basketball slowly gained popularity and trading/collecting hoops cards caught on in notoriety as well.
Of course, not all cards are created equal, pretty much like our favorite hardwood heroes differ in skill and personality. As hobbyists gorge on cards of superstars like Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Michael Jordan, they ultimately realize the value of such a collection, especially when you have in possession the rarest and most unique cards in existence.
Below are 15 basketball cards that any serious collector readily recognizes. Or in absolute best case scenarios, the majority of these may already be in their hands as crowned jewels of their collection.
1. Panini's Flawless Collection– Kyrie Irving Rookie Autographs Platinum 1/1
Your first set of cards may have cost you (or your Mom's pocket) a couple of dollars but if you happen to set your eyes onto Panini's 2012-13 Flawless Collection, you may have to skip paying mortgage for a month. Yes, a whole pack initially scored at $1,250 but several days after the launch, a kit cost north of 1800 bucks!
Serious basketball collectors who can't afford may opt for what online dealers call “breaking”. A break's concept is actually pretty simple: You simple purchase a spot on a case-breaking website as they rip the packs and reveal the cards one by one as you watch live on a stream. You will then get to pick a card of choice depending on a predetermined order called a “draft”. (For more information on different types of breaks, click here.) This is a wonderful opportunity collectors to own cards on very expensive packs like the Panini Flawless collection. Neat, right?
If you're in luck, you may get one of these babies like Kyrie Irving's platinum rookie card (above) priced at $10,000. Sweet!
2. Bill Russell- 1957 Topps RC#77
If somebody shows you a Bill Russell “rookie” card other than the 1957 Topps, sorry but it probably costs no more than a bag of chips.
Fact is, Russell's 1957 Topps is the only recognized rookie card of the 11-time champion and after whom the Finals MVP is named.
At mint condition (Grade 9), this oldie but goodie could fetch you more than $85,000 on a bad night!
3. George Mikan– 1948 Bowman
At 6-10, 245, Mikan was basketball's original big man. Similar to his cemented status in hoops history, the 1948 Bowman card is unlike any other that it was called the Holy Grail in the world of basketball cards!
In 2009, one with a “Gem Mint 10” sold for $218,550 and six years later, broke its own record by selling at $403,664.
Only one other card on this list topped that price so you may want to hold out a little longer for that one.
4. Pete Maravich, 1970-71 Topps
In this case, it wasn't so much about the price than the player itself. “Pistol” Pete Maravich burst into the scene in 1970 as the NBA's first showman, his flamboyant style earning him the adulation of many fans.
There are reportedly just two Gem Mint 10 cards in existence today (one was sold at $130,000 in 2015)
but I'd be genuinely surprised if it's going to change hands anytime soon.
5. 1980 Topps Larry Bird/Julius Erving/Magic Johnson
Topps did something in the 80's that was never done before in sports cards history: join together three players in one single card.
And if you're in luck, you may get the most unique collection of the group that featured the NBA's biggest stars in the 80's. During that decade, nobody was as popular as Bird, Erving, and Magic, whose teams collectively took nine championships out of 10 seasons. A BVG-9 mint condition card is available at Ebay for over $2000 but some 8's can be grabbed for a couple hundred dollars.
6. 1998-99 SkyBox Thunder Noyz Boyz Michael Jordan #9
The name choice might be terrible but the card is just as cool, especially to dyed-in-the-wool basketball card collectors. The rarity (1:300) and design of the MJ Noyz Boyz make it one of the most coveted Jordan cards produced.
You can have a BGS 9.5 over at Ebay, provided you got $1,300 to spare.
7. LeBron James 2003 Upper Deck Ultimate Collection Rookie Card
This LeBron signed rookie card was the third most expensive basketball card ever sold.
It got auctioned at $312,000 just a few days ago. Not bad considering this came from a pack that retailed at only $125.
The item was also the highest a fan paid for a LeBron memorabilia, blowing the previous one out of the water– another rookie card that was bought at $95,000 by a certain Bill Lee. That doesn't sound like a real name but the guy sure got some real dough.
8. Lew Alcindor 1969 Topps #25
Before Kareem Abdul-Jabbar jumpstarts the fast-breaking “Showtime” Lakers, he was Lew Alcindor that gave the Milwaukee Bucks the one and only championship in franchise history (1971). While he was known foremost for his exploits for the Purple and Gold, Kareem's Lew Alcindor rookie card will stand alone as the priciest basketball card ever, sold at $501,900 as reported by ESPN's Darrell Rover. Of course, we should expect nothing less from the NBA's all-time leading scorer and the only six-time MVP in league history.
Another fun fact:
One very unique feature of this card is the stipulation of Kareem's rookie salary at the back, which is worth an “estimated 5-year, $1,250,000 contract”.
9. Kobe Bryant, 1996 Topps Chrome
Kobe's 1996 Topps Chrome rookie card is certainly not the rarest nor the most expensive. But no basketball card collection can be considered complete without it.
Seriously, call any genuine collector right now and they'll show you their KB 1996 Chrome most probably in pristine condition. (It's cousin the KB 1996 Topps Chrome Refractor is the rarer, more expensive one. A placed bid has the card at a reported $73,000.) Bryant's creative and entertaining style was immortalized in this one moment, making this card The Mamba's most popular ever.
10. Michael Jordan 1986-87 Fleer RC
There are superstars and then there is Michael Jordan.
Widely considered the best to ever wear a pair of basketball sneakers, Jordan's Fleer rookie card is a focal point of any extensive basketball card collection. There could be only THREE of these cards graded perfect 10. So the dollar signs are definitely going to pile up in the years to come. Half a decade ago, Beckett Grading Services reported one pristine card that was sold at $100,000. The tongue wag, the extension, the #23– all the things that made Jordan the pop culture god that he is– is perpetualized in this iconic basketball card
11. Jerry West, 1961 Fleer #43
Do we really have the guts to make a basketball card list without Jerry West? Not me, I don't.
“The Logo” (as well as a number of All-time greats) appeared on Fleer's 1961 edition, which is also the only recognized “rookie” card of the Lakers great.
At Mint 9 condition, this card could go for as much as $15,000.
The second most expensive of the 66 cards in the ‘61 set. Just behind that guy over there…
12. Wilt Chamberlain, 1961 Fleer #8
I'm one of millions of basketball fans who doesn't know why the Philly Warriors logo end up looking like that. But hey, it's Wilt's most desirable card so who cares?
As the only person to have scored 100 in an NBA game and over 4,000 points in a season:
you have a license to wear anything, including that mean-looking mustache.
13. Oscar Robertson, 1961 Fleer #36
More from the legendary 1961 set, this popular card features probably the best all-around player in basketball history, Oscar Robertson.
The “Big O” was the only person to average a triple-double throughout the course of a season which may never be replicated unless you're playing NBA2K.
Supposing you're up to getting one of these cards, this costs at least $250 depending on the grade.
14. 1968-69 Topps Test 19 Jerry West
Jerry West's infectious smile is a common sight since his playing days but this card? Uh-uh.
There is absolutely zero chance you find this one on Ebay.
Unless the person who bought the entire set at $38,838 a few years back decides to go crazy. Many people rightfully want this card so bad and if you happen to be one of them, you better make contacts in major sports auctions companies the first thing tomorrow morning.
15. Julius Erving, ‘72-'73 Topps RC #195
If there's a model card for the 1970's, Erving's Virginia Squires RC is “it”. Four years before the ABA/NBA merger, the high-flying Dr.J quickly entrenched himself as a force to be reckoned with.
Everything in this card– the hair, the colored “money” ball, the background– totally screams 70's!
And one undeniable proof that a collectible piece of cardboard need not be “chromed” and “refracted” to look pretty. Sorry, Kobe!
The Crystal Palace winger is discussing what he wants from being back at the club; from returning “home”, as he calls it; from being where he feels he belongs and where he is “back to reality”.
This is Zaha's first major interview since leaving Manchester United after his “fairytale” £10million transfer - Sir Alex Ferguson's last deal as manager - turned into a living nightmare. He knows that he will have to deal with what went wrong at Old Trafford and there is a searing honesty in his responses as he sits in a small side-room at Palace's training ground ahead of Monday's Premier League encounter at home to Manchester City.
But first the relief - the overwhelming, life-affirming relief of playing again; of being in the team after being marginalised at United where he was left drained of confidence, searching for answers.
“It's a great feeling,” Zaha says. “There is nothing worse than not being involved. You are sitting there thinking ‘what exactly am I? A footballer who is not playing football?' You feel a bit worthless sitting in the stands, watching all the time. You have nothing to speak about with the players.
“If you have played the game then it's ‘well done' or ‘you should have passed here or there'. But when you haven't played… I think people lose a bit of respect for you. I think they are thinking ‘well, he's not played'. They don't have anything to speak to you about. It's a big thing.
• Zaha's move to Man Utd was just too much too soon
“And I'm frustrated when I am not playing. My family is frustrated. My friends are frustrated. It was difficult when it came to a game at United and they were asking me for tickets and asking ‘are you playing?' and that used to cut deep because I would think: ‘I can't just invite my family' because I had that doubt in my head as to whether I was even going to be in the squad. They would come to United and I would be in the stands. Now I am just able to say ‘here's tickets. I am starting the game'. I am happy again.”
Happy but not always smiling. Zaha says it is just the way he looks and that the Palace manager Alan Pardew has also picked him up on it. “The gaffer tells me to smile a bit more but I am just happy to play football,” says Zaha, who is still only 22. “I'm passionate about it. It's nothing to do with a bad attitude. Just because I don't smile a lot people think ‘ah, yeah. He must have a bad attitude'. But if you don't know me you don't know me. That was the problem. My face is just serious!”
Ah, the bad attitude. It is one of the many “rumours” that has hurt Zaha and left him bewildered as to what really went wrong at United.
“There were so many rumours about me that were not true,” he explains. “And they hurt me because all I was doing was keeping my head down to do my best every time and then after training I'd go home and there would be something in the paper or wherever about me not having a good attitude and that's why I wasn't playing, rumours about my private life and that's why I wasn't playing, me turning up late for this, turning up late for that.
“And I was thinking ‘why are people doing this?' I'd worked so hard to get here and now people were trying to bring me down. On top of not playing I had to deal with all that weird nonsense as well.
“When you are playing it just goes out the window. When you are not playing it stays in your head more. You are not even on the bench, you are in the stands every week and then you have people telling you that you are not playing because of your attitude and you know you have done nothing wrong. I worked my hardest in training but I was just unfortunate not to play.”
Zaha has earned two England caps but has not played for his country since Aug 2013
Nothing about Zaha's time at United was straightforward. Having been signed by Ferguson in January 2013, he remained at Palace on loan until the end of the season, helping the club to promotion; after joining up with United permanently, Ferguson immediately departed, to be replaced by David Moyes. He made just four appearances and ended the season on loan at Cardiff.
“When I was there United were going through a transition,” he says. “Sir Alex Ferguson was leaving, which I didn't know before I signed, so I didn't really get the chance that I wanted there because obviously the new manager came in with the pressure of being a Man United manager as well. I can't really blame anyone.
“In saying that I thought I did all right on the (United) pre-season tour but as soon as we got back to England and the Premier League started and the real games came then I wasn't getting a chance and I thought ‘what's going on?'
Zaha feels the pain after clattering into a post in scoring against QPR
“At first I wanted to come back to Palace and David Moyes said he didn't want me to go back to London and I thought ‘why? I'm just sitting here'. So I didn't play for a couple more months before I was sent to Cardiff (on loan). It was just a struggle because I never got any exact answers at United. A couple of times I asked and he (Moyes) said ‘I don't have anything against you' but I didn't feel he gave me a straight answer as to why I wasn't playing.”
Eventually, last August, that straight answer came. “The last straw - when I thought ‘I need to go' - was when United played in the Capital One Cup against MK Dons and they lost (4-0),” Zaha says. “I went down there and didn't play at all. There were reserves who came on and I thought 'I can't just sit here and not be given a chance'. I had worked so hard to get there and hadn't been told why I wasn't playing.
“Eventually I spoke to (Louis) Van Gaal and he said that right now I wasn't good enough to get into the first team and I put my hands up and thought ‘no problem, I will go on loan'. I'd rather he told me. Before that it was just rumours and here was a straight answer. I appreciated that and so I came back to Palace.”
Initially it was a loan. But Zaha was relieved not just when Pardew succeeded Neil Warnock but when the deal was converted into a permanent move, on a five-and-a-half year contract, at the end of the January window. Finally he really was home. “It wasn't planned like that but the gaffer (Pardew) thought it was best for me and I think it was the right decision because I wasn't prepared to go on loan to different teams,” Zaha says.
“I'm just glad he made it permanent so I can have a future. When it was a loan down here I was still thinking ‘what's going to happen when I go back to United?' Because I wasn't going to go through not playing again, going on loan again. Signing here was the best thing for me to do and in the end the gaffer made sure of that.”
Did you know Telegraph Sport has a Manchester United Facebook page?
But what about leaving United? “To be honest, I was happy,' Zaha says. “It was no longer a burden on my back. The thing was if I had a bad game I was ‘the Man United reject'. If I had a good game it was ‘Man United star on loan'. And I just thought ‘I don't need that anymore'. One minute I was hero; the next minute I was zero. I just didn't need it. I'd rather just play football.”
And so he is relishing working with Pardew and relishing being in the Premier League – and performing well.
Alan Pardew has brought the best out of Zaha at Palace
“I have trust in him and he has trust in me. When he says he will do something he will do it,” Zaha explains. “This gaffer understands that I am not going to get everything right, that it's my job to create and try and take on people.
"You are not going to keep hold of the ball constantly when you are trying things. He understands that I am going to mess up a couple of times but there is that one chance, two chances, when there will be a decent end product.
“And that's what I am working on – to make that consistent because that's the main thing in the Premier League. He's prepared to work with me. I've been out there for hours with him working on running out wide and into the box to get on the end of things. That's something that I wasn't really doing. I had a tap-in where I nearly broke my hip and another goal when I just gambled and ran. Those are the things he is trying to put into our games and I appreciate that.”
Zaha scores his third goal of the season at Stoke
Pardew has had a huge effect on the whole club: when Palace kicked off in their first league game under his stewardship - against Tottenham in January - they were second from bottom. Six league wins later, and Palace are sitting pretty in mid-table, and Pardew is being spoken of as a possible manager of the year.
“The gaffer brought strategies,” Zaha says. “There is that side of the game but also simple things like putting your arm around people and speaking to them. We are not robots. We go out there and do our jobs but at the same time we have feelings as well so if you speak to someone and see how they are feeling then you make them feel better about themselves when they do go out on the pitch. That's how I felt anyway.
"I'm here now, I love the fans, they are part of the team, home-grown, they have given me nothing but support, even when I left, I'm playing well again and have got my confidence back.”
Plenty of progressive voices in the media have piled on to the President's comments about the crusades and the moral equivocating in play when trying to describe the global destruction caused by radical Islamic terrorists. There's more than a little material available to debate exactly how “evil” the crusaders were (to put it mildly) but it's true that the Spanish inquisition took place along with other dark moments across man's history. None of that, however, has much relevance in terms of the 21st century and what's happening here and now.
One person who is fed up with this verbal wrangling is conservative Atlants radio host Michael Graham. In fact, he's fed up to the point where he's willing to put his money where his mouth is, and is calling out the liberals who echo Obama's statements to do the same in what he is calling The Crusader Wager.
Put up or shut up. Every time the topic of violence in the name of Islam comes up on my radio show or my Twitter timeline, I hear the argument that President Obama made: “The problem isn't Islam—it's extremism.” While it may appear that Islam has a unique problem regarding fundamentalist violence, you p.c.-types say, the real problem is fundamentalism in and of itself. And since other religions have fundamentalists and extremists, too, (which they do) Christians should “get off their high horse,” “slavery,” “Crusades,” etc. etc. This is, obviously, nonsense. No one who says it believes it. It's just a dodge, a political-correct blocking movement for people, who for whatever reason, don't want to deal with the Natural Truth: No other religion today has the same problem of fundamentalist violence as Islam. I've gotten so tired of this ridiculous claim, that I'm now insisting the people who make it put their money where their mouth is—and do so for a good cause. It's called the “Crusader Wager.”
Here's how it works. Graham is going to set aside $100 for “every death committed in the name of fundamentalist Christianity” in 2015. Any liberal who is willing to put up rather than shutting up needs to agree to put up one dollar for every person killed in the name of Islamist fundamentalism and violent jihad. That's a one hundred to one ratio in their favor. At the end of the year they will add up the total figures. If there is more money for all of the people killed by Christian crusaders, Graham will donate it to the charity of the liberal's choice. If the pool of money for everyone killed by Muslim terrorists is larger, the liberal must donate it to the Salvation Army. (Christian crusaders… get it?)
Let's see if anyone takes Michael up on his offer. Are there any Christian terrorists which could qualify under the terms of the wager? The only one that comes to mind is Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda and Sudan. (Calling them “Christians” is pretty insulting, but progressives will make the case that ISIS isn't composed of very good Muslims either. The point is that the LRA call themselves Christians and claim to base their beliefs on the Ten Commandments.)
In any event, I can't wait to see if somebody takes this up so we can tally the results next January. The worst that will happen is that some charity will get more money to do their work. ( For full disclosure, Michael Graham is on the Salem radio network, a subsidiary of Hot Air's parent company .)

Crony capitalism is an emerging political issue. From socialists like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) to conservatives like Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), there has been a bipartisan call to end crony capitalism. Both parties want to stop wealthy individuals from using the government to underwrite bad investments.
When the 2008 crash hit, voices on the right and left were outraged that the Bush administration and Congress allowed a bailout of Wall Street with no repercussions for those who got us there. Liberals called for criminal prosecutions and conservatives called for no government bailout.
Billionaires using friends in the federal and state governments to underwrite risky investments from failed green energy programs to precarious space exploration are not a new phenomenon, yet that practice seems to getting more pervasive and involving more taxpayer's money. Rich individuals love the idea of investments where they make money if the idea or technology works, and the taxpayers pick up the tab if it fails.
The many companies run by Elon Musk are excellent case studies in cronyism. Recently, members of Congress have raised concerns about the lack of oversight into SpaceX's, Musk's space exploration company, regarding a launch failure it suffered in late June. However, SpaceX's use of government funding, subsidies and tax credits is the big scandal.
A June article by Los Angeles Times, “Elon Musk's growing empire is fueled by $4.9 billion in government subsidies,” provided evidence that the government is loading up Musk's three companies, SpaceX, Tesla and SolarCity, with taxpayer-backed subsidies. This is not fair to Americans who are hurting right now that they are being used to pad the pockets of a guy who is already super rich—yet his companies would be bellied up without massive infusions of money from taxpayers.
The Times reported “Tesla and SolarCity continue to report net losses after a decade in business, but the stocks of both companies have soared on their potential; Musk's stake in the firms alone is worth about $10 billion.” Of course the stock is soaring, because the government has subsidized the billionaire's companies with even more billions. Investors know the government is insuring that money will flow into a crony's company and that makes it a good bet.
SolarCity has been the beneficiary of $750 million from the New York taxpayers to build a solar panel factory in and has secured a lease for $1 a year with no property taxes. The federal government has provided direct grants of about $500 million. Solar analyst Travis Hoium had this to say about SolarCity: “Simply put, the company wouldn't exist in the form in which we now know it without the government funding.”
Tesla motor company has secured $1.3 billion in incentives to help build a battery plant in Nevada. USA Today reported that the Tesla $127,000 deluxe electrical performance sedans were undrivable because of a tech glitch. The government is subsidizing the manufacture of cars that would cost the average American about two and one half years to buy. The cars are very expensive and they don't seem to work well. I would not invest in this company, yet it seems that the Obama Administration has already made that decision for me when they gave them $452 billion as part of the Stimulus plan.
SpaceX company has been awarded billions of dollars in government contracts with much of the work yet to be completed. For example, the SpaceX rocket that recently exploded was being launched in an attempt to deliver cargo to the International Space Station as part of a $1.6 billion contract. While Congress has questioned the technical investigation into the failure, SpaceX continues to compete for government contracts.
There have been multiple articles recently on SpaceX purchasing $165 million of SolarCity bonds. Elon Musk owns more than 20 million shares, which is 20 percent of SolarCity. Musk will personally benefit substantially if the SpaceX purchase brings other investors to SolarCity.
It is unusual for a company to utilize cash to invest in the debt of a higher risk company, because it is not a good business decision. It may be good for one man, Musk, but it is not a smart investment for everybody else.
In June 2014, the NASA Office of Inspector General found that SpaceX could not identify the costs incurred and was not able to separate the amounts billed and collected for Space Act Agreement contracts. These are the very same type of contract NASA issued to SpaceX to launch cargo to the International Space Station.
A grand total of $4.9 billion in government money has been entrusted to Elon Musk from the taxpayers. Let's hope that the government does not throw more good money after the bad and continue to prop up Musk's companies that are not making any money.

A UNC economics professor is receiving praise from students and colleagues alike for de-masking streakers who interrupted her classroom Thursday.Rita Balaban says it happened around noon, about an hour into her ECON 101 lecture. As she was instructing a class of 375 students inside UNC's Carroll Hall, three men, stark naked and wearing nothing but rubber masks, came screaming and running through a side door."I look for a second. I take pause and I'm like, woah!," Balaban explained her shock as she watched the streakers sprint up the aisles of the room toward the back.Once they reached the top of the aisle, two of them turned around came running back toward Balaban."To me, it was a no-brainer," she said. "It was like, you're coming right at me. This is too easy. I grab the one guys mask and just -pfsh!- pulled it right off, no problem! The other guy wasn't so easy. He drugs me out into the hall."Balaban says she pinned back the arms of one streaker as he tried darting out a side door, eventually de-masking him as well.UNC Dept. of Public Safety spokesperson Randy Young said officers cited one of the streakers, a UNC student, with indecent exposure.Balaban said while she's able to laugh about it now, she was pretty shaken up during the commotion."Just pure anger," she described her reaction toward the men exposing themselves to her and her students. "You know, you're violating my classroom. This is offensive to me. It's just rude."Walking back into her classroom Thursday, a mask in either hand, Balaban said her students erupted in praise.Balaban said streakers have been known to disrupt her colleagues' classrooms in years past, so she was prepared should it ever happen to her."I then always said, I would find out who it was," she recalled. "If I had a chance, I would take the masks off to embarrass them even more that way."She said her colleagues and some UNC administrators have been applauding her as well for her actions. When asked if she had handled anything differently, she said she wouldn't change a thing."For me personally, I think this deserves some sort of suspension from school," she said. "You're disrupting a classroom!"
NSA's Personal Propagandist For CBS Officially Takes Counterterrorism Job Everyone Knew He Was Getting
from the journalism! dept
When 60 Minutes did its hack PR job for the NSA a few weeks ago, lots of people called out the fact that the reporter who handled the segment, John Miller, wasn't just a former intelligence official working for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (which oversees the NSA), but that he was widely rumored to have worked out a deal for a new job for the NYPD, heading up "counterterrorism." Even though there were multiple reports at the time, including one that claimed it was a "99.44% done deal," when asked about it, Miller lied. He told a reporter , "you know as much about this as I do."That was clearly Miller lying -- something that Miller has had an issue with in the past -- as the "rumor" is now confirmed and Miller has accepted his job doing "counterterrorism" for the NYPD. And while some might say that doing counterterrorism for a city police force is different than working for national intelligence, that's only because you're not familiar with the NYPD, which has set up something of a shadow NSA/CIA to do all sorts of activities not normally associated with a police force.And, of course, since the press was clearly familiar with Miller's expected role, it raises serious questions about why 60 Minutes allowed the puff piece to move forward with a seriously conflicted "journalist." While Miller has lashed out at critics, rather than respond to a single point raised, the brand that comes out worst in all this is clearly CBS and 60 Minutes -- which basically let an intelligence official do an entire propaganda piece on the NSA. 60 Minutes used to be about hard hitting journalism. Now, apparently, they think it's "journalism" to shill for the surveillance state.

Prosecutors in Argentina are appealing a judge's refusal to try Jeremy Clarkson and his former Top Gear co-hosts over their number-plate swap during their controversial south American jaunt.
Argentinian Falklands War veterans confirmed last night they had been told in a private meeting the decision would be contested with a higher court.
Maria Cristina Barrionuevo last month ruled Clarkson deliberately entered Argentina with a Falklands-referenced number plate.
Former Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson may be forced to return to Argentina to be questioned in court after entering the country with the controversial number plate H982 FKL
She rubbished claims by the BBC and the presenter - fired in March after an unprovoked attack on a producer - that the use of the plate H982 FKL on Clarkson's infamous Porsche was an 'unfortunate coincidence'.
But she rejected demands to formally investigate the Top Gear team for changing the plate before angry locals forced them out of the country, concluding programme chiefs had acted to avert more conflict.
Osvaldo Hillard, spokesman for the Malvinas Veterans Centre in the southern city of Ushuaia, confirmed local prosecutor Daniel Curtale had promised them an appeal which in a worst-case scenario for Clarkson could lead to him being sentenced to three years in jail.
He said: 'We do not share Judge Barrionuevo's interpretation of events in the slightest.
'We believe the Top Gear people changed the number plates in the full knowledge that what they were doing was illegal.'
Claiming he was 'surprised' the judge ruled without calling on war veterans to testify, he added: 'They called other people in and not us who were the ones who saw the Porsche had another number plate on on the last day of filming and reported it to the police.
'I'm very respectful of the justice system but I think they should have acted differently.'
The appeal will be heard by judges in the nearby city of the Rio Grande, where Clarkson's Porsche is thought to be in storage.
Clarkson and his pals are expected to be asked to return to southern Argentina for a court grilling.
The vehicle at the centre of the storm had the number plate HI VAE on it when Top Gear workers abandoned it by the side of the road last October before fleeing across the border to Chile to escape stone-throwing locals.
They had been filming for a Christmas special which went ahead despite the diplomatic furore that ensued.
Under Argentinian law, illegal number plate changes can entail a conviction for falsification and a prison sentence of up to three years.
Mr Curtale asked judge Barrionuevo to open a criminal investigation for alleged falsification last year after the Top Gear escape from Argentina.
The judge said in her recent ruling, referring to the Falklands as the Malvinas: 'It should be understood that it is not up to me to investigate or evaluate the decision - arrogant and disrepectful to say the least - by the Top Gear production team to enter the country with one or more Malvinas-referenced number plates.
The former Top Gear team (from left) Richard Hammond, Jeremy Clarkson and James May, are rumoured to be close to signing up to online service Netflix to create a new version of the motoring series
'Nor is it my job to gauge the reaction - anticipated - of citizens to such an offence.
'My responsibility is to analyse whether a crime has been committed under Argentinian law in relation to the removal from the Porsche of the original number plate H982 FKL and its replacement by another.'
Concluding Top Gear chiefs had not acted in 'bad faith' in changing the plates and their hand was forced by 'massive government and popular pressure', she added: 'It led them to remove the original number plate and replace it with another which in principle wouldn't have negative connotations with the aim of ending the main focus of conflict and avoiding violent reactions by locals which indeed ended up taking place.
'The change was not done in a surreptitious way, but with the knowledge and approval of the presenters who participated in meetings with the programme producers.' The BBC has consistently denied suggestions the Porsche was bought for its number plate, or the number plate was changed after it was purchased.
Clarkson, 55, and his former Top Gear co-hosts are rumoured to be close to signing up to online service Netflix to create a new version of the motoring series.
For far too long, the debate about Scandinavian anti-Semitism in the Israeli English-language media has been hijacked by extremists. Last week, Dr. Manfred Gerstenfeld again depicted Norway as a Jew-hating hub, overflowing with anti-Semitic media and politicians.
Anti-Semitism is a cancer that Europe can't seem to completely get rid of, despite education systems highlighting tolerance and lessons from history. To be sure, raising awareness and engaging in a serious debate on Norwegian anti-Semitism is crucial and most welcome. However, Gerstenfeld and his peers paint a false and exaggerated picture in their promotion of Norway as a major purveyor of anti-Semitism. Such discourse does not only describe reality inaccurately, but is also counter-productive and damaging to serious efforts in fighting anti-Semitism.

Applying history selectively
The study shows that Norway has hard work ahead in combating such attitudes. However, it also reveals that the level of anti-Semitism in Norway is on par with other Western European states. The survey describes a complicated picture where 11% felt antipathy towards Jews, while 27% felt a special sympathy for them. Also, Norwegians are more prejudiced to other minorities. While the population preferred to be friends with Americans, Catholics and Jews, they were most negative toward interaction with Muslims, Somalis and people of Roma background.
A study conducted by the Anti-Defamation League on European anti-Semitism supports these findings by placing Norway between Holland and the UK. Gerstenfeld's assessment that 1.5 million out of 5 million Norwegians are anti-Semitic, seems at best unserious for anyone familiar with the country, and is based on a simplistic reading of an intricate study. If 38% of the population is anti-Semitic, why do 92% believe it is important to teach children about the Shoah?
Gerstenfeld and likeminded scholars also apply history selectively, and mention only events that strengthen their argument. Typically, the late admission of Jews into Norway or the anti-Israeli riots in Oslo during Operation Cast Lead are cited. While these incidents indeed taint Norwegian history, other events are conveniently overlooked, like the close political and grassroots relationship between Norway and Israel during the Ben-Gurion era, or early collaboration between the Norwegian Labor Union and the Histadrut.
Reality isn't black and white
In addition, hard-line critics seem to be unaware of the complexities of the current debate in the country. Norwegian anti-Semitism has been the focus of all major media outlets, and coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has, according to the leader of the Jewish community, improved over the last years. Because most of the discourse is not available in English, much of it may not be picked up by foreign commentators. That can explain why Gerstenfeld falsely labels the Norwegian prime minister as a part-time anti-Semite.
Gerstenfeld describes Norwegian media and political elite as unbalanced, anti-Israeli and anti-Semitic. Indeed, the many layers of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are at times overlooked in newspapers, and commentators now and then make judgments based on shallow knowledge of the Middle East. However, Gerstenfeld falls into the same trap himself. Without an adequate understanding of Norwegian culture and context, he time and again engages in black and white analysis and conclusions. Ervin Kohn, the leader of the Jewish community in Norway, previously described Gerstenfeld's allegations as untrue, and accused him of painting an unbalanced picture of the situation of Jews in the country.
Israel , I have learned that reality is very far from black and white. This lesson applies everywhere.

The Secret Vault of the Queen of Thieves – a 3rd level, city-based adventure scenario for Torchbearer RPG by Thor Olavsrud is now available via the Burning Store in pdf format, featuring cover art by Peter Mullen, interior art by Todd James and cartography by Dyson Logos!
Tamar, secretive master thief of the port city of Highwater, is dead. The rumors say she dropped face-first into a bowl of soup yesterday while supping with her lover, Lady Attar, at the Three of Cups in Saltown near the docks. It happened just days after she stole the fist-sized jewel known as the Jackal's Eye from the sinister Cult of Maata Re, Mistress of Plagues. Her lover has not been seen since.
Amidst the stories of conspiracy and murder, the underworld of Highwater is abuzz with tales of the secret vault of the Queen of Thieves, where Tamar is thought to have kept priceless trophies of her many adventures, perhaps even the Jackal's Eye, along with deadly traps to guard them. The race is on to find the vault; whoever does may become wealthy beyond their wildest imaginings.
The Secret Vault of the Queen of Thieves is a short city-based adventure geared for 3rd level and higher Torchbearer characters, though even lower level characters are viable if played skillfully. It should take a session or two of play. This scenario is set in the port city of Highwater, but you can drop it into your game whenever the characters visit a Bustling Metropolis or Busy Crossroads in your home setting.
This first “official” Torchbearer scenario since The Dread Crypt of Skogenby features fiendish traps, a new monster, a new town for adventurers to hail from and two new town locations – the Docks and the Thieves' Guild!

Congress has really outdone itself this time. On Monday, neoconservative Republicans in the Senate were apparently so eager to go to war with Iran that they broke a federal law known as the Logan Act in the process. The Logan Act has been around since 1799 and has remained mostly unchanged, created to keep rogue members of Congress from undermining foreign relations.
How did Senate Republicans violate the Logan Act? Well they did that by being war mongers. But more specifically, when 47 members of Congress signed onto a letter that was sent to Iranian officials in an attempt to undermine the peace deal with Iran, they clearly violated the act — and also all committed felonies. According to Cornell University, the act reads:
Any citizen of the United States, wherever he may be, who, without authority of the United States, directly or indirectly commences or carries on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof, with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States, or to defeat the measures of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.
And the precedent has already been clearly set. In the case United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp. (1936), Justice Sutherland wrote in the majority opinion:
The President alone has the power to speak or listen as a representative of the nation. He makes treaties with the advice and consent of the Senate; but he alone negotiates. Into the field of negotiation the Senate cannot intrude, and Congress itself is powerless to invade it.
The Republicans, who so often talk of the Constitution almost as highly as they talk of their support for Israel, seem to have trampled over the document multiple times in as many weeks. You see, when they invited Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to speak to Congress, they were also in violation of the Logan Act then too. John Boehner is mostly at fault for the Netanyahu fiasco, though, so he's the only member of the House that should prosecute for that.
However, 47 members of the US Senate — all Republicans — have clearly violated the Logan Act, and should be punished to the fullest extent of the law. Three years in prison for 47 members of our war mongering Congress? I would support that. The real question is: will enough Americans stand up and carry out the laws that are written plain as day in the Constitution, or will we simply sit back and expect the government to punish itself?
President Obama, who himself has shown little to no respect for the Constitution, seems to have no interest in prosecuting the war mongering 47, so that's up to us to carry out. A petition to charge the Senators has already racked up over 40,000 signatures overnight (UPDATE: the petition has now surpassed 100,000 signatures, which means the White House will have to respond to it).
However, Citizen's arrest seems to be a more effective plan of action than petitioning. These 47 men committed felonies and should be charged just as any one of us regular folks would be when we commit a crime. Who should we arrest first? John McCain or Lindsey Graham?
