Unfortunately for Colin Kaepernick, his life as a free agent might be a little on the long side. Even though many teams are in need of a good quarterback, Kaepernick has drawn little interest as of late.
According to one report, the reasons could be that over two thirds of the NFL team execs “genuinely hate” him.
— Spike Lee thinks it's ‘fishy' that Colin Kaepernick remains a free agent —
An anonymous AFC general manager said that Kaepernick has alienated many in the NFL front offices by protesting too much during last season. This GM says that about 70 percent of the teams “genuinely hate him and can't stand what he did. They want nothing to do with him. They won't move on. They think showing no interest is a form of punishment.”
The other teams aren't interested either. Some say he just isn't good enough anymore and others worry about backlash from fans or even Donald Trump himself.
“I think some teams also want to use Kaepernick as a cautionary tale to stop other players in the future from doing what he did,” the GM went on.
The State Land Board can either stop the sale of the Elliott or sell it this Tuesday!
The Department of State Lands (DSL) released the agenda for the State Land Board meeting on February 14th in Salem. In it the DSL has requested to proceed with the direct sale of the Elliott State Forest.
“The Department will initiate negotiations in good faith with the plan proposers towards a binding Purchase and Sale Agreement (PSA), and an eventual transfer of ownership of the Elliott Property to the Elliott Forest LLC, unless and to the extent the Board directs the Department otherwise.”
In other words, unless the State Land Board tells the Department of State Lands to not sell the Elliott, it will be officially sold.
The newly elected State Land Board members need to hear from us before they make a decision on Tuesday. Secretary of State Dennis Richardson and State Treasurer Tobias Read are the new members, and this will be their first State Land Board meeting.
What the State Land Board needs to know from us:
The Elliott needs to remain in public ownership.
The DSL is disregarding the Land Board decision in December to look into other options.
We still have time to create a new plan for the future of the forest.
The common school fund needs to be decoupled from the revenue of the Elliott, but not at the cost of loosing our public lands.
Who to call and write to:
Next Steps
Please join us at the State Land Board Meeting on Tuesday! Wear green to show your support for the Elliott. The meeting is from 10:00 am – 12:00 pm at the Oregon Department of State Lands Land Board Room 775, Summer St NE, Salem.
This could turn into the State Land Board meeting where the Elliott is finally sold. Please have conversations with your friends and other organizers to make sure that the Elliott is not sold quietly. Basically the shit should hit the fan if this happens! Who wants to bring the bag of shit?!?
Please get creative in the ways we as a community are reacting to this proposal. Don't let the Land Board think that they can get away with doing nothing. Because if they do nothing, the Elliott will be sold.

The Australian website also features images of a semi-naked young woman it says is "Liz, an American Apparel Melbourne retail employee". In one shot, the former Melbourne retail assistant is pictured topless, in a short skirt, her long hair covering just one breast. In another, she is lying provocatively in a leotard, on an unmade bed. The company, which opened its first Australian store in Melbourne in March last year, and has since opened stores in Sydney and Adelaide, is renowned for using staff in its advertising campaigns that are often shot by its controversial LA-based founder, Dov Charney. It also asks prospective sales staff to submit up to three photos of themselves as part of the job application process. Katrina George, a spokeswoman for Women's Forum Australia, condemned the company's use of "dangerous" and "pornographic" images. "It goes without saying that most of the images of women on that website are overtly sexualised and some of them you would have to call pornographic. It's another example of the normalisation of pornography in popular culture."
Ms George said it was also concerning that the men on the site were not sexualised in the same way women were. Clive Hamilton, the professor of public ethics at the Centre for Applied Philosophy and Public Ethics, and former chief of the Australia Institute, which issued the 2006 report, Corporate Pedophilia, on the use of images of children in advertising, is also concerned about the impact the images could have on children. "Clearly they are using pornographic-style images, pornographic-style poses in order to promote the product, and what it does is it normalises the pornographic genre," he said. "On this website there is also a section for children's clothes, which means kids who go to have a look at the website for clothes for themselves are just one click away from adult women posing in ways that are unquestionably sexually provocative." The Advertising Standards Bureau's chief executive officer, Fiona Jolly, was unavailable for comment but The Sun-Herald understands that it has not received any complaints about the imagery.
Ms George also raised concerns that young American Apparel staff might feel "pressured" to appear in the company's provocative advertising campaigns. However, a spokeswoman for American Apparel said it only used staff who "applied" to take part. "We very often photograph employees to appear in ads and catalogues, on our website and in-store art," said the spokeswoman. "Employees and fans of the company apply to model for us on a daily basis, we also sometimes scout them on our own. Photo shoots are often done with members of our creative team or other employees, like in Liz's case." Since launching the label in 1997, Mr Charney has been the subject of four sexual harassment lawsuits brought by former employees. None have been proven in court. In 2004, an article in the now-defunct US women's magazine, Jane, accused Mr Charney of masturbating in front of the reporter. He has never denied the allegation but said it was consensual.
The Air Force wants miniature drones that can perch and wait days or weeks for a target before attacking with an explosive warhead. Prototypes are already flying.
Battery power is the biggest limitation for small drones. Consumer quadrotors like the DJI Phantom can fly for half an hour or so. Fixed-wing craft like the military RQ-11B Raven stretch this to 90 minutes, but not nearly enough for prolonged surveillance. One way to get around this problem is to land—then only the camera and communications systems are drawing power. Perching has two other advantages: a stationary drone is less conspicuous than one circling overhead, and it has a stable vantage point close to the target. It's better to watch from a tree 100 feet away than a Predator at 10,000 feet.
Some drones already have "perch and stare" capability. AeroVironment's Qube , a quadrotor built for the police and military, can set down on any flat surface with its long landing legs. Quadrotors can set down easily enough, but landing is harder for fixed wing drones, especially when flat surfaces are not available. A truly useful drone would be able to perch as easily as a bird, taking advantage of streetlights or tree branches.
It's better to watch from a tree 100 feet away than a Predator at 10,000 feet.
The Air Foce has funded considerable research into this area, some of it under the Perching Micro Air Weapon project. This calls for a bird-sized drone able to land on structures—"power lines, trees, buildings, ground, etc"—send back video from three miles away, then take off again and perch elsewhere. The drone would carry a small warhead "on the order of half a pound of high energy explosive which will be used to target people and/or lightweight vehicles," similar to the existing SwitchBlade lethal drone .
Eye in the Sky Bleecker Street Media
If you saw the recent thriller Eye In The Sky starring Alan Rickman and Helen Mirren, that movie features not only a USAF MQ-9 Reaper watching from overhead, but two more exotic drones like the ones the Air Force wants to build. One resembles a bird, the other an insect. The drones in the movie have flapping wings, but the Air Force is taking the simpler approach of using fixed wings or rotors. The Perching Micro Air Weapon can do something the drones in the movie cannot: recharge itself by solar cells or other means. "The ability to harvest power/energy from external sources is critical to persistent surveillance," the specification says. This would allow a drone to wait days for the right moment to strike a target.
Perching is a surprisingly complicated manuver. Thankfully, birds perfected the technique millions of years ago and researchers have gleaned much valuable information from watching slow-motion video of them. Perching involves a well-controlled stall just above the perch, halting in mid-air so the bird just drops on to the surface. Even a clumsy flyer like a heron can land neatly on a fence, and drones ought to be able to do the same.
Bhargav Gajjar of Vishwa Robotics developed perching legs for drones based on a hawk. The spring-loaded claws have a powerful grip that should help make up for any residual speed that might otherwise cause the drone to bounce off its perch.
The Air Force didn't choose Gajjar's design, but two other projects made it to prototype stage. The version of the Perching Micro Air Weapon developed by Design Intelligence Incorporated with assistance from Oklahoma State University resembles a bird and could pass unnoticed almost anywhere. The drone has a modular design so that, like the Israeli ROTEM quadrotor , the payload can be switched from intelligence-gathering to lethal strike version. However they never actually fitted the drone with explosives. "The project was very successful, but the Air Force decided not to pursue it any further," James Grimsley, CEO of DII, told PM. DII has now moved on to developing small, solar-powered drones for non-military and commercial applications.
Aethermachines perching drone patent Aethermachines
The other prototype appears to have progressed further. The 3-lb. drone made by Aethermachines Inc is a more radical design that the company describes as "insect-like ". The 3D-printed drone has two shrouded rotors and takes off and lands vertically. The rotors act as wheels on the ground so the insect drone can scuttle along inside buildings and other closed spaces. It has a tiny ultrasonic sensor which, along with a set of accelerometers, allows it to perch.
Flight time is only 10 minutes per charge, but the insect can recharge itself in 40 minutes by perching on a power line and scavenging energy. This is its camouflage. Rather than pretending to be a monster insect, the drone is disguised to like any of the other anonymous black boxes hanging out near power equipment that nobody ever notices. Aethermachines's insect is a bomber rather than a kamikaze, with "the ability to aim and discharge the payload, allowing the MAV [Micro Air Vehicle] to return for reuse unless expendability is required by the mission." The payload can be either an explosive warhead or marking dye. With the latter, the target becomes a marked man easily identified later by security forces.
Perching drones might make good perimeter guards—like a minefield, but with human oversight and control.
Aethermachines patented an early design in 2010 that already had all these elements: the perching mechanism, power scavenging, rotor/wheels, color video camera, and "expellable offensive payload." The company claims it cannot discuss subsequent progress after the successful prototype. They may have passed it on to an industry partner for further development or production, as Aethermachines is not a manufacturer.
Meanwhile, there are many new players in the field of perching drones. Some, like the aptly named GRASP Laboratory at Penn State, are working on claws that not only perch but also can pick up objects . Harvard's diminutive Robobees recently showed they can land on and stick to any surface using static electricity. Perching is unlikely to be a novelty for much longer.
Perching brings significant benefits, especially for military operations. Unlike other forms of airpower, perching drones can effectively occupy terrain, allowing the operators to see and engage any vehicles or people on foot in the area. Perching drones might make good perimeter guards—like a minefield, but with human oversight and control. They might move around to form ad-hoc unmanned checkpoints, reading the license plates of passing vehicles from roadside perches. Or they might, as the Air Force seems to imply, be used offensively, released from aircraft to find and attack specific individuals in urban environments, even inside buildings. The future of air war is sophisticated, small, and scary.
David Hambling's book Swarm Troopers: How small drones will conquer the world is out now.
EXCLUSIVE: Government Cuts Medicare Claims for Professional Rugby
As if the Australian Rugby Union was not in enough trouble already. Green and Gold Rugby can reveal that Jenny Benjamin, the National Manager of Medicare and Veterans Branch has informed ARU CEO Bill Pulver that Medicare expenses will no longer be covered by Medicare and will have to be paid for by the franchises and the ARU.
In other words, Super Rugby clubs will now have to pay for their own scans and other medical treatment for players which will cause extra financial strain on their already tight budgets. This is the case for all Australian sports but places Australian Rugby in a precarious predicament due to their existing financial situation. This decision is ominous for the future of Australian Rugby as it has the potential to bankrupt them.
Talking to G&GR, ARU CEO Bill Pulver expressed concern over the plans.
“In essence, if the Government proceeded with this change it would add substantial cost to the Australian Rugby industry. As a consequence we are now in a close dialogue with the Government in an effort to put a stop to these plans” he said.
Medicare have highlighted the fact that under subsection 19(3) of the Health Insurance Act 1973, Medicare benefits are not payable in respect of a professional service in circumstances where the patient's employer is liable for, or has paid for, the service, or where the service was connected with the person's employment.
A review by the Medicare Department of Human Services decided that it would not be beneficial to continue funding sporting medical expenses and have thus, discontinued processing claims as of May 24 2014. In other words, this change will be backdated to May 24, applied to all professional sport.
Currently, an MRI scan costs $330 and a CT scan costs $250. With no Medicare rebate, private insurance will not pay up and there is no bulk billing, which means the player will need to pay cash on the spot and then claim the money back from the franchise.
This is the same in the ER when a player gets a cut or knock. In one franchise, just last week one player had 3 stitches put in at a cost of $836. Another player had an internal scan and check up which cost $2140. Again, without any rebate, franchises will be fully responsible for these costs. This same franchise had 5 MRIs, just last week (total cost more than $1500).
Then there's sports medicine – vital in the modern game. For just one well known super player's recent knee injury, he's had three physio sessions on a specialist running machine where the physio cost $160 and the machine time ($200 per session). Not to mention an MRI ($330) and specialist consultation ($240). Total: $1650
Many clubs are already struggling and some rely on the Australian Rugby Union for financial aid. This issue has the potential to be very problematic for Australian Rugby at precisely the wrong time.
Silverstone has hosted the British Grand Prix on an exclusive basis since 1987
It has not definitively happened yet, but it is now almost certain that Silverstone will in the next few days exercise an option to end its contract to host the British Grand Prix after 2019.
To those unversed in the long-running politics surrounding the race, this will sound like shocking and worrying news. To long-time observers, it will be met with a wearisome sigh - "oh no, here we go again".
The future of the British Grand Prix has been in doubt for as long as many people in Formula 1 can remember. The current contract, signed at the end of 2009 for a 17-year period, was meant to end that. But it has done anything but. The devil was in the detail.
Silverstone desperately wants to host the British Grand Prix but it cannot do it at any price
F1's former boss Bernie Ecclestone had a difficult relationship with Silverstone. Baiting them, criticising the track, its owners the British Racing Drivers' Club and pretty much anything to do with the race was something of a sport for him.
For Ecclestone, this was rooted in Silverstone's inability to pay him the money he wanted to host the race. Not benefiting from the largesse of a government, the BRDC has to make the event work financially, and as Ecclestone's fees went up, that became increasingly difficult.
That is still the core of the problem.
The current contract - signed at the end of a tedious few years of speculation and machinations concerning the future of the race - was for £12m in the first year, 2010. But it has a 5% annual escalator in it. So this year, the race is costing £16.9m. By 2019, it will be £18.6m, and by 2027, the final year of the deal if it were to run its course, £27.5m.
Lewis Hamilton has won the British GP four times - including the last three in a row
These numbers are massively less than some circuits are paying - for example, Bahrain pays at least $40m (£31m) a year; Russia $50m (£38.7m); Azerbaijan a reputed $75m (£58m).
But those races all have one thing in common - they are funded by authoritarian governments keen to promote their country to the world. Silverstone is a private members' club that has to run a viable business.
Silverstone desperately wants to host the British Grand Prix but it cannot do it at any price. The BRDC has a responsibility to protect the track in the interests of British motor racing. It cannot do that if it goes bankrupt because of the F1 contract.
Negotiations with the new owners of F1, who took over from Ecclestone in January, are still ongoing but have pretty much reached an impasse. F1, now owned by US group Liberty Media, has said it cannot renegotiate an existing contract. If it did, after all, the next thing would be they would have a whole bunch of other tracks knocking on their door demanding the same thing.
It has been leaked to Reuters that the F1 Group offered to take the race over for five years - saving Silverstone some money. But that only looks like largesse if you don't look very closely. It still leaves Silverstone with a contract from 2023-27 that it cannot afford.
No circuit can boast an older association with Formula 1 than Silverstone, which hosted the World Championship's first race in 1950, complete with makeshift royal box
So the circuit is set to end the contract and hope it can renegotiate a new one on better terms.
The BRDC knows this is a risk but it is a risk it cannot afford not to take.
So then the question becomes, what does F1 do next?
You can forget right off the bat any suggestion that any other permanent circuit in Britain could host the race. There is none suitable for a start - and none that could afford it either.
F1 chairman Chase Carey and commercial boss Sean Bratches have made it clear they value Silverstone highly and that they see the British Grand Prix as an irreplaceable part of the F1 calendar. But that does not mean the race has to be at Silverstone.
They have also talked about wanting races in "destination cities". That is usually a reference to a desire to have further events in the US in places such as New York and Los Angeles. But it could just as easily apply to the UK. After all, very few cities rival London for global cachet and appeal.
But the practical issues preventing a grand prix in London are immense - air quality, noise pollution, traffic complications, location, planning and, of course, money. Who would fund it? Where would the cash come from?
Carey and Bratches are highly accomplished businessmen but it would take some kind of miracle to resolve all those issues.
In reality, surely, if there is to be a British Grand Prix after 2019, it has to be at Silverstone. But there will likely be a whole load of hot air and headaches before it is finally sorted out.
BERKELEY, CA — A Berkeley Police officer seized two loaded, concealed guns on consecutive nights during traffic stops. Two suspects were also arrested in connections with the guns - Walter Green 32, of Berkeley, and Lamar Cotton 32, of Richmond.
According to the police, "The Berkeley Police Department takes great pride in our ongoing efforts to take illegally possessed firearms off the streets and help make our community a safer place."
The first arrest was Friday night. At approximately 10:15 p.m., the officer stopped a Lexus in the area of San Pablo Avenue and Carleton Street for an equipment violation. During a search of the car, the officer found a loaded .357 revolver, concealed on the driver's floorboard. Green was arrested for Carrying a Concealed Firearm, Carrying a Loaded Firearm in Public and Possession of Stolen Property.
On Saturday night at 11 p.m., the same officer stopped a vehicle for expired registration. A search of the vehicle turned up a loaded and concealed pistol inside of a backpack on the front passenger seat. Narcotics were also found in the vehicle. Cotton was arrested for Carrying a Concealed Firearm, Carrying a Loaded Firearm in Public and for being a Felon in Possession of a Firearm.

Swansea fully deserves all the praise after such an impressive, dominate display against a brave Bradford side that looked like a rabbit in the headlights. The latter were never really at the races today, as it was one-way traffic for the full 90 minutes.
Since getting into the Premiership in 2011-12, Swansea have emulated the league, offering a total brand of football that's just a sheer joy to watch. In their last campaign, they beat giants Arsenal, Liverpool and Man City before eventually finishing a very creditable 11th position. In the following summer, Brendan Rogers left for one of football's greats in Liverpool, thus leaving the door open for Michael Laudrup to take over the reins for the Welsh club, keeing their fairytale time in the Prem on-going.
Every real football fan loves watching this team play as its proper football… pass-move-pass-move little triangles, squares, or any other shape they can muster, but they also have an end product to all their impressive build up play too. The buy of the summer was without doubt Michu, who at 2million was an absolute bargain – he has already filled the onion bag 18times and again scored in the 5-nil League cup romp. While we're on Michu, he's not all about goals though, as he works hard by putting defenders under immense pressure. To be honest, surely a bigger team will make a large offer for him in the next transfer window, perhaps in and around 20million as I see the price tag.
But don't get me wrong, this isn't a one-man team. Players like Wayne Routledge have blossomed into a real quality performer that fits the team like a glove. Leon Britton does the unselfish things – making tackles, keeping the ball moving and letting the more skillful players be creative. Ashley Williams is a man mountain at the back – strong in the air, quick, but can play football too. Canadian Johnathan De Guzman has produced many top level performances this season, and scored twice in the final too. I could go through the whole side but these are the standouts for me in a side built to play as a team.
The only downside of the final was Nathan Dyer's petulant behavior at not being allowed to take the penalty, thus giving him a chance of a hat-trick. For two full minutes he was arguing with De Guzman like a spoilt child. After continuing the sulk, Laudrup eventually replaced him with Roland Laman. Enough of the Dyer nonsense.
As a football fan for over 30 years I love seeing the underdog do well(unless its Spurs!). This team has worked itself up to 9th in the Premiership this season and now have won their first major trophy in their 100 year history. As a non-Swansea fan I enjoyed the final immensely, the way they dismantled their opponents with speed, skill and sheer quality football making for the biggest win in their League Cup history – that's one way to lift your first major trophy – with such emphatically glorious style.
So where do Swansea go from here? I don't know, but tonight I hope they fully enjoy this tremendous victory. Well done Swansea, you deserve it!!

Reconstruction was the nation's first great experiment in biracial democracy, with hundreds of thousands of black men able to vote for the first time, and significant numbers holding elective office. Largely for that reason, Southern planters led coups against local governments that supported Reconstruction, and went on to bar blacks and many poor whites from voting and to construct a system of Jim Crow racial exclusion.
The story of Reconstruction remains a rich and troubling one for a nation that prefers stories of progress over those of regression. It reminds us of the centrality of race-based slavery to our nation's history; of the idealism of those, white and black, who sought to build a society based on racial equality upon the ashes of slavery; and of the violent overthrow of the experiment in biracial democracy. More broadly it reminds us that rights we sometimes take for granted can be taken away.
Nevertheless, Reconstruction often disappears from our national story. Historians long characterized it as a failure, disseminating myths of corruption or of African-American incapacity. Over the last half-century, scholars have overturned that interpretation, noting the extraordinary vitality and promise of Reconstruction, but this knowledge has too infrequently reached the public. Many Americans know nothing at all about the period.
A National Park Service monument to Reconstruction in Beaufort would be a significant step toward commemorating this crucial part of the nation's history. After the Union victory on Port Royal Sound in 1861, the scenic town of Beaufort and the surrounding Sea Islands was a rehearsal for Reconstruction. Former slaves on nearby St. Helena and Hilton Head Islands attended the Penn School established by Northern reformers, established religious services at Brick Baptist Church, created self-governing communities like Mitchelville on Hilton Head Island and served alongside Harriet Tubman in the nearby Combahee ferry raid, an 1863 foray into Confederate territory that liberated hundreds of slaves.
In alliance with some white Carolinians, they elected a war hero and former slave, Robert Smalls, to the state constitutional convention of 1868 and then to five terms in Congress. Smalls lived long enough to see the end of Reconstruction, defending civil and voting rights at the 1895 state constitutional convention that disfranchised African-Americans, and maintaining a rare biracial alliance in Beaufort until his death in 1915.
Traces of this history remain around Beaufort. From the Penn Center at the old Penn School to the Brick Baptist Church to Smalls's own home, visitors to the Reconstruction national monument would be able to stand where these historical actors stood and reckon with the legacy of their struggle for genuine freedom. A recent National Historic Landmark study found that Beaufort has the greatest density of important historical sites for Reconstruction in the country.
CYM 2016 minute on reconciliation
At the annual gathering of Quakers in Canada, Canadian Yearly Meeting in session, Friends found deep unity on a new position on reconciliation, acknowledging “that part of our journey is to decolonize our own thinking and sit in the discomfort and pain of confronting where we need to deepen our understanding, bear witness, and transform our behaviour.”
The full text of this minute reads:
At Yearly Meeting 2015 Friends approved Minute 2015.08.33 calling on individual Friends to read the Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and the Calls to Action. The Minute asks Friends to listen expectantly to the Spirit for guidance on what steps they may be personally led to take. It also asks Monthly Meetings and Worship Groups to engage with the materials shared by the Indigenous Rights committee of Canadian Friends Service Committee (CFSC) and prayerfully consider what actions they may take in working for reconciliation in their communities. We committed to minute our progress for the year at this Yearly Meeting.
Much has happened since our last Yearly Meeting:
We now have a new federal government that has stated it accepts all of the TRC's Calls to Action and that it will implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. This has changed the dynamic and the tone of public discourse on Indigenous Peoples' rights in Canada.
CYM and CFSC jointly issued a Quaker Response in March 2016 to Call to Action 48,and we submitted this to the TRC. We affirmed in our statement that we have “endorsed, celebrated and committed to implement the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples” as stated in previous minutes (2010.08.50, 2009.08.70). We received a warm reply from Justice Murray Sinclair, Chair of the TRC, thanking us for our work. He particularly liked that we had committed to an annual review of our progress.
CYM and CFSC also collaborated with other faith bodies, some of which were church parties to the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement and some of which were not, in issuing a joint ecumenical statement on Call to Action 48. CFSC's Indigenous Rights coordinator participated in drafting. This was a worthwhile process in working to find common ground amongst faith bodies regarding their role in the reconciliation process.
CFSC's Indigenous Rights committee educated Friends on such critical issues as free, prior, and informed consent; genocide; and intergenerational trauma.
Meetings and Worship Groups have visited nearby Indigenous communities; organized discussion groups in partnership with local Indigenous Peoples; are attending educational events such as workshops and film screenings; are learning about and honouring Friends' role as Treaty partners; and are placing the UN Declaration in poster and booklet form in their Meeting houses.
Some individual Friends have been led to stand alongside Indigenous Peoples in defending their traditional territories, including civil disobedience resulting in arrest.
During the year, CFSC has explored the work of Reconciliation with many Meetings, Worship Groups and Half Yearly Meetings. As Friends engage in the work of reconciliation, we are committed to grounding our actions in our Spiritual practices, particularly of speaking to that of the Creator in everyone. Let Friends first listen to the concerns of Indigenous Peoples. We know it is not sufficient to be well-intentioned and make assumptions about what is best for Indigenous Peoples without asking what it is they want and need. All actions require the guidance of the Indigenous Peoples involved and need to be done with respect, cooperation and ongoing consultation.
We, as Friends, also need to be open to being challenged in our assumptions about the many destructive facets of colonial legacies and continuing racist practices and policies that constitute Canada's historical and contemporary realities. We acknowledge that part of our journey is to decolonize our own thinking and sit in the discomfort and pain of confronting where we need to deepen our understanding, bear witness, and transform our behaviour.
While Friends corporately have often been on the forefront of advocating for Indigenous Peoples' human rights, it is now time to prioritize this work and take it to the next level.
Friends recognize that reconciliation requires us to continue to learn, grow, and establish and nurture relationships with Indigenous partners.
We are a Society of Friends, and friendship entails a relationship greater than simply understanding our colonial history. As Friends, we commit to walking the path of friendship, following these instructive words:
I think about what I want for my children and grandchildren. What I want for them is to be loved and love other people in this country. Not to tolerate them, not to go to our respective corners and stop hurting each other, but to be wrapped up and engaged in each other's lives.
– Douglas White, Kwulasultun (Coast Salish name), Tliishin (Nuu-chah-nulth name)
Director of the Centre for Pre-Confederation Treaties and Reconciliation, Vancouver Island University and former Chief of the Snuneymuxw First Nation
For Canada to grow and heal we must be active participants in a paradigm shift, moving from colonialism to a new reality based on respect for Indigenous Peoples' Human Rights. We are reminded that we have CFSC's Indigenous Rights committee to assist us and provide resources for this work.
We ask Monthly Meetings and Worship Groups:
to continue to educate themselves, including children and youth, about the doctrine of discovery, the ongoing effects of colonialism, the UN Declaration, residential schools and their legacy (including the TRC Report), the history of the land on which they live, and reconciliation efforts.
to formally acknowledge the traditional territories where their Meetings are located and engage in processes of reflection on the meaning of this. Acknowledgments can be accomplished through signage, statements during the close of Meeting, and inclusion in information provided to any community groups who use Meeting House space.
to find out about current concerns of Indigenous Peoples from those territories, including land appropriation or resource development, with which the Meeting could be engaged.
to investigate projects of cultural revitalization that Indigenous Peoples are involved in and discern if there is an appropriate role (including funding) that Friends can play.
to uphold and support individual Friends involved with grassroots Indigenous rights and provide spiritual support to Friends led to this work. This might include offering committees of care and approving minutes of support.
to report back annually through the Indigenous Rights committee of CFSC on actions taken. We ask CFSC to collate such information in their reporting to CYM.

0 Semi-truck strikes Tukwila rail bridge, causes Sounder delays
TUKWILA, Wash. - Sound Transit south line Sounder trains are delayed Monday morning after a semi-truck hit the Tukwila Bridge.
The bridge is at the Tukwila Sounder train station at 7301 Longacres Way.
As of 7 a.m., trains, which were being held at the Tukwila Station, were delayed by 40 minutes. As of 7:50 a.m., trains were again moving, but at a slower pace because of the backups, and the 40 minute delay remained.
The semi-truck's cab was sheared off and part of the truck's trailer was also damaged.
The driver said he thought he could make it under the bridge, but the truck hit the bridge and the driver tried to back up.
“It shook me up a little bit and I got a little nervous. Most of the damage happened when I backed up,” he said.
The driver said his phone's GPS took him to the route. He said his trailer clearance is 10 feet 10 inches tall, and the bridge is 11 feet 6 inches tall.
The bridge's tracks and overpass were inspected for damage. Gus Melonas with Burlington Northern Santa Fe said the track does have damage, but they are allowing all general traffic to use the bridge at a reduced speed of 25 mph.
Further assessment will be done and repairs may have to be made.

KENNETT SQUARE, CHESTER COUNTY, Pa.-- Lily has a new owner. Comedian Jon Stewart's wife, Tracey, adopted Lily.
"We're really excited," Stewart said. "She's going to have a beautiful life."
Lily was left abandoned in March at a horse auction in New Holland, Lancaster County. Lancaster County SPCA officials believe she was headed for slaughter.
She was taken to the Penn Vet New Bolton Center Animal Hospital. She then went to a nearby center to for rehab.
"She is very, very sweet. It's honestly one of the sweetest horses I've ever seen," Stewart said.
Stewart heard about Lily through Farm Sanctuary. They asked her to adopt Lily. She checked with her husband Jon, and they agreed to adopt her.
Jon and Tracey Stewart recently partnered with Farm Sanctuary, an organization that works to change how our society views and treats farm animals. Tracey Stewart said she hopes to have their facility ready to go by spring of next year. This is where Lily will eventually go. Right now, she is going to an undisclosed location to have some privacy.
"She's going to do whatever she wants all day," Stewart said.
Lily gained about 150 pounds since we last saw her. In March, she was underweight and covered in paint. She now will have to take ointment for her eye and be on a eating plan to maintain her health.
"Not anything too crazy," Penn Vet New Bolton Center Dr. Nicole Scherrer said. "Just kind of things that you have to do with older animals."
While in recovery, Lily made friends with another horse, Anita. Both horses have lost an eye. Since they get along, the Stewarts adopted both horses.
Stewart said jokingly, "It's actually covering up my hoarding."
She said she believes changes will be coming to animal cruelty laws.
"I think Lily's story will be a big part of telling why that's so necessary and important," Stewart said.
Her Facebook page, The Daily Squeal, will have updates on Lily. The updates will start in the summer.
The Lancaster County District Attorney's office has filed charges into the man who transported Lily. They are still investigating more of the case.
The latest release of NextCloudPi is out!
Changes:
Based on the latest NextCloud 11.0.2
Based on the latest Raspbian 8 release ( 2017-03-02 )
nextcloudpi-config for easy setup
Kernel updated to 4.9.13
Fixed compatibility with the updater app
This release comes with a general polish and updating of components. The most noticeable change for users is an easier setup with nextcloudpi-config.
Relocate your data directory
You can now easily move your data directory to an external USB drive. Follow any guide on the internet to automount your drive on boot. You will have to modify /etc/fstab for this, just look it up online.
Then, use nextcloudpi-config to update the data directory to somewhere inside your external mount. Easy!
Tune your limits
You can also configure the maximum upload size for NextCloudPi from nextcloudpi-config.
I recommend leaving the default value as is unless you really need to. A Raspberry Pi 3 only has 1GB RAM memory, and attempting to stretch memory limits will result in pagination, performance degradation and SD bitrotting. Use with care!
Disable HTTPS redirection
HTTPS is enforced by default, but in case you have a good reason to allow HTTP, you can enable it or disable it from here
Activate and configure your extras
If you are using the FULL version, all extras can be activated and configured from here.
Extras in the FULL version:
Thank you all for your feedback, more is to come

Hacked voicemails released by WikiLeaks have revealed how Democratic Party donors tried to persuade senior officials to ditch Bernie Sanders.
Calls left with senior figures reveal that supporters were actively lobbying for Sanders to be dropped from the convention.
Furious donors demanded Sanders be dropped, calling him 'the worst person in the world' and an 'a**hole' as they accused him of trashing the party.
The leaked messages are the latest embarrassment for the party establishment after Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz was forced to resign after hacked emails showed she and other officials tried to derail Sanders' campaign.

Hacked voicemails released by WikiLeaks have revealed how Democratic Party donors tried to persuade senior officials to ditch Bernie Sanders
One of the voicemails - from an Arizona dialling code - captures an irate woman demanding the party take action against Sanders.
'I am one of the many Democrats that is so angry at Bernie Sanders ... he is trying to change everything - change the rules,' the donor says.
'You guys are acquiescing to him on things at the convention. I don't think he should get a speaking spot at the convention.'
Calling the Vermont senator 'asinine', she adds: 'Do not let him rule the Democratic Party. He's not a Democrat! Please stop this man now.'
The same woman is captured in another phone call from the same number, saying she is 'furious about what you are doing for Bernie Sanders'.
'He is getting way too much influence,' she says.
Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz was forced to resign after hacked emails showed she and other officials tried to derail Sanders' campaign
'I am on fixed income and I spent over $300 donated to Hillary, and what I see is the DNC bending over backwards for Bernie.
'Bernie is the worst person in the world even to be running in a Democratic Party because he is not a Democrat. Please don't give into him.
'I don't care about Sanders supporters, most of them are going to vote for Hillary anyway.
'Quit acquiescing to this person who likes to play the victim card, and who also has been attacking Hillary which gives Trump all his talking points.'
In a final threat, she adds: 'I will leave the Democratic Party if the Democratic Party continues to coddle Bernie Sanders. Get rid of the**hole.'
Another call criticized the party for allowing Sanders to elevate one of his key supporters, Cornel West, to the DNC's platform committee.
'He's called President Obama a "n****rized president' and he said he's a ‘Republican in blackface',' the woman rages.
'Why does the DNC allow such trash to be on the platform committee? I don't understand it - you guys are losing me.'
The leak also revealed the access donors are granted to President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden
Other calls reveal the access donors are given to President Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and the First Lady.
One caller complains that they have been invited for a St Patrick's day breakfast with the vice president not to a White House reception.
Another man says Wasserman Schultz offered him and his wife the opportunity to attend a 'small dinner with President Obama this week'.
A separate call that was among the leaked files asks for the best contact details for Michelle Obama, concerning an invitation to an event.

German capital follows Hamburg with vote to ban taxi app firm, saying it does not protect passengers from unlicensed drivers
Berlin has voted to ban Uber on safety grounds as the app-enabled taxi service continues to run up against resistance in Germany.
Officials said the Californian company, which operates in 110 cities around the world, did not do enough to protect its passengers from unlicensed drivers. A senate statement said Uber – already banned in Hamburg – also failed to provide adequate insurance for its drivers or their passengers in accidents.
The Berlin ruling states: "Uber is from now on no longer allowed to use a smartphone app or similar application, or offer services via this app which are in breach of the Public Transport Act."
Uber said it would appeal against the ban, saying the senate's decision was "anything but progressive", and it was "seeking to limit consumer choice for all the wrong reasons".
Uber claims that it does not operate a taxi service, but merely offers a platform that mediates between drivers and customers.
Uber could be fined up to €25,000 (£20,000) if it ignores the ban. A Hamburg court last month lifted the ban pending a final decision. Uber's general manager, Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, told Handelsblatt newspaper on Thursday that he expected a similar decision in Berlin.
The Berlin ban follows Europe-wide protests by taxi drivers in June. In its statement, the Berlin senate said the "protection of the taxi industry" was one of the factors it had taken into consideration.
The Association of Berlin Taxi Drivers welcomed the decision in a statement on its website. "As taxi drivers, we have to meet a series of rules and commitments," said its chairman, Richard Leipold. "With its decision the senate has clarified that these apply to every player on the market, even digital competitors." Leipold said he hoped other cities would follow Berlin's lead. An interim injunction against Uber has been in place in Berlin since April, after a small taxi provider took legal action against the US company.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The United States won a ruling against India at the World Trade Organization on Wednesday after challenging the rules on the origin of solar cells and solar modules used in India's national solar power program.
In a statement, the U.S. Trade Representative's office called the ruling a significant victory that would hasten the spread of solar energy across the world and support clean-energy jobs in the United States.
The United States complained to the WTO in 2013 about the Indian solar program, which sought to ease chronic energy shortages in Asia's third-largest economy without creating pollution.
But a requirement that certain cells and modules be made in India fell afoul of WTO rules on discriminating against imports. The United States said its solar exports to India had fallen by 90 percent from 2011, when India imposed the rules.
The WTO ruling, which can be appealed within 60 days, was repeatedly delayed as the two sides tried to negotiate a settlement. An Indian official had said a compromise might let India subsidize state projects such as defense or railway projects.
Indian officials were not immediately available to comment on the WTO ruling.
1953: Central Intelligence Agency director Allen Dulles authorizes the MK-ULTRA project. The agency launches one of its most dubious covert programs ever, turning unsuspecting humans into guinea pigs for its research into mind-altering drugs.
More than a decade before psychologist Timothy Leary advocated the benefits of LSD and urged everyone to "turn on, tune in, drop out," the CIA's Technical Services Staff launched the highly classified project to study the mind-control effects of this and other psychedelic drugs, using unwitting U.S. and Canadian citizens as lab mice.
Dulles wanted to close the "brainwashing gap" that arose after the United States learned that American prisoners of war in Korea were subjected to mind-control techniques by their captors.
Loathe to be outdone by foreign enemies, the CIA sought, through its research, to devise a truth serum to enhance the interrogations of POWs and captured spies. The agency also wanted to develop techniques and drugs – such as "amnesia pills" – to create CIA superagents who would be immune to the mind-control efforts of adversaries.
MK-ULTRA even hoped to create a "Manchurian Candidate", or programmable assassin, and devise a way to control the minds of pesky despots, like Fidel Castro – giving credence forevermore to claims by the tinfoil-hat contingent that the government is out to control our minds.
In addition to drugs, the program included more than a hundred sub-projects that involved radiological implants, hypnosis and subliminal persuasion, electroshock therapy and isolation techniques. (The MK in the project name referred to the Technical Services Division that oversaw the project, and ULTRA was a security classification applied to top-secret intelligence.)
More than 30 universities and institutions participated in CIA-funded research, though not all were aware the spy agency was their benefactor, because funding was sometimes laundered through shell organizations.
Under the guise of research, LSD, whose psychedelic properties were discovered by a Swiss chemist in 1943, was secretly administered to CIA employees, U.S. soldiers and psychiatric patients, as well as the general public.
One federal drug agent who worked as a "consultant" for the CIA for a project dubbed "Operation Midnight Climax" hired prostitutes to slip the drug to unsuspecting clients, then watched through two-way mirrors as the clients tripped out. He also reportedly slipped the drug to patrons at bars and restaurants.
The CIA ultimately concluded that the drug was too unpredictable for reliable research, but that was too late for Frank Olson.
Olson was a 43-year-old civilian germ-warfare researcher for the U.S. Army who was also a CIA employee and an unwitting recipient of CIA acid. During a 1953 meeting at a mountain retreat with MK-ULTRA head Dr. Sidney Gottlieb and other CIA employees, Olson and four other scientists drank a glass of Cointreau that had been secretly spiked with LSD.
They were told about the drug about 20 minutes after ingesting it. Olson apparently had a severe reaction and left the retreat in an agitated state and later threatened to resign.
The CIA claimed he suffered a sudden bout of extreme paranoia and depression and sent him to a psychiatrist in New York for consultation. He died in a "fall" from the 10th floor of his New York hotel room. A CIA employee who had accompanied him to New York reported that he awoke at 1:30 a.m. to see Olson hurl himself through the closed window.
Olson left a 38-year-old widow and three children under the age of 10. In the absence of other evidence, Olson's family reluctantly accepted the CIA's puzzling explanation that the scientist had been suddenly seized by a fatal depression.
When news of the CIA's secret LSD program finally leaked out 20 years later, the family learned through a congressional inquiry that Olson had been slipped some of the hallucinogen days before his death. The CIA continued to insist that Olson had committed suicide, but at President Gerald Ford's urging, the family was paid $750,000.
It wasn't until the 1990s, when Olson's son had his father's body exhumed and examined, that he discovered that his father might have actually died from a blunt force trauma to the head, which may have been received prior to his fall from the window.
Olson wasn't the only casualty of the CIA's drug tests. A tennis pro who had gone to the New York Psychiatric Institute for depression following a divorce fell into a coma and died. He'd been administered a derivative of mescaline. There were other cases of suspect deaths and lives left in ruin.
The victim's families might have sued to obtain records of the secret program, but CIA Director Richard Helms had ordered the MK-ULTRA project files destroyed in 1973.
The program was brought to light in 1975 through investigations by the Church Committee and Rockefeller Commission that were established to investigate government surveillance operations in the wake of the Watergate wiretapping scandal and other domestic-spying revelations.
By then, the MK-ULTRA project had supposedly been closed. But this was by no means the end to misguided covert government programs, such as the remote-viewing project at SRI. Another, less-organized military project, inspired the story behind the recent film The Men Who Stare at Goats.
Dulles gave the go-ahead for MK-ULTRA, as it turns out, on the very day that Ian Fleming's first James Bond novel, Casino Royale, appeared. Coincidence? You decide.

A past Texas State Board of Education chairman and outspoken creationist urged his former colleagues on Tuesday to approve high school biology textbooks he said would "strike a final blow to the teaching of evolution."
Appearing at a board hearing on new instructional materials, Don McLeroy, a Bryan dentist who lost his seat on the SBOE in the 2010 Republican primary, told board members that the science textbooks currently under consideration contained many "hidden gems just waiting to be mined by inquisitive students" that proved there was no evidence for evolution.
McLeroy's testimony diverged from other witnesses skeptical of evolution, who criticized the proposed textbooks for inadequate coverage of alternatives to the scientific theory and asked the board not to approve them until publishers made changes.
His statements prompted a confused question from board member Mavis Knight, D-Dallas.
The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.
"Are you saying 'adopt these books' facetiously?" she asked.
McLeroy said he wasn't. He said that despite assertions of "robust evidence" for evolution, the textbooks actually offered few facts supporting it. He cited lessons on the complexity of cell structures and gaps in fossil records.
"Evolutionists argue that creationists want to force their religious views into the text, but just the teaching of biology accomplishes that," he said. "Support the Bible, adopt these books."
The 15-member SBOE won't vote on the 14 science textbooks currently under consideration until November. Chairwoman Barbara Cargill, R-The Woodlands, said the board would also discuss revising the state's textbook approval process, which science education advocates have criticized for allegedly lacking transparency and including unqualified reviewers.
Cargill herself has drawn accusations of improper involvement in the review process from the Texas Freedom Network, a group that monitors religious influence in public schools, after reports that she encouraged creationists on the panels. Cargill said she only attended the meetings to thank volunteers for their work reviewing the texts.
State panels have been reviewing sample instructional materials since April. The panels, which are assembled by SBOE members, have included several prominent creationists and evolution skeptics, as well as others without a background in education or science. Their preliminary proposed changes obtained by the Texas Freedom Network pushed for the inclusion of more arguments critical of evolution.
The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.
Concern about creationists' outsize participation in the review process also prompted a University of Texas graduate student who served on the panels, Jimmy Gollihar, to write a letter to the state board last week.
"It is impossible to conclude that the teams reviewing textbooks were anything other than grossly skewed and obviously biased," he said. “The net result of having a huge raft of non-scientists on the panels was that rather than checking for factual errors in the texts, I was put into the position of having to painstakingly educate other panel members on past and current literature."
Prior to Tuesday's hearing, three SBOE members — Ruben Cortez, D-Brownsville; Marisa Perez, D-San Antonio; and Martha Dominguez, D-El Paso — expressed their disappointment with the process at a rally organized by the Texas Freedom Network. They said that publishers were being pressured into including non-science-based arguments against evolution and called for only "content-relevant educators" to be included on review panels.
Cargill said during the hearing that she had asked publishers to voluntarily disclose for public review any changes they made to textbooks prior to their adoption. She also emphasized that any reports made by review teams were preliminary — and that in November, the board would take up suggestions about how to improve the process.
"I'm very appreciative of the reviewers themselves," she said. "But we've got some work to do."

Wearing wet socks and using the same safety pins are among athlete superstitions. Could a lucky charm work for you? Dr Josephine Perry investigates
When training for my first marathon, a friend told me it was unlucky to run over three manhole covers in a row as they equal the size of a coffin. Twelve years on and I still run around them, even in a race and despite the fact that my rational mind tells me the action is ridiculous.
Yet idiosyncrasies like mine are neither unusual, nor limited to recreational runners. Many elite athletes have their own seemingly bizarre superstitious rituals, things they say or do because they believe them to have the power to influence how they perform.
How do we become superstitious?
Often, superstitious behaviour develops by accident. During post-competition reflection, after a particularly good result, an athlete may ask themselves if there were any unusual circumstance, things they can repeat to recreate the success. Superstitions can focus around routines, kit, food, avoidance or good luck charms.
Laura Trott, the GB cyclist, steps on a wet towel before races after once winning a junior race while wearing a wet sock. Serena Williams will always bounce the ball five times before serving and Paula Radcliffe used the same safety pins to attach her number in every race.
Some athletes insist on wearing the same item of kit – think Michael Rimmer (pictured above), who wears a T-shirt beneath his racing vest, or Tiger Woods, who always wears red on the final day of a golf tournament.
Avoidance superstitions – aiming never to stand on white lines or, as one top cricketer insists, never to have any toy ducks in the house – are also common. And then there are the lucky charms.
Sprinter Harry Aikines-Aryeetey keeps a good luck stone near him in races while Jodie Williams had a lucky elephant charm that she claims took her though 151 races unbeaten. When she lost the elephant, she lost her first race. She now has an elephant tattooed on her ankle instead.
Is there any science to it?
Superstitions actually have a number of purposes. Some psychologists have suggested that they can help athletes get into their performance mindset as the adrenalin released by the action triggers a feeling of readiness. Other researchers have found that the ritualistic element of the superstition can distract an athlete from anxiety or nerves.
A Dutch study in 2006 asked 197 elite athletes about their rituals and found they serve as an important tension-regulation function for an athlete before a match or competition. They also found that there was a stronger commitment to the ritual when the competition was really important. Further research in Germany in 2010 found that using a lucky charm could improve performance. In a golf test, those who were told the ball they were using was lucky, putted better than those who used a normal ball. Others allowed to carry their lucky charm outperformed those without one in memory and anagram tests.
They suggest the performance benefits come from changes in athlete's perceived self-efficiency, increasing their confidence.
Can superstitions help to improve performance?
Research has also found that superstitions can give athletes a feeling of control over events, thereby boosting their chances of doing well. Sports psychologist Rebecca Symes says many athletes fall back on superstitions if “they are going into an unknown situation, such as a new competition, as they are seeking to exert control to reduce the anxiety and promote confidence”.
For many people, the set routine of a superstition provides a sense of certainty and control when they most need it. Much like a placebo, these rituals can work if the person believes in them.
Is there a downside?
If using the same safety pins or holding an elephant charm before your race helps you feel confident, in control and ready to perform, where is the harm?
Often there isn't any. But, in some cases superstitious rituals are taken too far and move away from being a routine towards becoming a compulsion. Two things can happen if you become unhealthily obsessed with your ritual. Firstly, you limit your flexibility to respond to the environment around you, which means that anything unpredictable might throw you off kilter. Secondly, it means that other athletes can use your superstitions against you to disrupt your performance.
The experience of Neil McKenzie, a South African cricketer, is an example of how an over-reliance on superstitions can go wrong. His one, not to step on white lines, was exactly what he needed to do in order to protect his stumps. When he did walk on them he would hear the opposition pointing it out to wind him up, ruining his focus. Similarly, baseball player Kevin Rhomberg refused to turn right while running and had a compulsion to touch anyone who had touched him, giving the opposition an easy way to send his stress levels sky-high and cause him to lose focus.
Keep things in check
“While an athlete may feel a superstition gives them control, in reality a superstition can sometimes be controlling them,” says Symes. “Superstitions can be dangerous when this happens because if they are unable to be implemented or the charm is forgotten feelings of doubt can be evoked.”
She recommends “developing a pre-performance routine which allows you to feel in control but also allows flexibility”.
This pre-performance routine means, rather than gripping on to an irrational element, you can purposefully prepare your mind and body to be in control, to have confidence and to perform well. And not have to race with a wet sock.

Ford Motor Co. has sued Ferrari in Detroit federal court, saying the sports carmaker has violated its trademark over the pickup truck name F-150.
DETROIT —
Ford Motor Co. has sued Ferrari in Detroit federal court, saying the sports carmaker has violated its trademark over the pickup truck name F-150.
The suit is based on Ferrari's naming of its new Formula 1 racing car the "F150," and its creation of the website http://www.ferrarif150.com.
Dearborn-based Ford says in Wednesday's filing that its trademark is being harmed, and the suit asks a judge to block Ferrari from using the trademark in the U.S.
Ford also seeks unspecified damages from Ferrari.
A message seeking comment was left for Ferrari officials at the company's Modena, Italy headquarters through U.S. spokesman Matteo Sardi.
Ferrari's website says the "F150" marks the 150th anniversary of the unification of Italy.
According to the Wrap ABC have picked up No Ordinary Family a superhero drama about the Powell's family an average American family. They develop superpowers after the family's plane crashes into the Amazon River Basin.
Cast
Jim Powell: Michael Chiklis (The Shield)
Stephanie Powell: Julie Benz (Dexter) -a gifted scientist who develops a power for superspeed.
JJ Powell: Jimmy Bennett (“Star Trek”)
Daphne Powell: Kay Panabaker (Summerland)
Katie Andrews: Autumn Reeser – perky lab assistant
George St. Cloud: Romany Malco (Weeds) – the Jim's best friend and old college roommate.
Yvonne Cho: Christina Chang (24) – a young police officer who works at the same precinct Jim.
Mitch McCutcheon: Tate Donovan (Damages) – the pilot of the family's plane that crashes into the Amazon
The Powells are pretty much your average, everyday American family. That is until their plane crashes in the Amazon jungle. After that, well, let's just say the Powells are a little less ordinary. Jim is a frustrated police sketch artist married to Stephanie, a brilliant and successful scientist. Although they still love each other, their marriage has lost some of its spark. All of that changes, though, when Stephanie takes Jim and their two teenage kids along on a research trip to the Amazon. The Powell's plane crashes into a swampy river; they manage to escape, but, their pilot, unfortunately, isn't so lucky. As the Powells gratefully return to their old lives, they are shocked to discover that they have suddenly developed some rather extraordinary abilities. Jim is super strong with amazing reflexes. Stephanie can suddenly move at lightning speed. Daphne can hear everyone's thoughts including those of her 16-year-old-boyfriend, ick! Then there's JJ, who miraculously goes from clueless to brainiac, seemingly overnight. The Powells are reinvigorated by their new powers, but they quickly discover that the toughest challenges may be the most ordinary ones. Sure, they can stop criminals, but all the superpowers in the world can't fix emotional problems. The Powells better get their act together, soon, though, because that pilot they left for dead at the bottom of a river… he just woke up. From Brother & Sisters' Greg Berlanti and Jon Feldman comes a wild new dramedy about a totally relatable family who just happen to be a little bit amazing.

The United States of America is notorious for its astronomical number of people killed by firearms for a developed nation without a civil war. With his signature sense of angry humor, activist filmmaker Michael Moore sets out to explore the roots of this bloodshed. In doing so, he learns that the conventional answers of easy availability of guns, violent national history, violent entertainment and even poverty are inadequate to explain this violence when other cultures share those same factors without the equivalent carnage. In order to arrive at a possible explanation, Michael Moore takes on a deeper examination of America's culture of fear, bigotry and violence in a nation with widespread gun ownership. Furthermore, he seeks to investigate and confront the powerful elite political and corporate interests fanning this culture for their own unscrupulous gain.

Spaz has named former Ohio State offensive coordinator and offensive line coach Jim Bollman to the Boston College football staff. Bollman will serve as offensive line coach/running game coordinator (whatever this means).
Nice things were said by all.
Here's Spaz:
"I am very pleased to welcome Jim to the Boston College staff," Spaziani said. "As a former offensive coordinator and offensive line coach for the Ohio State Buckeyes, Jim brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to our program."
And Bollman:
"I am very excited about this opportunity," Bollman said. "One of the most important and rewarding parts of my career has been working with outstanding people, and I look forward to working with Frank Spaziani and his staff. I'm very familiar with the ACC, having coached at NC State and Virginia. Boston College has a great offensive line tradition and has produced some of the best talent in the NFL. I look forward to the challenge of continuing and enhancing that tradition."
Bollman has made previous coaching stops with the Chicago Bears, Philadelphia Eagles and at Michigan State, Virginia, Youngstown State, North Carolina State and Miami (Ohio).
I literally haven't the first clue about this hire, but just as this announcement was made, our Twitter account immediately lit up with Tweets like this:
"I can't emphasize to @BCInterruption, @bcatleagle enough: you've hired the worst O-line coach in America. Godspeed."
... and this:
"Congrats on hiring your new OL Coach/Three-and-out Coordinator fellas. #Bollman"
So, well, uhh, yeah.
At the bottom of the release, there is also news of the fate of now former Offensive Line coach Sean Devine. Devine will now coach BC's tight ends and work with the offense. Devine has been a key recruiter for Spaz, but the offensive line has continued to regress under his watch the last few seasons.
Leave your thoughts on the hire below.
Price, who last threw off a mound on Saturday, is doing flat-ground work for the early part of this week.
TORONTO -- After throwing an increased volume of activity at David Price last week that included three side sessions in a span of six days, the Red Sox are taking a more conservative path with the lefty to start this week.
TORONTO -- After throwing an increased volume of activity at David Price last week that included three side sessions in a span of six days, the Red Sox are taking a more conservative path with the lefty to start this week.
Price, who last threw off a mound on Saturday, is doing flat-ground work for the early part of this week.
View Full Game Coverage
"He threw out to 90 feet today," said Red Sox manager John Farrell. "He'll throw out to 120 feet tomorrow. Coming out of that, we'll determine the next step, as we've been doing of late."
The next time Price throws off the mound, it could be with some hitters in the box, perhaps in a simulated game type of setting.
But the Red Sox are being careful not to plan too far ahead for Price, who suffered a left elbow strain on Feb. 28.
Farrell wanted to make it clear that Price has not suffered a setback.
"No," Farrell said. "And he'll be back on the mound. We just know that with the volume and intensity that last week presented to him, we're making sure he goes through some long-toss and continues to build."
Worth noting
• Amid a stretch in which the Red Sox are playing 32 games in 33 days, second baseman Dustin Pedroia was out of Tuesday's lineup strictly for rest purposes. Marco Hernandez got the start at second, with Xander Bogaerts batting leadoff for the first time in his career.
"He's been in all 13 games," Farrell said of Pedroia. "We come off a stretch where we've had so many different start times and just felt like today was a day to keep Marco rotating through the infield somewhat and give [Pedroia] a day down."
• Eduardo Rodriguez, who missed Tuesday's start after being placed on the paternity list, could be activated as early as Wednesday if the Red Sox need him as a reliever. By rule, Rodriguez must be activated Thursday. Farrell expects Rodriguez to slot back into the rotation on his regular turn -- on Sunday in Baltimore.
• Jackie Bradley Jr. and Josh Rutledge both started Minor League rehab assignments for Triple-A Pawtucket on Tuesday in a game at Charlotte. Rutledge, coming off a left hamstring strain, served as the designated hitter and homered in his first at-bat. Bradley, who is coming back from a right knee sprain, went 0-for-2 and played five innings in center field. Bradley could rejoin the Red Sox by Friday in Baltimore. Rutledge will probably be with Pawtucket a little longer. Yoan Moncada, the top prospect the Red Sox traded to get Chris Sale, homered in that game for Charlotte.
Key animator Katsunori Shibata (Yuri Kuma Arashi, 91 Days, Flip Flappers, A Certain Magical Index) launched a Campfire crowdfunding campaign to support animators in Japan on August 14. In just one week, the campaign has become a huge success, and the project still has 24 days left. As of the posting of this article, the campaign has raised 981,000 yen (about US$9,000) of its 110,000-yen (US$1,000) goal.
The campaign's initial goal was to use the 110,000 yen to award money to three animators and cover campaign costs. Animators who contact Shibata will be eligible for a lottery that will determine the animators to receive the raised money.
Shibata noted that many freelance animators earn less than 1,060,000 yen (US$9,700) per year despite working 11 hours a day, six days a week. He said that no corrective actions have been taken to improve the conditions for freelance animators. Shibata also said that the current environment is devastating and there is no room to nurture talent in animators. He hopes that the project will open communication on how to better the animation industry in Japan.
In addition to the crowdfunding campaign, Animator Dormitory and Young Animators NPO are combating low wages among Japan's animators with help from donations.
Animators in Japan are usually freelance, work long hours, and are burdened with high living expenses due to the areas where most animation studios are located. An NHK program discussed financial and working-condition problems in the anime industry in June. Mobile Suit Gundam Wing director Shinji Takamatsu responded to the program by criticizing some views the show expressed.

Texas is enormous, but it's hard sometimes to put its size in perspective: just listing the distance from, say, El Paso to Beaumont (824 miles!), and noting how it compares to the distance from Dallas to Sioux Falls, SD (841 miles!) doesn't quite do the trick—unless you've done both drives, it's still kind of abstract.
Here's one way to get a better look at exactly how big Texas is, though, as our friends at MySA.com found last week: Using the web app MAPfrappe (fun to say, too!), you can cut out the shape of Texas, and then superimpose it throughout the world via a Google Maps API.
MAPfrappe isn't the same as just taking your scissors to the World Atlas and moving Texas around to compare things—maps become less accurate at different longitudes, so MAPfrappe distorts the size of Texas to show exactly how big it would appear on the map at a given location. For example, this is what it would look like if you simply took Texas and superimposed it over the part of the map where Alaska is:
Tiny, right? But when Texas is distorted to more accurately reflect how size is magnified at higher longitudes, you get a better idea of how the two states stack up (spoiler: Texas is still smaller than Alaska, but not as much smaller as you've heard).
With that in mind, let's take a look at how Texas stacks up to some other parts of the US.
A few things here: First off, Montana is friggin' huge, too, and we don't spend enough time giving the state credit for its mammoth size. What's up with that? You're big, too, Montana, don't let anybody ever tell you otherwise. Out in the Midwest, meanwhile, the amount of area you can cover while still staying within what would be the borders of Texas is impressive. People in St. Louis don't tend to think of folks out in Charleston, South Carolina as living close to them, but they're almost the exact same distance as El Paso and Brownsville. Charleston is similarly geographically disparate from Detroit, but they're about as close together as Amarillo is to the Rio Grande Valley.
Everything's a bit more spread out in the west, but still—you can get a good chunk of California in the boundaries of Texas, and pack in Nevada, and parts of Arizona and Utah, too.
Now let's head over to Africa. Africa, of course, is a gargantuan continent, which is something that our maps have often failed to portray. (When you live in a country whose maps literally cut Asia in half so that you can be in the center of the world, it tends to be a little distorting.) But even a relatively obscure West African nation like Mauritania is bigger, on balance, than Texas. Countries like Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are much larger.
This puts some things in perspective regarding the Ebola scare of 2014, as well: the countries facing an Ebola epidemic were West African nations like Liberia and Sierra Leone. You can spot them a bit underneath Mauritania in the first map up there. Those countries are a massive distance from other parts of Africa. They're a solid Texas-sized distance from Nigeria, which is itself a couple of Texases away from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which has still another couple Texases to go to get to South Africa (not pictured here, because Africa is huge). That's a thing worth considering, when thinking about how big Africa is. You could fit literally dozens of Texases in there.
Over in Europe, though, things are a little different. France is roughly the same size as Texas—but you can comfortably stuff Switzerland in alongside it like an accessory. The further east you go, meanwhile, you can smoosh a whole lot of a whole lot of countries within the Lone Star State: Paris, Prague, Milan, Amsterdam, Brussels, Munich, and Florence could all be little bits of Texas, in an alternate reality. (This'll help explain why, if you live in Texas and have a European friend visiting New York, they might suggest you drive up to meet them—they have no idea that Texas alone is as large as much of their continent.)
A continent that is much bigger than Texas, though, is Australia. We're basically just a random smattering of outback to them.
Over in Greenland, though, we take up a lot more space than it appears on the map, because of the longitudinal distortion. Texas gets a bit funny-shaped that far north, but the Greenland land mass isn't as big as we think it might be.
It can also be instructive to look at the size of parts of the world we've been involved in conflicts. In the Middle East, for example, things are pretty spread out, which is useful to keep in mind. Our ally Saudi Arabia is considerably larger than Texas, while there's a great deal of distance from, say, Iran (also big enough to hold a Texas) to Libya (which is to the left of Egypt in the top map). That's perspective that it's hard to get without a frame of reference—and when you need a frame of reference, there's Texas.
The same is true in Southeast Asia. A good deal of Vietnam fits snugly alongside the stretch from Corpus Christi to Texarkana, which is a lot of miles—but you've got a whole second Texas to go if you want to include the Northern part of the country and Hanoi. But only the eastern edge of the state—by the time you get as far west as Austin, you're in Cambodia.
Afghanistan, meanwhile, is smaller than Texas on its own.
If you're the right kind of nerd, you can probably do this forever and not get bored—check it out, Mexico is maybe two and a half Texases! As a frame of reference for how big parts of the world are, Texas is a pretty good one.

Some time ago we came up with the article listing the best Ruby on Rails podcasts. Programmers, including those working in other languages, may find it interesting. Now it's time for a more creative subject. In this article we present the top 10 podcasts for everyone interested in digital design.
Listen to podcasts and stay creative
As we all know, a designer's job is all about being creative. In this line of work no one can give you an instant solution because each problem needs an individual approach. In addition to that the solution needs to be crafted perfectly to suit a selected concept. - Whaat? - You may ask. But yes, that's the sad truth. Creative approach is always helpful, but what can you do in order to stay creative and don't run out of ideas? My solution is very simple - listen to podcasts.
The shows which I've selected will give you a powerful dose of condensed knowledge which can make a huge impact on your skillset. Enough to allow you to polish your soft skills, which in our work are also very important. Each podcast is different but related to UI design, UX, animation and the problem of how to deal with emergencies when working on a project. On the list you will also find some shows regarding the process of bringing design to life. Their authors discuss how design works and how developers deal with the projects designers make.
Ok, let's cut to the chase, here's a compilation of the best podcasts. The order is random, not based on quality.. Enjoy!
Responsive web design podcast is co-hosted by Karen McGrane and Ethan Marcotte. During each show they interview designers and developers who share their thoughts and ideas about the “responsive” web world. You can dig into their guests' experiences related to implementation and flexible design solutions for large corporate environments.
Another podcast “by designers for designers”. Well described episodes and friendly atmosphere allow you to become familiar with the people who designed most of our favourite products.
On The Grid is hosted by design geeks Matt McInerny, Andy Mangold, and Dan Auer. Week by week its authors deliver some good quality content and an honest discussion on the impact of design on our world,, design fundamentals and principles.
The Design Review Podcast is a weekly talk about products, their UX and design. Chris and Jonathan are passionate, experienced designers. They share ideas about new designer software and case studies regarding UX problems..
Strongly recommended for UI designers and frontend developers who want to dive into the world of UX. Co-hosts Per Axbom and James Royal-Lawson always ready to debunk some UX myths and provide a solution for almost any problem. As the authors say: “It's not just for UXers, it's for everyone with a foot in the digital door. Sometimes we'll shoot high, sometimes we'll shoot low. Nevertheless, we aim to spread knowledge and break down silos.”
Est in 2006 by Gerry Gaffney, broadcasting straight from Australia. A free-ranging set of discussions with professionals involved in user experience design, website design, and usability in general. As the author says, these interviews are shorter and have a more serious tone than some of the others on this list but still with strong insights.
Hosted by Marc Edwards, Seth Clifford, and Rene Ritchie, who interview some of the best designers and app producers. It is focused on the mobile industry. The author takes up topics strongly related to user interface and user experience, from concept to final product.
The podcast which I truly recommend to everyone working in the web industry. Hosted by Mike Monteiro and Jessie Char - two talented designers who like to cover unconventional subjects. Attention! - it's offbeat, funny and, in a way, addictive.
Tentative is a podcast hosted by thoughtbot designers Reda Lemeden & Kyle Fiedler, subjects are related to the design of digital products for the web. I haven't heard about thoughtbot you should quickly catch up and check out this podcast immediately - so much valuable discussion is going on there.
Those guys deliver information on how animation can positively impact people when they are first experiencing something new. The content is different, but also closely related with digital design. A podcast hosted by Val Head, designer and author of the CSS animations book published by fivesimplesteps and Cennydd Bowles, a digital product designer with 14 years of experience.
Johnny, the author of this podcast, takes us into the world of interaction, psychology and user experience by showing and reviewing cases related to web design and mobile apps. Well documented show notes help us extend the knowledge gained when listening to the episodes. The discussed topics range from education and design to design practices and methods. We highly recommend this one.
Reach beyond design
From a designer's perspective, sometimes it's good to know what is going under the “hood” (and we're not talking here about backend side). That's why I also recommend the podcasts listed below. They reach beyond the problem of design. Here you'll also learn about frontend development and user experience. Get valuable insight into the problems of design, related to how users interpret and experience your projects.
I hope you find my list helpful and that the podcasts I listed above will turn out to be very inspiring. If you have any other web-design related podcasts to recommend, please share them with us in the comments below!

After losing match against Mumbai at Wankhede on Wednesday, Sreesanth and Ankeet Chavan headed to a pub to meet a bookie; the three split later, sending police squads waiting in the shadows into a hectic chase; Ajit Chandila was also picked up from a hotel later that night
After losing match against Mumbai at Wankhede on Wednesday, Sreesanth and Ankeet Chavan headed to a pub to meet a bookie; the three split later, sending police squads waiting in the shadows into a hectic chase; Ajit Chandila was also picked up from a hotel later that night
After weeks of methodically sniffing the clues and following the signs, police ensured that the after-party following the Rajasthan Royals versus Mumbai Indians match on Wednesday ended in jail for three cricketers, tainted with spot-fixing allegations.
In what is being called a credibility crisis for Indian cricket, pacer S Sreesanth and two of his Rajasthan Royals teammates Ankeet Chavan and Ajit Chandila were arrested by Delhi Police in the wee hours on Thursday from different places in Mumbai on charges of spot-fixing in at least three Indian Premier League games. The police also arrested 11 bookies.
Midnight haunt
A little before midnight on Wednesday, right after losing the RR-MI game at Wankhede, Sreesanth and Chavan made their way to the swanky pub
Or-G in Bandra (W), said an insider from the pub.
Oblivious that they had been on the police radar for the past several weeks right up to that moment, the duo went in to meet a bookie Mithania, even as a cop squad was waiting in the wings outside the bar.
A special team of the Delhi Police, helped by the Mumbai Crime Branch, had been hot on the cricketer's trail for the past few weeks. On the day, the sleuths kept tabs on each and every movement of Sreesanth and his two teammates. Even at the time Sreesanth left the stadium, cops were ceaselessly tracking him. The thorough surveillance culminated that night in a brilliantly laid trap outside the pub.
A source from Mumbai police, who was part of the special team that arrested the accused, said, “After spending half an hour at the pub, Ankeet Chavan left the pub, and one of the police teams began tailing him. When he reached the Intercontinental Hotel, cops arrested him. In the meantime, Sreesanth was still with Mithania inside the pub.”
The Or-G ends
Around 1.30 am, Sreesanth left the pub, got in a car and began driving to Waterfield Road in Bandra, the source said. Mithania, too, got in another car and drove off. The police team broke up and got behind their quarries. No sooner did Sreesanth's car reach Moti Mahal than the cops, stealthily chasing it all the while, intercepted it. The source said that three women were also present in the car. They are being questioned by the police.
In the meantime, the other police team nabbed Mithania from Linking Road. Sreesanth's teammate Chandila was also arrested from the Trident Hotel.
In a media briefing on Thursday afternoon, Delhi Police showed clippings of the three matches in which the players were allegedly involved in fixing specific overs.
The police also read out transcripts of conversations between the cricketers and the bookies, and played video clips where players were seen giving ‘indications' ahead of a ‘fixed' over. More than 100 hours of audio clippings were investigated by the police to get clues to the cricketers' involvement.
The officials said that Chandila received Rs 20 lakh, Sreesanth and Chavan allegedly received Rs 40 lakh and Rs 50 lakh respectively for collaborating with bookies or their agents. The bowlers had allegedly been asked to give away a minimum of 14 runs in their second overs. Delhi Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar said it was a coincidence that three players of the same team were involved in the fixing.
If you still think you can be anonymous on the internet, a team of Stanford and Princeton researchers has news for you: You can't. Over the summer, the team launched what they called the Footprints Project, which invited individuals to participate in an online experiment that allowed researchers to access their anonymous web browsing history, including information about active Twitter usage. Based on that information alone, Footprints successfully identified 11 out of 13 people who visited the site on its first day of operation. “I think the first thing I messaged was: ‘This is kind of scary,'” says Stanford undergraduate Ansh Shukla, a senior studying mathematics, who is working on the project with Stanford Engineering assistant professor Sharad Goel and Stanford computer science PhD student Jessica Su.
The researchers ended the Footprints experiment in October. By then almost 300 users had visited the site, and the system had accurately identified 80 percent of them.
How did it work? Users voluntarily participated in Footprints. That gave the researchers permission to gather the names of any websites that a participant clicked on through Twitter while using Google Chrome. This unique set of links is a fingerprint. To find that user, the researchers crawled through millions of Twitter profiles to see who everyone is following.
So imagine that Jane Doe, John Smith and Susie Q all participated anonymously, and that each of these three volunteers follow 100 Twitter accounts. All three might follow the official Stanford Engineering Twitter account. But Jane and John also follow the New York Times' Twitter account for their news, while Susie instead follows the Los Angeles Times as her newspaper of choice. Researchers can then deduce that the person who visited links tweeted from Stanford Engineering and the New York Times is more likely to be Jane or John, not Susie.
“Although we happen to use Twitter, it's not like Twitter is uniquely vulnerable,” Shukla says. “It doesn't take a lot of recorded characteristics to have people become unique.”
This project is part of a growing body of research that brings heightened alarm to privacy vulnerabilities on the web. For most websites we visit, we often implicitly consent to be tracked through a terms of service or “cookie” (a small file of identifying information left on a computer when you browse online) policy. Footprints researcher Arvind Narayanan, an assistant professor of computer science at Princeton, previously published a paper that demonstrated how data anonymization is broken on the web. The work became well known outside of academia because Narayanan cross-referenced Netflix user data with Internet Movie Database (IMDb) users to uniquely identify individuals.
The Footprints researchers know that online privacy risks are not new, but their latest research is “another nail in the coffin” to the idea that the average person with the average web browser can be private online, Shukla explains. “You should kind of go into the internet assuming that everything you go to someone might learn about someday,” he says.
Shukla says that even though many advertisers and internet companies might not initially know your name, they likely have most of your anonymous browsing history – even if you regularly clear your cookies. This data might be used by a commercial entity to link an anonymous person with a real identity – something that's lucrative for an advertiser – by cross-referencing databases. So an anonymous person who keeps visiting certain furniture websites might eventually be identified and targeted through a direct mail campaign. Or a political campaign might be able to target a specific voter.
Shukla hopes that as people realize how easy it is to track their digital footprints, this will lead to a change of policy, such as collecting far fewer data. He also envisions new technologies to empower consumers that are more powerful than the “do not track” setting on browsers – an injunction often ignored by websites. “Security theater,” Shukla says.
Goel notes that most people don't even realize they are leaving behind digital footprints. “We conceived this as a consciousness-raising project,” he says, adding that he and his team plan to write a journal article about the Footprints experiment.

T-Mobile has filed a fairly aggressive plan with the FCC to deploy its freshly awarded 600 MHz spectrum for mobile broadband, with a goal to cover 1 million-plus square miles of the country with service by the end of the year.
The No. 3 U.S mobile carrier laid out its plans in an ex parte filing with the FCC. T-Mobile was the big winner in the commission's April incentive auction of broadcast spectrum, 84 MHz of which has been freed up by the transition from analog to digital TV; the carrier spent $8 billion to snag holdings that are particularly concentrated in hundreds of thousands of square miles of rural and remote portions of the country, where residents may have never had wireless broadband connections, or where competition is limited. As such, much of the deployment will add new ink to the No. 3 mobile carrier's coverage map, in places like Colorado, Idaho and Wyoming.
In T-Mobile's filing, it offered a look at its 600 MHz winnings from the auction:
Mobile World Congress 2019 Attend the 2-Day Executive 5G Panel Series FierceWireless is returning to Barcelona, Spain, during Mobile World Congress 2019 with a two-day Executive 5G Panel Series at the Fira Congress Hotel, conveniently located across the street from the MWC Convention Center. The panel events will take place on Feb. 25-26 and will cover 5G and The Fixed Wireless Access Opportunity, Taking 5G Indoors, and Making 5G Ubiquitous. Attendees will have the opportunity to network and hear from 5G leaders including Verizon, Vodafone, Orange, Sprint, NTT Docomo, Boingo Wireless, Qualcomm, and more over the course of two days.

The company said in June that it has already started laying the groundwork for 600 MHz deployments, but the availability of the spectrum is dependent upon the speed of the broadcast transition. Broadcasters that participated in the auction are transitioning their operations to a different frequency band or channel share. Those that didn't participate will have their spectrum “repacked” into other bands to protect their signals from neighboring broadband interference (to ensure uninterrupted TV service). All of this means the FCC faces a time-consuming process of reauthorization and relicensing TV stations, for which it has allotted 39 months.
Broadcasters have their own share of obligations in the transition, too, and face a potential holdup given that their initial cost estimates for the move exceed the amount funded by Congress by approximately $389 million. In this week's filing, T-Mobile said that it's working with broadcasters to keep the 600 MHz relocation on schedule, and that it has agreed to invest in broadcast equipment manufacturing capacity, installation resources, help for low-power TV stations and support for TV translator licenses to make it happen.
“Quickly approving cost estimates and rapidly dispersing the money necessary to help fund broadcast relocation will complement the wireless operators' massive investments in deploying the 600 MHz spectrum as quickly as possible,” the carrier noted in the filing.
T-Mobile recently said that it's prepared to fast-track the 600 MHz deployment on its end, gaining 3GPP approval on specifications in May and working with infrastructure and device vendors to have compatible gear.

Noam Chomsky's bestselling book 9/11 (published a few months after the event) flung absurdities and pixie dust into the eyes of the left, blinding it to the obvious reality of the Zionist-led false flag coup d'état. Here is my critique of Noam Chomsky's 9/11 nonsense, delivered at last year's Left Forum in New York City (my talk begins at the 55:40 mark):
But now, Noam Chomsky is joining his harshest critics – namely Tony Hall and yours truly – in warning of coming false flag that could take American authoritarianism to the next level. In a recent interview headlined Noam Chomsky: Is It Fair to Worry About Trump Staging a False Flag Terrorist Attack? the guru of the American left put it bluntly:
In order to maintain his popularity, the Trump administration will have to try to find some means of rallying the support and changing the discourse from the policies that they are carrying out, which are basically a wrecking ball to something else. Maybe scapegoating, saying, “Well, I'm sorry, I can't bring your jobs back because these bad people are preventing it.” And the typical scapegoating goes to vulnerable people: immigrants, terrorists, Muslims and elitists, whoever it may be. And that can turn out to be very ugly. I think that we shouldn't put aside the possibility that there would be some kind of staged or alleged terrorist act, which can change the country instantly.
Obviously 9/11 was a “staged, alleged (Arab-Muslim) terrorist attack” which did indeed “change the country instantly” precisely as designed by its orchestrators. So why is Chomsky still doing everything he can to keep a lid on 9/11, while suddenly warning of a Trump false flag a.k.a. 911-2B?
Could it be that Chomsky and the rest of the left-liberal Zionist team didn't really mind the way 9/11 was staged to save Israel – and fear that the emergence of the truth could end the Zionist experiment – but also fear that a Trump 911-2B wouldn't serve their interests?
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Sepa is investigating what caused the foam to form on the river
Experts are trying to establish why a large expanse of foam has appeared on the River Clyde in Glasgow.
The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) said it had received a number of calls.
It is believed that the foam is coming from an overflow pipe located near the Tradeston Bridge, known locally as the Squiggly Bridge.
The foam stretches from the Broomielaw in the city centre to the Clyde Arc, known locally as the Squinty Bridge.
A statement from Sepa said: "Sepa currently has a number of officers committed to investigating the pollution incident in the River Clyde and samples will be taken for testing to determine any potential impact of the substance on the local environment.
"Efforts are also ongoing to determine the source of the pollution."

In a process that is out of this world, NASA is making plans to bring water and oxygen to the Moon and Mars in steps that could ultimately lead to colonization of other planets. It is just like something that happens in a sci-fi movie or a futuristic video game. Currently, shipping raw materials back and forth between Earth and neighboring solar system bodies is an incredibly expensive process, largely thanks to Earth's gravity. In fact, according to a NASA report from 2009, it can take as much as $10,000 for each pound of space shuttle cargo to blast off. Given that a gallon of water is 8.33 pounds, that means astronauts had better appreciate each bottle of water they drink like it's the last water on, well, the International Space Station.
It is no large wonder that NASA seeks to find newer and more cost-efficient ways of bringing water and oxygen to Mars and the Moon. Currently, the goal is to drop a new rover on the Moon by 2018 with the goal of extracting hydrogen and oxygen from the surface. This rover will carry something called the RESOLVE (Regolith and Environment Science and Oxygen and Lunar Volatile Extraction) science payload, which, in plain English, means it has the tools to extract all the good stuff Earthlings need from the Moon's loose surface soil (regolith). It will accomplish this by shifting through the regolith, heating it up and looking for trace amounts of hydrogen and oxygen, which can be combined to create water.
Right now, Canada's pride and joy, the Artemis Jr. rover, has been testing the RESOLVE payload on Earth. With any success, Curiosity's successor, which has yet to be named, will land on Mars in 2020 and begin searching for signs of life on the red planet with a microscope. The successor will also likely contain a similar RESOLVE payload which will help to create the first surface water that the red planet has seen in a long time. These are exciting days as humanity takes some of its first steps that could lead to planetary colonization. Check out the below video for more information on NASA's 2020 Mars rover plans.
Moving on to Bigger and Better Things
The really nice part about NASA's newest ambitious venture is that it paves the way for larger-scale space exploration. One of the main issues with modern-day space exploration, as previously discussed, is that water is just so expensive and difficult to get past Earth's gravity. Proving that water can be extracted from other planets' surfaces means that the next logical step would be to do it on bigger and more impressive scales. When this becomes a reality, space exploration will become a more feasible and cost-efficient process.
Of course, NASA is not the only organization that wants to harness water from places other than Earth. Planetary Resources Inc., a startup backed by billionaires such as Google's own Larry Page, intends to harvest water from near-Earth asteroids, some as close as the Moon. Successfully doing so would bring trillions of dollars to Earth and it is not unlikely that at least some of that money would go towards helping other space agencies such as NASA explore the solar system and beyond.
NASA already received an $800 million budget increase this year, bringing their total funding up to $17.65 billion, which is certainly a good thing, although there is always room for more growth. After all, consider that the U.S. military budget is set at $612.4 billion for 2014 and it seems like NASA drew the short straw. With plans as ambitious as taking oxygen and hydrogen from the Moon and Mars and turning them into water, hopefully decision makers will see and understand the importance of what is happening with space exploration today. By understanding the value of these steps, that could lead to the colonization of other planets; additional support would make even bigger and better things possible.

Somehow, left-liberals have associated the cause of gun rights with white racism, when if anything it is gun control that has a racist legacy. In the United States, early gun laws targeted recently freed blacks, and open carry first became banned in California under Governor Ronald Reagan to disarm groups like the Black Panthers. Today, blacks and Hispanics are disproportionately subjected to humiliating stop-and-frisk searches in the name of gun control.
Perhaps the most telling data concerns the racial makeup of who goes to prison for gun violations. According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, for Fiscal Year 2011, 49.6% of those sentenced to federal incarceration with a primary offense of firearms violations were black, 20.6% were Hispanic, and only 27.5% were white.
This is how gun laws actually work—those caught violating them go to prison. For the mere act of owning an illegal weapon—not necessarily for using it, not for threatening anyone with it, not for being irresponsible with it—people who have harmed no one are locked up in prison for years at a time. As with the rest of the criminal justice system, particularly the war on drugs, these laws disproportionately harm the poor and minorities. That is the inescapable reality of gun control.
It makes sense that blacks and others living in the inner city would rely more on private, illegal guns for self-defense. The police are unreliable at best in many of these communities. It also makes sense that minorities would be disproportionately hurt by these laws, because so many of the dynamics in play are the same as with the drug war—people are being punished for what they own, rather than what they have done to others; it is easier for police to go after those in poor neighborhoods than to search middle-class folks in nice neighborhoods; jurors approved by prosecutors tend to believe police testimony over the word of minority defendants; prosecutors tend to use discretion in possession crime cases that fall more painfully on the disenfranchised; public defenders offer inadequate services for those loads of court-appointed clients, and so forth.
Left-liberals will respond that the racist implementation of gun laws is a problem independent of firearms policy, that we need stricter laws against guns and we'll deal with inequity in prosecution and sentencing separately. But rarely do they make the same point with drug policy. Progressives know that in origin and in practice, drug policy is unmistakably racist. There is no way to easily purge the system of its racist elements—the problems are too entrenched. Yet these people somehow don't fully grasp that this is just as unavoidably true as it concerns gun control policy.
When it comes to restricting firearms, liberals have an amazing ability to ignore the hard truth of what they are advocating—putting more people in cages. That is what gun control is. Sometimes it almost seems like progressives are completely blind to this obvious reality—that they understand the problems with drug laws, that they see laws like Three Strikes unfairly punish people for minor property crimes, that they detect a problem with the death penalty even for convicted murderers, that they know that for the whole range of criminal offenses, the state tends to go overboard in dealing with the accused. Except for gun control! On this, we can expect equity, fairness, and efficiency! In truth, putting people in cages won't make a dent in criminal gun ownership, just as having a half million people behind bars for drug offenses has hardly stemmed the availability of illicit drugs. But that's a whole other set of questions.
There are a hundred reasons why I oppose gun control. But here is one that lefties, if they are to be consistent at all, need to take to heart: More gun laws mean more peaceful people, disproportionately young black and brown men, who have committed no violence against anyone, being locked up in cells. That might make you feel safer. But it makes me feel like I live in a mockery of a free, humane society.

British soldier who left base 'to fight against Isis' has returned to his unit, defence minister says BelfastTelegraph.co.uk A serving British soldier who left his army base to join Kurdish fighters battling against Isis has been found and is being returned to his unit, according to the Defence Secretary. https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/uk/british-soldier-who-left-base-to-fight-against-isis-has-returned-to-his-unit-defence-minister-says-31015833.html https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/uk/article31006404.ece/2cd0d/AUTOCROP/h342/PANews%20BT_P-33955204-b5e0-4ebd-9b9d-5673c232c081_I1.jpg

A serving British soldier who left his army base to join Kurdish fighters battling against Isis has been found and is being returned to his unit, according to the Defence Secretary.
The unidentified solider, understood to be 19-years-old, left his base after telling his family he was joining Kurdish peshmerga fighters in their battle against the extremist group, saying: "these guys need our help."
Speaking during the regular Commons defence questions, Mr Fallon said: “The House may also want to know the soldier reported as missing last week has now been located and is being returned to his unit.”
When reports of the incident emerged last week, a Ministry of Defence spokesman confirmed that the situation was being investigated.
The soldier had joined the army as a 16-year-old after he left school, and had reportedly been learning Arabic.
"I've gone to join the Kurds in Syria and Iraq,” he wrote to his family, according to Sky News.
He continued that he was with other British people and a Canadian, adding: "I don't know how to explain it to you but I really want and need to do this and I will be safe."
The incident comes after it emerged last December that two former British soldiers travelled to Syria to fight against the group calling itself the Islamic State, which has claimed swathes of Syria and Iraq since last summer.
The pair said they felt "compelled" to take up arms following the murder of aid volunteer Alan Henning.
During the Commons defence questions, Mr Fallon was also asked to outline Britain's plans to tackle Isis.
Labour MP John Woodcock argued that it was troubling defence chiefs failed to outline the objectives for the campaign against Isis in recent evidence to a Commons committee.
Michael Fallon told the Commons: “Our plan in Iraq is very simple - it is to disrupt threats to the UK mainland and our interests overseas."
Referring the US-led coalition against Isis, he continued: "Secondly it is as part of an international coalition to defeat Isil [Isis], including discrediting its violent ideology.
"It is thirdly to mitigate the impact of Isil and other violent extremist groups on the stability of the region as a whole."

Share. CCO Ted Sarandos talks Firefly, Buffy and Jericho revivals. CCO Ted Sarandos talks Firefly, Buffy and Jericho revivals.
When it comes to Netflix and its recent entry into original programming with the likes of House of Cards and the highly anticipated fourth season of Arrested Development, it's difficult to ignore the potential for future streaming content.
In a recent interview with Stuff, Netflix's Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos was asked about a slew of different shows and projects and how much potential there was for them to get new episodes via the streaming service. With Arrested Development producer Ron Howard also attempting to get a hybrid movie/TV series version of Stephen King's The Dark Tower off the ground for years, could that be a good fit for Netflix?
"I spoke to Ron about it, actually," Sarandos said. "The last time we talked about it the thing was being kicked about HBO -- but it's no longer there. Once Arrested Development gets through we'll keep talking about it." The plan has been for The Dark Tower to be a film trilogy and also a TV series, which would intertwine with the movies, so it remains to be seen how the movie portion would work if Netflix became involved.
And what about reviving another cult show like, say, oh, I don't know... Firefly? Well, it seems Sarandos doesn't feel the audience for that Joss Whedon-created series is quite large enough to justify bringing it back. "It's kind of been done, with Serenity, but yeah as a series... Arrested Development was the rarest of birds in that the audience of the show grew larger than the original broadcast audience because people came to discover it years after it was cancelled. The Firefly fan is still the Firefly fan from when it was on TV and there's fewer of them and they're more passionate every year. Whereas with Arrested Development we're going to be serving a multiple of the original audience. Any of the other shows we could bring back would be a fraction of the original audience."
Exit Theatre Mode
Sarandos was also asked about Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Jericho, the latter of which was said to be a possibility for a Netflix revival last year. "[Jericho] was on the bubble," he said. "I don't think a day goes by that I don't get an email or a personal handwritten letter about that show."
As for Buffy, "That's one that'll come up on everyone's list. She's a great character. If it was my property I'd do infrequent movies. There's not enough kick-ass female characters like that."

Google's AI-powered health tech subsidiary, DeepMind Health, is planning to use a new technology loosely based on bitcoin to let hospitals, the NHS and eventually even patients track what happens to personal data in real-time.
Dubbed “Verifiable Data Audit”, the plan is to create a special digital ledger that automatically records every interaction with patient data in a cryptographically verifiable manner. This means any changes to, or access of, the data would be visible.
DeepMind has been working in partnership with London's Royal Free Hospital to develop kidney monitoring software called Streams and has faced criticism from patient groups for what they claim are overly broad data sharing agreements. Critics fear that the data sharing has the potential to give DeepMind, and thus Google, too much power over the NHS.
In a blogpost, DeepMind co-founder, Mustafa Suleyman, and head of security and transparency, Ben Laurie, use an example relating to the Royal Free Hospital partnership to explain how the system will work. “[An] entry will record the fact that a particular piece of data has been used, and also the reason why, for example, that blood test data was checked against the NHS national algorithm to detect possible acute kidney injury,” they write.
Suleyman says that development on the data audit proposal began long before the launch of Streams, when Laurie, the co-creator of the widely-used Apache server software, was hired by DeepMind. “This project has been brewing since before we started DeepMind Health,” he told the Guardian, “but it does add another layer of transparency.
“Our mission is absolutely central, and a core part of that is figuring out how we can do a better job of building trust. Transparency and better control of data is what will build trust in the long term.” Suleyman pointed to a number of efforts DeepMind has already undertaken in an attempt to build that trust, from its founding membership of the industry group Partnership on AI to its creation of a board of independent reviewers for DeepMind Health, but argued the technical methods being proposed by the firm provide the “other half” of the equation.
Nicola Perrin, the head of the Wellcome Trust's “Understanding Patient Data” taskforce, welcomed the verifiable data audit concept. “There are a lot of calls for a robust audit trail to be able to track exactly what happens to personal data, and particularly to be able to check how data is used once it leaves a hospital or NHS Digital. DeepMind are suggesting using technology to help deliver that audit trail, in a way that should be much more secure than anything we have seen before.”
Perrin said the approach could help address DeepMind's challenge of winning over the public. “One of the main criticisms about DeepMind's collaboration with the Royal Free was the difficulty of distinguishing between uses of data for care and for research. This type of approach could help address that challenge, and suggests they are trying to respond to the concerns.
“Technological solutions won't be the only answer, but I think will form an important part of developing trustworthy systems that give people more confidence about how data is used.”
The systems at work are loosely related to the cryptocurrency bitcoin, and the blockchain technology that underpins it. DeepMind says: “Like blockchain, the ledger will be append-only, so once a record of data use is added, it can't later be erased. And like blockchain, the ledger will make it possible for third parties to verify that nobody has tampered with any of the entries.”
Laurie downplays the similarities. “I can't stop people from calling it blockchain related,” he said, but he described blockchains in general as “incredibly wasteful” in the way they go about ensuring data integrity: the technology involves blockchain participants burning astronomical amounts of energy – by some estimates as much as the nation of Cyprus – in an effort to ensure that a decentralised ledger can't be monopolised by any one group.
DeepMind argues that health data, unlike a cryptocurrency, doesn't need to be decentralised – Laurie says at most it needs to be “federated” between a small group of healthcare providers and data processors – so the wasteful elements of blockchain technology need not be imported over. Instead, the data audit system uses a mathematical function called a Merkle tree, which allows the entire history of the data to be represented by a relatively small record, yet one which instantly shows any attempt to rewrite history.
Although not technologically complete yet, DeepMind already has high hopes for the proposal, which it would like to see form the basis of a new model for data storage and logging in the NHS overall, and potentially even outside healthcare altogether. Right now, says Suleyman, “It's really difficult for people to know where data has moved, when, and under which authorised policy. Introducing a light of transparency under this process I think will be very useful to data controllers, so they can verify where their processes have used or moved or accessed data.
“That's going to add technical proof to the governance transparency that's already in place. The point is to turn that regulation into a technical proof.”
In the long-run, Suleyman says, the audit system could be expanded so that patients can have direct oversight over how and where their data has been used. But such a system would come a long time in the future, once concerns over how to secure access have been solved.
ESPN NFL analyst Tim Hasselbeck agrees with LB Karlos Dansby that front office changes were needed in the Browns' organization and discusses what the top priorities are for new coach Hue Jackson. (1:58)
A "suffocating" atmosphere caused by internal conflict dragged the Cleveland Browns down in 2015, veteran Browns linebacker Karlos Dansby said Monday.
As a result, he welcomed the team's postseason changes, which included replacing coach Mike Pettine with Hue Jackson and firing general manager Ray Farmer.
"I think everybody needed it, man," Dansby said. "Even the organization. I think the organization needed it more than the players."
Editor's Picks McManamon: Browns' playoff lesson is at QB The lesson of the playoffs for the Cleveland Browns again rested in one position as the importance of a big, strong-armed pocket passer was on full display, Pat McManamon writes.
Dansby said he didn't know what was wrong, but the team and players could feel the internal conflict.
"There was something about the situation that wasn't right," Dansby said. "And it was in the atmosphere. It was suffocating. You kept fighting and fighting and fighting, but you know it's there. You'd try to fight out of it, but it kept grabbing you and somehow pulling down into that boat."
Dansby said his 12 years in the NFL have shown him that a team has to be united at all levels to win. If there is division in the building, players feel it because it trickles down to them, he said.
"It's suffocating," he said. 'Because you try to do everything you can to try to motivate guys and keep guys inspired. When you're not getting inspiration from the leader, it was tough."
In the Browns' former system, Farmer picked the players and Pettine decided how they would be used on Sunday. It led to a glaring situation in which Farmer gave wide receiver Dwayne Bowe $9 million in guaranteed money but Pettine kept him inactive for nine games and Bowe caught five passes all season.
Dansby said it came across to players that Pettine could not inspire the team because of the internal disagreements.
"I felt like it was too much on him fighting that fight and then trying to inspire us," Dansby said. "He couldn't balance it because that fight was too overwhelming. You could see it on his face and in his body language."
As a result, players were dragged down by the atmosphere.
"It was a tough job for us," Dansby said. "I can't lie."
Topics from employment insurance to funding for Syrian refugees were on the table during a short meeting between Premier Brad Wall and the prime minister in Saskatoon on Wednesday.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau met briefly with Wall on Wednesday evening.
Wall said he feels encouraged that Trudeau is listening to, and understands the economic challenges Saskatchewan currently faces.
The two discussed getting Saskatchewan oil to market. Wall said he was pleased to hear Trudeau sided with him.
"We need to move our oil to tidewater and the prime minister has said that many times," Wall said.
Here's what Prime Minister Trudeau and Premier Wall had to say after their meeting 2:31
But the process of getting pipelines approved still has to follow a rigorous design and consultation process, which Wall said can't be put off any longer.
The Premier said he will continue to speak out to the federal government on the Energy East pipeline, because it would result in a greater investment in Saskatchewan, and it will give Canada a chance to move away from importing foreign oil.
"It will also make sure there's less oil on railways, which is not as safe as oil on a pipeline," he said.
Rethinking EI extensions
Trumpeting his thoughts on Ottawa's Employment Insurance (EI) benefits extension, Wall said he asked Trudeau to reevaluate the program, because a huge chunk of southern Saskatchewan was left out.
"I'm not saying the federal government screwed up… but I am saying there is a formula that I think kicked out some numbers that has excluded some regions of our province where there are a lot of oil workers," said Wall.
Wall said Trudeau promised his government would monitor the benefits extension.
"I'm hopeful that monitoring will turn into action."
New Syrian refugees
Syrian newcomers to Saskatchewan were also discussed as the premier told the prime minister they're still waiting for financial support that was promised from Ottawa when they started to aggressively accept Syrians refugees late in 2015.
Thus far Saskatchewan has taken in 1,100 Syrians, but schools have limited resources and access to English as a Second Language (ESL) instructors.
School boards need more support for Syrian students, according to Wall, and he said they have a figure of about $6.3 million in costs with respect to refugees.
Skip The Dishes subsidy
When asked about a recently announced $3 million subsidy to Skip The Dishes, an online food ordering company with an office in Saskatoon, Wall defended the investment. He said it's a way of creating 300 new jobs in the province over the next three years.
"I think it's going to be important as we continue to diversify the economy, especially because these are tech-sector jobs and you're going to see other sectors from companies who want to invest in Saskatchewan," said Wall.
He said that when the provincial budget comes out in June, there won't be the same level of subsidy dollars for businesses.
If there are fewer jobs created than the contract requires, the company is required to pay some of the money back to the provincial government.
Trudeau visits high school

Trudeau made a stop at Oskayak High School in Saskatoon Wednesday morning, where he had a meet and greet with students from the Aboriginal Youth Entrepreneurship Program.
"The success [of this school] is an example of the things that we need to be working on–not just in Saskatoon, but across the country," said Trudeau during his opening remarks.
During his visit, he participated in a Q&A with students and media, answering questions about education, building relationships with indigenous communities and focusing on environmental issues.
"Learning how to understand and empower is at the centre of being a teacher, but it's also, for me, at the centre of being a politician and a prime minister," he said.

The Bubba Gump Shrimp Company Restaurant and Market is an American seafood restaurant chain inspired by the 1994 film Forrest Gump. As of July 2015, forty Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. restaurants operate worldwide. Twenty-nine of these locations are in the United States, four are in Mexico, three are in Japan, Malaysia and in Colombia and one each in London, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Canada, the Marianas and the Philippines. The company is based in Houston, Texas, and has been a division of Landry's Restaurants since 2010.
The first Bubba Gump restaurant opened in 1996 in Monterey, California by Rusty Pelican Restaurants in partnership with Viacom. Viacom is owner of Paramount Pictures, the distributor of Forrest Gump. The Bubba Gump restaurant is named after the film's characters Benjamin Buford "Bubba" Blue and Forrest Gump. In the film, Bubba suggested getting in the shrimping business and, ultimately, Forrest pursued the idea after Bubba's death in the Vietnam War.
History [ edit ]
In 1995, Paramount Pictures approached Rusty Pelican Restaurants Inc. with a desire to create a restaurant based on a theme from Paramount's 1994 film Forrest Gump. The Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. was created as a result. Within a year the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. created a concept idea for the restaurant chain which was then licensed by Paramount Licensing, Inc. In 1996, the first Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. restaurant was opened in Monterey, California; its success led to its franchising on an international scale.[2]
In November 2010, Landry's, Inc. acquired Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. for an undisclosed amount.[3] The Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. purchase also included a lone Rusty Pelican in Newport Beach, California.
Bubba Gump Restaurant in Hong Kong
Like the name suggests, Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.'s menu consists mostly of shrimp dishes and other seafood, as well as Southern and Cajun cuisine. The restaurant offers dishes named after characters in the movie, like Jenny's Catch and the restaurant's bestseller Forrest's Seafood Feast.[4][5] Restaurants display movie memorabilia throughout the restaurant. Guests can play Forrest Gump movie trivia and can signal their waiter with a “Stop, Forrest, Stop” sign.
Employee social media policy [ edit ]
In 2013, a former Bubba Gump employee claimed that the social media policy in the company's employee handbook had a restrictive effect on employees' rights by prohibiting them from discussing their jobs online.[6] In 2015, a National Labor Relations Board administrative law judge ruled that Bubba Gump did not violate employees' rights as they did not explicitly prohibit employees from discussing job-related subjects, but only expected them to do so in a civil manner. [7] There have been many cases in the last few years in which the National Labor Relations Board found companies social media policies to be overboard, and ruled in favor of the employee(s).[8]
Chris Pratt [ edit ]
Actor Chris Pratt was discovered in 2000 while working as a waiter at the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. in Maui, Hawaii.[9] He waited on the table of actor/director Rae Dawn Chong, who had starred in one of Pratt's favorite films, Commando. Chong offered Pratt a role in a short movie she was directing at the time.
Namaste readers!
My name is Stephanie Ellison. I am a Sanātani (Hindu) and have been for many years at varying levels. I first became exposed to it when I was studying to be a Natural Hygienist in Austin, Texas in 1994-95. Natural Hygiene has many of the elements of taking care of your health in a wholistic manner as opposed to an allopathic manner as is common in Western civilization. It teaches ahiṃsa, respect for all nature, respect for other people and living beings, appropriate dietary for humans and animals, and living appropriately in terms of vital energy conservation. I wasn't yet aware of some links to Sanātana Dharma (Hinduism) from this course, but the very basic dietary path was laid down for me and made the process of waking up a “direct connect-up” to Sanātana Dharma. I'll explain as follows.
About 10 years ago, while doing underground financial research in my spare time (an area where I learned exactly how the financial enforcement arm of the banking class within Western civilization works), I had stumbled upon an article series about India's love for gold and how it plays a role in many levels in Dharmic society.
This work led me to see how I have some similarities between practicing Sanātanis and myself. This was the first indication that I had seen that there might be something to the connection between myself and Sanātana Dharma. In the following years up until about a year and a half ago, I kept finding articles here and there about Sanātana Dharma and India, and I kept feeling myself being pulled closer and closer in a spiral to Sanātana Dharma.
Finally, about a year and a half ago, I had decided to jump in and do detail research ABOUT Sanātana Dharma rather than Sanātana Dharma ITSELF. I took this position because I felt it was important to do “White Studies” on myself, to understand where I am coming from as a white woman of European stock, and how our European past has affected me, entailing privilege and especially worldview positioning from a western perspective, arising from history. I wanted to know how I was going to get tripped up by my biases upon studying Sanātana Dharma scriptures and sacred writings.
My bias isn't so much a Christian, fully-western perspective, though the latter is a bit of influence on me, but rather an Ancient perspective. I remember when I was past eight years old when I first learned about religion, but first, I ought to explain something. I am deaf and 50 years old, so this gives you an idea of how something like this could happen, in the '60s and early ‘70s. I was not diagnosed to be profoundly deaf until I was seven and a half years old.
What happened as a result of my deafness is what I call a “reset,” in that whatever “progress” that was supposed to be made in the context of civilizing of children from generation to generation was temporarily stopped. I spent a year learning to lip-read, speak, and read/write English. By that time, I was exposed to my Catholic nanny's ways at eight and half years old. By then, it was too late. My Self is just too strong. Explained further, this “reset” I experienced affected the “color” of three lenses that we all see through:
1. Language – this affects what you read, what language you use to make sense of the religious experience, and the medium of talking you used to share this experience.
2. Socialization – this affects how you share the experience with others, whether it's that of a woman who may or may not share more intimately with another woman the religious experience than with a man she is not married to, or maybe you proselytize people or not.
3. Religion – the experience itself within. This affects how you see the world, life, etc., whether with a history-centric view, how you see chaos versus order, what God or something else looks like to you, and all of the details that entail a particular religion.
The three lenses combine together to create people of many ways, whether it be an American Christian who speaks English, a French Catholic speaking French, or an Indian Sanātani who speaks a variety of Indic languages. The country, the language, and the cultural setting can all vary independently.
It was a very difficult place for me, because I am originally Native, or an Ancient. I was one without a recognized spiritual path. My Old Way is Native Human (not Native American) living in modern civilization, and I have carried intact to this day this worldview, which I'm unable to explain because there are no words for it, as I didn't learn to speak English until I was fitted with hearing aids during the seventh summer (I was born in January). I called this perspective “Ancient,” as in I am an Ancient. I felt like I was a Sampradāya of ONE for a long time, and this sampradāya would die with the end of this present life. The struggle I have had was not successfully assimilating into anything, because of my Native status, even if I tried to assimilate into traditional Cherokee beliefs. I found myself pulling back and staying where I had been inside all my life.
It wasn't until I had done enough research on Sanātana Dharma that I began to realize that because of my Natural Hygiene background and my ongoing, occasional research into Sanātana Dharma, that this basis and my Ancient perspective gave way as a direct connect-up to Sanātana Dharma. As I did not grow up Christian (because I could not accept it and resisted vigorously with many questions in Bible Study camp one summer – my stepmother had to pull me out early, to her consternation), I did not have the usual issues of radically changing my perspective from a Christian perspective of God to a Dharmi perspective of Brahman and the manifold manifestations (Brahman, Īshvara, avatāras, mūrtis, iśta-devatā, etc.). It was familiar to me, and I understood it right away. It felt like I was aware of Brahman Nirākā, Saguṇa (formless Brahman, but with qualities) from the earliest time I can remember.
A little over a year ago, I had stumbled across Rajiv Malhotra's web site, and this was where I began to critically look at what is depicted as “Hinduism” in the US (because I've been around the Christian style of thinking enough to be able to see it even in Hindu garb, and this would set off red flags). I have read several different books by different authors that explain the misconceptions about Sanātana Dharma arising from the educational monopoly of Western Academics as well as historical rewriting or obfuscation that hides and changes important information that everyone needs to know regarding the true nature of Sanātana Dharma, Western Abrahamic hegemony, and the true history of origination of knowledge from India and how it was disseminated across Central and Western Asia before arriving in Europe centuries later.
My desire for joining Rajiv Malhotra's work is to ENSURE that Sanātana Dharma not only survives, but also THRIVES in today's circumstances, which seem very dark unless changes are made regarding how one lives as a civilized human being. Today, in western civilization, we are faced with many problems, especially of an existential nature. It may not be too long before we don't have anything to discuss because we become too busy trying to survive, protect our families, and ensure their survival in dire circumstances. It must be realized, as certain people have proposed, that while there is Capitalism as one economic system and Communism as another economic system, both of them are NOT viable in the long run because of structural problems in terms of varṇāśramadharma, or the 4 occupational divisions of society and the four stages in a person's life, in addition to the four goals of life (artha, dharma, kāma, and mokṣa).
A third economic model is offered, that of varṇāśramadharma as found in the context of saṃskṛti. This is a model that needs to be considered by many other countries in the attempt to rebalance themselves, because this offers a way to introduce Inner Science through Dharma to help balance out what has been Western civilization's destructive tendencies as far as employees, employers, customers, and the environment is concerned. What we see is the case of western civilization greatly advancing its materialistic sciences and technologies, but without the Inner Science development that needs to occur, commensurate with the heavy responsibilities it entails towards all the people and the environment.
There are two options as solutions, and they both will not work; that of going all the way back to the time when invaders from the northwest starting coming into India, or dropping everything that is Bhārata and adopting Western civilization. Instead, the sensible thing to do, in my opinion is to combine the scientific knowledge from the West (which is the useful part) with the Inner Science of the East (which is NECESSARY for personal and civilizational development and refinement). I want to give my support to make this a reality for everyone.

Afghan police officers stand gaurd near the Park Place guest house in Kabul early on May 14. (Agence France-Presse)
Four Indians and an American were among 14 killed when gunmen stormed a guest in Kabul, trapping several foreigners in a seven-hour overnight siege, Afghan officials said on Thursday.A few of the attackers were also killed by Afghan security forces.The gunmen attacked the Park Palace guest house in Kabul's Kolola Pushta area at around 8:30 pm local time on Wednesday. Six Indians were in the building at the time; three have been moved to safety but one is still missing.Explosions and bursts of gunfire were heard as the gunmen reportedly went from room to room searching for people; witnesses told NDTV that bullets whizzed past them as they hid in their rooms.Sources have told NDTV that India's envoy could have been the intended target as the Indian embassy is in the same area.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is in China on a three-day visit, tweeted late last night: "In the aircraft I got news about the attack in Kabul. Am concerned about the situation & I pray for everyone's safety (sic)."Kabul Police Chief Abdul Rahman Rahimi told reporters that at least 44 guests - some had come for a music concert - were rescued by the police and special forces.A concert by well-known Afghan classical singer Altaf Hussain was about to begin at the guest house when the gunfire started.Kolola Pushta is home to several international guest houses and hotels and is near the Afghan interior ministry.The attack comes a day after a visit to Kabul by Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who pledged to support Afghanistan in its battle against the Taliban, saying "the enemies of Afghanistan cannot be the friends of Pakistan."Wednesday's assault was reminiscent of two attacks last year on a hotel and a restaurant in which 30 were killed. Earlier on Wednesday, gunmen opened fire at a meeting of Muslim clerics in Helmand, killing at least seven people. The Taliban, ousted from power in 2001, have stepped up attacks since they announced their "spring offensive" last month, after most foreign forces pulled out at the end of last year.
President Donald Trump has signed the 2017 NASA Authorization Act, the first complete authorization for the agency since 2010. The bill lays out NASA's directives along with a proposed budget for the 2018 fiscal year at $19.5 billion — a $0.2 billion raise from the previous year. It must still run through a congressional appropriations process to set the final funding for NASA.
The authorization act passed in the Senate with unanimous support and by voice vote in the House.
While the bill reaffirms NASA's commitments to the International Space Station (through 2024) and to future manned missions into deep space, certain elements — or the lack thereof — have caused concern among some scientists, including space baron Elon Musk.
Here are some of the bill's biggest changes.
*****
So long, Earth science
Rewind to 1958: The act that formally created America's space agency had a set of objectives. The first goal listed: “The expansion of human knowledge of phenomena in the atmosphere and space.”
Congress has maintained this objective for NASA, under Republican and Democratic administrations alike, until Trump signed this most recent bill Tuesday.
What changed:
The new authorization bill removes all mention of earth sciences , a section that was included in the NASA authorization bill signed in 2010.
, a section that was included in the NASA authorization bill signed in 2010. It also removed sections on NASA's collaboration with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on the investigation of the Earth's atmosphere.
Why it happened:
The new bill was authored by Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who has said in the past that he “is concerned in the current environment, that NASA has lost its focus” by focusing on climate change.
During a debate over the new bill, Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), who chairs the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, said the bill ensures “NASA is not burdened with funding other agency missions.”
Why it matters:
“Those programs provide the space-based measurements to help scientists understand the Earth's systems and changing climate to predict space weather events, which can have devastating impacts on our terrestrial infrastructure,” Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas), said of the missing science and heliophysics programs .
Scientists have pointed out that the items in question also include a lot of practical programs, “such as safeguards to avoid eating toxic shellfish, reduce aviation disruptions and tracking unhealthy air quality,” said Brenda Ekwurzel, senior climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

Who's on the hook if a commercial spaceship goes kaboom?
Meanwhile, the commercialization of space travel has strolled into its heyday.
In the 2017 authorization, Congress restates its dedication to NASA's Commercial Crew Program, a six-year-old initiative that provides government funds to private sector companies — like Blue Origin, SpaceX or Boeing — to develop space transportation vehicles.
What changed:
The bill requires NASA to prioritize the use of its own launch vehicles or commercial providers over those of foreign entities like Russia . Russian space vehicles had transported a number of American astronauts, including Scott Kelly, to the ISS in recent years.
. Russian space vehicles had transported a number of American astronauts, including Scott Kelly, to the ISS in recent years. The 2017 authorization act also calls on NASA to facilitate the “commercialization and economic development” of low-earth orbit activities , such as lowering the costs of commercial satellite operations and exploring the possibility of transferring the International Space Station into the private sector.
, such as lowering the costs of commercial satellite operations and exploring the possibility of transferring the International Space Station into the private sector. The power to invoke indemnity clauses — which place risk, or financial liability for an accident, on the government instead of private suppliers — moves from Congress to the executive branch, in this case, the NASA administrator.
Shortly after the signing, Vice President Mike Pence announced plans to reinstate the National Space Council. The space policy committee , which ran from 1958 to 1973 and again under President George H.W. Bush in the early 1990s, has a long legacy of executive control over NASA.
“We're going to be bringing together the best and the brightest in NASA and also in the private sector,” said Pence, who will lead the NSC. “We have elected a builder president and, as he said, America once again has to start building and leading to the stars.”
Why it happened:
“This bill will make sure that NASA's most important and effective programs are sustained,” Trump said after Tuesday's signing. “It orders NASA to continue transitioning activities to the commercial sector where we have seen great progress. So many people and so many companies are so into exactly what NASA stands for, so the commercial and the private sector will get to use these facilities and I hope they're going to be paying us a lot of money.”
Why it matters:
The indemnity clause provisions actually aren't new. “We have had commercial space transportation law going back to 1984 that codifies a risk-sharing agreement between the government and the private sector,” said Joanne Gabrynowicz, editor-in-chief emerita of the Journal of Space Law. “It would be triggered in the event of a catastrophic loss — and happily, that provision of the law hasn't been needed yet.” But the shift gives more power to the executive branch rather than Congress.

This kind of mandate has appeared in similar legislation before, but the 2017 version re-ups the terms. By comparison, the Mars Curiosity Rover mission cost $2.6 billion. (Reminder: NASA's current budget is $19.3 billion, approximately 0.5 percent of the total federal budget).

Despite the commercial commitments to near-Earth travel, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said he wasn't happy with new act's prospects for deep space. “This bill changes almost nothing about what NASA is doing,” Musk stated via Twitter. “Existing programs stay in place and there is no added funding for Mars.”

Deep space and cyberspace
Two additional tidbits in the act address NASA prospects in deep space and cyberspace.
What's changed:
The bill creates the TREAT Astronauts Act, which addresses the need for medical coverage for U.S. astronauts that spend extensive time in space flight , such as on future missions to the moon, Mars or elsewhere in the Solar System.
, such as on future missions to the moon, Mars or elsewhere in the Solar System. Unless new technology is developed, these trips will feature extensive exposure to microgravity and cosmic radiation with unknown ramifications. The TREAT Act would provide medical monitoring for astronauts years after they return and retire , namely for those who may not have access to military insurance plans.
, namely for those who may not have access to military insurance plans. The bill also requires NASA to establish agency-wide information security and to establish accountability, governance and implementation oversight to meet standard cybersecurity best practices.
Why it matters:
That looked even more likely on Monday, after the Maple Leafs completed a season sweep of the Boston Bruins of at least four games for the first time since 1924-1925 with a 4-2 win at Air Canada Centre, putting them one point back of the Bruins for third place in the Atlantic Division with one game in hand. It gave them a bit of breathing room too on their closest competition for the second wild card into the playoffs from the Eastern Conference, with a three-point advantage on the New York Islanders and four points on the Tampa Bay Lightning.
TORONTO -- There is no longer any doubt about the narrative that Nazem Kadri and the Toronto Maple Leafs have been pushing for much of the season: They are for real. They can make some noise. They can get into the Stanley Cup Playoffs.
"I've said that from the start: We're going to surprise some teams," Kadri said.
In the end, it was their power play that won it, the second-best in the League with the man-advantage against the second-best on the penalty kill. And though the Bruins clearly were not pleased with the call that resulted in that tie-breaking power play goal by Tyler Bozak at 18:03 of the third period - Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy called it "egregious" - the Maple Leafs were only concerned with the final outcome.
"They're a team that we're trying to catch and they're trying to pull away from us," Bozak said. "Those games are going to be tight. There's not a lot of room. They're going to be close games, so it's nice that we're finding ways to win. That was a big win for us tonight."
They had kept it tight enough that that power-play goal could make the difference, yielding empty-net goals at 18:47 by William Nylander and 19:09 by Kadri, before Dominic Moore got one back with 10 seconds remaining. The Maple Leafs had withstood the Bruins' push in the first half of the first period, after David Backes scored at 7:26.
And then Morgan Rielly tied the game at 14:05 of the first on a 4-on-4, a goal that would stand up until the game nearly went to overtime.
But it didn't. Instead, unlike on Saturday when they settled for an overtime loss to the Chicago Blackhawks, the Maple Leafs went home with two points, the Bruins with none.
"It's massive, especially to do it in the fashion that we did, regulation," Kadri said.
"That's how it's going to go for the last 11, 12 games here - it's that type of playoff hockey where one or two mistakes cost you the game. You're not going to see too much open ice out there, so it's important when you get those chances, you capitalize on them."

It was a game that, at times, became chippy and contentious, with Leo Komarov and Brad Marchand engaging, with Patrice Bergeron taking exception to a hit by Nikita Soshnikov. It was a game in which passions ran high, in which emotions were raised, given the stakes.
And that was especially true for the Maple Leafs.
"We've had moments where we haven't exactly done that, but I think we've learned from them and we've gotten better as the year's gone on," Rielly said of grinding out wins. "When you come down the stretch and you play in these important games late in the season, you learn a lot. This is where you learn how to win."
Since the Maple Leafs returned from an ugly trip to California, finishing a run of no wins in five games, they have gone 5-1-1, reasserting themselves in a playoff race that briefly looked to be slipping from their fingers. They have a chance to vastly improve their positioning in the playoffs, a concept that would have been almost laughable to start the season.
The Maple Leafs could catch the Bruins, taking over third place in the Atlantic, which offers a series against the No. 2 team in the division, currently the Ottawa Senators. That would be a far better draw than the second wild card, which brings with it the best team in the Metropolitan, which could be the Washington Capitals or the Columbus Blue Jackets or the Pittsburgh Penguins, all still capable of winning the Presidents' Trophy.
"It's a different look," Kadri said. "Either way, we're going to be playing some good teams and if we want to get to our end goal, which is the Stanley Cup, we're going to have to go through some good teams anyway. Right now, our focus is on getting in; don't matter which place we get in. Obviously the higher, the better."
They took one more step forward Monday. And with it, the standings got even tighter, even closer, even more likely to yield a playoff berth for the Maple Leafs.
Silicon Valley seems to think that the march to self-driving vehicles is inexorable, but the carmaking industry's biggest players are betting that most drivers prefer to keep their hands on the wheel.
According to one estimate, self-driving technology in cars may grow into a $42 billion industry in just a decade. Google is zooming to a fully self-driving commercial vehicle. Tesla is on its way, and Apple is seriously building the capability to develop an autonomous-vehicle, though it's still not known whether it will actually do so. And not just Silicon Valley, but virtually every big carmaker is developing self-driving vehicles, too.
But not the world's two largest carmakers. In a stubborn snub to one of the biggest new technological manias, VW and Toyota both have long-term strategies in which their cars will only perform some functions by themselves, such as taking over in bumper-to-bumper traffic and parking your vehicle.
VW, the largest carmaker, believes that “the desire for freedom of individual mobility is here to stay,” Barclays said today in a brief note to clients. The note summarized remarks made at a Sept. 4 Barclays conference in London on driverless vehicles. “Driverless cars are not in VW's roadmap. Their strategy is to support the driver, not to replace him or her,” the bank said.
The No. 2 carmaker, Toyota, has hired the senior-most robotics export from the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Pentagon's radical innovation laboratory, and donated $50 million to Stanford and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to develop an intelligent car.
Still, while developing an eventual self-driving option, Toyota intends to keep the motorist at the center of its future vehicles. In an interview with the Financial Times, Toyota's Kiyotaka Ise said, “To us, it is like a train without an operator. We always want to keep drivers in the vehicle and in control.”
No one can say who will be right—Google, with its belief that the world will go driverless, or VW and Toyota, which are happy to let Google take the risk first, but for now gamble less by going only half-way.
The VW-Toyota strategy seems solid: It's true that, for occupations such as long-haul truck driving, allowing technology to steer the vehicle makes sense, especially from a safety perspective. But it's hard to believe that future drivers, even in cities, will ever agree to be ever and always mere passengers. Around the world, the sensation of controlling one's own way through the chaos—when every other driver on the road is an idiot, and danger lurks along every mile—is still seen as one of the purest remaining expressions of freedom.
THE US NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY (NSA) considered dropping its local mass surveillance practices before Edward Snowden made his revelations, but decided that it was not worth bothering the board with the question.
Hindsight is a wonderful thing. Us spectators can see why it might have a a good idea for the NSA to cancel that controversial programme back then, and perhaps the NSA can too.
It would still have been controversial, but it might have been far less controversial and the NSA might not quite be as damned as it is today.
What might be a bit confusing is why the NSA never mentioned this before, and did, as the Electronic Frontier Foundation reminds us, publicly and repeatedly, defend the system.
Despite stubborn public defense of the program, NSA considered ending phone records collection before Snowden leaks. https://t.co/PJh8kcwXpX — EFF (@EFF) March 30, 2015
The Huffington Post reports about the NSA cancelling blanket local surveillance, quoting sources who say that the idea was mooted at lower levels but did not make it quite as far as former director General Keith Alexander.
Associated Press sources claim that some sage bodies at the NSA felt that the incredible cost of dragnet snooping on innocent communications for the occasional mention of terror chat outweighed the benefits.
Officials were concerned that it cost too much money, was ineffective, unpopular and not a key tool in the fight against terrorism. Higher level officials, or presumably just more people, disagreed, and the system that we have come to know and be appalled by continued.
The timing of this is handy, as the US government will get a chance this year to rule on the work of the NSA and an opportunity to act on talk of change that came from President Obama last year.
Obama's proposals from early 2014 made it clear that changes should happen, that Edward Snowden existed, and that the NSA was not operating in quite the way that it should.
"The task before us now is simply bigger than repairing the damage done, or preventing more disclosures. We need to make some important decisions. The threat of terrorism and cyberattacks will continue," Obama said at the time.
"The combination of increased digital information and powerful computers gives intelligence agencies the chance to sift through bulk data that may include impending threats. But the government collection and storage of this data also gives a potential for abuse."
NSA critics were not impressed then, and nothing much has changed at the NSA in the intervening 14 months. µ

Unto the Kingdom of the East do I, Master Frasier MacLeod send the warmest greetings,
For the past 10 months we have been working on developing a rule set for 2 handed swords in rapier. I am pleased to announce that a rule set has been adopted at the Society level so we have the official go ahead to roll out our rules, along with a list of initial 2 hander authorized fencers/marshals who will be fully empowered to perform authorizations going forward. The rule set and marshal's list will be included below. Thank you all who contributed to this endeavor, and to all of you for your patience with us while we hammered these rules out.
In Service,
Master Frasier MacLeod, KRM, East
Rule Changes:
Add new Sec. III.C.1.a: Weapon types are defined by the following length criteria. Blades are measured from the tip to the top of the tang. Grip length is measured from the top of the tang to the end of the pommel. Weapons that fall outside of these dimensions may be allowed at the discretion of the Kingdom Rapier Marshal. In no case may the overall length of a weapon exceed 60″.
(i). A dagger shall have a blade of 18″ or less and a grip length of 10″ or less.
(ii). A rapier shall have a blade of 18″ to 48″ and a grip length of 10″ or less.
(iii). A two-handed sword shall have a blade of 30″ to 48″ and a grip length of at least 10″ but no greater than 1/3 the length of the blade.
Add new Sec. IV.A.1.g.: “Two Handed Swords — The form covers the use of a two handed sword with or without secondaries. A fencer who is so authorized may use a two handed sword with any secondary for which he or she has obtained a prior authorization described above.
Add new Sec. IV.C.6: Two handed sword- the candidate must be able to demonstrate safely and competently all elements listed under Single Rapier, above, as well as the following:
• ability to switch from two-handed to one handed grip when guarding and attacking, while maintaining appropriate calibration and control
• use of any form of secondary which the candidate reasonably expects to use in conjunction with two-handed sword

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. economy is on track to grow at a 3.1 percent annualized pace in the fourth quarter due to expected stronger consumer spending and equipment investments as well as a smaller trade gap, the Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDP Now forecast model showed on Friday.
The latest estimate on gross domestic product for the fourth quarter was higher than the 2.3 percent increase calculated on Tuesday, the Atlanta Fed said on its website.
The forecasts for fourth-quarter consumer spending growth and equipment investment growth increased from 2.1 percent to 2.6 percent and 2.7 percent to 5.9 percent, respectively, after vehicle sales data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis on Wednesday.
Total vehicles were sold at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 18.3 million units in October, compared with an 18.0 million annualized rate in September, according to the agency.
The forecast of the contribution of net exports to fourth-quarter GDP inched up from -0.01 percentage point to 0.05 percentage point after the government's report on international trade, the Atlanta Fed said.
The Commerce Department said on Friday the trade deficit narrowed 9.9 percent to $36.4 billion in September, the smallest since February 2015. August's trade gap was revised slightly less to $40.5 billion.
Before joining Viget I built websites on Drupal for Congressmen and Fortune 500 companies. Those websites were good, and they're visited by millions of people. I've been to Drupal Cons, I've been to Drupal meet-ups, and I've given presentations on Drupal topics. I wouldn't have a career as a developer without Drupal, but I wouldn't recommend Drupal.
“So if not Drupal, then what?”
It depends. Anyone who says they know the solution before they know the problem is lying, wrong, or guessing. At Viget, we can figure out what the best solution is to a problem. That solution may be a static website, a solution with Contentful, a Craft site, a custom-built CMS, or something we haven't thought of yet. It depends on the project.
We've written about this before. We have come up with reasons to go off-the-shelf or to go custom-built. We have compared off-the-shelf CMS's and we wrote The Viget Book of CMS.
After six years of working on Drupal, I decided to look at the alternatives. I haven't found a reason to use Drupal since.
“We need to talk about Drupal”
Drupal is not bad. You can find plenty of arguments out there about how terrible Drupal is — that's easy — but it's not true. Drupal isn't bad, Drupal is good. It's good enough to make a site and get your business going. Drupal modules can be easily installed. Drupal hosting companies will make it easy to get set up, and help you run updates.
I don't want to dismiss Drupal outright. Drupal can be a good tool, but I want better tools. I left Drupal behind to build better sites, using the best tools. I came to Viget because our standards are higher than any place I've ever worked. We want to deliver the ideal solution, and we obsess over quality. If Drupal is ever the best solution for your project we will tell you, because we will want to use it.
I believe Drupal sometimes gets picked by default, and I want to change that.
“Come for the software, stay for the community”
Drupal's unofficial tag line is “Come for the software, stay for the community.” Maybe you've heard this at a meet-up, at DrupalCon, or at one of the many Drupal camps, and it's true. They are a kind, funny, inclusive, and determined bunch. This isn't exclusive to the Drupal community though, and we should see “the community” for what it is: marketing. A kind, funny, inclusive, and determined community will attract tons of people of all skill levels. There are great developers who contribute to Drupal, but there are many more site builders who do not contribute any code. A large community, even a nice one, doesn't equate a highly-skilled one.
Like any community, you will find differing opinions on “best practices.” Saying you follow Drupal “best practices” is akin to saying you have the Best Burger in DC (or anywhere for that matter). Knowing Drupal, and knowing how other agencies use Drupal, are two different things.
I've taken over Drupal websites built by other agencies before, and I rarely encountered what I considered “best practices.” Sure, it was Drupal, but I couldn't jump right in. I had to research every module that had been chosen and wonder why it was chosen over what I would have recommended. I had to dig through custom module code. Sometimes it was well written code, and sometimes not. Taking over these sites wasn't seamless.
Recently I've taken over some Craft projects. Even without any prior Craft experience I was able to get up and running far quicker than on Drupal projects. I didn't need to be part of a Craft community to become productive in a Craft project, I just had to read their documentation, and since the system is more intuitive everything was easier.
“Look at all these modules, so many modules!”
Drupal's functionality can be extended through modules, simple add-ons that the Drupal community has built for everything from better commenting to integrations with third party tools like Salesforce. It's worth noting that Drupal didn't invent modules, nor is it the only platform that has a concept like modules. Every CMS and most programming languages have something similar to modules.
Modules are touted as time saving, and they can be. If you are willing to settle for what the module does and nothing more, then they are time savers. However, the architecture of some modules make them hard to extend or modify. These modifications introduce possible problems to the update flow. The promise of modules is oversold. In practice, every module introduces a point of failure while running updates. This isn't a Drupal thing, it's a software thing. Drupal doesn't solve this problem in any clever way.
Modules and the modular architecture of Drupal are good. They've made serious improvements to the way modules get added in Drupal 8. However, Drupal is an open source project with modules being developed by individuals with limited time. This means that sometimes the module you need may not be ready for primetime, may not be well maintained, or may not exist at all.
“Drupal ain't easy”
Drupal is filled with drupalisms, the quirks of the system that don't translate to other platforms. Every language or system has its quirks but Drupal is defined by them. The big tent of Drupal developers have internalized these quirks, but the much bigger tent of web developers is usually baffled by them. This means that choosing Drupal ultimately limits the pool of talent you can pick from. Good Drupal developers will be able to pick up any web project that use similar technologies, but the reverse isn't necessarily true. Drupal is not particularly approachable for developers. That's why every aspiring Drupal developer is shown this:

The world, and the countless lives that he touched, will be lessened because Brian McCray is no longer with us. I am trying to come to grips with the fact that I will never again see that aw-shucks grin, those piercing eyes, or hear his nasally voice cutting right through the BS to get right to the point of the matter.—Matt Childers
The late Brian McCray on the first ascent of Isaac's Stigmata (VI 5.11R A4+), Zion, "a stunning overhanging headwall split with a climber's dream," as his partner Kurt Arend described it in the 2001 American Alpine Journal. Near the summit, "Fly'n Brian led horror-show pitch after horror-show pitch of loose white slabby 5.9-5.10+ R/X, all in his Tennies," Arend wrote. "After every last ounce of energy in our reserves was used, long after the water ran out, and long after the sun went down, we still had one more pitch. We knew we were on the verge of an epic, so we held our heads high and started rapping. The summit of Isaac still haunts us to this day." [Photo] Kurt Arend collection
Monday morning in the office I saw that Kurt "Burt" Arend had photos of my hero Brian McCray, 45, nearly 46, on his Facebook wall. He had written something about "losing a close friend," and "the dark art of climbing," but there was no name attached to the post. Then Brian's ex-wife Roxanna Brock McDade posted pictures of Brian.

I called Matt Childers, a friend of Brian's since the mid 1990s, who confirmed his August 23 passing. It was a suicide. This was the first conversation of many more I would have in the next couple of days that revealed a clear outline of Brian and his legacy. He was a climber's climber, but a better friend and mentor. For Matt, it was the opportunity to climb with Brian in Yosemite that left such an indelible impression. In 1999 they went for a ground-up attempt of Freerider on El Capitan for what would be the third or fourth ascent. They nearly pulled it off and missed to send by two hangs on the entire route.
"Neither one of us really cared that we didn't officially send the route," explained Matt. "We had such a blast up there goofing around and trying hard that we never even considered going back for it. It was the experience rather than the redpoint that we were interested in. He was the best climber that I have ever roped up with."

Brian trained hard and dedicated himself to completing the most difficult routes he could imagine. For him that led to ascents of both short and muscular sport climbs and intricate and committing aid routes. From May 3-21, 1999, he made a giant first ascent over two weeks with Jim Bridwell, Terry Christensen, Glenn Dunmire and Brian Jonas on the Bears Tooth, Ruth Glacier, called The Useless Emotion (VII 5.9 WI4 A4, 4,700'). It was Brian's first alpine climb, yet he led more than half of the route's 39 pitches.
I first met Brian, his then-wife Roxanna and their schnauzer dog in front of the mountain shop in Vegas in April or May of 1997. We chatted it up in the parking lot. He was a wall climber. I climbed walls, and I could tell that he definitely outranked me as a climber. But he was open and approachable. I learned that Brian left his mark in the New River Gorge by establishing the first 5.14 in the Proper Soul area. We kept meeting up at big climbing areas, and it turned out we had very similar close friends.
Roxanna, who went through a divorce with Brian in the late 1990s, said, "He got the same life breath from climbing that I did and wanted to spend every minute doing it—we were hooked.... Brian was childlike, always hypersensitive with a deep understanding of people and subtleties. He was always psyched for people who loved climbing, like he would lift them up, teaching them all he knew. Compulsively he pursued new adventures, pushing the limits in sport, trad and big-wall climbing; first ascents were his real love. [I'm] grateful to have gotten to tie in with him, learn from him, have long conversations about things climbing and not. Though it makes me very sad, I am glad Brian can finally rest."
Brian's one and only day climbing with "Wild Man" Warren Hollinger ended in an emergency rescue in February '99 while they were establishing an A5 route on the Grade VI Rainbow Wall in Red Rocks. It was a route Brian had been working on for several weeks when he recruited Warren. During one lead, Warren took a giant fall into a ledge and broke his back in the process.

"I owe him my life, no doubt about it," Warren said over the phone at 7 a.m. from his home in Hawaii.
Warren recounted the scene of the accident. "It was at a 5.10 section that was less than vertical. An edge that broke. Just a small, half-pad edge. And the piece I was holding onto just blew. I went for 60 feet. I knew my back was broken, but he was able to pull me up to a ledge a little over half a foot wide until I got my feet splayed on it. Then he came over to me via a rope solo. Then Brian called for a rescue. "I stood there pasted up against the wall for six hours," said Warren. "He was integral in my last day of climbing.... Without him I would have a higher probability of being paralyzed."
Brian later returned to the route, solo, and finished it. He called it Sauron's Eye.
"Brian was very fun loving," Warren told me. "He enjoyed every aspect of climbing. At the end of the day, he wanted to be on the sharp end, channeling that drive on a hard pitch. He was at a constant state of going that hard. It can burn you out. Even though we only had one intimate day together, we'll be bonded for life."

The second time I ran into Brian was around a Curry Village tent in Yosemite Valley. He was smoking unfiltered Camels and getting ready to head up Freerider with Matt. Then I saw him at the base of Surgeon General, an A5 route on the far east face of El Cap. He showed me the big gash on his arm from falling on the route, and told me how the rope burned over his arm until he threw his arms up in the air allowing the Gri Gri to engage properly. He received a five-inch-long, third-degree burn during that 60-foot fall.
Now, I think back to what Matt told me on the phone from West Virginia. "It takes a certain person who's willing to push the boat out that far for that long. It takes a certain wiring for someone to do that."
Around the time I saw Brian below Surgeon General, he and Ammon McNeely were setting speed records on some of Zion's and El Cap's hardest aid routes and putting up first ascents all over the Southwest: South of Heaven (VI 5.8 A4+) and Stigmata (VI 5.11R A4+) in Zion; Sauron's Eye (VI 5/10+R A4) in Red Rock.
"We [also] did the first one-day ascent of Latitudes," on the Streaked Wall in Zion, Ammon said over the phone from his home in Ogden, Utah. As they climbed the route they spied a first ascent and talked loosely about returning together to climb it.
"I called Brian, and we started talking about the route, and he let me go on and on about doing the first ascent with him before telling me he was already halfway up the wall solo," he said with a hint of laughter in his voice. "Brian called it Lord Helmet because you go through this Darth Vader feature. He thought that would be a funny name."

Ammon continued, "He was always fighting demons. He was so strong mentally and physically I didn't think he'd go out like that. I can't understand it. Never will.... Just sad, man. We lost a good one."
I visited Brian in Vegas awhile ago. His living room had piles of climbing shoes waiting to be resoled. He ran a business called Fly'n Brian's Resoles that was around for many years. He had a steep climbing wall in his backyard. He was working as a mineral miner at the time, a trade he picked up from Jimmie Dunn.
I reached out to a lot of friends of Brian to know more and to share stories.
Mike Lewis, a climbing guide and long-term partner and friend, posted this about him on Facebook:
"Brian and I put up Dogma in Red Rocks, the Oasis in Red Rocks (with Roxanna Brock McDade), routes at Potosi, Buena Vista, and the New River Gorge, and we freed the Rainbow Wall and Brown Recluse in a day. Brian belayed me on my first 5.14 and was a huge mental and emotional support."
I called Mike up from home. He talked from the bouldering wall at a gym in Boulder as I typed: "[Brian] put his efforts into the resoling business. Then he got into rigging. He is bouldered V10, climbed 5.14, did the hardest big walls out there and did crazy big-wall routes on expeditions. He was at the top level of every type of climbing out there. [But he] had a number of stressers and didn't always see the way out of it all. He was my best friend for a while. I told him to his face many times that he was my strongest mentor.
"[After] Dogma we did 15 rappels in 30 minutes to get off of it. We were simul-rapping with Gri Gris. I was trying every time to get my Gri Gri setup before his. He showed no effort in his face and body, but he was ahead of me every time and I was trying really hard. He was always able to keep it cool."
My last thoughts of Brian are from that conversation in El Cap Meadow standing by the road, his wild blonde hair sticking out in every direction. He was attempting to solo Nightmare on California Street, one of Warren Hollinger and Grant Gardner's last great climbs. He talked about the stresses of life in Vegas but was quick to let his worries of the real world rest and focus instead on the intricacies of pasting micro heads in a fractured feature, solo, on El Cap—where he was in his element.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron agreed on Saturday to work together to push the US to reconsider its recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Reuters reported.
Quoting a Turkish presidential source, the news agency said the two leaders discussed the issue during a phone call Saturday, agreeing the move was a cause of concern in the region.
Macron called the US move “regrettable” shortly after President Donald Trump's announcement on Wednesday. Erdoğan, who has threatened to cut ties with Israel, has been bitterly opposed to Trump's decision and has called a summit of Islamic countries on December 13 in Istanbul.

Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was heading to Paris and Brussels late Saturday, and is set to meet Macron. Hundreds of pro-Palestinian demonstrators rallied in Paris on Saturday night.
On Saturday, Erdoğan stepped up his criticism, describing Israel as a “state of occupation” which used “terror” against the Palestinians.
“Israel is a state of occupation,” Erdoğan said in a speech in Istanbul. “And now they are making use of terror and are bombing young people and children,” he said.
Israeli air strikes in response to rocket fire from the Gaza Strip killed two gunmen from the Hamas terror group before dawn.
Several rockets were fired at Israel from Hamas-run Gaza on Thursday and Friday, one of them landing in Sderot and another being intercepted by the Iron Dome missile defense system. Hamas, which seeks to destroy Israel, has called for a new intifada against Israel to liberate Jerusalem, and urged Palestinians to confront soldiers and settlers.
Erdoğan, who regards himself as a champion of the Palestinians and an opponent of any perceived global injustice against Muslims, described Jerusalem as the “apple of our eye” and a “red line” for Muslims.
He said that the American decision was “null and void” for Ankara. “Trump seeks to move forwards by saying ‘there we go, I did it, it's done!' I'm sorry but… being strong does not give you such a right.”
“The leaders of major countries have a mission to make peace. Not unleash conflicts.
In Istanbul on Saturday, protesters rallied holding Turkish and Palestinian flags, and chanted anti-US slogans.
In his Wednesday address from the White House, Trump defied worldwide warnings and insisted that after repeated failures to achieve peace a new approach was long overdue, describing his decision to recognize Jerusalem as the seat of Israel's government as merely based on reality.
The move was hailed by Netanyahu and by leaders across much of the Israeli political spectrum. Trump stressed that he was not specifying the boundaries of Israeli sovereignty in the city, and called for no change in the status quo at the city's holy sites.
Erdoğan on Saturday continued to play a central role in diplomatic efforts in the crisis, telephoning both Macron and Lebanese President Michel Aoun, the presidency said.
Last year, Turkey and Israel ended a rift triggered by the 2010 Mavi Marmara flotilla, in which nine Turkish activists were killed after attacking Israeli commandos who boarded their ship, which was trying to break Israel's naval blockade of Gaza.
The two sides have since stepped up cooperation, particularly in energy, but Erdoğan has repeatedly been bitterly critical of Israeli policy.
Last week he warned that Turkey's reaction “could go as far as” cutting relations with Israel, but he made no reference to this in his latest speech.

I spoke some free verse to a friend of mine.
She said, "What's that?" I said, "That? That's free verse."
"I bet it is," she said. "I've heard that line
before. You want to get inside my purse."
"No, honestly," I said, "the verse was free.
It didn't rhyme and neither did it scan."
"So what's the catch?" she asked. "And what's the fee?"
"Trust me," I said, "I'm not that sort of man."
"Oh yeah?" she said. I said, "Look let's forget it."
"Listen," she said, "I'm not born yesterday.
You want something. But you're not going to get it.
I see the sneaky game you're trying to play.
I know my rights. Nothing in life's for free."
So I gave in. And charged her 50p.

Manuel Pellegrini has started the mind games early for next season by accusing his Chelsea rival José Mourinho of taking the credit “for everything”.
In an interview with the Chilean newspaper El Mercurio he said: “When he wins, Mourinho wants to take credit for everything. I never do that.
“When I won the Premier League, I didn't say a word. I don't have any problem with Mourinho, he's not my enemy and there isn't any conflict – but I differ from him on all fronts. I have no interest in analysing him as a person.”
Chelsea's Victor Moses reluctant to act as makeweight for Stoke's Asmir Begovic Read more
The pair's rivalry dates from their time in Spain when Mourinho replaced the Chilean as coach of Real Madrid in 2010.
Since then they have become managers of England's leading teams, Pellegrini winning the title with Manchester City in 2014 and Chelsea taking their place at the top this year.
They renewed their war of words at the beginning of last season when the sides drew 1-1 at the Etihad Stadium in September. Pablo Zabaleta was sent off and Pellegrini accused Chelsea of being a “small team” who played like Stoke.
“It was very similar to the Stoke team, with a big team playing against a small team with very good players, trying to defend, trying to keep the score [0-0]. They had nine players in front of their box. They came just to draw and they scored on the counterattack against 10 players,” he said.
Mourinho responded by referring to him as “Pellegrino” and said: “I don't comment on his words. Don't ask me about his words, I am not interested in that.”
The sides meet again on 15 August at the Etihad in the second match of the new season.
Though I agree with much of what Ben says about James Comey's statement, I find myself in greater agreement with David French's account. As French concludes, “there are some elements that are good for President Trump, but overall it shows a chief executive placing improper pressure on the FBI director — pressure that no GOP politician would tolerate from a Democratic president.” I write to add two points.
First, I disagree with Ben about whether the Comey statement vindicates Trump's claim, in his letter firing Comey, that Comey “on three separate occasions” informed the President that he was “not under investigation.” Contrary to Ben, that seems to me like a fair reading of what Comey says he told Trump.
Comey says that he told the President—the first time without the President raising the topic—that the FBI was not investigating him. Comey makes clear that the first time he said this, he meant that the FBI did not “have an open counter-intelligence case on” Trump. But he does not say that he explained to Trump that his “assurance” was so limited. Moreover, Comey later says that in connection with his confirmation to Congress about “the investigation into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign,” he told the President that he (Comey) “told ... Congressional leaders that we were not personally investigating President Trump.” He also “reminded” President Trump that he had previously told him this.
Ben says the Comey statement “emphatically does not amount to Trump's blanket statement that he was assured multiple times that he was not under investigation.” He reasons:
Trump might have been on solid ground in his letter firing Comey had he written that “I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that none of the investigations involving my campaign, my subordinates, or my companies at the present time involves an open counterintelligence case directed at me personally.” Somehow, however, that lacks the self-exculpating ring the President seems to have been going for.
This seems nit-picky to the point of wrong, at least based on the Comey statement. Regardless of what Comey intended, we don't have any reason to think that Comey distinguished in his comments to Trump between a counter-intelligence investigation and some other type of investigation. And Comey himself said that he told the President that he was not under investigation concerning “possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign.” It is easy to see how the President might interpret that statement as meaning that he was not under investigation in connection with the Russia matter, period. Maybe Comey was hiding the ball from the President in his conversations, and there is an investigation of the President other than a counter-intelligence one related to Russia. Comey does say at one point: “I did not tell the President that the FBI and the Department of Justice had been reluctant to make public statements that we did not have an open case on President Trump for a number of reasons, most importantly because it would create a duty to correct, should that change.” Comey was at least contemplating the possibility that Trump's investigation status might change. But the premise of that contemplation was that “we did not have an open case on President Trump.”
Second, consider one of French's best points about what the Comey statement reveals:
Overall, one gets the impression that the president views himself less than the president of a constitutional republic and more as the dictatorial CEO of a private company. This is understandable, given his long experience in the private sector, but it's unsustainable. President Trump has to better understand not just the separation of powers but also the constitutional and legal obligations of governance, or the turmoil surrounding Comey's termination will be but the first of a series of controversies that could well shake his presidency to its foundation.
This analysis echoes points that Bob Bauer has made on this site. And it is right. Trump does not remotely understand his role, status, and duties as President and Chief Executive, and this failure infects or undermines just about everything he does. It is an amazing state of affairs: A President of the United States who does not at all grasp the Office he occupies, and who thus entirely lacks the proper situation sense, or contextual knowledge, in which a President should exercise judgment or act. Let that sink in, and then imagine all of the decisions a President must make, all that he is responsible for. This reflection is the main reason why I have come to believe that the President does not deserve a presumption of regularity in his actions—not just by courts with respect to the immigration executive orders, but by the public more generally with respect to “everything the Executive does that touches, however lightly, the President.”

I want to thank Father Walsh for his spiritual help. I want to thank Bob Ray (Sanders) and Steve Blow for their friendship. What I want people to know is that they call me a cold-blooded killer when I shot a man that shot me first. The only thing that convicted me was that I am a Mexican and that he was a police officer. People hollered for my life, and they are to have my life tonight. The people never hollered for the life of the policeman that killed a thirteen-year-old boy who was handcuffed in the back seat of a police car. The people never hollered for the life of a Houston police officer who beat up and drowned Jose Campo Torres and threw his body in the river. You call that equal justice. This is your equal justice. This is America's equal justice. A Mexican's life is worth nothing. When a policeman kills someone he gets a suspended sentence or probation. When a Mexican kills a police officer this is what you get. From there you call me a cold-blooded murderer. I didn't tie anyone to a stretcher. I didn't pump any poison into anybody's veins from behind a locked door. You call this justice. I call this and your society a bunch of cold-blooded murderers. I don't say this with any bitterness or anger. I just say this with truthfulness. I hope God forgives me for all my sins. I hope that God will be as merciful to society as he has been to me. I'm ready, Warden.

If there has been a common refrain for 2017, it was "Fuck this year." Which, to be fair, was also the common refrain for last year—and for many before it, too. But what set 2017 apart from past disaster years was the cadence. On some scale, every year brings political losses, environmental disaster, mass violence, economic precarity, and, yes, beloved celebrity death. But no year in my life has offered up fresh crisis with such speed and regularity.
Scandals that would once dominate an entire week's news cycle were barely fodder for an afternoon. Terrible natural disasters were immediately followed by different terrible natural disasters. We woke up to—or stayed up watching—social media feeds and news reports about violence, sometimes political, sometimes personal, sometimes seemingly random.
It was exhausting, and with so much to worry about, the organic downtime that we normally find to recharge our batteries was also put under threat. In 2017, it was harder than ever to work up the strength to confront problems directly.

Somehow, though, the world of gaming was determined to maintain its own whirlwind pace in 2017. By the end of February, we were even complaining (as is our wont) that there were too many games worth playing. To be fair, by the end of February, we'd already played (or were in the middle of playing) Gravity Rush 2, Let It Die, Resident Evil 7, Horizon Zero Dawn, Nioh, Fire Emblem Heroes, Night in the Woods, Yakuza 0, Super Mario Run, and two different Telltale series. I was even a few hours into Breath of the Wild.
As the year went on, events in the world only got more frustrating and the games continued to impress.
It was hard to keep up, and the deluge of great games has led to a lot of chatter this year about the crowding of platforms, the increase in microtransactions, the possibility of (yet another?) "indie apocalypse," and the seemingly inescapable gravity of the marketplace. Game developers, of course, didn't pause and wait for us to have these debates. They just kept shipping incredible games.
As the year went on, events in the world only got more frustrating and the games continued to impress. And as good as the games were, the dissonance was hard to swallow.
On the day Trump's first immigration ban order was announced, Patrick and I were busy writing about class struggle in Gravity Rush 2. On the weekend that Heather Heyer was killed by a white supremacist in Charlottesville, I was trying to figure out what I thought about Agents of Mayhem. Sometimes, the discrepancy was too great for us: In the wake of the country's worst mass shooting this past October, we stepped away from streaming PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds.
In 2017, games needed to be more than distractions. They had heavy lifting to do.
But games were also the way we got through the hardest weeks. In March I wrote that "Breath of the Wild Is the Zelda Adventure I Always Wanted," but it was also the game I needed to make it through the year. Collecting korok seeds and solving shrine puzzles could not be more trivial an activity, but when I needed something to lift me out of the deepest slumps, or something to pull me away from Twitter and into bed at 3AM, there they were.
By March, I was trying to work through how those two things fit together, causing me to write a little about the intersection of video games and self-care. It wasn't the first time, either. Back in my 2014 (2014!) Game of the Year list for Giant Bomb, I wrote about the tension between needing to recover during hard times and needing to remain engaged:
This year we've been forced to face hard truths about our community and our country, and this has put the need for self-care and the need for social improvement in conflict over and over, again and again. Do you spend the night engaging with the rando on Twitter who seems to be coming from an honest place, or do you take the night off and just watch some shit? Do you correct your racist uncle at the holiday dinner, or just roll your eyes and rub your temples? Do you put on your heavy coat and walk down to the protest, or just hit RT from the comfort of your bed?
My takeaway then was that it was a hard line to walk, but it was one we had to do, and one that games could help us with. In 2017, I understand that better than I ever could've then.
In the lead up to our big end of year coverage, I honestly wasn't sure what we were going to do. Last year, we concocted Waypoint High, an alternate universe where our favorite characters of 2016 were awarded Senior Superlatives, danced together at the prom, and snuck out of class to get high in the tennis courts. It was fun. 2017 was not fun. And, frankly, it just didn't feel right. In 2017, games needed to be more than distractions. They had heavy lifting to do.
So, when Waypoint's managing editor, Danielle Riendeau, suggested that we should build a pantheon to play off of the "godly" year of games, everything clicked into place.
Whether about Athena, Agni, Anansi, or Amaterasu, myths did work for the people and the cultures who told their stories. As Paul Veyne argues in Did the Greeks Believe in Their Myths?, these stories were not "simply" held as fact, but used as tools for thinking through daily problems, civic responsibilities, and the most philosophical of inquiries. For cultures around the world, the stories of gods and goddesses allowed humans to conceptualize justice, demonstrate the folly of arrogance, and make sense of unexplained phenomenon. And, you know, they also made for great entertainment.

I leaned on games in 2017. When all I could do was think about death, What Remains of Edith Finch offered to think along with me. When I felt burnt out from political action, Wolfenstein: The New Colossus demanded I consider the costs of selfish inaction. When, on my lowest nights, I wondered if there was any chance that humanity could bridge its differences, Nier: Automata gave me tools to both wallow and hope, in turn.
So, for the next five days, Waypoint will be constructing its own loose mythology of gods and goddesses, avatars and heroines, twisting labyrinths and dark passageways to the underworld. We'll be running articles about our favorite games, writing about some of the year's most memorable characters, and analyzing major industry trends. And yes, we are of course bringing back fanfiction again this year—how could we not ask some of our favorite writers to add their own myths to the collection?
Oh, and, because want to entertain you ourselves, too, each day will bring its own podcast and pre-recorded livestream, too. For the streams, just follow us over on Twitch, and for the podcasts, subscribe on iTunes, Google Play, Stitcher (or add this RSS link to whatever platform you'd like.)
It's all bound to be a lot of fun, a little contradictory, and hopefully pretty thoughtful, too. Just like the myths that inspired us.
To keep up with everything we do this week, just click right here, and to chat about the day's awards, essays, podcasts, and videos, head over to our forums.
Here's to the end of 2017, may it rot in hell.

Tesla has been betting big on batteries for a while now, but the stakes got higher when South Australia made Tesla a new battery bet that it couldn't pass up. Can Tesla build the world's biggest lithium-ion battery to combat the feast or famine windstorms and set a new precedent for renewable energy? Elon Musk says yes. He just needs 100 days to get the massive battery fully operational. If he pulls this off, he'll have pushed energy security into a whole new realm.
“This system will be three times more powerful than any system on earth,” said Musk. “This is not a minor foray into the frontier. This is going three times further than anyone has gone before.”
To pull off a project of this scale, Tesla is partnering with Neoen, a French renewable energy provider, as well as the South Australian government. Neoen owns the Hornsdale wind farm that the battery will be hooked up to, where there are about 99 wind turbines. Hornsdale generates about 1,050,000 megawatt hours of renewable electricity to the national power grid each year, but it's still spotty. Sometimes there's no wind. Sometimes there's too much wind, like in September of last year when the whole state lost power after a gnarly storm. To capture the energy, Tesla is going to design a 100MW/129MWh battery that can power 50,000 homes and keep the lights on even when the wind itself isn't cooperating.
It's a big splashy project that is in line with smaller-scale concepts Tesla already had in the works. On the other side of the world from South Australia, he's been building something known as the Gigfactory in aptly-named Sparks, Nevada. It's supposed to be the biggest battery factory in the world, and if he can ramp up the quality, size, and production scale of lithium-ion batteries the way he hopes to, it could have big implications for not only massive solar and wind farms like Hornsdale, but for residential and business sized renewables, too. It would be a lot easier to convince, say, your local grocery warehouse to run its freezer section off a solar roof if they didn't have to worry about a rainy week causing all their fish sticks and ice cream sandwiches to melt.
There's just one catch to Tesla's bet with Australia. Once the battery is hooked up to the Neoen grid, he has 100 days to make sure the thing works correctly. If it doesn't, Tesla is going to have to eat the cost, which could be at least $13 million dollars. Regardless of the outcome, however, Musk's ambition is pushing the envelope in a big way. Whether or not Tesla delivers, it's a learning experience that will drive renewables forward. But here's to hoping he doesn't have to pay a losing bet and can spend the money on some other new discovery instead.

Story highlights It will take at least a week to analyze results from the latest scans, officials say
An international conference is scheduled for May 8 to discuss results
(CNN) King Tut's tomb isn't giving up its secrets that easily.
Egypt's new antiquities minister said Friday that a third round of radar scans seeking hidden chambers in the famous chamber offered hints, but no obvious home runs, in the search for what could be Queen Nefertiti's tomb.

"We have a lot of information. So at this moment, 10 hours after finishing work, we can't say 100% whether there is something or not," Antiquities Minister Khaled El-Anany said after the scans were complete.
It will take at least a week to review the extensive data collected by two types of radar scanners, he said.
The team needs time to remove signal interference and anomalies in the data, said Mohamed Abbas, the head of the Egyptian team involved in the research.

A new draft of legislation to rescue Puerto Rico from the jaws of a debt crisis was released by the House Committee on Natural Resources on Tuesday evening, as the territory's governor warned that his government did not have enough money to pay for fuel for school buses or police patrol cars, or for therapists for schoolchildren with special needs.
The revised bill includes a provision for a vote by two-thirds of creditors on any particular debt restructuring proposal — a major change that was designed as a concession to conservative Republicans and would give Puerto Rico's creditors leverage to insist on voluntary settlements.
The threshold is low enough to give a newly created oversight board the power to impose restructuring deals on reluctant creditors, but if it is high enough to potentially bog down restructuring talks.
If the oversight board fails to get the support of two-thirds of creditors, it can turn to a judicial procedure to enforce a settlement.
Rep. Rob Bishop (R-Utah), the committee's chairman, said in a news release that the bill offers “tools to redirect Puerto Rico from a path of destitution towards a path of prosperity.”
“This is the constitutionally-sound solution that will provide real, long-lasting reform to the Commonwealth while respecting the rights of all parties and creditors,” he said. “It is the island's best shot to mitigate its financial collapse and future calls for a bailout, which would be untenable.”
House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) endorsed the bill shortly after its release Tuesday, saying it “protects American taxpayers from bailing out Puerto Rico.” But it was not clear in the hours after the bill's release whether it would ultimately win the endorsement of the Republican Study Committee (RSC), the influential group of House conservatives that includes most GOP members.
The group's chairman, Rep. Bill Flores (R-Tex.), said in an interview Tuesday that he had not reviewed the final text of the latest draft but said there appeared to be improvements. “In a perfect world, I'd like to see there can't be an involuntary cram-down,” he said. “But if we can find a way where there's a good likelihood of having a consensual restructuring, maybe I can find happiness on this.”
The RSC balked at the previous version of the legislation, casting doubt on whether any Puerto Rico bill could garner the support of a majority of House Republicans — a key threshold for Ryan, who has vowed to abide by the wishes of his party conference. Outside activist groups, notably Heritage Action for America, also have pressured Republicans to reject strong restructuring provisions and require more sweeping economic reforms.
But the bill probably will need Democratic support to pass, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) and other key Democrats have been engaged with the bill's Republican drafters to address concerns about the powers of the control board created under the legislation.
Those changes included increasing the size of the control board, and changing its political composition and limiting its non-fiscal powers — modifications made, in the words of a Republican committee summary, “to address concerns that it was too colonialist.”
Gov. Alejandro Javier García Padilla, in Washington with a broad delegation of legislators and business people from Puerto Rico, stressed the need for haste. He said that “we are in a humanitarian crisis” and that about 10,000 children have not been able to attend school because of a lack of fuel for buses.
García Padilla said that Puerto Rico's government owes close to $2 billion to private suppliers of goods and services and that the arrears will climb to $2.2 billion by June 30, when the territory expects to default on its general obligation bonds, considered the safest type of bonds for investors.
The governor called the new version “a step in the right direction.” Earlier, he sharply criticized the first draft of legislation to help Puerto Rico restructure its crushing debt of about $72 billion; that draft created a five-person appointed board to root out waste and corruption, set the island's budget on a sustainable track and restructure the territory's debts.
García Padilla said that the board's structure would be “turning Puerto Rico back to 1900 . . . after the invasion and Spanish American war.” He said “it will make no sense” because it would create a financial control board with the power to impose taxes, fire people from jobs and curtail services without regard to democratically elected officials in Puerto Rico.
But he said the new version of the legislation “incorporates some of our comments with respect to a more balanced calibration of the Board's powers.”
Some of the investors in Puerto Rican bonds oppose the creation of any bankruptcy-like procedure that could impose a final settlement on a minority of holdout creditors.
A group called the Center for Individual Freedom has spent about $200,000 on television ads in the Washington market, according to the Sunlight Foundation. The ads urge people to “tell Congress” to “stop the Washington bailout of Puerto Rico” — even though the House draft of legislation does not provide any money for Puerto Rico. The Alexandria, Va.-based 501(c)(4) group says on its website that its “mission [is] to protect and defend individual freedoms and individual rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.”
On Monday, Puerto Rico's government sweetened a January offer to pay creditors, offering to boost its debt-service payments to $1.85 billion a year, up from $1.7 billion a year in the earlier offer. Those payments would equal about 15 percent of projected government revenue in 2021, a level higher than in virtually all mainland U.S. states.
The government also said that an earlier proposal for a “growth bond” that would depend on a certain level of economic growth in Puerto Rico would be replaced with a “capital appreciation bond” that would require payments regardless of economic growth.
But investors would still end up taking deep reductions in the overall payments they are owed.
Last week, Puerto Rico declared a debt moratorium, allowing the governor to temporarily halt debt payments by government and public corporations or impose a stay on bondholder litigation. The moratorium would block a $422 million debt-service payment by the Government Development Bank on May 1, forcing a default.
The credit rating agency Moody's said in a statement Tuesday that the moratorium “signals the culmination of the US territory's liquidity crisis and the complexity of negotiating restructuring agreements with holders of the Commonwealth's debt.”
Correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the job title of an agency official. Jeanne Ireland is the assistant commissioner for legislation, not litigation. This version has been updated.
Congressional investigators said Monday that the chief counsel's office at the Food and Drug Administration authorized wide-ranging surveillance of a group of the agency's scientists, the first indication that the effort was sanctioned at the highest levels.
In a letter to the FDA, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) said that his staff had learned that the spying was “explicitly authorized, in writing” by the agency's top legal office.
“The FDA's actions represent serious impediments to the right of agency employees to make protected disclosures about waste, fraud, abuse, mismanagement, or public safety,” wrote Grassley, who demanded that the agency release a copy of the memo authorizing the surveillance and the name of the FDA official who requested it.
FDA spokeswoman Erica Jefferson said that the agency is looking into the matter. She said that the surveillance was limited in scope and reiterated that it was relegated to government computers. “We did not impede or interfere with any employee communication to Congress, their staff, media or federal investigators,” she said.
The disclosure marked the latest turn in an investigation of the FDA's past efforts to monitor the communications of a group of its doctors who were expressing concerns about the safety of medical devices. As part of the effort, the FDA secretly collected thousands of private e-mails that the employees sent to one another, members of Congress, journalists, lawyers and others.
The FDA acknowledged Friday that targeted surveillance of five employees began in mid-2010, but it said that was not ongoing today, according to a letter sent to Grassley by Jeanne Ireland, the agency's assistant commissioner for legislation. The FDA said Monday that the computer surveillance was limited to five employees. But an internal document shows that the agency targeted at least seven employees beginning in 2010.
The targeting of the employees' communications, including e-mail and other online activities, was reported by The Washington Post in January. The agency monitored personal e-mail accounts accessed from government computers, took electronic snapshots of computer desktops and reviewed documents saved on hard drives.
The New York Times reported over the weekend that the scope of the surveillance was wider than first suspected, with the agency creating a database of 80,000 pages of computer documents collected from the scientists' communications.
The database, apparently posted inadvertently online by an FDA contractor, included an FDA “scoping” document of targets for future e-mail interception that included congressional staff members. Also captured were draft complaints being prepared by the scientists to the Office of Special Counsel, an independent federal agency that investigates disclosures of government wrongdoing and retaliation against those who report it.
The OSC is investigating the FDA's monitoring of its employees.
In June, OSC special counsel Carolyn Lerner warned federal agencies that monitoring their employees' personal e-mail violated the law if the intent was to retaliate against whistleblowers. The White House distributed her warning to agencies across the government, an acknowledgment by the Obama administration that there are limits to employee surveillance.
Two years ago, the FDA's parent agency, the Department of Health and Human Services, reminded it that employees have a right to air their concerns to Congress and journalists. The reminder accompanied a rejection by the HHS inspector general of the FDA's request that it pursue a criminal investigation of the scientists' activities.
Grassley, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has been seeking answers from the FDA since January on the extent of the surveillance and who authorized it. On Friday, he accused the agency of “stonewalling” him after officials there responded to his inquiries by saying in a letter they are “still identifying and gathering evidence” in the matter.
“It is simply not credible that FDA went to such great lengths over the course of two years to monitor employees' personal e-mail accounts, then spent six months crafting a reply to my questions about it, and yet still cannot identify who authorized the spying,” he said.
FDA computers post a warning to users, visible when they log on, that they should have “no reasonable expectation of privacy” in any data passing through or stored on the system, and that the government may intercept any such data at any time for any lawful government purpose.
Internal documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the scientists, some of whom have been fired, show that the FDA was concerned that they had improperly disclosed con­fidential business information about several medical devices used to screen patients for colon cancer and breast cancer.
According to documents, the agency used software sold by SpectorSoft of Vero Beach, Fla., which is marketed to employers as a way to monitor “everything [employees] do,” including taking snapshot videos of the user's computer screen, and sending instant alerts based on specific keywords, program activity and printing. SpectorSoft says that it can create reports on how users are communicating with one another, who is leaking confidential information or trade secrets, and who is transferring data to removable media such as USB drives.
The scientists who were targeted in the FDA's effort have filed suit against the agency for violating their privacy and right to free speech.
“Given the public health and safety nature of the concerns raised by these doctors and scientists, any authorization by the chief counsel would be startling, disturbing and should result in a swift investigation,” said Stephen M. Kohn, an attorney for the scientists.
The extent of similar surveillance by other government agencies is unclear.
The Federal Maritime Commission, an independent agency that regulates international ocean transportation for U.S. exporters and importers, is under investigation by a House committee for spying on the personal e-mail communications of several employees with grievances against the commission's management.
The commission apparently also used SpectorSoft software, said Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, who opened an investigation of the agency in May.
Nest is getting serious about home security with an entirely new product family it's calling Nest Secure. Announced today at a hardware event in San Francisco, Nest detailed a new modular system that is designed to make home security more modern and simple.
The centerpiece of the system is called Nest Guard, and it's a small, hockey puck-shaped device with a keypad on top. The device sits indoors facing your front door and communicates with a series of smaller devices, called Nest Detects, that can be placed throughout your home. If anyone enters the house and doesn't disarm the Nest Secure system, the alarm triggers and a large loud siren sound is sent out. For every action along the way, the system sends alerts to your phone.
There are a ton of moving parts to Nest Secure, and while the company's aim is to design a dead-simple security system, it's worth going over in detail how it's all supposed to function. For one, the Nest Guard acts as the central hub, so all the disarming and arming of the security system is done through that device, which contains a motion sensor, connects to your home network via Wi-Fi, and can communicate with Nest's mobile app.
To arm it, you tell your Nest app that you're leaving, and you're given a countdown before the system rearms. (You can also arm the system remotely if need be.) To disarm the system when it triggers or when you're coming home, you can enter the key code on the Guard itself, disarm through the app, or turn it off via NFC using one of two included key fobs called Nest Tags. Nest thinks the tags are perfect for children, other family members, or for temporary access like babysitters and dog walkers, and you can set temporary access time limits on the tags by time of day and day of the week.
While the Guard is designed to sit at your front door and detect any opening and closing on that front, the Nest Detect is for the rest of your home. Nest is bundling two Detect devices into the Secure starter pack — it's also selling individual units separately — and the company says they're mostly designed for back or side doors and windows. They do not need to be plugged into power, like the Guard, or connected to Wi-Fi, but instead run on batteries and communicate with the Guard using Nest's mesh networking technology Weave.
Nest Secure lets you set up motion and door detection throughout your home
To Detect is designed to be placed near the upper corner of doors, on the jam itself, and separated into two pieces. The two pieces communicate the strength of a magnetic field, so that when that field is disrupted by a door or window opening, the alarm is triggered. Nest is including a feature it calls Quiet Open, that lets you tap a button on to Detect itself to disarm just a single door, in the event you'd like to leave the house early in the morning for, say, taking a jog or running a quick errand and you don't want to wake the house by disarming the whole system. Nest Detect can also just be used as a simple motion detection tool, if you'd like one room of the house to be monitored.
For those who want a bit more security, Nest will be selling a professional home monitoring and alarm response service through third-party provider Moni. That will effectively loop Nest Secure in with local law enforcement in the event you want any trigger of the alarm system to be taken very seriously. Nest doesn't have pricing for that service available just yet. The company is also selling cellular backup service through T-Mobile for $5 a month or $50 a year, in the event your power goes out or your Wi-Fi is down and you want Secure to stay online.
Nest is selling the whole Secure system in a starter pack, which includes the Guard, two Detects, and two Tags, for $499 this November starting in the US; Canada and Europe are coming next year. It will also start selling the standalone Nest Detect units for $59 and additional Nest Tags for $25 apiece. Preorders start today.
To round out the whole product family, the company also designed a signal booster, called Nest Connect, for those with large homes who worry about connection issues. To Connect helps strengthen the mesh networking technology that helps the Detect devices communicate with the Guard. Nest also partnered with lockmaker Yale to develop a joint smart lock, aptly named the Nest + Yale lock, that will tie into the Secure system as well. That way, when you unlock the front door, it can disarm the system alongside any of the other three available disarm methods. Nest hasn't released pricing or availability details for to Connect or the Nest + Yale lock yet.
Moving a character from one point to another is not always a simple matter. Often there is not a clear path between the starting point and destination. Simply moving a character along such a path is a sure fire way of getting it stuck. In cases where a character (be it the player or a NPC) need to move to a specific point, the PathfindingService can compute a clear path that can be followed.
Path
The key object added by the PathFindingService is the Path object. A Path holds a series of points between a given start and end location and can also check if that path becomes invalid at any point, giving the game a chance to recompute the path.
Creating a path
A path is made with ComputeRawPathAsync. This function requires three things, a Vector3 for the start of the path, a Vector3 for the end of the path, and the maximum distance the path is allowed to be.
Evaluating a path
When a Path is created with the PathfindingService, a status is returned along with the path. This status is stored in the path under Status, and will be one of the values in PathStatus. The different statuses and their meaning are as follows:
Success Path found successfully. ClosestNoPath Path doesn't exist, returns path to the closest point. ClosestOutOfRange Goal is out of MaxDistance range, returns path to the closest point you can reach within MaxDistance. FailStartNotEmpty Failed to compute path; the starting point is not empty. FailFinishNotEmpty Failed to compute path; the finish point is not empty.
The status can be used to determine if you want to recompute the path with different parameters (such as a new end point), or would like the character to choose a different behavior.
Using a path
A Path object contains a table of points that can be accessed with GetPointCoordinates. This table stores the series of Vector3's that can be followed in order to complete the given path. Keep in mind the PathfindingService does not create any kind of motion, it just shows which points to move to on the path. To create movement, consider using a movement functions like MoveTo, moving the object with CFrames, or even create physical motion with a force via BodyVelocity or BodyForce.
Rechecking Path
Roblox games are often dynamic, and things might get in the way of a path after it has been calculated. If this happens, the path should be recalculated so the object moving along the path can continue. That said, recalculating a path is an expensive operation, and should be seldom done.
A good way to check if a path needs to be recalculated is with CheckOcclusionAsync. This function will check to see if any point on the path (starting with a point you specify) is obstructed. If so, the function will return the first index of the path where the obstruction occurs. At this point you can recompute the path from the object's current position, or can compute a path from the last obscured point.
EmptyCutoff
You may notice that pathfinding can have difficulty with thin floors. Thin floors are sometimes considered empty because they don't take up much space. This is due to the way pathfinding calculates empty space in the game world. To find a path, the service divides the world into a grid of 4x4x4 cubes called voxels. It then checks on how empty the voxels are to determine what an available path is. By default, if a voxel is less than 16% filled then it is considered empty.
To solve the issue of thinner floors, there are two solutions you can employ. Firstly, you can simply make the floors thicker (which will fill up more of the space so the voxels are considered full). The other solution is to change the EmptyCutoff to a lower value. This has the advantage of preserving the look of your level (if you need thin floors), but it does mean the paths in your level may change.
Example
Click to move is a very common feature in games, but can be very troublesome when simply using MoveTo. Using the PathfindingService, we can calculate a series of points to MoveTo so that the character does not get stuck.
You can see this place in action here.

If Stephen King's name wasn't enough to sell you on Hulu's “Castle Rock”, they've cast horror veteran Jane Levy in one of the lead roles.
Levy, who starred in both Fede Alvarez's Evil Dead remake and Don't Breathe, is set to co-star opposite Moonlight‘s André Holland in Hulu's upcoming psychological-horror drama series from J.J. Abrams and Stephen King, Deadline reports. Also boarding the show in a key role is an actress closely associated with King's cinematic world, Carrie star Sissy Spacek!
Levy has signed a one-year deal for “Castle Rock”, which is suspect and hopefully not a spoiler.
Set in the Stephen King multiverse, “Castle Rock”, from Bad Robot Productions and Warner Bros. Television, is named after the fictional town in King's native Maine that is featured prominently in a number of his novels, novellas, and short stories. Per the producers, it combines the mythological scale and intimate character storytelling of King's best-loved works, weaving an epic saga of darkness and light, played out on a few square miles of Maine woodland.
Oscar winner Spacek will play Ruth Deaver, estranged adoptive mother of Henry (Holland), a retired professor whose fading memories may hold a key to Castle Rock's unsettling past. Levy plays Jackie, the death-obsessed, self-appointed historian of Castle Rock.
Holland plays Henry, a death row attorney with a unique and complicated history in Castle Rock, Maine.
Spacek is coming off a three-season run on the Netflix drama series “Bloodline”.
Sam Shaw & Dustin Thomason developed Castle Rock for television and serve as executive producers along with J.J. Abrams, Ben Stephenson and Liz Glotzer.
North Korea has its own restaurant chain. It's good, even if the sea cucumber liquor and dog casserole are overpriced.
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia—
The restaurant's fluorescent lights dim and give way to multicolored spots as an upbeat synthesized tune begins to play. Three waitresses—nearly identical with their red aprons, pale smiling faces, and jet black hair—rush onto the small stage, each clutching a microphone and dancing in unison as they sing the North Korean classic “Pan Gap Sumnida” (“Nice to Meet You”) while scenes from their homeland flash on a television behind them.
This is Phnom Penh's Pyongyang Restaurant, part of a pan-Asian chain established in the 1990s that now has about 100 branches scattered across China, Indonesia, Russia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Nepal. Despite functioning like regular—if kitschy—restaurants, they are believed to be a part of Bureau 39, a secretive arm of the Korean Workers' Party that acquires and launders foreign currency for the cash-strapped Hermit Kingdom through ventures as diverse as agricultural exports, arms sales, and methamphetamine production.
The great irony of the Pyongyang Restaurant chain is that South Koreans are some of their best customers. Cambodia's original North Korean restaurant opened in Siem Reap in 2002 to cater to the busloads of South Korean tourists descending on the area's famed Angkor Archaeological Park. Its success led to the opening of a Phnom Penh branch in 2003. There are now two of these North Korean–themed restaurants in Siem Reap and three in the Cambodian capital. South Korea's Chosun daily newspaper estimates that each restaurant funnels between $100,000 to $300,000 in hard currency back to the Stalinist state each year.

The oldest of the three Phnom Penh restaurants is surprisingly propaganda free. Instead of didactic slogans and portraits of the Kim clan, the walls are adorned with massive pastoral paintings: cherry blossoms, mist-shrouded mountains, a serene birch forest.
It's Friday night, and around us, well-heeled Cambodians and South Korean businessmen knock back bottles of soju and Angkor Beer from tables piled high with specialties from above the 38th parallel: Savory Pyongyang cold noodles, pungent dog meat casserole, and viscous pine nut gruel are all on the menu. A shelf near the entrance holds expensive bottles of North Korean liquor—ginseng ($50), mushroom ($50), sea cucumber ($70)—and small boxes of herbal pills ($120 per package!) that a waitress claims will cure anything. At one table near the back of the restaurant, a lone Cambodian bodyguard listens intently to a walkie-talkie while munching on a platter of grilled pork. When a waitress asks him if friends will be joining him, he points upstairs to the VIP karaoke rooms that westerners are barred from entering.
The crowd appears more interested in the pretty young waitresses than Kim Jong-un's nuclear ambitions.
Mandatory military service means that nearly all of the South Korean customers have served in the armed forces. The irony of patronizing a restaurant owned by a regime bent on their destruction seems lost in the boozy haze. The overwhelmingly male crowd appears to be more interested in the pretty young waitresses than North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's nuclear ambitions.
The waitresses, all in their 20s, are perfect comrades. Standing next to the tables—they refuse offers to sit down—they politely laugh at jokes, exchange pleasantries, and answer questions with short declarative sentences. The women spurn their drunk customers' advances with cheery grace, subtly sidestepping attempted gropes so no one loses face. Their well-rehearsed poise, however, lapses when they're given opportunities to play with diners' smartphones. Suddenly, devices in hand, plastic smiles loosen and eyes grow wide as they look at photographs of Seoul and beyond. Although Internet access is tightly regulated back home, no one stops them. Mutual curiosities are entertained here, with diners and servers providing each other a glimpse of alien familiarity–people with the same language and history cut off by a half a century of ideology, violence, and political posturing.
After the sinking of a South Korean warship in 2010, Phnom Penh's South Korean expat community launched a campaign to dissuade their countrymen from visiting North Korean restaurants. Despite their efforts, the eateries remain popular for their novelty, though the image that curious diners get of their northern neighbors is a meticulously curated one.
The website Daily NK describes the women who staff these North Korean restaurants as being hand-picked from elite Pyongyang families for their beauty, talent, language skills, and political loyalty. All are said to undergo rigorous ideological education before being sent overseas. The waitresses, who come on three-year contracts, live onsite, serving lunch and dinner seven days a week. Government security agents are also reportedly placed within each restaurant, and the waitresses never venture out unescorted. A friend who visited one of the Siem Reap branches claims that the waitresses he spoke to had never even seen nearby Angkor Wat–Cambodia's main tourist-draw. The women are able to send money home to their families who live as virtual (albeit privileged) hostages until their daughters return to Pyongyang.
While rare, defections have happened—including reported cases in China, Nepal, and Cambodia. In each instance, the offending restaurants were temporally shut down as the entire staff was repatriated and replaced.
Citing anonymous “U.S. and western intelligence officials,” the Washington Free Beacon recently reported that the waitresses double as intelligence operatives trained to extract corporate secrets from inebriated South Korean businessmen. The piece goes on to claim that the restaurants are espionage hotbeds frequented by both North Korean agents and American spooks hoping to enlist informants. For Americans, after all, such restaurants are some of the few portals they have into the DPRK. While such claims remain dubious, they might explain why the Phnom Penh waitresses enforce a strict no photo policy—I only managed to snap a few shots before being told with polite firmness to put my camera away.
Our shy waitress she seems to instantly develop a rapport with my American roommate—one of the only women in the restaurant.
Our waitress, Lee Jun Mei—I've changed her identity here, but her real name was spelled out in Korean and English on a badge decorated in the colors of the North Korean flag—hasn't been working in Cambodia for very long. While the 21-year-old is shy with the men at our table, she seems to instantly develop a rapport with my American roommate—one of the only women in the restaurant.
In cheery but broken English, Jun Mei complains that her feet hurt from wearing heels all day and that she doesn't like dealing with these hordes of drunken men. She tells my friend that Cambodia is too hot and that she misses Pyongyang and her family. The woman seems rather scandalized when my roommate explains our living situation.
“You stay with man?” she exclaims, giggling nervously. “And not married!”
When I ask Jun Mei where she likes to go in her free time, she becomes evasive. Direct questions—don't you think Phnom Penh's Royal Palace is beautiful? What's your favorite place in the city?—only elicit vague mumbling replies.
It's less of a concert than a kind of Pyongyang's Got Talent.
I leave Jun Mei with my roommate and stroll around while one of the waitresses sings a nearly unrecognizable rendition of Neil Sedaka's “Oh! Carol.” After her, others sing in Korean, Khmer, and Chinese. Such karaoke-esque acts are interspersed with dance routines and instrumental performances: a rapid-fire violin, an oom-pa-pa accordion, and a beautifully played gayageum, each accompanied by synthesized keyboard beats. The waitresses change clothing between sets, coming out in tight-fitting dresses, flowing robes, and traditional hanbok gowns in the same vibrant colors of the Buddhist flag. After each act, they quickly change and go back to delivering more dishes. It's less of a concert than a kind of Pyongyang's Got Talent. And they actually are talented, albeit in a heavily scripted sort of way.
The food at Phnom Penh's Pyongyang Restaurant is good if overpriced—more than double what a similar meal would cost at many of the city's expat-run South Korean eateries. The cold noodles and hearty seafood pancake are my favorites. We avoid most meats (dog casserole for $28!), though the pine nut gruel is a hit with my companions. Perhaps, like the whole dining experience, it's the quintessentially North Korean novelty that does it for them. To me, however, it lives up to its billing as gruel—thick, viscous, and almost completely flavorless.
The performance sends the crowded restaurant's now-drunk diners into fits of cheering and applause.
A five-piece band caps the night's show. On guitar, bass, accordion, keys, and drums, the waitresses rock through an original number that crescendos into a pounding drum solo. It's frenetic, precise, and oddly melodic. The performance sends the crowded restaurant's now-drunk diners into fits of cheering and applause.
And then it ends. The fluorescent lights come back on. The waitresses put away their instruments, change their clothes, and go back to serving dishes and drinks.
We order another round, then get the bill. I ask Jun Mei one last question: “Do you like Cambodia?” She looks down silently and shakes her head, “No.”
Late last week, the Daya Bay experiment in China released a new set of measurements of the neutrinos produced by the nuclear reactors on the site. The new data provides further examples of these strange particles refusing to act like we'd expect them to. This evidence further supports strange behavior that some have interpreted as evidence of the existence of particles beyond the Standard Model, but the new data doesn't bring evidence up to the level of significance required to announce discovery.
For good measure, there's also evidence of an entirely different anomaly—one that could be anything from an indication of new physics to a sign that our experiments were fundamentally misguided.
Any flavor you like
Last year's Physics Nobel Prize went to the people who discovered that neutrinos are less a single particle and more of an identity-shifting family of particles. Neutrinos come in three types, or flavors: electron, muon, and tau. But the identity of any given neutrino isn't fixed; instead, it can shift among these identities over time. Thus, even if you started with a population of pure electron neutrinos, you'd find a few muon neutrinos in the mix as well, given sufficient time.
This change in identity is called a flavor oscillation, and its confirmation was key to the discovery that neutrinos have mass.
We can measure the probabilities of these flavor oscillations by creating a relatively pure beam of one flavor of neutrino and sending it to a detector a specific distance away. Depending on the distance, a specific fraction is expected to change identity. If you measure the number of neutrinos that do, then you can see whether the flavor oscillations align with theoretical expectations—and whether the total of all three probabilities adds up to one.
Somewhat disturbingly, it hasn't. A variety of experiments, conducted using different sources and different detector technology, all indicate that there seems to be a deficit. If we expect a certain fraction of our beam to oscillate into electron neutrinos, we always detect fewer of them than we'd predict. While this has been seen in a number of experiments, the deficit has never become statistically robust enough that physicists were willing to hand out more Nobel Prizes.
Daya Bay is now the latest experiment to see this sort of deficit. The detector, based in China, is located near a nuclear power plant with six large reactors. Each second, those reactors collectively produce 3,500 billion electron antineutrinos. Even though detecting neutrinos is rare, these numbers ensure that the Daya Bay experiment is able to pick them up regularly. In a 217-day run, the detectors observed more than 300,000 neutrinos.
Once again, however, the discrepancy is below the five-sigma standard of significance that physicists expect before a discovery could be declared.
Signs of sterility?
There's one possible explanation for the missing neutrinos: if there are more than three flavors, then some of the missing ones could have oscillated into an identity we're unable to detect. This is exactly what you'd expect if there were a class of particles that physicists have been wondering about for decades: sterile neutrinos.
The three types of neutrinos we know about take part in particle interactions through the weak force, which is involved in radioactive decay. Any further neutrinos would not interact in the same manner, meaning their only option for interactions is through gravity. This apparent indifference to most physical forces is what gave them the name "sterile."
It also would make them even harder to detect than a regular neutrino. In fact, at the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, physicist Carlo Giunti said that the only direct way of detecting their presence is through the sorts of anomalies seen at Daya Bay—strange numbers coming out of experiments designed to track flavor oscillations.
Cosmologist Olga Mena, however, said that this may be some evidence of neutrinos that we could see due to their gravitational effect. Studies of the Cosmic Microwave Background indicate that we've already discovered all the neutrinos there are. The experimental errors of those measurements, however, would allow a sterile neutrino if it's relatively rare, she said. Provided they were sufficiently massive, however, they would act as what Mena termed "warm dark matter."
Most of the large-scale structure of the Universe can be explained through cold dark matter—dark matter that's moving slowly enough to easily form gravitational aggregates. But this doesn't explain a few anomalies that appear at smaller scales, like the relative paucity of dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way. One possible explanation for this deficit is that we're not especially good at spotting dwarf galaxies.
An alternative, according to Mena, is that there is also some warm dark matter around—matter moving fast enough that it's harder to get it to slow down and aggregate. Mena said this would suppress the formation of dwarf galaxies while leaving the cold dark matter to do the heavy lifting of forming the large-scale structures of the Universe. And a heavy sterile neutrino would make an excellent candidate for warm dark matter.
Anomalies on top of anomalies
The second Daya Bay oddity, however, may throw a monkey wrench into all of this. It comes through measurements of the energy carried by the neutrinos when they slammed into the detector. This energy comes from the nuclear decay itself: some of it goes into a photon, and the rest imparts momentum to the neutrino.
Berkeley's Kam Biu Luk, a spokesman for the Daya Bay experiment, told Ars that it's possible to measure that energy based on the amount of energy the neutrino deposits in the detector. The number of neutrinos at various energies can then be compared to the number you'd predict you'd see. That later number relies on a combination of our understanding of nuclear decays—along with the knowledge of all the isotopes present in an active nuclear reactor as well as the rate at which they're all decaying.
When the Daya Bay team did this comparison, the curve of the measurements largely traced the calculated expectations for a while. But at energies around 5 Mega-electronVolts, there was a discrepancy. It's not quite at the five sigma standard, but it's quite large, and Luk seemed to expect that the next run of the detector should be able to tell whether it's real.
What would it mean if this discrepancy is real? Here's where interpretations can differ. It could be that there's something odd happening in either nuclear decays or our understanding of the environment inside a nuclear reactor. Either of these could be potentially interesting, but such conclusions might not tell us anything dramatic about the nature of the Universe.
If it's the former—a lack of understanding of nuclear decays—it could mean that we're mistaken in our understanding of how many neutrinos should be produced in these reactions. In which case, our expectations for the number of neutrinos we should be seeing is off, and the apparent deficit we see is nothing more than an indication of our flawed understanding. Sterile neutrinos would safely remain in the realm of theoretical oddity.
And the last possibility is that the result is real and has nothing to do with the presence or absence of sterile neutrinos. In which case, neutrinos could once again be hinting at new physics.
The Daya Bay facility will continue taking data, and Fermilab's Peter Wilson told the audience at the meeting of Fermilab's efforts to build a neutrino source and set of detectors that should be able to nail down whether the neutrino deficits are real in a few years. For now, this is one of those mysteries that we'll just have to wait patiently to see resolved.

It has been a few weeks since I have said anything in public about the controversy over my remarks at the Women in Secularism 2 conference. As CFI announced via Twitter, this pause was to enable the board to have time to consider the matter. The board has issued its statement. It is now an appropriate time for me to make some remarks.
I am sorry that I caused offense with my talk. I am also sorry I made some people feel unwelcome as a result of my talk. From the letters sent to me and the board, I have a better understanding of the objections to the talk.
I am also sorry that my talk and my actions subjected my colleagues and the organization to which I am devoted to criticism.
Please accept my apologies.
In the spring of 1918, the influenza that would become pandemic was first detected. It was initially known as “three-day-fever.” Its effects were such that it caused few deaths. Nobody paid it much heed.
That fall, however, it reappeared in a more deadly form and began to rapidly spread. Because of the War and the subsequent troop demobilization in late 1918 and 1919, a concentration of soldiers in camps, and in troop ships and trains returning to their homes, abetted the disease's migration around the world.
By the end of 1919, somewhere between 20 million and 50 million people were dead of influenza, more than had been killed in four years of fighting. It has been estimated that over 20% of the U.S. population (106 million in 1920) had contracted the flu, with 675,000 dying. While those numbers suggest the death rate was only 3.5%, the 675,000 dead were almost six times the number of Americans killed in the War.
The outbreak of the Ebola virus was first seen in Guinea in December, 2013. It has since spread to at least four other West African countries: Liberia, Sierra Leone, Senegal, Nigeria, and recently Ebola was confirmed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The three hardest hit countries are among the smallest. Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone have a combined population of 22 million, But Nigeria has a population of 173 million, and 68 million people live in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Significantly, the latter two countries are not contiguous to the others.
A data sheet from the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta provides some key facts:
* Ebola virus disease (EVD), formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, is a severe, often fatal illness in humans.
* EVD outbreaks have a case fatality rate of up to 90%.
* The virus is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads in the human population through human-to-human transmission.
* Fruit bats are considered to be the natural host of the Ebola virus.
* Severely ill patients require intensive supportive care. No licensed specific treatment or vaccine is available for use in people or animals.
Once contracted, Ebola is far more deadly than the influenza. Thus far this year, 49% of those infected have died. Costs are rising, and it is gaining momentum.
An article in Wednesday's Financial Times quoted Dr. David Nabarro, senior UN coordinator for Ebola. Dr. Nabarro estimated that the cost of addressing the disease jumped tenfold to $1 billion from just a month earlier.
Shanelle Hall, director of the supply division of UNICEF, which has sent 550 tons of supplies to West Africa, was quoted: “The pace of the disease and also its impact have taken our breath away – it's been that massive.”
According to a report in Wednesday's New York Times, reported cases are at 4,985, including 2,461 deaths. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that half of the infections have occurred in the past three weeks, and they expect that fatalities are likely to continue to double every three weeks. The numbers are sobering. A doubling every three weeks means that by the end of December, 165,000 people could be infected, and in six months 2.5 million could have the disease, with over a million dead.
The possibility of the disease coming to the United States may be remote, but its devastation in Africa could have world-wide humanitarian and economic consequences. The likelihood, of course, is that it will be contained on the African continent, and fear of its spread should not cause panic in the U.S.
For one, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said that it was extremely unlikely that the Ebola virus would mutate into an airborne pathogen. Given proper, supportive patient care, healthcare workers and family members should be okay, but patients must be kept isolated, as the disease is spread through contact with bodily fluids. The question is: Do conditions in Africa permit such patient care?
But to scoff at the threat, as did Investor's Business Daily on Wednesday, is to show unconcern about its potential consequences. In Liberia's capital city of Monrovia, according to the report in the Times, bodies are often left in homes or neighborhoods for up to three days before burial teams can take them away. At this point there is no vaccine, though one is being tested in the U.S. by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and GlaxoSmithKline. Yesterday, the Associated Press reported on a similar experimental vaccine being tested in the U.K.
It was good to see the President travel to the CDC in Atlanta on Tuesday, where he spoke with some urgency. He called the crisis a “top national security priority.” But we are late in treating this as the emergency it is, and it is not getting the press coverage it deserves, perhaps because the media does not want to be seen as responsible for inciting a panic. As an indication as to how long it has taken the world to respond, until a few weeks ago, the WHO was more concerned with the proliferation of electronic cigarettes than with controlling the spread of Ebola.
Nevertheless, the situation is now being taken seriously in Washington and elsewhere. Why else would the State Department have ordered 160,000 Hazmat suits? Mr. Obama will ask Congress for $88 million to conduct a “major Ebola offensive” in Africa. Additionally, he will send 3,000 American troops to help set up 17 treatment centers with 100 beds each, which will take about three weeks to accomplish. It will not be enough. Liberian officials claim they will need 1,000 beds next week.
While there are those like Illinois' Senator Dick Durbin who would politicize this tragedy – using twisted logic, he recently argued that a comprehensive immigration amnesty bill would have helped America contain the Ebola epidemic in Africa – America's response shows our country at its best.
The United States is condemned for involving itself in others' affairs. We are criticized by many, at home and abroad, for attempting to impose our values on other cultures. Yet, it is humanitarian acts such as these that manifest the magnanimity of our values – that make America the exceptional nation she is. Would China have done the same? Would Russia, Brazil, or even Europe? Once our influence and standing are diminished (as seems to be the course we are on), who will replace us? We are the indispensable nation. That's not pride; that's reality.
The word pandemic stems from the Greek pandēmos, meaning all the people. In reference to a disease, it means that it is widespread throughout a country, region, continent, or the world, affecting a large percentage of the population. Given current statistics, Ebola is not a pandemic, but it is likely to become one.
Home > Japanese Entertainment > "Death Note" Started Mysterious Countdown
Japanese Entertainment
A mysterious countdown has begun on the official website for the live-action movie "Death Note", which was released in 2006.
The countdown is scheduled to end on September 13 at 10:30 PM. This coincides with the airdate for the final episode of the live-action drama "Death Note", which airs on NTV. However, it won't become clear whether or not the countdown is related until then.
"Death Note", originated by Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata, is a popular manga that has been serialized in the "Weekly Shonen Jump" from 2003 to 2006. It was adapted into an anime series as well as a film series. While the countdown appeared on their past movie site, it is speculated that this hints at a new project.

As citizens of the United States worry over the implications of the pending SOPA legislation, a small land-locked country on the fringes of Europe is showing how bad things can really get. Labeled by the United States as an "outpost of tyranny", Belarus is certainly living up to its reputation. This Friday, browsing foreign websites will become an offense punishable by fines, with service providers taking responsibility for the actions of their users.
While there are many reasons why people oppose the implementation of SOPA, a common thread is that any level of censorship will simply encourage yet more. The fear is that an inch will become a mile, and before long the Internet will be a place of restrictions where innovation is stifled.
Those pointing to China as an example of how bad things can get should now focus a little closer to the west, on the outskirts of Europe to be precise.
From January 6th, Belarus, which became independent in 1991 following the collapse of the Soviet Union, will begin severely restricting what its citizens can do on the Internet. New legislation requires that anyone do business in the country may only utilize fully local Internet domains when carrying out their activities online.
As highlighted by the Law Library of Congress, this means that it will become illegal for locals to use a site such as Amazon.com, which has no official Belarusian presence. Indeed, browsing any website outside the country will be punishable with fines of up to $125.
The initial decree, issued in February 2010 by President Alyaksandr Lukashenka, requires the compulsory registration of all web sites which must then be hosted in the country.
The potential damage to the Belarus economy and their growth from online trade will be significant. According to Alexa, some of the world's biggest sites are listed in the country's Top 20 most-visited list including Google, YouTube, Twitter and Wikipedia, all of which have .com domains and US hosting. Indeed, only two sites in the Belarusian Top 10 currently appear to be ‘legal' for local access.
Additionally, the legislation will also hold Internet providers, such as cafés providing wifi, responsible for the actions of their customers if they are found to be using foreign sites. The same responsibilities lie with home Internet subscribers who share their connections with others.
The suggestion is that such providers, commercial or domestic, will have to monitor for foreign website use and report the findings to authorities. The legislation also ensures there is plenty of data to hand over. As a minimum, ISPs and webhosts will be required to record the names and passport details of customers, along with their domain names, a description of their site's activities and IP addresses allocated.
So for now, even Google's Belarusian variant Google.by seems to fall outside the legal reach of citizens of Belarus, hosted as it is in the United States. Twitter, Facebook and Wikipedia have further problems, since the .BY variants of their domains have been registered by other entities.
Interestingly, while Belarus National State Television has previously aired pirated movies such as The Hurt Locker, they won't now be able to grab them from foreign torrent sites as they did in the past. RUTracker, one of Russia's largest torrent sites, is Belarus' 20th most-popular site. However, it too has a non .BY domain and is hosted abroad, rendering it off limits to locals.
Torrents.by will be doing lots of business soon though – hosted and registered in Belarus.
Bernie Sanders presidential campaign is already bringing about a small bit of the revolution he is calling for, simply by existing as a true progressive in a race of barely-there Democrats.
During Sunday night's Jefferson-Jackson dinner in New Hampshire, Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders, Martin O'Malley, and Hillary Clinton spoke to a large number of Democratic activists on topics ranging from social inequality to foreign policy.
Sanders' campaign is having and will continue to have a major and visible effect on the general direction of the Democratic party by consistently forcing Hillary further to the left in order to compete with the promises Sanders has made. Hillary knows that she is in danger of losing the election due to her establishment politics and close ties with Wall Street, so she is making an effort to seem harder on the one percent.
At Sunday's dinner, Hillary said that “republicans have stacked the deck for those at the top.” No mention, of course, that Hillary is certainly one of those at the top. It is unclear if anyone is buying her shtick, but her shift to the left can only benefit the Democratic party as a whole if she sticks to what she campaigns for.
Sanders campaign, too, is getting sleeker and more refined as he hones in on the issues he seemed to lack in the past, particularly dealing with foreign policy, a subject that he noticeably skimmed over in the last debate.
Sanders has done an admirable job proving that he is a man of the people and will make serious reforms in the economy and social structure in the U.S., but he must continue to prove that he can be an effective commander in chief when it comes to defending our country from foreign threats.
If Bernie Sanders is not our president come November 2016, it will be a real tragedy. And yet, there is no way that his candidacy will not have a strong and lasting effect on the Democratic party for years to come. His campaign is proof that change can happen, and not some sort of bought-and-sold change we know, but true political reform.

For a notoriously outspoken businessman who extols the power of social media and the virtues of corporate transparency, Saleforce.com CEO Marc Benioff used the former to send one heck of a thinly veiled political message just a few hours ago.
And, if he didn't really mean what it seems he meant, Benioff isn't in any hurry to offer a clarification.
Boom, boom, boom and boom: In a 23-minute burst of four successive posts all appearing on (at least) his personal Twitter, Facebook and Google+ accounts, Benioff called the attention of his tens of thousands of social-media followers to videos and photographs depicting vandalism and mob-like actions yesterday on the part of Oakland protesters purporting to support the Occupy Wall Street movement.
But it's what he didn't say that spoke the loudest.
From his Google+ account:
11:29: A link to a post on Michelle Malkin's blog featuring what Benioff calls "shocking" photos of vandalism.
11:29: A link to a YouTube video - again called "shocking" by Benioff -- and labeled as having been taken, "During an anti-capitalism march on November 2." (Emphasis mine.)
11:35: Another link to YouTube video showing general mayhem outside of a Whole Foods Store, on which Benioff wrote only "Oakland Whole Foods Grocery Store."
11:52 A link without a word of commentary from Benioff to raw footage from the local NBC affiliate showing a mob knocking over a fence and tossing chairs around at the same Whole Foods Store. (The TV station did offer this context underneath its video: "While today's General Strike at Occupy Oakland was mostly peaceful, some people caused damage to businesses along the way, including this Whole Foods.")
Shocking? Maybe, but we've all seen much worse from sports fans (hello, Vancouver).
The issue here is whether Benioff really wants those images to speak for him when it comes to what he thinks about Occupy Wall Street, because it sure looks that way. And if he does that means he thinks that a movement polls show enjoying clear majority support in this country is grounded in lawlessness and antipathy to capitalism. Neither is true, in my view, nor do I believe it is the view of the overwhelming majority of OWS participants and supporters.
Of course, it would not be surprising to learn that Benioff isn't sympathetic to OWS. After all, with a net worth of about $2 billion, there's no doubt that he is a 1-percenter in Occupy Wall Street terms. However, he also appears to lean left politically, at least in public, having hosted a fundraiser for President Obama in April. And he and his wife are generous philanthropists whose $100 million pledge has been instrumental in the ongoing construction of a new hospital.
I asked the Salesforce.com public relations department if today's social-media postings were meant to reflect Benioff's general views about OWS, and received this reply from a spokeswoman: "If Marc decides to further comment on his views, he will do so on the social channels."
That's fine, but if he does he should speak more clearly instead of letting a bunch of hooligans and knuckleheads do his talking for him.
(Update: On the same day Benioff was torching the Occupy Oakland rowdies via his social media soapboxes, he holds the movement up as a shining example of the power of Twitter, Facebook, etc., in this interview on TechCrunch. Which is it?)

What's Next
Xbox One fans are petitioning Microsoft to return the console to its original state. The company had removed controversial game-sharing restrictions after backlash from the gaming community, however not everyone is happy with the decision. The petition is asking Microsoft to give gamers back the Xbox One they were promised at the Electronics Entertainment Expo earlier this year. In response to the petition, Xbox One chief product officer Marc Whitten admitted that Microsoft hasn't done a good job communicating its messaging surrounding the new console.
“I think it's pretty simple. We've got to just talk more, get people understanding what our system is,” Whitten said in an interview with IGN. “The thing that's really gratifying is that people are excited about the types of features that are possible, and it's sort of shame on us that we haven't done as good of a job as we can to make people feel like that's where we're headed.”
The executive said that Microsoft needs to do “more work to talk about what we're doing,” adding that the company is now doing a better job of listening to the feedback of the gaming community.
As for removed features such as the Xbox One's family sharing ability, Whitten noted that Microsoft will “find the right way to bring it back” if demand is there. He explained that while there isn't set road map for the feature, the company is going to “continue to push” other areas such as how advantages from Xbox Live Gold can be shared with family members. Whitten did admit that he “should have been more clear” on the day Microsoft changed its policies.
“We took some feedback and realized there was some stuff we needed to add to the program,” he said. “Taking Family Sharing out of the launch window was not about ‘we're going to take our toys and go home' or something like that. It was just sort of the logistics of ‘how do we get this very, very clear request that people really want, that choice, and how do we make sure we can do an excellent job of that, get to launch, and then be able to build a bunch of great features?'”
Whitten continued, “One of the things I think we learned was that we didn't talk enough, and we were incomplete in a lot of how using the system would work. We weren't participating in the conversation in a deep enough way, it got us sort of off cycle about how we talk about our program. I think we've learned a lot of lessons. And I think it's something that you're going to see a lot more from us, frankly, is engaging more with the community. I think it's the number one thing I'd want to do if I went back, was had the conversation more open and more complete.”
Six weeks after test results were given, all of the subjects filled out standardized surveys for anxiety, depression and distress related to the test. They also filled them out six months later, and one year later. There were no major differences between the people who found out their test results and those who did not.
“We did not find significant psychiatric distress,” Dr. Green said.
In the study, people who found out they did not have the risky gene were relieved, even though they understood that they were still not in the clear. Those who learned they had the gene were more likely than those who did not, or who did not know, to regard their risk of Alzheimer's as higher and to express negative feelings about receiving the results. But those feelings did not translate into distress. And those who had the gene were no less likely than the others to say they would have the test all over again, the researchers said.
The information concerns a gene called APOE, for apolipoprotein E. It is not a yes/no gene that absolutely determines a person's fate. But APOE does influence the risk for Alzheimer's.
People inherit two copies of APOE, and each copy comes in one of three types, e2, e3 or e4. E4 is unlucky. People with one copy have three to five times the risk of someone who has no e4, and those with two copies of e4 have 15 times the risk, Dr. Green said. (In the general population, the average lifetime risk of ever developing Alzheimer's is about 10 percent.) Compared to people with no e4, those who have it also tend to decline more on memory tests as they age, even without obvious symptoms of Alzheimer's.

But APOE is not definitive. Many people with e4 never become demented, and many Alzheimer's patients have no e4. That uncertainty helped turn the medical profession against testing.
In the past, the Alzheimer's Association discouraged testing, but it has relaxed its stance in the past few years, largely because of reports from the Reveal study. Even so, William Thies, the association's chief medical and scientific officer, said that so far there had not been much demand for the test, and that a direct-to-consumer company specializing in it had gone out of business. Two authors of the study, but not Dr. Green, provided consulting services to a company that was marketing APOE testing.
Two study participants, among a half dozen whose telephone numbers were given to reporters by Boston University, said they were pleased that they had joined the study. Amy Sumner, 45, a social worker in Simsbury, Conn., said she had sought out the research because there were several cases of Alzheimer's in her grandmother's generation on her mother's side. Ms. Sumner thought her test results might help her mother and aunts (who do not have dementia) decide whether to be tested. She turned out to have no copies of e4, a relief for her but not much help for her relatives, who could still carry the gene.
She said her mother and aunts were concerned about their risk but did not dwell on it, adding, “All four are very strong, spiritual women and have a lot of peace about it even though they're concerned.”

Another participant, Robert McKersie, 79, said he wanted the test because his mother died of Alzheimer's. Dr. McKersie said he thought the test results might help him and his wife decide whether to stay in their house or consider moving to an assisted-living facility, just in case. He learned that he did have a copy of e4 — but given his high scores on mental tests and the fact that he has reached 79 with no intellectual decline, the researchers estimated his risk as fairly low. Although is retired, Dr. McKersie is still teaching business courses at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Despite the study's reassuring results, Dr. Green said it did not mean that APOE testing was right for everybody. Some people who initially wanted to participate changed their minds after they learned more about the test. Dr. Green also cautioned that the study was small, participants were given extensive talks by genetic counselors and they were followed for only one year. It is too soon to tell whether the knowledge will begin to haunt them later in life. It is also not clear whether being positive for e4 could hurt people financially. Although a law enacted last year forbids health insurers and employers to discriminate based on genetic tests, it does not apply to insurance for long-term care or disabilities.
Some study participants have already bought long-term care insurance specifically because they learned they had an e4 gene, Dr. Green said, adding that this scares long-term-care insurance companies. He said that when he mentioned those purchases in a presentation to insurance executives, whom he described as a staid group, some leapt to their feet and shouted that there would be no more long-term-care insurance if too many people with risky genes started buying policies.
So, you have this important meeting and your entire face has acne scars! Or, each time before a good occasion you need to look at yourself in the mirror and tell your self what awful pimple marks you have on your face.Well, you can't get rid of these scars in a few hours, here comes the role of makeup. With a few simple products, you can easily cover up your ugly, embarrassing scars.You can do wonders with a good concealer, a foundation and a blusher to conceal and disguise your pimple marks.If you are not sure as to how to go about it, follow these simple step to hide acne scars with makeup.
Things You Will Require
Acne skin cleanser
Skin toner
Oil free moisturizer
Mineral foundation
Oil free stick concealer
A bronzer or blush
Follow these simple steps to hide your scars neatly:
Use an acne free facial cleanser to wash your face. Make sure that your skin cleanser contains salicylic acid. A clean, neat face is definitely the best canvas for any makeup. To control the excess oil of the skin, use a skin toner. Take a cotton ball and dip it in the toner, wipe your face with this skin-toner-dipped cotton ball. Take a benzoyl peroxide containing lotion and apply it to your face. This will help in keeping bacteria away from your skin, there by keeping away from acne. Choose a light oil free moisturizer which has SPF 30 or 15. This will help keeping the pores from getting clogged. Now, select a stick concealer shade suitable for your skin tone.Get a concealer slightly lighter than your foundation. Now take the concealer. If it is a liquid concealer, place a dot on each of your dark pimple scars. Apply this to your eye circles, on your red spots and acne scars and even on acne. Also, apply it to the sides of your nose as this is the area where there is a little redness. However, make sure you do not put on a thick layer. Spread the concealer as smooth and evenly as possible.
If you have a lot pimple marks and scars go for a high coverage foundation from a good cosmetic brand. Chances are that it will be expensive but it will be worth all that. Put on the mineral powder foundation which perfectly suits your skin tone. After applying the powder evenly on your face, do some touch-ups with the help of a small brush. Tap the brush on the areas where coverage is required. Mineral powder foundation lasts all through the day and helps in controlling the oil. And, the bright side is, it will look natural and your face won't even be that shiny. Now, take the tip of a clean cosmetic sponge. Damp it a wee bit if you want a flawless blend. Now blend the concealer into the foundation on your skin. Blend till it looks natural. Now dust a bit of your pigmented face powder and you are ready to go. Use a blush or a bronzer to brighten up your face. It helps to make your skin look more smooth and natural. If you are going for some special events, you may like to add a shimmer on your cheeks, but avoid applying over the acne scars.Shimmer might settle into your acne marks and can bring more attention.
These are a few simple steps that you can follow to hide acne scars with makeup. If you are looking for more tips to remove acne scars naturally, you may also like to read an article onOlive Oil for Acne Scars.

The Portland area, which through much of 2016 led the nation in rising home prices, fell out of the top three metros in August for the first time since September 2015.
Prices in the Rose City climbed 7.2 percent compared with a year earlier, according to new numbers from the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller home price index. That's the slowest rate of home-price growth the region has seen in more than two years.
Portland was overtaken by Las Vegas, which saw prices rise 8.6 percent year-over-year, and San Diego, where prices rose 7.8 percent.
Seattle, where home prices rose 13.2 percent in the last year, leads the 20 cities included in the index.
While homes continue to appreciate in value at a rapid pace, the slowdown suggests Portland is approaching the limits of affordability.
The market remains competitive, with a slim inventory of homes for sale. But while bidding wars still break out over certain homes, they come with less frequency and frenzy than in the heated market of two years ago.
New construction has brought some relief to the rental housing market, giving first-time homebuyers more flexibility to wait.
"People aren't going to pay anything for anything," said Matthew Gardner, chief economist for Windermere Real Estate. "Just because there are so few homes on the market for sale doesn't mean people are going to pay anything it takes to get that house. They're being more choosy."
The median home price in the Portland area was $385,000 in August. It fell to $380,000 in September.

There are so many ways Twitter could end up looking like a fool if it gave up control of Vine that it would rather bury the app than sell it. There's little to gain and a lot to lose. So in the spirit of Vine, I'm going to break down the reasoning into 6-second snippets of text:
Twitter can preserve all the existing Vines so tweets and embeds with them don't go dead, whereas if someone else owned it, they might break or delete the archive
There's too much brand risk involved if someone else owned a product everyone associates with Twitter. What if the new owner resold it to PornHub, which turned Vine into a smut garden?
With Vine's traffic so low at the end, the sales process might have been too costly and distracting to Twitter to make the little cash it got back worth it
If it did sell for a low price, it would embarrass Twitter by implying it was desperate for the cash just to keep the lights on
Since Vine's account system was bootstrapped off of Twitter, selling it could give the new owner too much ability to clone Twitter's core user graph and build a competing product
If someone else bought it and made it more successful, it would demonstrate the ineptitude of the Twitter leadership and their inability to harness Vine's potential
That all makes sense.
But…
By killing off Vine instead of allowing someone else to breathe new life into it or assigning a small skeleton crew to maintain the app:
Hello,
This week we have another in depth piece written by one of our team members! But before we get into this we would like to announce that we will be closing our slacker backer campaign on BackerKit this Monday, December 6th. As mentioned in our end of October update, it's important to us that pre-alpha players have plenty of time to play and give us feedback before then, as we don't want anyone to be short changed and not get a chance to contribute before a bigger community joins in. So what does this mean for you? Make sure that all of your information is up to date (address, tiers, payment info etc..), as we will lock down backer information soon. And, this is also the last chance to get in on the pre-alpha feedback. Don't hesitate to send us an email (info@compulsiongames.com) if you have any concerns.
This week, Marc is going to talk about game metrics. It might not sound bubbly, but it is a crucial part of game development.
Hello happy few!
Marc, gameplay and AI programmer here. I have done a lot of small updates and added a few features to gameplay, sound and AI in the past few weeks, but I have been thinking that it's not that interesting to just deliver a series of bullet points. Instead, this week I wanted to talk about an important subject of game development that is becoming critical at our stage: Metrics.
We have been recruiting a few people in level design and art to help push all the content the game needs and it's becoming really necessary to make sure we're all on the same page when it comes to the game space.
Metrics are what we call the series of “regulations” we try to follow when building areas: e.g. width of doors and corridors, height of windows, etc. Defining metrics allows for better tuning of the gameplay by controlling the space, it reduces player confusion, and, very importantly for game development, reduces the amount of bugs.
For instance in We Happy Few the player can vault over fences, enter windows, and climb walls. The level designers need to know the physical dimensions that are taken into account by the gameplay code to know where to place their objects.
Some games use really strict metrics (think about the square/hexagonal grids on turn based strategy games, or the block heights in most platformers), which has a lot of advantages: it's clear to the player what he can do, it's much easier to build, and to test; and there are no edge cases that could be the source of unexpected behaviours. But when you do a (relatively) realistic open world game, you don't want to limit yourself to prefabs of a given dimension when building the world; it needs to be more organic than that, and as such, there will be problems.
So it's even more important to have a clear idea of the capability of the player and the AI characters to try to avoid using geometry that does not clearly correspond to one ability or another. It will still happen, no software as complicated as a game is bug-free, but trying to respect the metrics as much as possible helps a lot to relieve the pain.
Coming back to the vaulting & climbing example, the code needs to detect whether an object is “climbable”. It uses at least two tunable values: minimum height and maximum height. As we have two different types of climbing - a “low” climbing and a “high” climbing - there is also a cutoff (middle) height. We want to avoid obstacles with a height that is about the cutoff point, as we want to be clear which kind of climbing it is: the “low” objects should be between the minimum and middle height, and the “high” between middle and maximum. Obstacles that can be “vaulted” over need to have a maximum depth, and ideally be well below it to avoid physics collision issues. But in this case we also need a minimum depth otherwise the animation will not match nicely.
As a gameplay programmer it is my job to tell the designers the ideal dimensions they should use, so I created a technical document with all this information, and created a test map containing grey blocks representing these dimensions:
The other advantage of having test maps like that is to check the gameplay code is working as intended, i.e. it is useful for regression testing (making sure stuff that was working is still working).
Another very important aspect is metrics for AI. We all know how stupid characters can look in video games: getting stuck in walls, not knowing how to walk over a pebble on the floor, etc. One wonders why it's still happening, and in big AAA games too, now that we have a lot of experience and very sophisticated game engines. Well, the answer is that AI navigation and behaviour is a hard problem, really hard. The number of factors to take into account is crazy. When you see these bugs in games, don't believe it is because the developers are lazy (they're not) it's because they have tons of issues to fix and some just slip under the radar. You should see what it's like before they release it into the wild.
What if the AI can walk above a 30cm step but a random object ended up on its path and it's a 32cm obstacle? What if the AI capsule (its collision volume) is 70cm diameter but there is a flower pot that reduces a corridor width to 69? You end up with stuck characters, because game engines need to simplify things, and so when the AI looks like it should have the space to go somewhere its game engine physical representation may not.
To minimize all these issues the game spaces need to respect the AI constraints, which are stricter than for the player. For instance:
The other problem for AI is the generation of the navigation mesh: For a character to know how to get somewhere, she needs to have a mesh that indicates the connections between different spaces. Aka, where can you walk. This is generated with some extra tolerance/margins, relative to the geometry, to avoid AI getting into places they shouldn't (for instance stuck through walls). So, you need to add space on top of the “size” of the characters:
The green areas are where the AI would consider walking, and the green arrows on doors represent the “navigation links” that AI can use to go from one patch of the nav mesh to another.
In this example the dimensions are minimum: a corridor needs to be wide enough for two characters to go through relatively comfortably (so they don't get stuck walking in the opposite direction to each other), and a door can accommodate only one character. The wider the space, the fewer issues there will be. It's one of the main reason there are few open world games that do a lot of interiors, and when there are some they are usually very controlled environments.
You can already see how the corridors dimensions are not “realistic” (for a corridor inside a house at least):
But there is a difference between “realistic” and “believable”. Video games rarely use realistic dimensions; in my experience, when they do they shoot themselves in the foot and it leads to buggy games. Instead, we use “believable” dimensions, where everything is slightly oversized and room layouts are much more open that they would be in real life. After all, what's important is not the reality, it's the illusion of reality. If you double-check the games you're playing you will soon notice how everybody's doing it.
So that's why we need to define metrics: to simplify our life, and allow everybody on the team to be on the same page building consistent environments. I'd like to deliver a game that is bug-free, but I know that won't happen, so we aim to deliver a game with few problems, that are of little consequence when they arise.
Hope you enjoyed this update, have a great weekend!

Labour would not increase borrowing to reverse cuts in government spending, Ed Miliband has told activists as he warned the party must be "credible".
Mr Miliband said Labour must face up to the "hard reality" that it will not be able to reverse spending cuts scheduled by the coalition for 2015-16.
The party's leader told its policy forum if Labour wins the next election, it will be in "tough" economic times.
The Conservatives said Mr Miliband was "too weak" to stick to the promise.
Mr Miliband said: "Our starting point for 2015/16 is that we won't be able to reverse the cuts in day-to-day current spending unless it is fully funded from savings elsewhere or extra revenue, not from more borrowing."
'Crystal clear'
He was speaking ahead of Chancellor George Osborne's Spending Review on Wednesday, which will set out the government's spending plans for the year following the general election in 2015.
Analysis Ed Miliband is attempting a balancing act. On the one hand, he wants to enthuse his party by promising a Miliband government would introduce radical social changes; on the other, he's trying to convince voters that those changes wouldn't involve borrowing more money - at least in the first year. He wants to be seen as trustworthy and disciplined on the economy, but he risks giving some voters the impression that he's not offering much that's different from the coalition parties. His nostalgic references to the Attlee government are an attempt to show he has a bold vision. But as the general election draws closer, he'll come under increasing pressure to translate that vision into hard, detailed policies. And that's where his critics claim he'll come unstuck.
The majority of government departments are facing cuts of between 8% and 10%.
"When George Osborne stands up next week and announces his cuts..." Mr Miliband said, "we won't be able to promise now to reverse them because we've got to be absolutely crystal clear about where the money is coming from."
Hammering home his message on the economic inheritance Labour will face should it regain power after the next election, Mr Miliband described it as the "toughest for a generation".
Labour has already said it would withdraw the winter fuel allowance from the wealthiest pensioners, and would not reverse coalition cuts to child benefit for households where one person earns more than £50,000.
"People will only put their trust in us if we show we are credible," Mr Miliband said.
'Same old Labour'
But the Conservative Party chairman, Grant Shapps, dismissed the pledge, saying the opposition leader was "too weak to stick to his promises".
Image caption Ed Miliband drew comparisons with the 1945 Clement Atlee Labour government
"Ed Miliband only offers more spending, more borrowing and more debt - the same old Labour approach that got us into this mess in the first place," he said.
Mr Miliband also set out plans to penalise property developers who "sit on land" rather than building new homes.
And he drew parallels with Clement Atlee's 1945 Labour government, saying that as well as creating the NHS and building homes, it also ran budget surpluses.
"By the end of their time in government they were actually starting to pay off the war time debt. But nobody in this party and nobody in this country thinks that government didn't make a difference," he said.
In an earlier speech to Liberal Democrat activists, leader Nick Clegg warned his party it risks "irrelevance" if it retreats to the "comfort blanket of opposition".
Southampton will resist Manchester United's attempts to land Sadio Mane in January.
But there is a growing feeling at St Mary's that the exciting forward will leave at the end of the season.
Louis van Gaal wants to sign a winger in the transfer window and is set to return for Mane having failed to land him in the summer.

United boss Louis van Gaal (above) wants to sign a winger in the transfer window and is set to bid for Mane
But the Saints are determined to keep Mane until at least the end of the season; manager Ronald Koeman viewing the Senegalese as vital to his plans.
United were willing to fork out around £20million to land Mane in the summer - a similar bid will be rejected by Southampton in January.
However, an offer nearer £40million could provoke a change of heart from Southampton; but the likelihood of such a mammoth bid seems unlikely.
Southampton wants to extend Mane's contract, that expires in 2018.
United were willing to fork out around £20m to land Mane in the summer - a similar bid will be rejected
But the African has resisted the temptation of a new deal and Southampton believe signing Mane to an extension is unlikely.
That means the former Red Bull Salzburg forward's future is likely to come to a head at the end of the season, when he enters the final two years of his deal.
On September 19th, Sub Pop-signed duo Memoryhouse release their new five-track EP, entitled The Years. Yes, if you're a smart person you'll notice it's been released before, but this release is new and improved, with all tracks remastered and remixed, as well as two new added ones.
We've got a stream of it for you to listen to, and you can do that below. However, we've also got some exclusive words and thoughts on the five tracks from Denise and Evan from the band. Think of it as a directors' commentary if you will. That is below also and well, well worth a read.
Introduction: by Denise Nouvion:
As a kind of unifying aesthetic, The Years was created with many references to the author Virginia Woolf. The title of the EP quoting her 1937 novel by the same name, To the Lighthouse a 1927 novel, 'The Waves', a song on the original release, another novel written in 1931. Despite popular belief, it wasn't because of the connection to the beach (why would it be?), but to the theme of the passage of time.
For the past few years, I've been fascinated with the illusion of how time seems to overlap over a consistent space. During the recording of the EP I was able to visit a house that I once lived in, but was too young to ever form a full image of it. To my knowledge, no one had lived there in at least sixteen years, but in my own mind, it had not changed since the day I left it. Of course, it was in shambles. A country home, untouched, unentered, in almost two decades. It was like I was watching the paint peel off of the walls, the basement flooding, the wet and cold seep through the windows, and still place my memories in each room they occurred. It was an eery sensation that could only really be interpreted by someone who understood the relationship one has to a specific space and time, to their own static and often distorted memory of something. Somehow Woolf understood this very well.
'Sleep Patterns': by Denise Nouvion
I tend to view Sleep Patterns as the thesis of the album; when I visit the song, I am specifically thinking about a section of the novel “To the Lighthouse” entitled Time Passes. The chapter, devoid of people, depicts an empty home over time that is slowly degrading, much like my own. Sleep Patterns is about trying to make sense of the feeling of emptiness, of time passing. (There is even a reference to Beckett's “Waiting for Godot” here as well, for those of you who are super-nerds like Evan and I).
'Lately': by Evan Abeele
Even though the speaker in Lately spends much of the song wallowing in self pity (“shut me off, shut me up”), I tend to view the song as a somewhat positive moment of personal insight. I had gone through a rather self-destructive winter, which culminated in a hospital-stay with a bad case of pneumonia. Obviously things turned out fine, but at the time, I was flushed with an intense, all-consuming feeling that I was about to leave everything behind. This of course, brings one to think about what kind of legacy they'll leave behind, after all is said and done. Of course, I'd never really accomplished anything quite on the scale I had always hoped I would, and I was at that age where people tend to shelve those dreams in favor of good old crippling reality.
In this sense, 'Lately' acted as a totem—something to ground that nagging, tenuous desire in the back of my mind that pushed me to pursue creating something bigger than myself. I decided that rather than allow the rational part of my brain to address the long list of reasons why pursuing music was a bad, bad idea (“In this recession!?” – 2008 me) and just did it. This, in effect, was the “shut me off”; it wasn't so much a plea to pass on, but a fundamental desire to be new again, or to perhaps, make the type of choices you wouldn't have done in your old skin. 'Lately' was the first original Memoryhouse song, and the second song we ever recorded, a few months after we covered 'These Days' (which greatly influenced the lyrical ideas for 'Lately'). Both songs convey a sweet sense of nostalgia despite being grounded in present-tense anxieties.
'Quiet America': by Evan Abeele
I consider this to be a big turning point for Denise as a songwriter. I remember messing around with some piano chords in my apartment, killing time before Denise and I rehearsed for an upcoming performance. I had recorded a quick take that I had hoped to return too before getting up to make coffee for Denise and me. As I was preparing the coffee I could faintly hear Denise singing something in the other room. When I returned, 'Quiet America' was written. Here I'd spent months agonizing over the arrangement for 'Modern, Normal', and Denise, in about ten minutes, came up with the entirely of Quiet America. What struck me was how honest and vulnerable the lyrics and melody where, which again, were completely made up on the spot. We're generally a band that likes to take our time with music, which will often go through 5-10 stages of demoing and re-writes before we even start rehearsing it (understand why it took two and a half years to write our L.P?), and yet in the blink of an eye Denise came up with a truly sincere, compellingly honest song. Of course, I wasted a few weeks finding a suitable arrangement before realizing they there could be no greater service done to the track beyond letting Denise sit alone in a room with the piano and hammer it out.
'Modern, Normal': by Denise Nouvion
'Modern, Normal' refers to a poetry collection entitled Modern and Normal by a Canadian writer named Karen Solie, which focuses on the alienation associated with living in the city. While 'Sleep Patterns' conveys a more nostalgic sentiment, 'Modern, Normal' reflects an alienation affiliated with being forced into a state of constant progression; knowing that everything is fleeting, that everything will eventually be rebuilt or replaced. In a North American city things rarely reach old-age, instead they are replaced well before their time.
To the Lighthouse: by Evan Abeele
To be honest, this song has more to do with The Great Gatsby than Virginia Woolf's novel. In Gatsby, the green light at the end of pier represents a permissible, if just unreachable, dream. While we were writing this song, I was considering the caveat of products and influences being sold to us and whether we really want them. The speaker in the song experiences a sensation likened to drowning when considering all the things that are being dangled in front of them (“...houses in the sky”), always seeing time as a deadening weight against their own sense of achievement. Ultimately the speaker finds a sense of liberation in human connection where matters of time and commerce need not be considered.

Picture this; you're sitting at home minding your own business when your dog comes running through the door and bounds over onto your lap… except it's not your dog. Sure, it looks like your dog, identical in every way- but some deep instinct tells you this is an imposter. Your parents walk past and give you a smile, but your stomach lurches because in your heart you know those people aren't your family. Sounds a bit like a horror movie but some people really experience this feeling, now known as the Capgras delusion. I've even experienced it once myself, but we'll get to that later.
French psychiatrist Joseph Capgras (1873-1950) first described the disorder in 1923. In his paper Capgras wrote of a woman known as “Madame M.” who had become convinced that “doubles” had replaced the people around her, including her husband. Capgras described the syndrome as “l'illusion des sosies” or “the illusion of look-alikes”. Today we understand the Capgras delusion as a type of mental or neurological illness involving delusions about the true identity of a person, object or place. The delusion most commonly occurs in people suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, but has also been observed in those with brain injuries, dementia and diabetes. People suffering from the Capgras delusion usually begin to doubt the identity of familiar people such as their partner or family members, but occasionally these doubts extend to other things such as their pets, cars or even houses. In some extreme cases patients will even begin to doubt their own identity, convinced that they are an imposter in their own life.
So yeah, freaky stuff, and we're not even completely sure what causes it. In 1990 psychologists Hayden Ellis and Andy Young hypothesized that patients might have damage in the systems that regulate emotional reactions to familiar objects. Vilayanur S. Ramachadran (who you might remember from my split-brain article) has investigated this theory and suspects that there might be a disconnect between the area of the brain where faces/objects are visually recognized (the temporal lobes) and the area involved in producing emotions (the limbic system). Below Ramachandran explains in detail through the amazing story of Capgras sufferer David:
Nova: Season 28 Episode 13 – Secrets of the Mind (2001)
Dissociactives, Capgras and My Experience
In one 2010 study on the effects of ketamine, researchers happened to induce Capgras delusion in a healthy 26-year-old graduate student. The student participated in the study over a four-day period during which she was administered both ketamine and placebos; during this period she began to develop delusions about the identity of both the researchers and herself:
“Every time you left [the researcher] the room, I thought another person dressed in your clothes was coming back into the room . . . it wasn't scary, just another person dressed in your clothes, doing your job, but the person was a little older in age and weighed more.” She also reported: “I'd look into the mirror and think that's not me, I didn't think the image staring back at me was myself . . . even the words I was saying were not words I would normally say . . . it just wasn't me . . . it wasn't my speech, my voice, my reactions . . . I felt like a different person because I would not have reacted in the way I usually would have.”
As mentioned earlier, I myself have experienced extreme Capgras delusions while under the influence of mind-altering chemicals. It happened while experimenting with the plant Salvia divinorum, which was legal to buy and use at the time. Interestingly enough both ketamine and Salvia are dissociatives; meaning that they reduce signals between the conscious mind and other parts of the brain. My experience was extremely intense; almost instantly I became convinced that the entire universe around me was an evil imposter, out to trick me for some nefarious reason. Luckily the effects of Salvia are short lived, and wore off in 20 minutes or so. I can't even begin to imagine the sheer terror those who suffer true Capgras must experience.
In some cases, such as David's and my own, the delusions simply fade with time. Some patients required therapy, others require anti-psychotics. It's a horrifying condition that is hard to understand unless you've experienced it. How could an otherwise rational person become convinced of something so outrageous? I guess that's just the strange reality of these delicate systems we call our brains. Some poor souls out there with damaged systems are doomed to live out their lives, convinced that those closest to them have been replaced.

A packed agenda awaits the Redding City Council on Tuesday with public safety as a strong theme to the discussions.
City Attorney Barry DeWalt will ask the council to consider amending an ordinance passed earlier this month aimed at cracking down on illicit massage parlors and sex trafficking rings.
The City Council on June 7 passed the first reading on the ordinance requiring massage therapists to be fully clothed, go through background checks and operate regular business hours.
"Subsequent to the public consideration of the ordinance on that date, two concerns worthy of consideration have been brought by those who would be regulated by the ordinance," DeWalt said in a report to the council. "These concerns are significant enough to merit consideration."
Among those concerns is the ordinance's requirement for a doctor's referral to massage a client's buttocks.
"The requirement for a referral by a licensed health care practitioner for gluteal massage is not common," DeWalt said. "The vast majority of municipal ordinances on this subject do not have a health care provider referral requirement for gluteal massage."
The requirement also wouldn't help deter illicit massages and the ordinance still prohibits genital massage, DeWalt said.
The revised ordinance would also bar serving alcohol at spas. While most similar massage parlor ordinances in other areas have the same requirement, DeWalt said some allow serving alcohol at facilities that have obtained a license from the state Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control.
"It appears highly unlikely that those seeking to use alcohol as a means to encourage illicit massage practices would bother to seek approval from the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control," DeWalt said.
The council could either embrace the recommended changes, requiring a second reading of the ordinance at a later date, or reaffirm the original draft. A second reading of either version would happen July 19 and the ordinance would become city law 30 days later.
In other business, the council will:
Decide whether to establish a citizens committee to review all spending from revenue generated from a proposed half-cent sales tax increase on the November ballot.
Though the election on the tax is still more than four months away, the city would seek to establish a five-member committee to annually review all money collected from the tax and how it's spent, report back to City Council and advise where to spend the funds, City Manager Kurt Starman said in a report to the council.
Revenue from the tax wouldn't carry specific requirements on how it's to be spent, though voters in November will also be asked to approve an advisory measure directing the money to public safety.
The city estimates as much as $11 million per year from the tax was proposed largely to fund public safety improvements after the Blueprint for Public Safety study. The money, as envisioned by a team of Redding and Shasta County officials who worked on the study and how to implement its recommendations, envisions the funds will be used to build more jail space, hire more police officers and firefighters, and help establish a sobering center and mental health facility.
Respond to a Shasta County Grand Jury report that found not all police may have received crisis-intervention training beyond what's offered at academy training, that such training is important and the recommendation that the city adopt a requirement for ongoing training.
The city is set to enact such a requirement by the end of the year and is working in coordination with the Shasta County Sheriff's Office and Anderson Police Department, Redding Mayor Missy McArthur said in a proposed response to the grand jury.
Receive presentations from the Redding Police Department on problem motels in Redding, including those that receive the most calls for police service, and from the Redding Parks Department on efforts to conserve water and modernize irrigation in city parks.

The climate crisis and the deforestation crisis are deeply interlinked. Simply put, one cannot be solved without addressing the other.
Half of the world's forests have already disappeared, and only 20% of what remains are intact. The destruction of the world's forests is one of the single largest sources of carbon pollution into our atmosphere.
Forests play a critical role in mitigating climate change because they act as a carbon sink—soaking up carbon dioxide that would otherwise be free in the atmosphere and contribute to ongoing changes in climate patterns. Deforestation undermines this important carbon sink function. It is estimated that 15% of all greenhouse gas emissions are the result of deforestation.
Not only does this have huge consequences for the climate and for wildlife, it's a major human rights concern: some 1.6 billion people worldwide depend on forests for the livelihoods and benefits they offer including food, fresh water, clothing, traditional medicine and shelter.
What's driving deforestation?
The causes of deforestation vary from region to region, but the one important thing they have in common is us. Human activity is behind all major causes of forest destruction, whether it's to support the industries that make products we use every day or to make space to grow our food. Here are just some of the ways business-as-usual is contributing to deforestation.
The largest drivers of deforestation in the world today include clearance for industrial agriculture, including palm oil, soy and beef cattle. Logging for wood products, much of it illegal, and the clearance of forests for the expansion of pulp plantations are other major drivers of forest loss.
Agribusiness
Agribusiness—in which huge areas of forest are burned or cleared to make space for crops and livestock—is the number one driver of deforestation. These practices are turning some of the most biodiverse areas in the world into monocultures.
Conflict Palm Oil
Palm oil is the most widely used vegetable oil on Earth. It's in roughly half of the processed food in your local grocery. Chances are, palm oil is present in some form in nearly every room of your home. Because of this demand, palm oil is also one of the biggest threats to rainforests. And the search for cheap palm oil causes not only deforestation, but also human rights violations, massive carbon emissions, removal of Indigenous peoples from their land, child labor, and forced labor — and the industry is pushing species such as the Sumatran Orangutan to the brink of the extinction.
Read more about how conflict palm oil drives deforestation.
Soy
Between 70% to 90% of the world's soy crop is used to feed livestock. Therefore, most of the world's soybeans are consumed indirectly by humans through products like meat (chicken, pork, and beef), dairy, eggs and farmed fish. People also directly consume soybeans in tofu, soy sauce, meat substitutes and other soy products.
The increasing global demand for soy has resulted in massive deforestation in the Amazon Rainforest.
Read more about how the soy industry drives deforestation.
Beef and Cattle
Converting forest to pasture for beef cattle, largely in Latin America, is responsible for destroying 2.71 million hectares of rainforest each year—an area about the size of the state of Massachusetts—in just four countries. This is more than half of tropical deforestation in South America, and more than five times as much as any other commodity in the region.
Read more about how the beef cattle industry drives deforestation.
Illegal Logging
Illegal logging is an immense, multi-billion dollar industry threatening forests worldwide. Some research even suggests that illegal activities make up more than 10 percent of the global timber trade, representing more than $150 billion per year.
Read more about how illegal logging drives deforestation.
Pulp and Paper
Pulp from cleared forests and the pulpwood plantations that replace them is made into cheap copy paper, books, tissue, packaging, toilet paper and even luxury shopping bags. It is also used to make rayon, a fabric found in a wide array of clothing and apparel and sold to consumers in the United States, Europe and Asia.
Read more about how the pulp and paper industry drives deforestation.
Spotlight on the Leuser Ecosystem
There are three major rainforest regions on earth: The Amazon Basin in South America, the Congo in Africa and the forests of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia. Though heavily impacted by human activity, each of these areas is still home to remaining expanses of intact tropical forests, which must be protected to avert climate catastrophe.
One of these special places is the 6.5 million acre Leuser Ecosystem on the island of Sumatra. The Leuser Ecosystem is a world unto itself—a rich and verdant expanse of intact tropical lowland rainforests, cloud draped mountains and steamy peatland swamps. It is among the most ancient and biologically diverse ecosystems ever documented by science, and it is the last place on Earth where orangutans, elephants, tigers, and rhinos still roam side by side.
In addition to the endangered and iconic wildlife, millions of Acehnese people depend on the Leuser for their clean water supply and livelihoods.
The Leonardo Dicaprio Foundation is committed to working to secure the long term protections needed for this high priority conservation landscape under siege from palm oil plantation expansion, pulp and paper plantations, mining, logging, poaching and human caused fires. Please take a moment to take action with Rainforest Action Network today by adding your voice to the growing international chorus standing up to the companies that profit from the destruction of the Leuser Ecosystem.

President Donald Trump signed a directive to send Americans back to the Moon in the presence of Harrison Schmitt, one of the last Americans to walk on Earth's satellite 45 years ago (AFP Photo/SAUL LOEB)
Washington (AFP) - US President Donald Trump directed NASA on Monday to send Americans to the Moon for the first time since 1972, in order to prepare for future trips to Mars.
"This time we will not only plant our flag and leave our footprint," Trump said at a White House ceremony as he signed the new space policy directive.
"We will establish a foundation for an eventual mission to Mars and perhaps someday to many worlds beyond."
The directive calls on NASA to ramp up its efforts to send people to deep space, a policy that unites politicians on both sides of the aisle in the United States.
However, it steered clear of the most divisive and thorny issues in space exploration: budgets and timelines.
Space policy experts agree that any attempt to send people to Mars, which lies an average of 140 million miles (225 million kilometers) from Earth, would require immense technical prowess and a massive wallet.
The last time US astronauts visited the Moon was during the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 1970s.
On July 20, 1969, US astronaut Neil Armstrong became the first man to walk on the Moon.
Trump, who signed the directive in the presence of Harrison Schmitt, one of the last Americans to walk on the Moon 45 years ago, said "today, we pledge that he will not be the last."
The better known Buzz Aldrin, the second man on the Moon after Armstrong and a fervent advocate of future space missions, was also present at the ceremony but not mentioned by Trump during his speech.
Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, who heads the newly revitalized National Space Council, have previously vowed to explore the Moon again, but offered few details.
Nevertheless, the announcement was welcomed by NASA's Acting Administrator Robert Lightfoot, who said the agency "looks forward to supporting the president's directive" and "strategically aligning our work to return humans to the Moon, travel to Mars and opening the deeper solar system beyond."
- 'We're dreaming big' -
Former US president George W. Bush also pledged to send Americans to the Moon as part of the Constellation program, which ran from 2005 to 2009.
Constellation was projected to cost $100 billion, and aimed to get boots on the Moon's surface by the late 2020s.
In 2009, then president Barack Obama deemed it too costly and repetitive of missions already achieved, and canceled the program in order to focus on reaching Mars by the 2030s.
Trump vowed his new directive "will refocus the space program on human exploration and discovery," and "marks an important step in returning American astronauts to the Moon for the first time since 1972."
The goal of the new Moon missions would include "long-term exploration and use" of its surface.
"We're dreaming big," Trump said.
His administration has previously held several meetings with SpaceX boss Elon Musk and Amazon owner Jeff Bezos, who also owns Blue Origin.
A White House statement acknowledged that partnerships with other nations and private industry could well be on the cards.
The US "will work with other nations and private industry to return astronauts to the Moon, developing the technology and means for manned exploration of Mars and other destinations in our solar system," it said.
Dozens of pupils at a school in Denbigh were taken out of lessons on their first day of term after being told they were wearing incorrect uniform.
Seventy-two schoolchildren at Denbigh High School were excluded from their regular classrooms on Monday and instead put in a learning suite.
In a statement, headteacher Simeon Molloy said the school had taken action after a number of pupils had worn inappropriate trousers, skirts or footwear.
Several pupils were able to get the correct uniform during course of the day and returned to their classes.
One parent, Tracey Webster, told ITV News her daughter was among those excluded because her school trousers were "too skinny".
She said losing a day of regular lessons over school uniform was "a bit stupid", adding that while she thought highly of the school and it staffs, she felt there could have been more leniency on the issue.
"Maybe they could have attended the regular lessons, then gone home with the rule that they had to change," she said.
The USA leads the world in obesity, but it's far from the only country with a weight problem. (Photo11: Mark Lennihan, AP)
By sheer numbers, the USA handily leads the world in obesity, with 87 million of the world's 671 million obese people — 13% of the total for a country with 5% of the population, a new report says.
But we are hardly alone in our battle with bulges: Obesity is a growing problem worldwide and, by proportion, is even worse in some other countries, says the study to be published Thursday in the medical journal Lancet. Rates are rising among men, women and children, in rich countries and in poor countries, the report says.
"It's going up everywhere," says study co-author Christopher Murray, director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington-Seattle.
The new 188-country study is the most comprehensive look at obesity worldwide over the past several decades, and it paints a discouraging picture, Murray says: "The most concerning thing is that there's not a single country that has seen a decline in obesity in the past thirty years. … We hoped there would be some examples of success that you could latch onto. But there's a complete lack of success stories in bringing down obesity."
Obesity is more common in developed countries than in poorer nations, but it is rising in both, the report says. Throughout the world – including in the USA – obesity co-exists with pockets of hunger, Murray says.
Among the details:
•The number of overweight or obese individuals worldwide increased from 857 million in 1980 to 2.1 billion in 2013. That's nearly 30% of the world's population, up from about 20%.
•About one-third of adults in the USA are overweight (with a body mass index of 25 or above), and another third are obese (with a body mass index of 30 or above), as has been reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
•Obesity rates are even higher in some countries, exceeding 50% among men in Tonga and among women in Kuwait, Kiribati, Micronesia, Libya, Qatar, Samoa and Tonga. "Those are extraordinary levels," Murray says.
•About 22% of girls and 24% of boys in developed countries are overweight or obese. So are 13% of boys and girls in developing countries.
•In the USA and other developed countries, increases in obesity have slowed; in developing countries, rates are accelerating.
The new study does not examine causes but lists possibilities, including increased calorie intake, changes in diet composition, decreased physical activity and even changes in the mix of bacteria that live in human guts in the modern world.
The report notes that population-wide weight gains and income gains generally go hand in hand around the world.
That seems to support a theory, advanced by another recent study, that a major cause of obesity is that food has become cheap relative to income.
"It's not just cheaper in terms of money. It's also more accessible and more available all the time in the form of prepackaged junky food that is not necessarily conducive to health," says Roland Sturm, a senior economist at RAND and co-author of that study, published last week in CA: Cancer Journal for Clinicians.
"It's a good thing that hunger has decreased," Sturm says, "but now we have to deal with another health issue."
This month, the World Health Organization launched a commission to study rising obesity among children worldwide and suggest solutions. A report is due in early 2015.

Groupon has reportedly rejected Google's massive $6 billion acquisition offer and intends to stay independent.
The group-buying giant has been the center of the tech world this week after it was reported that Google had offered it $5.3 billion with a $700 million earnout. According to Chicago Breaking Business and Bloomberg, Groupon has decided that it is better off on its own.
To say this news comes as a bit of a shock would be an understatement. Many in the technology world believed that Groupon would accept Google's offer, making its three co-founders (CEO Andrew Mason, Eric Lefkofsky and Brad Keywell) billionaires. Groupon's board of directors met on Wednesday to decide the company's fate.
Still, there may be a reason why Groupon rejected this offer. According to AllThingsD, Groupon generates $2 billion in yearly revenue, not the $500 million figure that has been widely reported.
If this report is true, then Groupon is eyeing greener pastures and bigger numbers. Could Groupon IPO in 2011, or will another company make a play for one of the world's fastest-growing companies? We'll be watching to find out.
...Then I took 1000 years of responsibility to the knee...Yes, I paid Skyrim and yes, I know what the "knee thing" means. :ISo about the story behind this picture. I got the idea after reading the comic "My Little Pony: Friends Forever #4" where Spike and Celestia embark on a journey to find something, some things happen and there's a lesson (great synopsis, I know). The thing that stuck out to me was how Celestia was portrayed as the warrior gone bureaucrat. She had been fighting wars and intense battles for years only to retreat to a position of diplomacy and peace, quite interesting when you think about it.This is by far my favorite picture that I've drawn so far, it's soThis one started about 8 months ago, I think, and I was working on it (background especially) for quite some time before I got bored with it and moved on, I'mthankful I did! I lost interest because the picture looks bad (and it did), but since I've been drawing more I've been able to bring to a level of quality satisfaction.This one picture a week thing I'm doing is going well, I'm already working on another picture (more Fo:E stuff, so on).Seriously, I'm not asking much but if I want one picture to get attention, it's this one.Art Breakdown can be found here All Artwork Belongs to: Me,Princess Celestia and Twilight Sparkle belong to: Hasbro Inc.
If you ever wanted to see Miles Teller as a boxer with a Rhode Island accent, then this is the film for you. Granted he looks more like Jerry Ferrara, he truly does a good job in his lead role as Vinny Pazienza. His voice is very similar to the real boxer. What is good about Vinny to follow as a character is that not only “he's a fighter,” but he's not arrogant. What makes Pazienza much more of a genuine character his near death accident and his way to recovery. Most boxing films center on the boxer's win-loss-win storyline but this is a real accident that more depressing. Even after this man's near death experience and when he wakes he still wants to box. It's the scenes where Vinny is wearing the HALO attempting to train that displays Teller's dedication to the role. He got built more than you've ever seen him before. Younger does a great job capturing the fire and the spirit of Pazienza making him a likable person with Teller's performance doing him great justice.
As much as Miles Teller does a great job he is at times outshines by one of the many faces of Aaron Eckhart. When he's introduced, you have no idea it's him. It doesn't even sound like him it doesn't even look like him. This year we are getting the many faces of Aaron Eckhart from Sully and now this. He's more than your average boxing trainer with a known past but he's also his friend. He puts on this New York accent and a majority of times deliver some of the best lines. But whenever he's sharing the screen with Teller there is some amazing chemistry on screen. It may not as strong as B. Jordan and Stallone in Creed, but their relationship is very strong. One of the best scenes of the film is the recreation of Vinny's training videos with his HALO.
TEL AVIV — Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta said Monday that U.S. officials have been trying to broker the release of an accused Israeli spy held by Egypt, and he raised hopes that he could win the prisoner's release during a visit to Cairo this week.
Ilan Grapel, 27, a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen and a law student at Emory University in Atlanta, was arrested in June in Cairo on suspicion of espionage. Egyptian authorities accused him of gathering intelligence for Israel and trying to sabotage the popular revolution that toppled Egypt's longtime president, Hosni Mubarak.
Grapel and his family have said he was working as a legal aid volunteer for a refugee organization in Cairo and is innocent.
On Sunday, a day after he was visited in prison by a U.S. diplomat, the Egyptian state-run news agency MENA said the government in Cairo was considering Grapel's release. The news agency said U.S. officials had offered “more political and economic support in return,” it but did not provide details.
In a news conference Monday in Tel Aviv with Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak, Panetta declined to comment on the status of the negotiations, saying, “I'll wait until I get to Egypt.”
Panetta did not answer directly when asked to comment about a report in Dar al-Hayat, a London-based Arabic newspaper, that he would personally seek to free Grapel from custody and fly him back to the United States on his military aircraft. Panetta is scheduled to meet this week in Cairo with Field Marshal Mohammed Hussein Tantawi, the chief of Egypt's ruling military council, and other officials.
“We have made our concerns known to the Egyptians about holding that individual,” Panetta said. “We would hope that whether it happens to me or whether it happens at some point in the future that they do take steps to release that individual.”
Panetta's aides sought to play down expectations that Grapel's release was imminent. “The secretary, like other senior American officials, seeks resolution of the issue,” said George Little, Panetta's spokesman. “He's not affixing any particular timetable to that process but hopes that it draws to an end soon.”
Grapel was born in New York City. Before enrolling at Emory, he served as a paratrooper in the Israeli Defense Forces. Egyptian security officials took note of his presence in Cairo after they said he made repeated visits to Tahrir Square, the focal point of the massive demonstrations that forced Mubarak from office.
Israeli officials have insisted that Grapel is not a spy but so far have been unable to persuade Egypt to release him. Tensions between the two countries have risen in the aftermath of the Egyptian revolution.
After Grapel's arrest in June, Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said that the law student was “maybe a bit strange or irresponsible, but he has no connection to any intelligence service — not in Israel, not in the U.S., and not on Mars.”
“This is a mistake or bizarre behavior on the part of the Egyptian authorities, who have received full explanations from us,” Lieberman added.
While Panetta said he hoped that Egypt would free Grapel, the defense secretary dashed Israeli hopes that the Obama administration was having second thoughts about another spy case.
The Israeli government has been lobbying the White House for the early release of Jonathan Jay Pollard, a Navy intelligence analyst convicted of stealing secrets for Israel. He has already served 25 years and is scheduled to remain in prison until 2015.
An Israeli reporter asked Panetta if he could explain why the Obama administration has refused to release Pollard early.
“Obviously he was convicted as a spy,” Panetta replied. “For that reason the president and others have indicated the position of the United States is not to release him.”
Greek trade unions line up behind government austerity measures
By Robert Stevens
31 March 2010
The General Confederation of Greek Workers (GSEE) and the public-sector Civil Servants' Confederation (ADEDY) are working to stifle opposition to the 16 billion euro austerity package being imposed by the Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) government.
On Sunday, Greek newspapers led with headlines declaring that 300,000 public sector workers will lose their jobs, and 4,000 municipal enterprises will close as a result of last week's European Union/International Monetary Fund agreement on the Greek debt crisis.
Official unemployment has already risen to 10.3 percent, with 514,000 counted as unemployed. Unemployment among women in the fourth quarter of 2009 was almost double the rate for males. Young people aged 15 to 29 were the worst affected, with a jobless rate of 25.8 percent.
According to other estimates, including that of the GSEE, the real jobless rate is much higher, standing at about 16 percent, and is likely to hit 20 percent this year.
Since the government's enactment March 5 of its latest package of cuts, estimated at €4.8 billion, the unions have halted even the limited 24-hour strikes they previously sanctioned. The trade union federations, representing more than half of the five million-strong Greek working class, have held no further joint strikes or even a single one-day stoppage since March 11.
On March 15 some of the severest attacks in the austerity programme came into effect, including a hike in the Value Added Tax on many everyday items. The GSSE marked the day by declaring a “Consumer Day” and calling for a nationalist “Buy Greek” campaign.
Since then, workers in several sectors have struck in isolated, sporadic strikes. On March 19, civil engineers, geo-technical engineers and academics at Greece's engineering and agricultural science universities staged a four-hour strike to protest the tax increases announced by PASOK. Doctors employed at state hospitals joined the protests to demand unpaid wages.
On March 23, lawyers staged a 48-hour strike, and public employees in several sectors held a three-hour stoppage. The limited public sector workers strikes were held to protest pension cuts and other austerity measures and were not called by ADEDY. Involved in the action were postal employees, railway workers, firefighters and employees of the Hellenic Telecommunications Organization.
Such has been the impact of the union's efforts to demobilise the working class that an evening demonstration in Athens that day was attended by just a few thousand people. These were in the main trade union bureaucrats and members of the various pseudo-left coalitions. This comes a few weeks after over two million workers took part in widely supported one-day general strikes and demonstrations and protests were held in every major town and city.
The trade union bureaucracy has played the key role in enabling the government to introduce its austerity programme despite the opposition of millions of workers. The leadership of both union federations is staffed by high-ranking members of PASOK. They called the one-day general strikes in February and March in order to provide a harmless safety valve for the mounting opposition of the working class to the government. The aim was not to build up a movement of working class opposition, but to pre-empt any such movement and dissipate the anger of workers and youth.
The trade unions' support for PASOK was highlighted at the 34th congress of the GSEE, held March 18-21. On March 19, Prime Minister George Papandreou addressed the congress and announced that there would be no let-up in PASOK's austerity measures. Calling for support for his government's plan, the prime minister said, “Saving the economy and regaining credibility is a necessary precondition to create the country we deserve.”
He told the GSEE, “We were forced to take the most difficult decisions ever taken by any government in this country. We are making efforts to reverse this course…. If we do not make sacrifices today, the problem will spiral out of control.”
The assembled delegates applauded the speech, whose clear content was a declaration of war by the Greek bourgeoisie on the working class.
PASOK members made up the majority bloc within the GSEE in the elections held at the congress. The PASOK-affiliated PASKE grouping received 230 votes (48.2 percent) out of 478 votes.
DAKE—the trade union body of the right-wing opposition New Democracy Party—received 118 votes (24.69 percent), and the Workers Militant Front (PAME), affiliated with the Stalinist Communist Party of Greece, received 100 votes (20.92 percent). Despite routinely describing the GSEE as a “yellow” union and denouncing its “strike-breaking,” the Stalinists have no compunction in taking seats in the same union's leadership.
The only differences the union bureaucracies have with PASOK concern the best tactical means to impose the cuts without provoking a backlash. The unions have never raised the demand for a repudiation of the debt owed to the international banks. This year alone, the government will have to raise €53 billion ($72.4 billion). Some €20 billion of the total, for refinancing old loans, falls due between April 20 and the end of May.
Instead, Yannis Panagopoulos, the president of the GSEE, simply echoes the government's demand that Greece be able to borrow at lower interest rates. “What we ask is that Greece be able to take loans at the same interest rates as others,” he said.
Last week, GSEE spokesman and executive member Stathis Anestis told the Associated Press, “We have an appreciation of the situation the country is in…. We maintain a realistic and responsible position of readiness.”
In the name of being “realistic,” the union leaders are pledging to do nothing that will impede the implementation of the most drastic attacks on the working class.
In his speech to the GSEE Congress, ADEDY President Spyros Papaspyros presented PASOK as the helpless victim of the global economic crisis. The government “has been trapped in a path that unilaterally lays the burden on those who are not responsible for the crisis,” he said.
Whilst the unions sabotage anti-austerity struggles, the ruling elite in Greece is making plans to escalate its attacks. As the GSEE conference was underway, representatives of big business and the main political parties attended an investment conference in Athens entitled, “Greece at the Crossroads: Will Reforms Bring Competitiveness and Investment?”
The conference was sponsored by the International Herald Tribune, the sister paper of the Greek daily Kathimerini. It included keynote speeches from Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou, Alternate Foreign Minister Dimitris Droutsas, and the leader of the New Democracy, Antonis Samaras.
Explaining how the economic crisis should be used to permanently restructure social relations at the expense of the living standards of the working class, Minister of State Haris Pamboukis told the conference, “The economic crisis can be seen as a major opportunity for Greece and Europe to move forward.”
On March 22, Kathimerini published a comment imploring the trade unions to come forward as the policemen of the working class. It began by stating, “We are entering a period in which every institution, every group and every individual will have to redefine itself with regard to society as a whole. The economic crisis is the greatest catalyst for change since the military dictatorship of 1967-74 took right-wing authoritarianism to extremes, discrediting it totally as a political and social option.”
Implying that strikes and protests against austerity are similarly “extreme,” Kathimerini concluded, “The unions must now take a hard look at themselves and decide whether they will contribute toward Greece's reformation, with all that this will cost employees, or whether they will keep shouting and marching into irrelevance—at far greater cost to workers.”
Kathimerini is frankly somewhat behind the times. As is already abundantly clear, the trade unions are working to paralyze the working class and stand four-square behind Greece's ruling elite.
These recent YouGov state polls are demonstrating a consistent flaw, reporting a registered voter poll as a likely voter poll. Registered voter polls, according to Nate Silver, almost always favor Democrats. This probably represents the most likely explanation for the CBS pollster using this tactic. According to the Ohio poll released today, 994 of the 1000 registered voters they surveyed were deemed likely to vote. Included in the pool of likely voters were registered voters who deemed themselves a "maybe" as to whether they will vote or not, and also those who said they will "probably" vote. These voters combined to represent seven percent of the likely voter pool. They were all deemed likely voters. Most pollsters throw those voters out of the likely voter pool. Opening up the likely voter pool to include essentially every registered voter they talked to resulted in a +7 Democratic voter turnout assumptions in a state that is even, with a one-point Republican party ID edge as recently as 2014. Not to mention, the intensity is on Trump's side, so nothing justifies assuming such a high Democratic turnout. It was no better in the Florida poll, where they assumed only seven of the 1200 registered voters they interviewed would stay home, despite the fact that around 72 of those registered voters said they were a "maybe" or a "probably," as opposed to definitely. Again, this is not what most pollsters assume. This poll assumed Democrats would have a +2 turnout advantage on election day, a much more reasonable assumption than Ohio. That assumption is in line with recent elections. The poll also had a much more reasonable outcome, but among registered voters, not likely voters.

One of the New York Times Book Review's Ten Best Books of the Year
Winner of the James Beard Award
Author of #1 New York Times Bestsellers In Defense of Food and Food Rules
Today, buffeted by one food fad after another, America is suffering from what can only be described as a national eating disorder. Will it be fast food tonight, or something organic? Or perhaps something we grew ourselves? The question of what to have for dinner has confronted us since man discovered fire. But as Michael Pollan explains in this revolutionary book, how we answer it now, as the dawn of the twenty-first century, may determine our survival as a species. Packed with profound surprises, The Omnivore's Dilemma is changing the way Americans thing about the politics, perils, and pleasures of eating.
Coming from The Penguin Press in 2013, Michael Pollan's newest book Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation--the story of our most trusted food expert's culinary education
"Thoughtful, engrossing ... You're not likely to get a better explanation of exactly where your food comes from."
-The New York Times Book Review
"An eater's manifesto ... [Pollan's] cause is just, his thinking is clear, and his writing is compelling. Be careful of your dinner!"
-The Washington Post
"Outstanding... a wide-ranging invitation to think through the moral ramifications of our eating habits."
--The New Yorker
"If you ever thought 'what's for dinner' was a simple question, you'll change your mind after reading Pollan's searing indictment of today's food industry-and his glimpse of some inspiring alternatives.... I just loved this book so much I didn't want it to end."
-The Seattle Times
Cultural and economic boycotts helped isolate white-supremacist South Africa and encouraged a shift to multi-racial democracy — and a similar strategy has ratcheted up pressure on Israel to reach a peace deal with Palestinians — but there is a new pushback against that strategy, notes Lawrence Davidson.
By Lawrence Davidson
There is a new British organization called Culture for Coexistence with the aim of ending the cultural boycott of Israel, which has been relatively effective in raising public awareness of oppressive Zionist policies, and replace it with “open dialogue” and “cultural engagement.“ A “galaxy of 150 British artists and authors” signed an open letter published in the Guardian newspaper on Oct. 22 announcing the group's position:
“Cultural boycotts singling out Israel are divisive and discriminatory and will not further peace,” while “open dialogue and interaction promote greater understanding and mutual acceptance and it is through such understanding and acceptance that movement can be made towards a resolution of the conflict.”
While concepts such as open dialogue and cultural interaction are, in principle, hard to disagree with, their efficacy as agents of conflict resolution has to be judged within a historical context. In other words, such approaches are effective when circumstances dictate that all parties seriously dialogue and interact meaningfully – in a manner that actually promotes “mutual acceptance.”
Is this the case when it comes to Israel? The burden of proof here is on Culture for Coexistence because they are the ones asking the Palestinians and their supporters to put aside a strategy (boycott) that is actually putting pressure on Israel to negotiate seriously.
The Culture for Coexistence signatories do not address this question of efficacy. Instead they make the simple assertion that cultural boycotts are bad and won't help resolve the conflict while cultural interaction is good and will work to that end. How do they know this? Without evidence of its workability, such an assertion is merely an idealization of cultural engagement that ignores that pursuit's historical futility during a near century long conflict.
Do Israeli Leaders Want a Just Peace?
Cultural interaction with Israel went on for decades before the boycott effort got going. It had no impact on the issue of conflict resolution. Such cultural activity certainly did not change the fact that Israel's leaders have never shown interest in negotiating a resolution with the Palestinians except solely on Israeli terms.
And, that stubbornness is a major part of the reason why peace talks (and also the Oslo agreements) never worked. There is a whole set of histories, written by Israelis and based on archival research that support the claim that Israel has not sought a just resolution to the conflict. Here I would recommend the Culture for Coexistence signatories read the books of the Israeli historian Ilan Pappe .
Given this historical Zionist attitude, what sort of “greater understanding and mutual acceptance” does Culture and Coexistence expect to accomplish by swapping the boycott for “cultural engagement”? It is a question the signatories of the open letter might address to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who just recently was reported to have proclaimed that Israel will control all Palestinian land indefinitely.
The “galaxy of British artists and authors” aligned with Culture for Coexistence seems oblivious to all these contextual issues. Of course, there is a good chance that some of them are more interested in undermining the boycott of Israel than in the alleged promotion of peace through “cultural engagement.”
As the Guardian article discussing the group notes, “Some of the network's supporters are closely aligned with Israel,” including individuals associated with Conservative Friends of Israel and Labour Friends of Israel.
Does Cultural Contact Lead to Peace?
There is another, more generic misunderstanding exhibited in the group's statement. It is found in the letter's closing assertion that “cultural engagement builds bridges, nurtures freedom and positive movement for change” – a position reiterated when Loraine da Costa, chairperson of the new organization, told the Guardian that “culture has a unique ability to bring people together and bridge division.”
No matter how you want to define culture, high or low, there is no evidence for this position except on the level of individuals or small groups. On the level of larger or whole populations, the assertion that “cultural engagement builds bridges” is another naive idealization that is belied by historical practice. Historically, culture has always divided people (both across borders and across classes) and acted as a barrier to understanding. At a popular level, most people are uninterested in, or suspicious of, foreign cultures and are unwilling to try to pursue cultural interaction.
Israel is a very good example of this cultural xenophobia. Historically, the European Jews who established the state despised Arab culture. They tried to eradicate it among the Mizrahi Jews who came to Israel from Arab lands. This intra-Jewish Israeli prejudice is still a problem today. What aspects of Arab culture (mostly having to do with cuisine) Israeli Jews are attracted to they try to repackage as “Israeli.”
There are two final considerations here: First is the need to be serious and clear in the use of language. One can, of course, say “culture has a unique ability to bring people together” but is this a statement that has any real meaning or is it just a platitude?
And second: If you are going to give advice about a century-old conflict you should know enough about its history to be sensible in your offering. Thus, in this case, if you know that high or low cultural intercourse with Israel (and, as suggested above, there has been plenty of it since the founding of the state in 1948), has actually improved the prospects for Israeli-Palestinian peace, you should lay out the evidence. However, if one is just offering a banal cliche, well, only the ignorant can take that seriously.
Those who first proposed the cultural boycott did not do it out of some anti-Semitic dislike for Israeli artworks, music, literature or theater. They did it because cultural interaction with Israel had not only failed to promote an equitable peace, but in fact camouflaged the policies of a nation-state that practices ethnic cleansing and other destructive policies against non-Jews.
The logical conclusion was drawn that if you want to pressure the Israelis to change their ways, you withdraw from cultural contact and make any reconnection a condition of their getting serious about conflict resolution.
How is it that the 150 artists and authors who signed the Culture for Coexistence open letter do not know the relevant facts? Setting aside the confirmed Zionists, whose ulterior motive is pretty clear, do these people take this stand because it “feels right” – that is, because they believe cultural interaction ought to, or even must, promote conflict resolution? Alas, this is wishful thinking and, taking history seriously, Palestine may go extinct before such an approach actually helps lead to a just peace.
A little-noticed tidbit in Saturday's Washington Post is sure to raise eyebrows among liberal supporters of a gorvernment-run healthcare plan: the plan is likely to be administered by a private insurance company, the very companies that progressive activists are trying to unseat.
The public-option debate is frustrating some Democrats, who have come to believe that a government-run plan is neither as radical as its conservative critics have portrayed, nor as important as its liberal supporters contend. Any public plan is likely to have a relatively narrow scope, as it would be offered only to people who don't have access to coverage through an employer. The public option would effectively be just another insurance plan offered on the open market. It would likely be administered by a private insurance provider, charging premiums and copayments like any other policy. In an early estimate of the House bill, the Congressional Budget Office forecast that fewer than 12 million people would buy insurance through the government plan.
Supporters of the public plan contend that it will help to trim healthcare costs, as a public insurer wouldn't need to generate profits. Health insurance companies typically earn profits of around two to four percent, which amounts to billions of dollars for some firms.
A physicians' group notes that the bills authorize the government to contract with “corporations” that will create a “public option.”
“Both bills authorize the Secretary to contract with corporations to conduct unspecified activities that will somehow lead to the creation of an “option” program throughout the country,” Kip Sullivan at Physicians for a National Health Program writes.
He continues:
Advocates of a “public option” claim that the “option” will look like Medicare. They say this about the “option” in both bills that have been introduced to date – the House “reform” bill, HR 3200, and the bill written by the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) committee. But this statement is not true. Medicare is larger than any private insurance company; the “option” in both bills will be small. The traditional Medicare program is a single program with uniform benefits; the “option” in both bills will be a balkanized program that may not be available in all parts of the country. Medicare is administered by public employees; the “options” in both bills will be administered by private-sector corporations, some or all of which will be insurance companies. The “option” in neither bill resembles Medicare…. As the preceding rather convoluted description of MACs and contracting administrators suggests, neither the HELP bill nor HR 3200 makes it easy for readers to grasp that corporations, not public employees, will create, and probably run, the “option” program. Neither bill comes right out and says, “The Secretary shall hire private-sector corporations to create and run as much health insurance companies as is necessary to make health insurance available for sale to the non-elderly in each health insurance market in America.” Nor is that fact being ballyhooed by the bills' authors and proponents. But it's an important feature for “option” supporters to understand because it undermines the claim “option” advocates make over and over that the “option” will look like Medicare.
The Senate Health Committee bill includes a public option; the Senate Finance Committee bill does not. Senate Democrats are pushing to include an “opt-out” or “trigger” public health option in their final bill, which would unsettle some Democratic moderates but not to the point where they'd join a Republican filibuster.
In the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is whipping votes for a “robust” public option, to give negotiators between the two chambers leverage in order to have some form of the public option be included in a final bill.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today in the presence of these readers, to join Burger King and Burger-King in matrimony. Burger King Brand proposed on Monday, and Joel Burger and Ashley King accepted.
The company is paying the expenses and providing gifts for the July 17 wedding of Joel and Ashley in Jacksonville, aka the Burger-King nuptials.
Friday's column was about how Joel and Ashley have been Burger-King since they were in the fifth grade together in New Berlin. When they announced their engagement this spring, they had their picture taken next to the BK restaurant logo in Springfield. They flipped their names so that Joel's would be first in the announcement. Normally the woman's name is first. But then it wouldn't have been Burger-King, would it?
Friday's column was pretty well-read locally. And then it went viral. The New York Daily News posted it. The Huffington Post reposted it. Soon I was hearing from BuzzFeed, the Daily Mail in the U.K. and a producer from Australia's #1 Radio Show, which happens to be The Kyle and Jackie O Show. (But, then, you knew that.)
They all wanted to contact Joel and Ashley. The media crush is threatening to become overwhelming. It will only gain momentum now that Burger King is on board and will be promoting the Burger King, Burger-King connection nationally. I hope it stays fun for Joel and Ashley.
"Oh my God, it's going to be crazy," Ashley said. She knew over the weekend that the column had gone viral. She said, sure, they'll talk with Australia's number one radio show. I expect more will be calling.
> UPDATE (April 8, 10:15 a.m.): Burger King has released a video about the couple on YouTube:
This all began innocently enough with SJ-R business editor Tim Landis. He spotted the unique Burger-King engagement announcement and photograph in the Chatham Clarion. He put it on my desk in case I thought it could make a column. For my part, all I had to do was recognize it as one.
Since Ashley had already tried to reach out to the Burger King company, but unsuccessfully, I sent an email to the company's media relations representative. I soon heard from Alison Brod Public Relations in New York City, the company that has the Burger King account. I sent them an email about the wedding, they contacted the company, and Burger King took it from there.
Which culminated Monday afternoon when Joel and Ashley got the big news from Burger King via Skype. The connection was between New Berlin and New York City and we can't say that very often, can we? Ashley's dad, Vince King, was there to help celebrate, as was Joel's mom, Cindy Burger.
"When we heard about the happy, Burger-King couple, we felt an overwhelming urge to celebrate their upcoming marriage," said Eric Hirschhorn, Burger King Brand spokesman. "On so many levels it felt like fate; they found each other and their story found us."
The company, as we say in the newspaper business "buried the lede" when giving Joel and Ashley the news Monday afternoon. Burger King didn't tell them they were picking up the tab for the wedding until near the end. It was a huge surprise.
"We were just blown away," Joel said.
"We were shaking," Ashley added.
Shaking and blown away and crying, but in a good way.
Since Friday's column described how the Burger-King name was given Joel and Ashley by a motivational speaker who used yo-yos at a fifth-grade assembly, the Burger King company is providing personalized yo-yos to the wedding guests. The company also is providing gift bags, Mason Jars and Burger King crowns, all personalized for Joel and Ashley's wedding.
But paying for the entire thing is huge.
"We knew deep in our hearts that we wanted to honor the union of Mr. Burger and Ms. King," says Hirschhorn. "In an unforgettable way. Everyone at Burger King Brand agreed and, as Dave Bakke said, we knew we wanted to create a 'whopper of a wedding' that's uniquely their own.
"And now we hope we've swept them off their feet. All we ask in return is that they live happily ever after."
And that's the way we like it: Well done.

All it took was one glance last week to light up Twitter. Tormund Giantsbane crushing on Brienne of Tarth? It's the match-up we never knew we wanted, until we did. And in Sunday's “The Door,” the wildling's desperately unabashed interest in the warrior continued until Brienne was visibly rolling her eyes.
One fan of the storyline is Brienne actress Gwendoline Christie, who says she could barely keep a straight face during Tormund actor Kristofer Hivju's advances.
“First of all, Kristofer is absolutely hilarious,” she says. “I don't think I've been in a scene on Game of Thrones when it's been everything I can do to stop myself from laughing. The way he was behaving toward me was just extraordinary.”
The actress also appreciated Tormund's giant crush from an acting vantage point, as well. “I enjoyed Brienne being put in that position of feeling awkward and not wanting the attention,” she says. “That was a very fun thing to play. He's a wildling, he's very sensual and animal-like and very forthright with his emotions and feelings — which is really the opposite of [Brienne]. I enjoyed trying to navigate that and the beauty of her embarrassment. She can totally deal with the situation, and with him, but she's just so embarrassed about it.”
So much happened in last night's #GameofThrones but Tormund's crush on Brienne is still the best. pic.twitter.com/ZX6Hreuys9 — Matt Baumann (@Matt_bau) May 23, 2016
Christie also revealed that one Brienne-Tormund scene actually cut from the show: a moment showed Sansa “going Mean Girls” on Brienne and teasing her about Tormund's interest, “and you had the powerful warrior who's totally flustered.” We hope that one ends up as a deleted scene on the season 6 home release.

Streets in five San Diego neighborhoods will be closed to cars Sunday for San Diego's first CicloSDias.
Special Feature Speak City Heights Speak City Heights is a media collaborative aimed at amplifying the voices of residents in one of San Diego's most diverse neighborhoods. (Read more)
A 5.2-mile-long block party will close streets to vehicle traffic in five San Diego neighborhoods Sunday for the city's very first CicloSDias.
"It's a bicycling-, walking-, strolling-, rolling-, connect-with-your-community event," said Andy Hanshaw, executive director of the San Diego County Bicycle Coalition.
Hanshaw said San Diego is joining an open streets movement with Sunday's event. CicloSDias is modeled after similar events in Bogotá and Los Angeles. The goal is to reclaim streets for pedestrians, bicyclists, skateboarders — anyone but drivers.
Hanshaw said CicloSDias has been in the making for about four years. It gained momentum during the 2012 mayoral campaign, when candidates jockeyed for support from San Diego's bike community and smart growth advocates.
"I think the timing was right," Hanshaw said. "I think people are wanting to have more of these types of environments and opportunities to enjoy their streets without worrying about the stress of traffic."
Street access will be closed to cars from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on 30th Street from Grant Hill, through Golden Hill and South Park, to North Park. Landis and Wightman streets heading into City Heights will also be open to pedestrians.
Expect neighborhood booths, music, Zumba classes and a lot of bikes.
Hanshaw said organizers are already thinking about hosting another CicloSDias. Permits, equipment and marketing for the event cost $60,000 to $80,000. This year's event was funded through private donations, Hanshaw said. Organizers are still accepting donations through the crowd-funding site Fundly.com.

SAN DIEGO — San Diego Zoo Safari Park officials are searching the for an exotic bird that flew away Monday afternoon.
The young painted stork was being trained for the free-flight bird program. Trainers were flying the stork over the Park when the inexperienced bird got caught in a wind gust and disappeared from sight.
The zoo's animal care staff were on the hunt for the painted stork, and area bird experts, such as the Audubon Society, have been alerted, zoo spokeswoman Christina Simmons said.
The website The Big Zoo describes the species as tall and slender, standing about 3 feet tall, and mostly white in color, with black and white markings on its wing and chest feathers, with light pink on its lower back and legs. The bird's bill is long, yellowish and slightly curved toward the end.
According to Bird Life International, painted storks are frequently found in India, Sri Lanka and Cambodia, but are disappearing from other southern Asian countries due to hunting, wetland drainage and pollution. The organization said the species is classified as near-threatened.
Painted storks feed on fish and, sometimes, frogs, in shallow waters.
Simmons said it's uncertain how far the painted stork could have flown because its usual range might not apply outside its normal habitat.
Animal care staff are asking people not approach the stork, but to report it, if they sight the bird. Call (619) 318-3348 or e-mail publicrelations@sandiegozoo.org
Groups of protestors confronted lines of police officers along Crenshaw Boulevard in the southwestern LA suburb of Crenshaw.
The protesters, some of them waving signs and riding bicycles, kicked in storefronts and swarmed oncoming vehicles, according to news footage televised on KCAL-TV Channel 9.
There were reports of a building on fire and that a Wal-Mart had been broken into.
The LA Times said the LAPD had declared a tactical alert about 9pm, which means that off-duty officers can be kept on duty when their shifts end and may respond only to high-priority calls. Shortly later, the police force designated the protest an "unlawful assembly" meaning they could arrest anyone involved.
Footage of the area taken from helicopters showed young protesters facing off with officers wearing helmets and holding batons along Crenshaw Boulevard, a major thoroughfare.

LAPD Lt. Andy Neiman told the news station that some people were engaging in "lawless activity" and that one person had been arrested. "We got a tough job on our hands tonight," he said.
Lt Neiman asked parents to send text messages to their children that might be involved in the unrest asking them to go home, otherwise "things will not end well".

He said there had been scuffles, which appeared to be among people within the group, and there had also been rubbish bins set on fire and cars climbed on as well as other low level criminality.
He said: "It's hard to tell if there is any leader here, it just seems to be lawless activity. People jumping on cars can be a very frightening experience for any civilian driving through the city, and you never know how they're going to react."
He added: "It's almost like herding kittens and cats, keeping a large group running in various directions with reports of crime along the way."

Mr Zimmerman, 29, was acquitted on Saturday in Florida of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the 2012 shooting death of Trayvon, 17.
The verdict has sparked protests across the county, despite calls from community leaders for calm.

“BITCOIN isn't going away,” confidently declares Danny Brewster, seated in a swivel chair in his Nicosia office.
Well, he would say that wouldn't he? Then again, the young CEO of Neo & Bee has a lot riding on the project. Brewster has invested €6m of his own money into Neo& Bee, his brainchild. Whatever you may think about the bitcoin currency, it's hard to shake off the feeling that Brewster and the people behind him have done their homework. Time will tell, but this doesn't sound like a flash in the pan.
Tomorrow bitcoin marketers Neo& Bee open for business, the culmination of several months of preparations. They will initially be offering customers brand bitcoin wallets.
Explains Brewster: “Neo and Bee are two separate brands that fall under the same roof. Neo is a physical portal for people to get educated on the bitcoin technology. They can also buy bitcoins directly from us, but we won't sell to them until we know they got the right understanding of the technology.”
That's the Neo part. Coming soon is Bee, a payment network for merchants. In the future the company will be providing merchants with the physical hardware (POS terminals), or an online portal to accept payments in bitcoin.
And once merchants accept a payment in bitcoin, Neo & Bee will offer them the option of buying back those bitcoins from them instantly, so the merchants aren't exposed to the current market volatility of the crypto currency.
“It's not going to be a bank,” says Brewster. “A bank does lending. All we are is an exchange and a hosted wallet provider. We can't put our hands into customers' wallets and take that money and gamble and create more money, like a bank does.
“If a customer has a wallet with us, and they buy bitcoins they deposit with themselves. And even if we don't exist they can still access and use those bitcoins. This is the first real alternative to banking. The beauty of bitcoin is that you become your own bank.”
What's bitcoin? It's a peer-to-peer digital currency that functions without a central authority. The crypto-currency was first introduced in January 2009 by a person (or persons, no one knows for sure) going by the handle ‘Satoshi Nakamoto'.
The digital currency is stored in anonymous “electronic wallets,” or code, and can travel from one wallet to another by means of an online peer-to-peer network transaction. Think BitTorrent, but with money.
Bitcoin uses a shared transaction database called the “block chain”, or log, to achieve distributed consensus about coin ownership. Once accepted, transactions can't be undone or denied. And it's open source.
Now a lot has been said about bitcoin – it's just another bubble that will pop, etc. Yet even the most gung-ho advocate will tell you not to put all your wealth into this digital currency.
Brewster takes a similar line: “If an individual decides for themselves to buy them, we will facilitate that. But you'll never find me or anyone else says ‘go out and buy bitcoin.”
What with the ‘Silk Road' incident, Brewster freely concedes that bitcoin is susceptible to money laundering.
“But contrary to what has been written about bitcoin, I don't know any smart criminal that would use a system that keeps a log, a record that can never be changed and in 10 years' time can come back and bite you.
“So we at Neo need to know who you are. We check that against PEPs (Politically Exposed Persons) lists and sanctions lists. It's not just a case of any Tom, Dick or Harry walking in to open a wallet.”
How will Neo & Bee make their money?
“A lot is made through our own reserves in bitcoin. When we sell bitcoins we have our own index price, so we'll make on that spread. Plus we have our own trading desk. Also, when a merchant accepts a payment we'll buy the bitcoins off them instantly…essentially we're going long on bitcoin. We believe in it.
“Whereas if we were to hold everything in euros, we know that the European Central Bank can go and press ‘Print' a few more times.”
Neo & Bee is part of LMB subsidiaries, a UK-based company. So their main profits aren't made in Cyprus, but rather around the world through their other operations, such as the Neo Easy Coin online platform.
At this point let's explain the difference between lowercase bitcoin and uppercase Bitcoin. The former is the digital currency. It's just one application of Bitcoin, which encompasses the broader technology.
‘Satoshi Nakamoto' designed the original Bitcoin protocol in 2008 and launched the network in 2009.Without getting too techie, the protocol for the first time satisfactorily solved the distributed consensus problem – how to get thousands of different computer systems to agree to a single dataset and timeline. It was a huge leap in computer science.
That's where it gets exciting. Going forward, and as the Bitcoin protocol is tweaked, people will be able to use it for such things as legal contracts, derivatives and so on. The possibilities are virtually endless.
And that's what Neo & Bee are eventually looking to tap into. At some point, they'd like to offer derivatives, futures and stock options. Right now bitcoin is not considered a financial instrument here, and the company have been talking to the Securities and Exchange Commission in the hopes of changing that.
Should they succeed, Cyprus could well become the first regulated bitcoin derivatives market in the world; but this needs to be done fast, because others are already working on the idea.
Brewster says he's already in talks with investors for hundreds of millions to come into the country. His outfit, he claims, can bring an extra €200m into the economy within the first year, just from their other operations.
The aim is to set Cyprus up as an “incubator” for bitcoin business, enabling entrepreneurs to come here, creating jobs and cross-selling opportunities.
“The first place that forms a concise set of rules will enable so much movement into the economy to provide the right environment. Right now everything is up in the air. A lot of people are expecting to move to the best jurisdiction to set up shop.”
If that happens, Brewster likens this Mediterranean island to a potential Silicon Valley for a Bitcoin industry.
And Neo & Bee aren't skimping on software development either. So far they've spent well over €5m, and have cobbled together a team of 25 developers, including some of the brightest computer science minds in the world. Tellingly, they've engaged leading Bitcoin evangelist and entrepreneur Andreas Antonopoulos as a distributed systems consultant.
There appears to be a lot more going on here than just bitcoin the currency, which may or may not turn out to be just another Ponzi scheme. Like it or not, Bitcoin with a capital ‘B' is here to stay.
Last post I briefly mentioned that Python Requests went v1.0. This involved a huge code refactor and a few changes in the API.
One of these changes was the inclusion of something Kenneth (and others) have been thinking about for a while as part of the future of Python HTTP ‘project'. This something is the ‘Transport Adapter'. From Kenneth's blog post:
Transport adapters will provide a mechanism to define interaction methods for an “HTTP” service. They will allow you to fully mock a web service to fit your needs.
Well, v1.0 brought the inclusion of Transport Adapters into Requests. This is a shiny new feature, and I wanted to take some time to explore it. The best way to do that is to go ahead and write an adapter! As well as providing a useful bit of experience for me, I would be able to document the process and thereby provide a bit of a tutorial for anyone who wants to follow in my footsteps.
But what to write an adapter for? I wanted to see how far Kenneth's goal of Transport Adapters could be stretched, so I decided to implement a transport adapter not just for a specific web service, but for a whole new protocol: FTP.
Come with me, as I show you how to write an adapter through the lens of my own.
For those who just want to see my work, you can see the finished product here.
Getting Started
The first thing to do is to work out how you implement such a thing! A quick look at the Requests code should tell you the answer. A Transport Adapter should be a subclass of requests.adapters.BaseAdapter , and should implement three methods: __init__() , send() and close() . Let's take a closer look at these.
First, __init__() . This will be called only once, when your adapter is instantiated. This means that any state that should be common to all requests belongs here. As an example, Requests' included HTTP Transport Adapter creates a urllib3 ConnectionPool object here. In my case, all I wanted to do was allow multiple FTP verbs, so I created an ad-hoc function table keyed off the names of the verbs. Pretty hacky, but fast.
Second, close() . This is also only called once, at the exact opposite moment to __init__() . Any state you set up in init() should be torn down here. Again, for Requests' built-in adapters, this means tearing down their ConnectionPool s. For me, nothing.
Finally, send() . This is where the meat of your functionality will occur, so let's take some time over it.
Send
Glancing through the Requests code reveals that to send() function must, at minimum, accept a single PreparedRequest object and a list of kwargs , and return a Response object. This is where I began to run into trouble.
By default, the PreparedRequest object is very HTTP oriented. This is by design, and any transport adapter you write is likely to be happy with that. However, for me it was mildly problematic. In particular, the PreparedRequest contains almost none of the information on the standard Request object. It carries a url , a method , its headers , its body and its hooks . That's it.
You get a little more detail from the kwargs . You get the values of the following Requests fields: stream , timeout , verify , cert and proxies . Mostly this stuff is of minimal value, and I ended up ignoring it (though I may go back and use timeout .)
If you're using HTTP, I suspect you can mostly get by with this. Byte-level manipulation of the body is possible (and encouraged), so you can permute the Request into whatever form is expected by your web service.
For FTP, this was harder. Mostly I wasn't interested in the data here, except when running an FTP STOR. Here, I wanted to piggyback on Requests' current file upload syntax. However, by the time I get hold of the Prepared Request , the file has been encoded as multipart form-data. My current solution is to use the Python CGI module to decode the data again. This is shoddy, and far and away the worst part of the code I've written.
Returning to your code, this function has all of the responsibility for both sending the data out and parsing it back into a useful form for Requests. You may find, as I did, that you actually want to split this out into several functions or methods.
When building a response, it's particularly instructive to take a look at the function build_response in requests.adapters . This gives you an idea of the kinds of fields Requests expects to be filled in. I ended up basing my equivalent function very heavily on this.
Surprises
There are a few surprises to be found. The first is that response.content and response.text only work if you provide a file-like object as r.raw . I ended up using BytesIO for this, which is a pain. If you're using urllib3 this should be easy for you, but it's worth knowing.
Also bear in mind that you may have to jump through some hoops to get very Requests-like behaviour. The special case of Basic Auth as a naked tuple is handled above the PreparedRequest layer, so if you want to piggyback on it (like I did) be prepared to mess about with headers to get it to work.
Plugging it in
Once you've got a transport adapter, all you need to do is plug it in. To do this, use the mount method of the Session object:
s = requests . Session () s . mount ( 'http://randomservice' , YourAdapter ())
In my case, this was actually
s = requests . Session () s . mount ( 'ftp://' , FTPAdapter ())
Any subsequent Request through that session will use your transport adapter if the URL prefix matches!
Going Deep
For my stuff, though, I wanted to go a bit further. In particular, since I was adding new verbs (LIST, STOR, RETR and NLST), I wanted to make the utility methods available: the equivalents of Session.get() and Session.post() . To do this required that I monkeypatch the Session object.
I didn't want to do this on import, though: the end user should have the choice about whether they actually want me to mangle the Session object or not. For this reason, I export a function: monkeypatch_session() . This function adds four utility functions to the Session object and overrides the constructor so that the FTPAdapter is automatically mounted.
All Together Now!
When you put that all together, you get my shiny new library. You can get this from the cheeseshop: just run pip install requests-ftp . Once you've got it, you can go straight into using it! For example, you can list the files at the root of the directory and then get one:
import requests_ftp as ftp ftp . monkeypatch_session () with requests . Session () as s : r = s . list ( 'ftp://127.0.0.1/' , auth = ( 'username' , 'password' )) file = r . content . split ( '
' )[ 0 ] r = s . retr ( 'ftp://127.0.0.1/' + file , auth = ( 'username' , 'password' )) file = open ( 'temp.txt' , 'wb' ) file . write ( r . content )
Caveats
There are lots of things my code doesn't do. A list can be found on the readme. If you feel like you want to use it anyway, feel free! I'd also welcome contributions to resolve some of its more significant problems (like the fact it isn't tested).
Summing Up
Writing a transport adapter for HTTP is very easy, especially as the in-built Requests ones have very clean and comprehensible code. Writing them for new protocols is harder.
This is because Requests is laser-focused on HTTP, as it should be. However, you can take my word for it: it is definitely possible to implement some other protocols as Transport Adapters in Requests. Whether you want to be entirely up to you, of course.
ISTANBUL, Turkey — I heard the news: a court ruled that the Canadian government has the right to deny thousands of Canadian expats their votes. Remarkable, isn't it? Not the news itself. It's remarkable that I, an expat, manage to get any news from home at all. Certainly the government believes that citizens are cut off from issues of national importance while they remain suspended in that dark and mysterious netherverse known as “abroad.”
Fortunately, my carrier pigeon is especially well-trained and my local telegraph operator is perfectly fluent in Morse code. So while I may soon be denied a vote in Canada (you do still spell it C-A-N-A-D-A, don't you?), I can make my views on that fact known through one of the country's newspapers, which generously allows even pseudo-nationals to weigh in. From what I've been able to make out over short wave radio and from the odd piece of post, the government's most basic concern is this: if you aren't in your country then you aren't connected to your country.
But we might be more concerned about the Canadian government's connection to the rest of the world than with Canadian expats' connections to Canada. Maybe out of ignorance, maybe out of bad faith, the government argued that a five-year limit on voting rights for expats is in line with international norms. In other words, the government grudgingly acknowledged that Canada's relationship to the world matters in the same moment that it broadcasted a spectacular ignorance of the world.
Germany allows even Germans who've never lived in Germany to vote; they need only spend a few months eating bratwurst sometime between their 14th birthday and the last 25 years to have some stake in Germany's affairs. France now allows overseas French citizens to elect representatives in one of the Assemblée Nationale's 11 roughly continent-sized overseas districts; expats, this approach implies, aren't “affected less” by French laws, but affected in particular ways that deserve a voice. Italy's Chamber of Deputies and Senate takes a similar approach. As does Portugal's Assembly of the Republic. The United Kingdom did implement its own five-year limit in 1985, but computers looked like microwaves then and overseas calls cost money instead of bandwidth; the UK's limit is now 15 years, and even that will be abolished if voting rights groups have their way.
Beyond Europe, the United States never puts American expats' voting rights on the clock; this, after all, is the country that won't tolerate taxation without representation. Australia asks that citizens return to Australia once within their first six years abroad, and after that period to annually declare that “at some point” they'll return to Australia; it's an annoying bureaucratic charade, but many disenfranchised Canadian expats would make that declaration in exchange for a ballot. New Zealand has its own silly limit, but you can get around that remarkably easily too: you never have to move back — just stop in and say hi once every three years. Even that gaping loophole is too restrictive for the one million New Zealander expats, and they've formed The Expatriate Party of New Zealand.
So the Canadian government has its argument precisely backwards: the “new global norm,” according to many citizenship scholars, is to grant voting rights to citizens overseas. True, expat voting rights are often time-limited, but Canada's limits are unreasonably restrictive compared to those of many established democracies and to the direction that many others appear headed.
And global norms matter, as the government concedes. To bastardize Goethe: those who know nothing of foreign nations know nothing of their own. By keeping Canada in touch with the world, Canadian expats keep Canada in touch with itself. This court decision demonstrates why our country needs more citizens who book one-way plane tickets out it. Just as long as they write home once in a while.

Tuesday was a historic night for the Milwaukee Bucks. Only two teams in the history of the NBA can say they played someone who achieved their 41st triple-double in a single season. Bucks fans everywhere should be proud. And losing by 31 points makes the celebrations for the Bucks even better. I guess Oklahoma fans should be excited too. I mean, it's not everyday fans get to see Norris Cole score two points in a game. Simply incredible. But in all reality, Russell Westbrook made history Tuesday night by tying Oscar Robertson for most triple-doubles in a single season.
This is it. This proves what I've been saying for this entire season. Russell Westbrook is absolutely not human. Averaging a triple-double and leading the league in scoring is just a taste of what he has done for the Thunder franchise. Westbrook is out on the court every night playing until and he physically cannot play anymore. The society of Westbrook's home planet must be awesome. Things must be getting done on Westbrook World. Also, don't even get me started on how fashionable everyone would be.
Westbrook earned his 41st triple-double scoring 12 points, dishing out 13 dimes and grabbing 13 boards. But Westbrook couldn't have made it this far if it were not for his teammates. Every night it seems a different player steps up for the Thunder. Tuesday night saw some great contributions off the bench from the Thunder. Enes Kanter, everyone's beloved sixth man, finished the night with 17 points off six of eight shooting. Domantas Sabonis finished with 11 off three of six. There's nothing better than knowing the Thunder has some young players who could legitimately make a difference out on the court. Like Nick Collison. He's young, right? Nick, you don't look a day over 40.
The Greek Freak and his squad put up a good fight, but there was no stopping Westbrook and the Thunder on a night like this. The Thunder win 110 – 79.

Weekend PC Game Deals is where the hottest gaming deals are amassed into an easy-to-follow format, every week, from all over the internet. So kick back, relax, and hold on to your wallets.
The current Humble Monthly bundle has been on offer for three weeks now, meaning you have less than a week before a brand-new bundle and an early unlock game takes the place of the current ones.
The current early-unlock game available in the $12 bundle is, of course, Rise of the Tomb Raider by Crystal Dynamics, that received critical acclaim at launch. In addition to that, the bundle will also unlock a selection of other games once it reaches its conclusion next week. However, we get next to no clues on what these games could be, as Humble only says the full bundle will be worth over $100.
The game has Lara Croft following in the footsteps of her father as she searches for the lost city of Kitezh. It doesn't hurt that the city is said to have a connection to gaining immortality as well.
The bundle will refresh its contents on October 6, and don't forget that Humble Monthly subscribers get access to the Humble Trove, which includes a host of DRM-free games to try out, as well as a 10% discount on Humble Store purchases.
It has been 20 years since 'Fallout: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game' was released into the wild and introduced gamers to its addictive post-apocalyptic world for the first time. While it was a far cry from the much more action-oriented Fallout games we see now, the isometric RPG is still considered one of the best in the series by many old-school fans.
To celebrate the 20 year anniversary, the game is completely free to claim on Steam until 11:59pm PT on September 30th. Just go to the game's Steam store page and click 'Install Game' to add it permanently to your library.
If you're keen on trying out the game, be sure to install the 'Fallout FIXT' enhancement mod to remedy most of the issues that the game will throw at you for using modern systems. Also, be prepared for a difficult venture in your search for that elusive water chip, as the game is pretty unforgiving.
A relic remaining from Bundle Stars' Bundlefest promotion from last week is ending soon, that being the Nemesis Bundle 3. Similar to a bundle by Humble, the new Nemesis Bundle has a few tiers for you to choose from, with each tier adding more and more games to your collection, adding up to 15 games in total worth almost $300.
The bundle brings along games from the amazing S.T.A.L.K.E.R series, Planetary Annihilation: TITANS, Tropico 5, and more. For simplicity's sake we have listed each tier's cost and contents in list form below:
Tier 1 - $1.00
S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky
Shadowrun Returns
Shoppe Keep
Eon Altar
Tier 2 - $4.99
Planetary Annihilation: TITANS
S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl
Tropico 5
Styx: Master of Shadows
Slain: Back from Hell
SpellForce 2 - Anniversary Edition
Blood: One Unit Whole Blood
Phantaruk
FaceRig
Tier 3 - $9.99
S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat
FaceRig Pro Upgrade
The bundle will come to an end in a couple of days, so be sure to grab it if it piqued your interest.
Free Events
Call of Duty's last venture into the World War II era was with World at War back in 2008, and almost a decade later, the series is finally returning to the brutal time period with Call of Duty: WWII.
The game is set to launch on November 3, however, a PC beta for the multiplayer side of things is now in effect. If you hadn't pre-loaded the game already, you can jump into this open beta by going to its dedicated Steam store page here. The beta will last until October 2, giving you plenty of time to test out its maps, gun mechanics, and all the little details.
While the Call of Duty: WWII beta will surely attract a larger number of players, another shooter is also having a free event this weekend. This game is Lawbreakers by Cliff Bleszinski's studio, Boss Key Productions.
While the game received favorable reviews at launch just last month, it has sadly failed in retaining its players, with numbers falling to abysmal levels. The free weekend should help in rectifying this issue, at least temporarily. So if you have the urge to play a fast-paced arena-like shooter with solid mechanics, Lawbreakers may be the way to go.
You can join in on the event by installing Lawbreakers via its Steam store page. Moreover, free weekend participants also have a chance at winning a free copy of the game, and you can go here for all the details regarding the contest.
Lastly, we leave behind the shooters and look toward Battlerite, a competitive, skill-shot based brawler, that rose to fame last year when it entered early access. The game is finally on its way to launch in its full form in November, and to celebrate, the developer initiated an entire week of free play for the game.
The issue is that this free week began last week, so it is almost at an end, with it ending tomorrow. However, if you're hungry for some fast-paced satisfying fights in solo or team-based matches, this is a good opportunity to have a look at Battlerite.
Even if you miss out on the free event, the game is set to release as a free-to-play title, but the amount of content available for free players will be limited, unlike the full free experience available during the current event.
Big Deals
With the beginning of the weekend comes a wide assortment of sales from numerous PC game stores, and below, we have a selection of handpicked games that are near or below their historical discount rates.
Warner Bros. entire catalog of published titles is discounted quite heavily on Steam for the weekend, so we have some great games on offer, from the Arkham series to the varied and humorous LEGO games.
DRM-free Goodness
Now, with all those pesky DRM-filled games out of the way, let's take look at some DRM-free deals. The GOG store's weekly deals revolve around adventurous games this time, and you can see our highlighted picks below.
Do keep in mind that pricing and availability for some deals may vary depending on the region you're in.
And that is it for our pick of this weekend's PC game deals folks, and hopefully, some of you have enough self-restraint to not break the bank adding new games to your ever-growing backlogs. Of course, there is a gargantuan amount of other deals available all over the interwebs if you search hard enough, so keep your eyes open for those as well.

Jury of 12 unable to reach unanimous decision on charges against Michael Slager, who shot unarmed black man five times in the back in 2015
The trial of the former police officer who shot dead Walter Scott, an unarmed African American, in an incident that was caught on cellphone video and reignited the debate on race and policing in the US, has ended in a mistrial.
Michael Slager, 35, was caught on film shooting Scott, 50, five times from behind after pursuing the father of four when he fled a traffic stop in South Carolina in April 2015. The video filmed by a witness, which propelled the case into the global spotlight, showed Scott was running away with his back turned when Slager, then an officer with the North Charleston police department, opened fire.
Walter Scott shooting: single juror forces deadlock and pushes trial into fifth week Read more
The jury of 11 white people and one black person was unable to reach a unanimous decision on the murder and manslaughter charges, meaning the case resulted in a mistrial. The result appears to have hung on the opinion of single juror who, on Friday, indicated in a note to the judge, Clifton Newman, that they could not “with good conscience consider a guilty verdict”.
The jury's foreperson had pushed deliberations into a fourth day, after tense scenes in court on Friday, allowing jurors a weekend break after a monthlong trial.
State solicitor Scarlett Wilson said in a statement she would retry the case “whenever the court calls”.
Slager has also been indicted on federal civil rights charges that carry a maximum sentence of life, but the failure to reach a decision in this state murder trial will probably be seen as a stinging blow to the Black Lives Matter movement, which has campaigned doggedly for police reform and equal justice.
The result follows similar outcomes in other high profile trials of police officers accused of unlawfully killing unarmed African Americans across the country. Last month the trial of former Cincinnati campus police officer Ray Tensing ended in mistrial despite video evidence that prosecutors argued showed he had murdered Samuel DuBose. At the end of 2015 the first of six Baltimore police officers indicted in the death in custody of Freddie Gray also ended in a mistrial, paving the way for charges being dropped in the other cases.
During an emotional address on Monday, Wilson said the 12 men and women on the jury had been “exemplary” in their service.
“Y'all have been all-stars. And while I don't mean to downplay or understate my disappointment that together we weren't able to reach a resolution, no one can be critical of you,” Wilson said.
“You have sacrificed more than any of your peers in this community have for jury service and it hasn't gone unnoticed.”
As Wilson addressed the jury, she paid tribute to Scott's parents, Walter Sr and Judy Scott, whom she described as “leading this community to peace”.
Holding back tears, Wilson continued: “The whole world has remarked on Charleston and this community and how we've reacted over the past year and a half. The dignity and grace that this community saw started right here with the Scott family, and they have not gotten the credit they deserved.”
The couple sat in the second row of the public benches, Walter Sr with his arm around his wife.
As Slager's defense attorney Andrew Savage also thanked the jury for their service, some of Scott's supporters left the courtroom.
Judy Scott told reporters outside the courtroom that she was confident that Slager would be convicted in a retrial.
“Today I'm not sad, and I want you to know why I'm not sad. Because Jesus is on the inside. And I know that justice will be served because the God that I serve, he's able,” Scott said, later raising her hands to the sky.
“God is my strength and I know without a doubt that he is a just God, and injustice will not prevail.”
The Scott family attorney, Chris Stewart, argued that Slager had escaped conviction “by a hair”.
“The fight isn't over. That was round one. We've got two more rounds to go,” Scott said.
Anthony Scott, Walter's brother, called for calm in the city after the trial's outcome. “We're not going to tear up this city. We're going to keep it just the way it is. And we're going to believe in peaceful protest.”
The judge had allowed the jury to consider a lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter, meaning an unlawful killing that occurred without “malice” but rather in the heat of passion after provocation. But the failure to reach a verdict indicates at least one juror believed that Slager's decision to shoot Scott was a reasonable use of force.
The jury had sought sought clarification on the distinction between “fear” and “passion”, the potential difference between a justifiable self-defense claim and a manslaughter conviction. On Monday, the jury sent a list of six further questions relating to legal definitions and the nature of charges, indicating they were still at an impassable deadlock.
The former officer pleaded not guilty to murder and testified he had shot Scott because he was in “total fear” for his life after Scott had repeatedly disobeyed his commands and “grabbed” the officer's Taser during a scuffle on the ground.
Although Slager conceded under cross-examination that the video showed he had opened fire after his Taser dropped to the ground and when Scott was at least 17ft away from him, he argued at the time of shooting his “mind was like spaghetti”, meaning he had perceived a greater threat.
Slager also said he was unable to remember why he could be seen in the video retrieving the Taser and dropping it next to Scott's dead body, but denied it had been an attempt to plant evidence.
Walter Scott: protesters demand justice – and an end to police discrimination Read more
Slager's defense team took an aggressive stance throughout the trial, first attempting to have the video struck out as evidence, and then accusing the witness who recorded it, Feidin Santana, of being ideologically opposed to law enforcement and unpatriotic for not handing the film over to authorities immediately.
Santana, a Dominican migrant who had never met Scott before, told the Guardian last year that he had attempted to hand the recording to police immediately but was ignored, and eventually handed it over directly to the Scott family. Santana also said he lived in fear for his life after the incident.

During closing arguments last Wednesday afternoon, Savage, Slager's defense attorney, unleashed a tirade against the media, arguing his client had become a “poster boy” for perceived police brutality around the US and placed blame for the incident on Scott's “felonious conduct”.
“The impression that the media has, and the state is trying to sell you, is that nothing happened – he just ran after him and shot him in the back,” Savage told the jury. He argued that Slager had no opportunity to “pat him [Scott] down” during their interaction, meaning the officer did not know if the suspect was armed at the time he opened fire.
Wilson, solicitor of South Carolina's ninth judicial district and lead prosecutor on the case, responded by accusing Slager's defense team of bamboozling the jury with a large volume of testimony and attempting to characterize Scott as “a thug”.
A total of 55 people testified during the trial, ranging from eyewitnesses and Scott's mother to members of the North Charleston police department and expert psychologists.
As Wilson made her final argument, she urged jurors to “do the right thing”, played the video of Scott's death a final time and displayed a North Charleston police department badge on a screen for jurors to see.
“That badge is supposed to be a shield, not a sword,” Wilson said. “Our community, our courtroom, can only have one fountain for justice. It's time for Michael Slager to take his drink.”
The Scott case also leads the US Department of Justice to commence a collaborative review of the North Charleston police department, following calls from local activists of routine bias in the department.
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is getting sued by 26-year-old Daniel Johnson who suffered burns in his genital region after being tased by cops.
Johnson was making dinner at his parents' home in Altadena when a man knocked on the door to inform them that Johnson's father was getting fined for throwing a cigarette butt on the ground. According to the lawsuit, the 58-year-old man is disabled and walks with the assistance of a cane and because of the nerve damage in his hands often drops things on the ground.
Johnson went outside to talk to the officers and saw Deputy Abdulfattah writing a $1000 fine for loitering. He asked if he could pick the cigarette butt instead but according to Johnson's statement Deputy Abdulfattah replied “I can write you a ticket too if you want”.
Johnson's mother got out of the house just as her son turned his back to the cops and walked away, when Deputy Russell grabbed him from behind. He held Johnson in a full nelson grip and tackled him to the ground while the other cop hit his elderly father in the face. She watched the cop repeatedly tase her son in the genitalia while looking at her.
<
“He's looking directly at me every time he pulls that trigger, and at one point my son says, ‘Mom, I'm OK. So at that point, I realize this guy is doing this because I am reacting”, said Rose Gonzales, Johnson's mother.
Johnson, who is a Berkeley graduate with no criminal record, was arrested for battery on a police officer but the charges were never filed. He hopes there is an audio or video recording of the incident that could help him win the case against L.A. County Sheriff's Department.
It's well known that stress is a top trigger for rosacea flare-ups, but new research may point to the direct effect stress has on the skin.
"Nearly everyone has some form of stress in their life, so it's difficult to determine whether stress can actually make the skin diseases worse," said Dr. Richard Granstein, chairman of the department of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical College and a member of the National Rosacea Society's Medical Advisory Board. "However, it's been known for a long time that the nervous system, which processes our stress, has an impact on conditions such as psoriasis and rosacea."
In a presentation at the summer meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology, Dr. Granstein discussed research into the relationship between the nervous system and the skin, and the pathophysiologic processes involved in that interaction.
He explained that many types of cells in the skin -- including immune cells, endothelial cells and mast cells -- can be regulated by neuropeptides and neurotransmitters, chemicals that are produced by nerve cells. Some of these chemicals in turn cause inflammation and dilate blood vessels in the skin. Some also appear to regulate immune processes in the skin.
"In stressed humans, parts of the nervous system are activated with enhanced release of some neuropeptides and neurotransmitters ," Dr. Granstein said. This can affect how and at what level the body responds -- causing inflammation, and dilating blood vessels in the skin of rosacea sufferers. These symptoms may in turn cause additional stress, he noted, resulting in a vicious cycle. There is now direct evidence of a role of certain neuropeptides in rosacea.
"If we could block specific steps in certain pathways involving nervous system signaling to the skin -- without impacting the whole body -- we would likely have new ways to prevent or treat skin disorders like rosacea," said Dr. Granstein. "We're gaining a greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying many skin conditions, which will help us develop new therapies."
The good news is that stress management can be an effective method of getting your condition under control. In a recent NRS survey on emotional stress and rosacea, two-thirds of the respondents said they were able to reduce their flare-ups by minimizing the causes of their stress and their emotional reactions.
Speaker John Boehner watched his hard-fought bill go down in instant defeat in the Senate Monday night, leaving him with just a few hours to rally his conference around a plan that will keep the government open.
It won't be easy.
A dozen Republicans voted against his last plan, which would have kept the government open in exchange for some changes to Obamacare. And prominent Republicans like Sen. Rand Paul are starting to talk about a temporary fix that would at least avert a shutdown at midnight. Others, like Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky are predicting Republicans will lose even as they urge Boehner to keep up the fight.
So while Boehner eked out a victory, moderates and conservatives alike are starting to rebel, leaving Boehner exposed on the left and the right just as he is supposed to show strength in the final hours before a shutdown. It means Boehner is heading into the final hours of a battle against a united Democratic front hobbled by an ugly civil war raging in his party.
On Boehner's left flank, moderate Republicans who have long warned against a confrontation over Obamacare are arguing that this may be the stop on the shutdown train where they get off.
Congressman Peter King of New York, who supported the House's previous bill to delay Obamacare, said he planned to vote against the new measure. Not only that, he predicted to MSNBC's Luke Russert that as many as two dozen more moderate Republicans could join him in opposing the “Ted Cruz wing.”
“I can tell you about 25 people on Saturday night who told me they were definitely going to vote no,” he said. “Now, at high noon you don't how many of that 25 are going to stay committed, but there's real opposition.”
Moderate Republican Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania also called on Boehner to accede to Obama's demands and offer a clean continuing resolution.
“The hour glass is already empty and it's time that we pass a clean CR,” he told reporters.
Dent and King rebelled against a test vote on the rules governing the debate of over the bill Monday night, but they were it for the moderate caucus. They didn't do much better in the final vote, either. But some supporters of the bill said their patience was running thin with brinksmanship.
Devin Nunes of California told reporters he was voting for the bill, but that the House GOP was acting “like lemmings with suicide vests” intent on provoking a crisis with unrealistic demands.
“They have to be more than just a lemming,” he said of the House's conservative wing. “Because jumping to your death is not enough.”
On the right, tea party rabble rousers like Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota opposed the latest bill because it doesn't go far enough in opposing Obamacare.
“For what I have done with my life as a federal tax lawyer, I wouldn't negotiate with myself, because then I wouldn't have a strong position,” Bachmann told reporters. “It's important we come at this with strength.”
On the rules vote for the bill Bachmann voted nay along with three other tea party Republicans: Steve King, Paul Broun, and Louie Gohmert.
They were joined in the final vote by Joe Barton, Mario Diaz Balart, Phil Gingrey, Kay Granger, Thomas Massie, and Mike Rogers.
“We're just rushing to the clean CR,” Massie, who voted against Boehner's proposal because it was too weak on Obamacare, told reporters. “That's where we're going to end.”
Boehner can only afford to lose 16 Republicans votes, give or take a handful of Democrats who might cross over. If at any point one of his bills fail, it will severely damage his leverage by demonstrating his caucus is too divided to even reach a consensus starting point on negotiations.
A similar revolt during the 2012 fiscal cliff fight over the Bush tax cuts and sequestration ended with Boehner asking the Senate to reach a compromise instead, which he then passed over conservative objections with help from Democrats in the House. In this case, the damage would be greater than Democrats would likely assume Boehner's position was compromised on the debt ceiling as well. After all, if moderates and conservatives revolt when a shutdown deadline gets close, why wouldn't they do the same thing for the far more dangerous default deadline?
HELSINKI (Reuters) - Nordic countries agreed on Monday to step up defense cooperation and exchange more air surveillance information because they are worried about Russia's increasing military activity.
The countries have increased defense spending and cooperation with each other and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014.
“The ... situation is a common concern for the Nordic countries ... We aim at strengthening our national defense and finding cooperation to better address security concerns,” Finnish Defence Minister Jussi Niinisto told a news conference.
It followed a meeting with his Swedish, Danish and Norwegian counterparts and a representative from Iceland.
He said the agreement to exchange more air surveillance data would contribute “positively to situational awareness” as well as flight safety. The Nordic countries have accused Russia of repeatedly violating their airspace in the past few years.
The countries also agreed to cooperate on procurement and said they planned to use a common Nordic combat uniform.
“We see an aggressive Russia that is building up its forces, renewing its materials, having new missiles in Kaliningrad ... That is the new picture in our part of the world,” said Danish Defence Minister Claus Hjort Frederiksen
Kaliningrad lies between Poland and Lithuania on the Baltic Sea. Other ministers said Russia did not pose a current threat.
The Baltic sea region is a zone of heightened tensions between Moscow and the West. Russia has increased its military capability in its Baltic enclave of Kaliningrad and criticized NATO for stationing anti-missile shields in eastern Europe.
Norway, Denmark and Iceland are NATO members, while Sweden and Finland - which shares an 833 mile (1,340 km) border with Russia - have remained militarily non-aligned.
Finland said last week it was planning large-scale military drills with the Nordics, the United States and other allies as early as 2020.
The ministers will meet in Helsinki on Tuesday with a Northern Group that includes Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, Poland and the Baltic states. U.S. Defence Secretary Jim Mattis will also join the meeting.
The man accused of murdering IU senior Hannah Wilson could face the death penalty, if prosecutors charge him with kidnapping. Daniel Messel , 49, already faces a charge of murder."It's my opinion that the state is probably considering a death penalty count in this murder case," said criminal defense attorney Jack Crawford, a former county prosecutor. "It appears strongly like Hannah Wilson was abducted, that's a kidnapping. A murder committed in the course of a kidnapping is an aggravating ground or circumstance to seek the death sentence."In the Brown County field where Hannah Wilson's body was found last Friday, so was a cell phone that police say belonged to Messel. Police then found blood and hair inside Messel's car and, when he was arrested, he was carrying a trash bag full of clothes.But there are apparently no witnesses to the murder."It's not unusual to have a circumstantial case. You let the jury put the pieces together. And these are some big pieces," explained Crawford, who said the prosecution in this case does not have to prove motive.If Messel never testifies about the case, that's fine, too he can still be convicted."If they connect up the DNA, if they find his DNA on or near her body, or if they find her DNA in his vehicle, that's strong circumstantial evidence that he committed the killing," said Crawford.If detectives are able to show that Hannah was abducted, this could become a capital case.The Brown County prosecutor, so far, isn't talking about the evidence or additional charges."We will remain playing this close to the vest, I don't want to make a comment at this time," said Brown County Prosecutor Ted Adams on Monday.Hannah's father is focused on the loss and mostly, celebrating a young and vivacious life."She's gone. It doesn't matter whether they find a killer or don't find a killer," said Dr. Jeff Wilson, Hannah's father, "I think, though, the police and the detectives have done a great job. They're on it. I'm not too concerned about that."
WEST HOLLYWOOD >> The adult entertainment industry is built on fantasy. Now it's welcoming a dose of reality — of the virtual kind.
Industry leaders who gathered this week at the five-day XBIZ 2017 conference at the Andaz Hotel in West Hollywood declared themselves bullish on the economic potential of virtual reality.
“I firmly believe virtual reality is the next big thing for the adult entertainment industry — and it will make obsolete traditional recorded two-dimensional porn,” said Alec Helmy, founder of XBIZ, an annual porn trade expo. “It's going to be a really amazing thing.”
Helmy moderated a “state of the industry” panel at XBIZ, where representatives from major players in adult entertainment addressed the opportunities presented by virtual reality and obstacles to its growth.
“VR is not just a cool little buzzword anymore. It's definitely here,” stated Joey Gabra, managing director of Affil4You.com, a company that specializes in monetizing mobile content. But he added, “The market's really, really tiny still.”

Growth in the VR segment of the porn business could be a boost to the economy of Southern California, which remains home to the lion's share of the multi-billion dollar adult entertainment industry, according to Mike Stabile, communications director for the Free Speech Coalition, an industry trade group.
“The current revenue being generated from VR isn't huge. But across the industry, people are looking at it as something that really is going to develop into the dominant medium for adult entertainment,” Stabile said.
But there are technological hurdles that have kept some consumers from adopting VR.
“The headset is uncomfortable so you really can't put on a headset and spend hours watching porn,” noted Brian Shuster, CEO of Utherverse, which creates online virtual environments. “Hopefully we're going to be able to push the headset manufacturers to be able to produce lighter, easier, more durable headsets.”

The XBIZ conference attracted manufacturers who say they are ready to solve problems with currently available VR equipment.
“We are working hard to develop new headsets,” promised Jean-Claude Artonne, CEO of Terpon, which creates VR camera technology for the adult industry. He said Terpon is also about to release a new line of 3D VR cameras that, according to the company's website, will push “the boundaries of immersive live webcam streaming.”
Artonne believes the immersive quality of VR is what makes it the wave of the future in porn.
“What you want is to interact (with a webcam performer) and when you talk about interaction, virtual reality is really the next step because it's really a way for you to feel you are with the person,” he explained.
His display at XBIZ featured an exotic dancer who writhed behind a sheer white curtain. Viewers who tested out a VR headset got the feeling that the dancer was right in front of them, performing for their pleasure.
According to Artonne, live experiences in VR are just the start.
“Immersive enjoyment is not just about vision. It's about hearing, it's about touching, it's about feeling,” he said. “There is an endless possibility of hardware that can be designed.”
At some point over the next several days, before his self-imposed Friday deadline, Barry Trotz and his coaching staff will gather together, review their roster and make the decisions that so far have remained unclear. They will think about placing Tom Wilson and Dmitry Orlov on injured reserve. They will mull over the open defensive spots, and the open forwards spots, and the vacancy at second-line center. And they will decide what to do with Andre Burakovsky.
“Right now, he's playing like an NHL player, yes,” Trotz said. “But I wouldn't say he's on the team, no.”
The 19-year-old Swedish forward has held his own throughout preseason practices and games, backing up the promise shown during development camp and rookie camp, when the Capitals first moved him to center. Trotz has expressed no issue with returning Burakovsky to the wing, should the situation arise, but Tuesday's on-ice session was spent between Troy Brouwer and Brooks Laich on the second line.
Worst-case scenario, Burakovsky reports to Hershey for his first American Hockey League season, centers the Bears' top line and remains atop the short list for call-ups. Both Trotz and General Manager Brian MacLellan have no desire to handle Burakovsky's development like Wilson's last season, when the forward played 82 NHL games during his rookie season but averaged fewer than eight minutes per game.
“Two trains of thought are, take the best players and as long as you can use young players at decent level, I have no problem with them playing,” Trotz said. “If you're not going to use them at a decent level, then play them at the level where they're going to get the most minutes and the most time.
“Then for some guys, like [Burakovsky] and guys like [Liam] O'Brien and even [Evgeny Kuznetsov] who's a young guy, the more they can play at the National League level, even practice, helps them. That's why you can have a young guy go down and play in junior or whatever, it just helps. Even practice, taking passes at the National Hockey League level, the speed, how quickly they get it over and think, it's really good.”
Burakovsky, who will likely center the Brouwer-Laich line again Wednesday at Buffalo, said his comfort level has grown each game, culminating in a strong performance Sunday at Montreal, when he won a puck battle behind the net and set up Joel Ward's game-winning goal.
“I felt much more comfortable tonight actually,” Burakovsky said. “I felt like I could really play my own game, take care of the puck all the time, do stuff with the puck and really play my game. Today I was feeling really comfortable out there.”
According to Trotz, Kuznetsov will center Jason Chimera and Ward against the Sabres, while Marcus Johansson, a one-time candidate for the second-line center job, will remain on the wing. At practice Tuesday, Johansson played on the fourth line alongside Michael Latta and Chris Brown.
“I thought Marcus played pretty well in Montreal,” Trotz said. “Started a little bit slowly. He's getting better every game, which is what you want to see. Talking to the staff, talking to Mac who have been around with the organization for a long time, they said Marcus is traditionally a slow starter here, so that's not unexpected from past history. I thought he was using his speed a little bit better last game. I thought he was playing a pretty solid game. I liked him much better last game than I did the game before.”
On Tuesday, Trotz divvied up the rosters into, first, veterans most likely making the Capitals and, second, players still needing to improve, for whom “the next two games are going to decide what happens.” That group included blue-line candidates Connor Carrick, Steven Oleksy and Patrick Wey, while veterans John Erskine and Jack Hillen practiced with the first group.
The full roster traveling to Buffalo is listed below:
Saxe, who speaks rapidly and radiates an intellectual intensity, gets most animated by philosophical and deeply fundamental questions about the brain. For her, the next obvious question is: How did the brain's organization come about? “Seeing in adults these incredibly rich and abstract functions of your brain — morality, theory of mind — it just raises the question, how does that get there?” she said.
Have our brains evolved to have special areas devoted to the things most important for our survival? Or, she said, “is it that we were born with an amazing multipurpose learning machinery that could learn whatever organization of the world it was given to discover?” Do we enter the world with an innate blueprint for devoting parts of our brains to faces, for instance, or do we develop a specialized face area after months or years of seeing so many people around us? “The basic structural organization of the human brain could be similar from person to person because the world is similar from person to person,” she said. Or its outlines could be there from birth.
A Place for Faces
Riley LeBlanc spits out her pacifier and starts to cry. A 5-month-old with a mop of curly brown hair, she's fussing in her swaddle as Heather Kosakowski, Saxe's lab manager, stands by the hulking MRI machine, housed in the bottom floor of MIT's Brain and Cognitive Sciences building, and bounces Riley up and down. Lori Fauci, Riley's mother, seated on the scanning bed, pulls another pacifier from her back pocket to offer her child.
Everything here is designed to soothe Riley. The room is softly lit, and speakers play tinkling, toy-piano versions of pop songs as lullabies (currently: Guns N' Roses' “Sweet Child o' Mine”). On the scanning bed lies a specially designed radio-frequency coil — an angled lounger and baby-sized helmet — to act as an antenna for radio signals during scans. The MRI machine is programmed with special protocols that generate less noise than usual, to avoid harming the babies' delicate hearing.
It takes a few false starts before Riley is willing to lie in the coil without fussing. Her mother positions herself on her stomach with her face and hands near Riley to soothe her. Kosakowski slides mother and child into the scanner and moves to a windowed anteroom, while Lyneé Herrera, another lab member, stays in the MRI room and gives hand signals to Kosakowski to let her know when Riley's eyes are open and watching the mirror above her head, which reflects images projected from the back of the machine.
The team's goal is to collect about 10 minutes of data from each baby while she's motionlessly watching the videos. To achieve that, the researchers often need to average together data from multiple two-hour sessions. “The more times a baby comes, the more likely we are to get that full 10 minutes,” Kosakowski said. This is Riley's eighth visit.
When Herrera signals that Riley has stopped napping, Kosakowski initiates the scanner and cues a series of video clips, as babies are more likely to look at moving images than still ones. After a while, Herrera closes her hand, signaling that Riley's eyes are closed again. “Sometimes I think babies must be getting their best naps here,” Kosakowski said with a laugh.
Studying infants has always required creative techniques. “It's been an interesting problem,” said Charles Nelson, a cognitive neuroscientist at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital who studies child development, “because you're dealing with a nonverbal, rhetorically limited, attentionally limited organism, trying to figure out what's going on inside their head.” Similar techniques are often used to study babies and nonhuman primates, or children with disabilities who are not verbal. “We have a class of covert measures that allows us to peek inside the monkey, the baby, the child with a disorder,” Nelson said.
The simplest is watching their behavior and noting where they look, either by observing them or using eye-tracking technologies. Another is to measure brain activity. Electroencephalography (EEG), for instance, simply requires attaching an adorable skullcap of electrodes and wires to a baby's head to detect fluctuating brain waves. And a newer technique called near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) sends light through babies' thin, soft skulls to detect changes in blood flow in the brain.
Both methods reveal how brain activity changes moment to moment, but NIRS only reaches the outer layers of the brain, and EEG can't show exactly which brain areas are active. “To study the detailed spatial organization, and to get to deeper brain regions, you have to go to fMRI,” said Ben Deen, first author of the Nature Communications study, who's now a researcher at Rockefeller University.
Using other methods, researchers have found hints that babies respond differently to visual inputs of different categories, particularly faces. Faces “are a very salient part of environment,” said Michelle de Haan, a developmental neuroscientist at University College London. In the first few weeks of life, an infant's eyes focus best on objects around the distance of a nursing mother's face. Some researchers believe babies may have an innate mechanism, deep in the brain, which directs their eyes to look at faces.
There's evidence that young infants will look longer at faces than other things. A baby's response to faces also becomes more specialized over time and with experience. For instance, adults have a harder time discriminating between two faces when they're upside down, but babies under 4 months of age don't have this bias — they can discriminate between two upside-down faces as easily as two right-side-up ones. After about 4 months, though, they acquire a bias for right-side-up faces. Around 6 months of age, infants who see faces produce an EEG signature of activity that is similar to that of adults who see faces.
But while this research suggests that babies might have some specialization in their brain for certain categories like faces, Deen said, “we knew very little about the detail of where those signals are coming from.”
For their current paper, Saxe and her colleagues obtained data from nine of the 17 babies they scanned. Though the lab is increasingly relying on outside families recruited into studies, it helped that they had a spate of “lab babies” to start with, including Arthur; Saxe's second son, Percy; her sister's son; and a postdoc's son. They presented babies with movies of faces, natural scenes, human bodies and objects — toys, in this case — as well as scrambled scenes, in which parts of the image are jumbled. Saxe said they focused on faces versus scenes because the two stimuli create a sharp difference in adult brains, evoking activity in very different regions.
Surprisingly, they found a similar pattern in babies. “Every region that we knew about in adults [with] a preference for faces or scenes has that same preference in babies 4 to 6 months old,” Saxe said. That shows that the cortex “is already starting to have a bias in its function,” she said, rather than being totally undifferentiated.
Are babies born with this ability? “We can't strictly say that anything is innate,” Deen said. “We can say it develops very early.” And Saxe points out that the responses extended beyond the visual cortex (the structures of the brain responsible for directly processing visual inputs). The researchers also found differences in the frontal cortex, an area of the brain involved in emotions, values and self-representation. “To see frontal cortex engagement in a baby is really exciting,” she said. “It's thought to be one of the last spots to fully develop.”
However, while Saxe's team found that similar areas of the brain were active in babies and adults, they did not find evidence that infants have areas specialized for one particular input, like faces or scenes, over all others. Nelson, who was not involved in the study, said it suggests that infant brains are “more multipurpose.” He added: “That points out a fundamental difference in the infant brain versus the adult brain.”
The Flexible Brain
It's surprising that babies' brains behave like adults' brains at all considering how different they look. On a computer screen outside the MRI room at MIT, I can see anatomical images of Riley's brain that were taken while she napped. Compared to MRI scans of adult brains, in which different brain structures are clearly visible, Riley's brain seems creepily dark.
“It looks like this is just a really poor image, doesn't it?” Kosakowski said. She explains that babies at this stage have not yet fully developed the fatty insulation around nerve fibers, called myelin, that makes up the brain's white matter. The corpus callosum, a yoke of nerve fibers connecting the two hemispheres of the brain, is only dimly visible.
At this age, a baby's brain is expanding — the cerebral cortex swells by 88 percent in the first year of life. Its cells are also reorganizing themselves and rapidly forming new connections to one another, many of which will get winnowed back throughout childhood and adolescence. At this stage, the brain is astonishingly flexible: when babies have strokes or seizures that require having an entire hemisphere of the brain surgically removed, they recover remarkably well. But there are also limits to this flexibility; babies who experience deprivation or abuse may have lifelong learning deficits.
Studying how healthy human brains develop can help scientists understand why this process sometimes goes awry. It's known, for instance, that many children and adults with autism have difficulties with social cognition tasks, such as interpreting faces. Are these differences present at the earliest stages of the brain's development, or do they emerge out of a child's experience, driven by a lack of attention to faces and social cues?
We're only beginning to understand how babies' brains are organized; it will require many more hours collecting data from a larger number of babies to have a fuller picture of how their brains work. But Saxe and her colleagues have shown that such a study can be done, which opens up new areas of investigation. “It is possible to get good fMRI data in awake babies — if you are extremely patient,” Saxe said. “Now let's try to figure out what we can learn from it.”

CLOSE Big Ben is undergoing a $38 million renovation and will remain silent for four years. It will be the longest stretch the iconic London landmark hasn't chimed since its first bell ringing in 1859. USA TODAY

British authorities have admitted what every homeowner knows in their heart of hearts: renovations always cost more than you expect.
Parliamentary authorities said Friday the cost of repairing London's Elizabeth Tower — part of the Houses of Parliament, and known as Big Ben — is now estimated at $81 million. Previously estimates said it would cost $38 million.
The mid-19th-century clock tower that soars 315 feet into the air in the heart of London's political and diplomatic quarter is one of the capital city's most-visited buildings. The repairs are needed to fix decaying stonework and outdated electrical and plumbing systems. The last extensive repairs took place more than 30 years ago.
Authorities said the increased costs were related to the complexity of the project and the scaffolding needed to enable workers to reach heights safely. The works have been controversial because Big Ben's bell will fall silent on all but a few special occasions during the repairs. The restoration project is expected to take about four years.

The 13.5 British ton (15.1 U.S. ton, 13.7 metric ton) bell has sounded the time almost uninterrupted since 1859, but it's due to fall silent on Monday so repairs can be carried out on the Victorian clock and the Elizabeth Tower.

NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - In families with a history of child abuse, a mother's depression may increase the risk that she will act aggressively toward her child, a new study suggests.
A doll is seen in the backyard of the mobile home where three children and their mother were found hanged in Hudson Oaks, Texas May 29, 2007. REUTERS/Jessica Rinaldi
The study, which followed 5,500 U.S. families investigated by child- welfare agencies, found that when a mother developed depression, the odds of her child suffering “psychologically aggressive acts” — including threats or name-calling — increased.
The findings do not prove that mothers' depression, per se, led to the children's abuse, the researchers report in the Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine.
However, they write, the study does support general recommendations that adults be screened by their doctors for both depression and spousal or partner abuse — which is also linked to increased odds of child abuse.
For the study, Dr. Kerith J. Conron and colleagues at the Harvard School of Public Health used data from a national survey of 5,500 families who had been involved in child abuse investigations.
Mothers completed a standard measure of depression symptoms at the outset, and again 18 months and three years later. They were also asked about any instances in which their child was abused over the past year — including physical abuse, neglect and psychological aggression.
The researchers found that when mothers developed depression over the course of the study, incidents of threats, name-calling and other forms of psychological aggression against their children also increased — by an average of two extra incidents per year.
Roughly one-quarter of the mothers were deemed to have major depression at each of the three surveys. One-third of the women overall either a remission or onset of depression during the study period.
In other findings, mothers who reported an increase in abuse from a partner were also more likely to report an increase in physical abuse and neglect of their children. In contrast, mothers who moved in with a non-abusive partner during the study generally reported a decrease in psychologically aggressive behavior toward their children.
It's possible, according to Conron's team, that having a supportive partner lessened some mothers' strain and, in turn, lowered the likelihood of child abuse.
It is not clear from the study data whether mothers' depression typically preceded the increases in aggressive behavior toward their children. However, the researchers write, the findings still support recommendations from several medical groups that doctors routinely screen adults for both depression and intimate-partner violence.
Right now, the researchers note, there are no screening tests for parents that reliably catch cases of child abuse.

Above his desk at Columbia University, astrophysicist Charles Hailey has pinned up a colored photograph of the super-massive black hole at the center of our galaxy. The black hole is hidden by hot gas and dust, and is so dense that light itself cannot escape its gravitational pull. “There are only about ten people in the world who have seen this,” Hailey says.
The image comes from NASA's newly launched Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, or NuSTAR satellite telescope. Hailey led the team that designed and built NuSTAR's optics, the first ever to scan our galaxy with high resolution in the so-called “hard” or high-energy X-ray spectrum of light. “The hard X-ray band is the last frontier of the light spectrum that has not yet been studied with high sensitivity,” says Steven Kahn, an astrophysicist at Stanford University. These hard X-rays are among the only kinds of light that escape the center of the galaxy. And until now, no satellite was able to focus them into clear images. Hard X-rays are produced by the matter around a black hole and a variety of other ultra-hot stellar bodies.
In the past, high resolution satellite telescopes like NuSTAR have been created by meticulously polishing metallic or glass surfaces that are used to reflect light. But the polishing is “extremely expensive and time consuming,” says Hailey. The Chandra X-Ray Observatory, a low-energy X-ray telescope launched in 1999, cost $1.65 billion to construct, and the Hubble Space Telescope, launched in 1990, cost over $2.5 billion.
But by using a technique — pioneered by Hailey and advanced by NASA — called ‘glass slumping' to build NuSTAR's optical device, Hailey avoided polishing altogether. Instead Hailey and his team took smooth glass panels, heated by his colleagues at NASA to the right curvatures, and pressed them onto a perfectly smooth, machined surface. This eliminated both the painstaking polishing process and the need to align the glass by hand. The result was that NuSTAR cost only $165 million to produce, a fifteenth of the cost of Hubble.
Wiry and wry, Hailey is animated as he describes NuSTAR and his other experiments, eagerly jumping to his chalkboard to illustrate glass slumping and drive a point home. Hailey traces his interest in science and astrophysics back to his early childhood. Now 57, he was given his first telescope in 5th grade, and built his own at age 16. Today he is, as Kahn explains, “one of the leading astrophysicists in the country.” But what separates Hailey from many of his colleagues is how many different areas of physics he has contributed to.
Before NuSTAR, Hailey worked as an atomic physicist developing methods to detect nuclear materials at Lawrence Livermore National Lab. And before that he was employed by a now-defunct company, KMS Fusion, working with plasmas and building X-ray detectors. “Most scientists, particularly experimentalists, get channeled into a narrow part of the field that they try to become more and more of an expert on,” says Kahn, who has worked with Hailey in the past. “But Dr. Hailey has always had very broad interests.” Even now, NuSTAR is not the only project Hailey is working on.
Hailey also leads the General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS) project at the University of California, Los Angeles, which seeks to detect dark matter, the unseen force which makes up more than 90 percent of the known universe's mass. “Dark matter is the most outstanding mystery in particle physics,” says Stefano Profumo, an astro-particle physicist at the University of California, Santa Cruz. “It's the clearest evidence that we don't understand the whole of particle physics.”
GAPS, which completed its first test-run in northern Japan last summer, uses a large balloon to lift a five-foot cube of detectors into the earth's upper atmosphere. The detectors, like a giant Geiger counter, attempt to capture a type of antimatter particle called antideuterons, which some physicists think are the debris created when dark matter collides with itself.
Hailey thinks that GAPS will be key to narrowing down the possible candidates for dark matter's composition. But he concedes that due to dark matter's unknown nature, nobody knows for sure. “Depending on the exact nature of dark matter, you may or may not produce antideuterons,” says Hailey. But Profumo agrees that the antimatter particle is a likely byproduct. “In the best models that have a dark matter candidate, you should produce antideuterons.”
GAPS has other limitations too. Some exotic cosmic sources, such as evaporating black holes, are hypothesized to be originators of antideuterons and could give a false reading. “But I think it's a fantastic experiment,” says Profumo. “The production of antideuterons wouldn't conclusively point to dark matter, but it would add a very important piece to the puzzle.”
Though Hailey is investigating crucial questions in physics, his work, he says, is far from glamorous. He talks about the endless days he spent doing tedious measurements, helping to design and build the telescope optics for NuSTAR over 14 years. “It's hard, dirty business,” says Hailey. “You're slumping glass, putting it together with epoxy, taking measurements, and you're not doing any astrophysics.”
Even circumventing the polishing-problem, he says, building NuSTAR required an exasperating level of detailed precision and time. By the final stages of developing NuSTAR's optics, “the work was so painful and so hard to do.” But Hailey gestures, smiling, toward his photograph of the galactic center. “But after two months of NuSTAR's flight, I said to myself, my God, this was worth 14 years of my life.”
The payoff for Hailey is the new data pouring in every day from NuSTAR, which includes newly discovered black holes, information on recent supernovae and images of the galactic center. “Every time I look at a piece of data, I look at something that nobody has ever seen before,” says Hailey. “It's like pure heaven to go after this.”
Received my package sometime this week. Couldn't open it seeing as how I was away on vacation for Christmas with family. Came home to a nice plump package waiting to be opened. First thing I notice is minions figures taped on the inside of the box. My Santa must have found my subscription to /r/minionhate. Inside I got an Xbox One controller stand, NASA stickers, 'An astronaut's guide to life on earth', Beer nuts (I ate them all and damn were they good), Some warheads candy (also pretty much all gone), A Master Chief figure, a POP! heads vault boy, a beer opener (Beer nuts brand, we don't have these in AZ so I'm actually really excited about the beer opener), A SPACE PEN (OH FUCK YES), and Bentley a NEW toy. He was so excited to get his new toy and is very protective of it already. He usually rips the foam out within a few hours but this one is the kind that can't be ripped so he loves that he can't ruin it within minutes. Overall this was an excellent gift with a lot of thought put into it. I look forward to reading this book!
Overall: A perfect 5/7
Purse opened its doors last year with a fantastic idea. They unite people with bitcoin to spend with people with unwanted or unused Amazon gift cards or other discounts (sometimes neither one) to purchase with.
How Purse Works
Like most incredible ideas the one underpinning the Purse business model is an incredibly simple one and one that has been the model of hundreds of traders for years. However traders lacked a solid platform tailored for this. You can still do the very same thing on Paxful, Bitwallet, Localbitcoins.com, and other peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms however not without sacrifice. When a trader exchanges an Amazon.com purchase bit a defined amount of bitcoin, the only way to utilize the escrow services these platforms provide is to let the escrow sit. Escrows sitting hurt trader statistics and inadvertently hurt the party with the bitcoin to spend by adding copious amounts of hours on top of their release (escrow release) times. These platforms also do not integrate with Amazon.com.
This is where Purse fits like a glove. Purse is fully integrated with Amazon.com and escrow times waiting on shipment deliveries do not hurt statistics.
The way this works is that an individual with bitcoin to spend makes an Amazon.com wish-list. They then post that list along with a desired price in bitcoin to the Purse marketplace. The Amazon.com buyer, typically armed with gift cards, discounts, and a long-standing Prime account (free shipping) comes along and accepts the wish-list. The Amazon.com purchaser pays for the item(s) and enter the order number followed by the tracking number when available.
Amazon then delivers the merchandise to the bitcoin seller who reviews the delivery and finally releases the bitcoin from escrow and the order is complete.
The traders then leave feedback for each other much like eBay but without words. There are three simple options, positive, negative, and neutral.
The Purse Amazon.com for Bitcoin Market
The Purse Process User1 wanting to purchase something from Amazon.com and has bitcoin to spend creates an Amazon wish list. User1 sends enough bitcoin to cover the purchase with shipping and sets the rate he or she would like to trade the bitcoin for wish-list-purchase for. User2 wanting to purchase a wish-list in exchange for bitcoin chooses from a list of available offers and selects User1's request. User1's bitcoin are then placed in escrow with Purse as the additional signature. The order is placed by User2 and User2 updates Purse with the order number. 4.1 Amazon.com completes fulfillment and notifies all parties of shipment. The shipping company (FedEx, UPS, USPS, etc...) delivers the order and notifies all parties of its delivery. User1 reviews the shipment for accuracy and once satisfied, releases the bitcoin in escrow to User2. At this point both users can then leave feedback for each other.
Purse orders earning bitcoin
Purse also offers 5% off any order from Amazon.com instantly as a direct purchase instead of going through a listed vendor or peer, however the real savings are using the aforementioned technique.
New Merchant Services Purse has furthered their platform now to include merchant services. Think Amazon.com and eBay but using bitcoin to make payment.
With 21 Marketplace for developers and Openbazaar for discreet purchases both opening this week It's fitting to see the Purse merchant Marketplace open this week as well.

Summary We'll put together a tutorial for creating listings but it's very straight forward. If you've ever listed something on Purse or eBay, you've already got the process down since its very similar and you can sell new or used items on the Purse Marketplace.
Purse has done great job with this so far. It's clean, attractive, well thought out, and the wish-list portion that [has] been in production for a while now appears to be successful so far. The ease-of-use from a sellers perspective is exceptional with just a single easy-to-understand user interface that allows a quick and streamlined product listing experience.
Due to the marketplace portion of the platform being brand new (we created the above example this morning) we cannot comment on the process past listing but will provide more information on that in the future.
If you're looking to spend bitcoin or sell for bitcoin Purse is certainly worth looking into and giving a try. This week in general has been phenominal for buyers and sellers in the bitcoin space since there has been three platforms introduced. Purse being the more likely candidate for mainstream use.

North Korea has said it will reopen an investigation into the fate of Japanese nationals it abducted decades ago, Japanese PM Shinzo Abe has said.
Mr Abe announced the move after days of talks between officials in Sweden.
Japan says North Korea abducted several of its citizens in the 1970s and 1980s to train spies - including learning the Japanese language and behaviour.
Tokyo said it would relax some sanctions against Pyongyang once the probe had been reopened.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said that Japan would also consider providing humanitarian aid to North Korea, depending on how the investigation progressed.

He said that once it had recommenced, Tokyo would lift restrictions on travel, allow remittances to North Korea and lift an embargo on the entry to Japanese ports of North Korea-flagged ships with humanitarian missions.
Mr Suga said that such a move would not be a contravention of UN sanctions against North Korea.
'Overall solution'
Mr Abe told a news conference that Japan's "mission will never end until the day comes when families of all abduction victims are able to embrace their children with their own arms".
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Suga announced a series of measures that would benefit North Korea once the investigation got under way
"We have tackled the problem with this determination and we hope that this will be the first step toward an overall solution."
North Korea has returned five of the abductees and says the rest are dead - but Japan does not believe this.
The Japanese prime minister said that as a result of his talks, the North Korean side promised to make a "comprehensive and overall investigation" into Japanese abduction victims and missing people where the "possibility of being abducted cannot be ruled out".
"In keeping with the promise, it will set up a special commission for the investigation," he said.
North Korea has admitted kidnapping 13 Japanese nationals. It allowed five to return to Japan in 2002 and later released their children, but says the other eight died.
Japan says that eight men and nine women are officially recognised to have been abducted, but correspondents say there could be many more victims,
The most high profile of the eight who died is Megumi Yokota, who was kidnapped by North Korean agents on her way home from school in 1977, when she was 13.
North Korea says she married a South Korean abductee and had a daughter before killing herself in 1994.
North Korea returned what it said were her remains in 2004 but DNA tests subsequently disputed that claim.
There has been considerable talk about the 35-year old Frank Lampard leaving Chelsea at the end of the current season as part of the Jose Mourinho house-cleaning that might also include John Terry and Ashley Cole. In fact, rumours of Lampard joining the Los Angeles Galaxy in the MLS have been spread over the past two seasons.
Furthermore, the recent run of injuries Steven Gerrard has been accumulating over three of the past four seasons serves as a nagging reminder that at 33 years old, the next injury could also be his last.
It is not inconceivable that this season might be the final chance to examine how these two celebrated British footballers are currently performing on a head-to-head basis. Are they still producing numbers worthy of their prominent history and does another EPL season seem realistic for the future of either or both of these two players?
Editors Note: This article was written before the Chelsea-Tottenham game so the statistics are up to 7th March 2014
Gerrard Vs Lampard: Comparing the Numbers
It is important to recognise from the outset of this analysis that there is a very large discrepancy in the game minutes that each of these players has accumulated during the first 28 league matches this season.
Steven Gerrard has played 80.3 percent of the minutes available while Frank Lampard has been able to accumulate only 55.4 percent over the same period. The reason for this incongruity is found in the very different roles they are playing for their respective clubs.
Steven Gerrard is clearly the linchpin for Brendan Rogers in connecting the wingers and forwards in the aggressive Liverpool attack. Gerrard is selected for the Reds starting eleven whenever he is healthy.
Frank Lampard has not been so fortunate. Jose Mourinho's voluminous midfield selection has often excluded Lampard as a starter for league play in favor of a sporadic substitute role or in a more prominent role only during cup play. As a result Lampard's opportunity for “minutes” has been comparatively limited this season for EPL games.
In order to accommodate the large advantage of Gerrard's game minutes over that of Lampard's, the quality of metric performance will be added to the cumulative metric numbers in the performance comparisons. So, as an example, when I examine passing performance, the number of successful passes as well as the efficiency of passes completed will be included.
Gerrard Vs Lampard: Establishing Statistical Difference
Additionally, in comparing performance metrics, we are going to supplement some of the more amenable metrics with statistical analysis. And by amenable, I mean if the sample size of measures for the specific metric is sufficiently large. If so, the statistical difference reflected by the numbers will be presented in terms of the odds or chances of these differences normally occurring. This will elevate the findings beyond an opinion of whether one player outshines the other to a clinical analysis looking for statistical superiority. Here is what I mean:
In sports analytics, as in most statistical analyses, the most common accepted value for establishing a statistical significance is when the difference or relationship you are examining could have normally occurred by chance only 5% of the time or less. Or, to say it another way, it would have to be so rare that the odds of it occurring are 20 to one. Here are a few examples of common chance events:
The ability to accurately call the flip of a fair coin would be 50% (1 in 2) or to predict the correct suit of a card would be 25% (1 in 4), or to predict the exact card to be drawn out of a full deck would be less than 2% (1 in 52).
So, the standard of statistical significance is quite conservative and is not a normally encountered event. It suggests special circumstances. That is, very different from normal circumstances. It is more natural to expect no statistically significant difference.
Here are findings across the game metrics examined for Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard that include passing, creativity and attacking.
Gerrard Vs Lampard: Passing
Gerrard completes 1253 of 1465 open play passes compared to Lampard's 725 of his 880 attempts. Their open play passing accuracy seems very similar: 85.5% to 82.4%, respectively. However, this 3.1% difference is based upon a very large sample of data—enough to establish that Gerrard performs at a significantly superior level than Lampard. In fact, the chance that this 3.1% difference would normally occur is only one time in 23 or approximately 4%.
Additionally, for midfielders who typically play in a central role or just behind the front line like Gerrard and Lampard, the most critical passing occurs in the final third of the pitch. In this situation Gerrard is better than Lampard by an 11.3% difference — 73.3 to 62.0%, respectively. The chance of this large difference occurring normally is only one time in 1639! Again, Gerrard's performance is significantly superior to Lampard's in passing accuracy in the final third of the pitch.
Gerrard Vs Lampard Creativity
Although Gerrard is achieving 12 out of his 17 successful dribbles compared to Lampard's 6 out of 10 attempts, this 70.6% to 60% advantage is not statistically significant because of the small number of measures. The odds of this outcome are less than 2 to 1 and are quite common. Remember the importance of sample size? There is simply not enough information to be conclusive.
A similar outcome occurs when contrasting crossing skills. Although Lampard's crossing accuracy of 41.0% (26 completions out of 64 attempts) is superior to Gerrard's 28.0% (37 completions out of 131 attempts), it also fails to achieve the standards of statistical significance. It can be viewed as a statistically interesting difference although not clinically significant (close but no prize). The chance of this difference occurring is about 8% or one in 12. It's different, but not different enough to conclude that Lampard's crossing is significantly better than Gerrard.
So, what different performance metrics might Lampard have delivered a statistically significant difference in crossing success percentage? Here are two hypothetically possible ways:
If Lampard had completed 28 instead of 26 of his 64 cross attempts, he would have improved his completion percentage to 43.8%. This higher 15.5% advantage would have established a statistically significant difference—one that would only occur one time in 32 occasions or about a 3% chance event. A second way would be for Lampard to have achieved exactly the same percentage of successful crosses (41%) but to have made more attempts. The exact breakdown would be 48 successful crosses in120 total attempts. This would yield a statistically significant outcome of occurrence of exactly a one chance in 20.
The chances created in open play (including assists) illustrates that Gerrard has created more opportunities than Lampard for his team-mates in terms of both quantity—53 to 26 total chances —and frequency of supply—38 to 54 minutes between chances.
The clear-cut chances supplied by the two are very sparse because these events, like goal assists, are relatively rare events. Clear-cut chances supplied represents goal scoring opportunities that the player provides for his teammates that is viewed as a one-on-one situation. Gerrard outshone Lampard 7 chances to 1 in this category. No statistical comparison is offered given the sparse number of events, however, the raw numerical difference is difficult to ignore.
For central midfielders, goal assists are one of the most important performance measures. Unfortunately, the small sample size allows very little deconstruction of this metric. Contrasting Gerrard's 9 assists with Lampard's 3 is, at first glance, overwhelming. However, the fact that 7 of the Gerrard's assists were from set plays needs a bit of moderation in assessing. Gerrard's role with Liverpool is to take almost every set piece with the exception of those he shares with Luis Suarez when the location is close to the area. Conversely, Lampard's current role has been changed from the primary choice of taking almost all set pieces to being, at best, second choice to Eden Hazard. The opportunity differential is, again, an important point to note.
Gerrard Vs Lampard: Attacking
Shooting accuracy—the ratio of shots on target/total shots—gives Gerrard a 13.1% advantage over Lampard (65.6% to 52.5%). Even though Lampard played less than 70% of Gerrard's game minutes, he shoota much more frequently. Lampard ventured a shot on goal roughly every 35 minutes while Gerrard's frequency reflected a more economical rate of once every 63 minutes.
Regardless, Gerrard's edge in accuracy (21 shots on target out of 32 shots taken) was not sufficient to establish a statistically significant margin over Lampard's 21 on target shots out of a total of 40 shots taken. The chance that this 13.1% margin could have occurred for the sample of shots taken was about 26% or one chance in 4. There is no statistically significant difference between Gerrard and Lampard's shooting accuracy. Repeat after me: “Damn those small samples.”
Shooting effectiveness or chance conversion—the ratio of the percent of goals scored/shots on target—yield very similar results to the shooting accuracy. Again, Gerrard converted 8 of his 32 shots (25.0%) into goals compared to Lampard's 5 out of 40 (12.5%). The statistical chance of this difference occurring is less than one in six or about 17%. The conclusion, once again, is that Gerrard and Lampard do not display statistically different shooting effectiveness. Keep in mind the number of events in the sample. It is always an important and mitigating factor in the determination of statistical significance.
The final metric is clear-cut chances or shots that have been described as “can't miss” (but sometimes are) or sitters. Steven Gerrard encountered and converted 6 out of 7 of these opportunities (85.7%) compared with Frank Lampard's success rate of 2 out of 4 (50.0%). Again, we suffer the fate of small sample sizes when dealing with attempting to establish statistically significant differences and, alas, we cannot. The chance of this difference occurring given our miniscule sample sizes are about one chance in 5 or 20%.
Gerrard Vs Lampard: Conclusion
Even with the disparity of playing opportunity, with the exception of Gerrard's superior overall passing skills, including those especially critical in the attacking third, it was not possible to establish a convincing statistical superiority in performance between the two warhorse midfielders. However, the consistent numerical advantage that Gerrard displays over Lampard across most measures begins to tell a story about whether it is statistically supported or not. It is important to not ignore the steady advantage of performance that the numbers illustrate even though they are only descriptively compelling. The story told does not seem to waver.
Nevertheless, the conditions of opportunity have played a major role in this season's impact on the two players. While Steven Gerrard is currently enjoying one of his best seasons in years as Liverpool look to him as the centerpiece of its attack in each and every game, the conditional playing opportunities offered Frank Lampard paints a different and not so promising future at Chelsea.
It is a fair bet that at Anfield on April 27th, given the current title race, the seasons last game between Liverpool and Chelsea might be one of the most memorable in years between these two great players—and very likely the last with their respective teams for one of them.
As Sweden crumbles under the weight of an unassimilable minority, as the Swedish foreign minister claims that her country is facing collapse due to a flood of refugees, my thoughts flash back to 1998, and a lengthy, contentious dinner I had with one of the preeminent progenitors of multiracial and multicultural Sweden: Fransesca Quartey. Fransesca is, and was already by 1998, a superstar in Sweden, one of that nation's most popular actresses. She certainly stood out; her mother was a white Swedish native who, as a teen, had a child with a Ghanaian immigrant. Growing up in Gothenburg, there were not a lot of black/mixed-race Swedish stage, film, and TV stars, so when Quartey hit the big time, it was a big deal. Her ascent in the Swedish entertainment industry was fueled in part by a society that, ashamed as it is of its homogeneity, wanted to flaunt its nascent diversity.
In 1998, Quartey came to L.A. to see if her Swedish credits could transfer to an acting career in the U.S. You can probably guess how well that went. What constituted a novelty in Sweden was par for the course over here; sometimes it's best to remain a big black fish in a small white pond.
As Quartey struggled to find career success in Hollywood, she met my then girlfriend, a low-level filmmaker who bragged about her “big-time Jewish movie-producer boyfriend.” And before you could say abracashiksa, I found myself roped into a dinner with Quartey and my girlfriend at a trendy restaurant in Santa Monica. I was, of course, expected to be on my best behavior. And why not? All I was planning to do was recommend a few talent agents and throw in some meaningless motivational boilerplate to sugarcoat the reality that she had practically no chance of getting representation in this town when her only calling cards were brown skin and a rÃ©sumÃ© that read like the Swedish Chef's recipe for kroppkakor.
“If you can force a rocket scientist, celebrating the accomplishment of a lifetime, to cry and grovel and beg forgiveness on international TV for wearing a shirt, you are not unempowered.”
Somewhere in between the appetizer and the main course, Quartey decided to go off on a tangent about her ultimate goal, the thing she was going to leverage her stardom to achieve. Now that she”d been “accepted” by the Swedes, her plan was to use her clout to transform the country into a multicultural mecca in which the old traditions and culture would be jettisoned for a new “afro-Sweden.” Quartey seemed genuinely hostile toward the native Swedes. “They think they run the place,” she exclaimed, “but look out! The immigrants are coming and so is a new Sweden. We”re gonna make that country unrecognizable.”
I knew if I said anything, I”d be in the doghouse with my girlfriend for at least a week, but I couldn't”t resist. I asked a simple, one-word question: “Why?”
Quartey stopped cold. She froze. In the echo chamber that was her life, I honestly don”t think this was a question she”d ever been asked.
“What do you mean?” she sputtered.
“Why change such an old and indigenous culture? A nation that has welcomed you with open arms, a people who have inhabited the land since prehistory, a people far more indigenous than the bare-assed hut-dwelling natives of the Amazon. The Swedes have given you a good life; why destroy what they have?”
Hot damn, did things get unpleasant at the table from that point on. Quartey accused me of being racist, but to me, I saw my views as being anything but. As a child of the “70s, I was raised during a time when protecting “indigenous peoples” was all the rage. Native Americans were no longer portrayed as savages in two-dimensional Western films; they were a noble, wronged people, the voice of reason and conscience in films like The Outlaw Josey Wales, Little Big Man, and Buffalo Bill and the Indians. Internationally, the collapse of European colonialism led to nightly media cheerleading about indigenous Africans “getting their countries back.” Simultaneously, we cheered one group of Indians in North America for fighting back against white genocide, and we booed a different group of Indians in Africa as they were punished by Idi Amin for not staying in their own damn country. Because it was all about the indigenousness.
Granted, the media hacks rarely pointed out in those days (as they never point out now) that white people are the indigenous people of Europe, but when I finally figured that out on my own, I merely applied the same standards of indigenous rights that the 1970s had drilled into me regarding “people of color.”
But Quartey wasn't”t buying it. I was a racist, and dammit, Sweden was going to change, whether it wanted to or not. Within a year, Quartey was back home and fomenting the cultural revolution she sought. I never saw her again, but I emailed her last week, to get her opinion, seventeen years later, of the current state of affairs in “diverse,” “multiracial” Sweden. She flatly refused to discuss the matter. This young lady who was so chatty, so eager to opine, in 1998, is silent now, as Sweden is rocked by internal strife and destabilization.

“[Trade-unions] seem natural to the passing phase of social evolution, and may have beneficial functions under existing conditions. . . .”
If you guessed some wily labor leader or social democrat, you are wrong. British laissez-faire advocate Herbert Spencer (1820-1903) wrote those words in his Principles of Sociology (1896). Spencer was the most prominent and respected individualist philosopher of his time. To this day his voluminous scholarly and popular writing remains an important resource for adherents of the freedom philosophy.
Spencer's statement, then, may surprise some readers. It shouldn't. Our libertarian forebears put the plight of workers at the top of their concerns. In England feudalism had not entirely disappeared, many people had been pushed off the land through enclosure, and true laissez faire was nowhere in evidence. Neomercantilism, or what Albert Jay Nock called the “Merchant-state,” was the rule. For example, early in the Industrial Revolution worker “combinations” were outlawed in England and people were not free leave their home parishes in search of better employment opportunities, something decried by Adam Smith. When these laws were finally repealed, workers were hampered by other state interventions, such as land engrossment, patents, government-backed banking cartels, and tariffs. To be sure, living standards improved, but to the extent that government stifled free competition, workers were deprived of bargaining power and their full free-market reward.
Spencer is famous for setting out a theory of social evolution, according to which society was moving from the rigidly hierarchical “militant” type to the open, contract-based “industrial” type. Society was still in transition and had a long way to go. (See my “Austrian Exploitation Theory.” )
Suppressed Competition
Spencer begins his discussion of unions by noting that worker guilds (like employers) historically preferred suppression of competition to the uncertainties of market rivalry. He criticizes the hypocrisy of workers who applaud competition that lowers the price of bread, but oppose competition that lowers the price of labor. He also argues that agitation for higher wages, if successful throughout the economy, would do workers no good because prices and hence the cost of living would rise as a consequence. (This analysis requires some assumptions that may not in fact hold.)
But he also notes that “[u]nder their original form as friendly societies—organizations for rendering mutual aid–[unions] were of course extremely beneficial; and in so far as they subserve this purpose down to the present time, they can scarcely be too much lauded.”
Nevertheless Spencer asks: “Must we say that while ultimately failing in their proposed ends [higher wages], trade-unions do nothing else than inflict grave mischiefs in trying to achieve them?”
His response: “This is too sweeping a conclusion. . . . There is an ultimate gain in moral and physical treatment if there is no ultimate gain in wages.” For example:
Judging from their harsh and cruel conduct in the past, it is tolerably certain that employers are now prevented from doing unfair things which they would else do. Conscious that trade-unions are ever ready to act, they are more prompt to raise wages when trade is flourishing than they would otherwise be; and when there come times of depression, they lower wages only when they cannot otherwise carry on their businesses.
Knowing the power which unions can exert, masters are led to treat the individual members of them with more respect than they would otherwise do: the status of the workman is almost necessarily raised. Moreover, having a strong motive for keeping on good terms with the union, a master is more likely than he would else be to study the general convenience of his men, and to carry on his works in ways conducive to their health.
He thinks unions are necessary because: “Everywhere aggression begets resistance and counter-aggression; and in our present transitional state, semi-militant and semi-industrial, trespasses have to be kept in check by the fear of retaliatory trespasses.”
Spencer, however, is not satisfied with this state of affairs. Recall that he says trade-unions belong to “a passing phase of social evolution.” Passing to what?
Worker-Owned Firms
He is attracted to alternatives to the standard “master-and-workman type of industrial organization” and discusses at length profit-sharing arrangements, pointing out both their advantages and disadvantages. (On a related issue, see this and this.) But these too leave him unsatisfied.
Thus he foresees the emergence of “self-governing combinations of workers,” which, while not without problems, would avoid most of the drawbacks of traditional firms:

In an exciting technological breakthrough, German engineers have developed a 3D printed bionic hand that contains simulated muscles made from ‘smart' wires.
So far, bionic hands have been heavy and packed full of motors and generators, making truly functioning prosthetic fingers untenable. The 3D printing breakthrough uses lighter electric wires to power and control the hand, making it more functional for the user.
This has been made possible through advances in 3D printing. Three-dimensional printing describes several types of additive processes. Here, successive layers of material (normally polymers) are laid down under computer control. 3D printers are now so advanced that they are, in effect, industrial robots.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLn7uNRBBZc
The new breakthrough was devised by Professor Stefan Seelecke of the Saarland University. The hand-like device is composed of very thin nickel-titaninum wires (Nitinol), embedded in plastic.
Talking to a specialist science website, Professor Seelecke is quoted as saying: “So we can build systems with those that can be like bio-inspired, look-to-nature for a successful prototype, and that's what we realized with this first prototype of a robotic hand using shape-memory alloy wires.”
When an electric charge is applied to the ‘shape memory alloys', the hand contracts. When the charge is removed, the hand relaxes. This type of invention is the stepping stone to try bionics for people who have lost part of a limb.
The goal of the project is to reproduce bionics in ways that are cheap, lightweight, and functional. It seems the researchers led by Professor Seelecke are getting close to something doing remarkable.
In my last post, “Stock Photography and Selling Photos Online for Beginners,” I gave an introduction on which stock photography websites I like to use and also named a few others that are out there you can try. Now with this post I want to better prepare yourself, so that you can learn from my own mistakes and get a better understanding on how stock photography works.
Key Word List
Every stock photography website requires you to add relevant keywords to your photos, so that customers can find exactly what they're looking for. I would recommend that you start to build a separate Word document composed of the keywords you have chosen for each photo, so that you don't create any extra work in the long run. By doing this, you will be able to use the same keywords for each of the websites that you decide to use and help with new photos in the future. Knowing this a head of time would have helped me tremendously in the beginning because I was constantly trying to think of keywords, but couldn't, because of the mental exhaustion of working with so many photos and different websites at one time. I also recommend if you do run into writer's block when it comes to keywords, go to some of the stock photography websites and see what keywords other photographer are using for similar photos to yours.
Commercial or Editorial
After uploading your photos, every website gives you the option to upload them for either commercial (Royal Free) or editorial purposes. The commercial or Royal Free option should always be the first route to take, but only if you do not have any recognizable people, logos, brand names, recognizable private property, or anything else that might be questionable as “private,” unless you obtain a release form. Now if your photo can not be submitted for commercial purposes, this is where the Editorial option comes in and should be used when release forms can't be obtained.
Model and Property Releases
Every stock photography website requires a release form for any recognizable person or private property that is composed in your shoot. Make sure if you plan on using a person (model) in your shot, that you ask them to sign a release form at the end of the photo session, otherwise you may not be able to use the photo for commercial purposes. Every website offers a release form that you can easily download and print. They are usually really simple, just follow the instructions and submit them with your photos when you are ready to upload them. If it is a picture of yourself, you will still have to submit a release form, but again it's really simple and you should have no problems. Now if you're taking a photo of private property, like a famous monument or somebody's house, you may be required to submit a release form, but I have noticed that every website has different standards and you may just have to use the trial and error method to see what they do and do not accept when selling the photos commercial. When in doubt you can always submit every photo that you can't obtain a release form, as editorial use only. Most of the time, your photo shouldn't come back as rejected, but again, every website is different.
Exclusive Option
You may also notice that the websites offer an “exclusive option” for your photo. If you choose to go this route with your photos, you will make more money, but you are not allowed to upload those photos to any other stock photography websites or offer them for sale on your own website. Exclusive means your photo can only be available for sale on the stock photography website that you choose to go exclusive on. Of course you can always opt out of this option whenever you choose, but as long as that photo is marked as exclusive you must follow their policy or face possibly account termination. I personally do not like this option because I like to sell my photos on as many different websites as I can to better my chances. But the choice is yours and I only wanted to mention it because the option is out there.
Highest Quality
After submitting your photos to a stock website and they are approved, you will start to see that different sizes and qualities are available for the customers to purchase. The bigger and higher quality of photo, the more money you make when they are purchased. So because of this I recommend that you shoot your photos in the highest quality possible and also when you are editing them, save them in the highest quality. The best option if possible, is shooting your photos is RAW format because it gives you the highest quality and you have full control over the photo when editing them in an external software. However, by doing this, the file size of each photo will be much larger and you will need plenty of available space on your SD card during your photo shoots. Of course it's not required to shoot your photos in RAW, as you can still have much success shooting them in any format that you see fit.
Tax Forms and ID's
Every website does require you to fill out tax forms in order to get paid because federal law requires any income earned, must be claimed on your yearly tax submission, but only if it's over a certain amount. It's not something to stress about, the process is simple and every website assists you with this. Also, keep in mind some of the websites also require you to submit an ID, such a driver's license, to verify your identity.
Copyrights
You as the photographer retain all copyrights to your artwork whenever submitting your photos to stock photography websites. You are only selling royalties to use the photo and never actually selling the copyrights. However, some of the websites such as Dreamstime, do offer the option to actually sell the copyright at a price you set.
Patience
If you have a lot of photos from previous years that you want to submit online, have patience because it will take time and a lot of work in the beginning to get your portfolio how you want it. I myself had over 6,000 photos in the beginning that I had to sort through and clean up before getting them ready for submission. It took me a few months before I was completely finished uploading all of them, but now I don't have to do anything else and they're out there in the cyber abyss working for me. Don't give up and if you have a lot of photos in the beginning like me, just do a few each day, so you won't get burned out.
Keep in Mind
After submitting photos to a stock website, every photo has to be approved by a representative on their end. The turnaround time varies with each company and I have noticed that there isn't really a time frame set in stone for any of them. I have seen photos being approved/rejected within hours of submission or as long as several weeks. So don't worry about this and just keep uploading more photos in the meantime.
Don't get Discouraged
Sooner or later as you continue to upload your photos online, you will have some that come back as rejected for any reason that the website provider decides. But don't worry because if one website rejects a photo, another one might not, so just continue to throw it out there and see what sticks. This has happened to me a lot and if the same photo gets rejected from multiple websites, I archive it and take the opportunity to learn how to better my photo shoot in the future. Some of our biggest successes come from our biggest failures.
The amount of money you could be making every month is limitless and your success depends completely on you. The money is small in the beginning, but over time it starts to add up. One of the biggest benefits from using stock is that once your portfolio is established, you do not have to do anything else. You can sit back and watch the money roll in, as all your efforts and hard work is finally paying off. Of course you can always continue to add to your portfolio as new pictures are composed, and I believe that the more pictures you have out there, the better chance and more money you will make in the future. So what are you waiting for? Get out there and start making some extra dollars today, because I can tell you first hand, it works!
If you have any questions or would like to share your experiences with stock photography, I encourage you to please leave a comment below.

Though Internet Explorer 9 has made great strides in improving Internet Explorer's standard support, and version 10 is similarly set to include a whole range of new features, one thing that Microsoft hasn't even touched is WebGL, a specification that allows webpages to create 3D graphics using an API based on the venerable OpenGL API. A blog post today from the company's security engineers may explain why: they don't think there's any way to implement it safely.
Three main concerns are enumerated in the post: WebGL exposes too much sensitive, privileged, or unhardened code to the Web; depends too heavily on third-party code for security; and is too susceptible to denial of service attacks. The first of these is perhaps most significant. Video hardware and video drivers are traditionally only exposed to relatively "trusted" code—programs that the user has explicitly chosen to install. Display drivers are notoriously unstable and buggy, and developers of 3D software have to go to quite some effort to ensure their programs do not use (or misuse) the 3D hardware in such a way as to cause problems.
Webpages often contain hostile code, deliberately written to provoke bugs and flaws in software. To combat this, browsers themselves are typically hardened, through use of sandboxing, privilege reduction, and other techniques, to minimize the impact of flaws; they're also vigorously analyzed to detect such issues, and coded in such a way as to aggressively detect misuse and handle such situations safely—in no small part as a result of a long history of browser-based exploitation. In the past, video drivers have never had to face this kind of threat, and so have never been written to cope with this kind of problem, often preferring to simply trust that 3D developers will do the right thing. WebGL changes this picture, and gives hostile webpages relatively free access to attack vulnerable drivers.
This brings up the second point—many of these flaws don't exist in the WebGL specification itself, but rather in the display drivers written by ATI, NVIDIA, and Intel. This makes it difficult for a browser vendor to effectively combat them; although attacks may be delivered by the browser, it's not the browser that's being exploited. The best the browser can do is to blacklist known-vulnerable drivers, but this in turn leads to a very uneven user experience.
WebGL was not written in a vacuum, and some of these issues were considered in its design. OpenGL has also had features added that enable the underlying drivers to perform stricter validation of 3D code, with the specific intent being to make WebGL scenarios safer. Microsoft's third point is that these techniques aren't proven and are likely to be incomplete (the post specifically mentions a forthcoming OpenGL extension designed to improve WebGL security that extends an existing extension that's not sufficiently robust).
Taken together, the company says that these issues mean that any WebGL implementation would not meet the company's internal standard for software security.
Though once the idea of Microsoft rejecting something on security grounds may have been considered laughable, the substantial efforts in creating new software development methodologies and embedding security into every aspect of a product's design and development have paid off; Windows Vista and Windows 7 have both had a substantially better track record than Windows XP when it comes to security flaws, both suffering fewer flaws than Windows XP and reducing the severity of many of the bugs they do have. The reluctance to implement a specification that doesn't abide by the security guidelines that have served the company well in recent years is understandable.
Cynics might argue that the security argument is a smokescreen and that this is simply Microsoft once more rejecting an open standard in favor of its own, proprietary, Direct3D. That interpretation is harder to defend against a backdrop that has seen Microsoft actively participating in the development of HTML5 and vigorously promoting the use of open HTML5 standards—even at the expense of its own technology. The company appears to be making a good-faith effort to do the right thing, at least with regard to HTML5 and related specifications.
Microsoft also isn't alone in having a problem with the quality of video drivers. Firefox 4, like Internet Explorer 9, uses Direct2D and Direct3D to accelerate the drawing and animation of webpages. These APIs, both hardware accelerated, are heavily dependent on driver quality. Although the use of these APIs is in many ways quite controlled and restricted—it's Firefox calling them, rather than WebGL JavaScript calling them—the Firefox developers have still had to blacklist a large number of drivers, especially older ones, due to problems with crashes and screen corruption. They're simply not predictable enough or consistent enough to be usable without testing, and when they crash, the effects can be disastrous.
Redmond may face a similar issue itself; Silverlight 5, which will be used for browser-based applications among other things, will include some support for Direct3D graphics. This could open browsers up to many of the same problems as WebGL—at least for those systems with Silverlight 5 installed and enabled.
WebGL is in many ways a natural counterpart to the 2D Canvas API that many browsers—including Internet Explorer 9—support, extending browser graphics into the third dimension. Its omission is sure to earn some degree of criticism from other developers, especially as Microsoft's criticisms of WebGL are unlikely to encourage Mozilla, Google, or Apple to drop the technology. The blog post does acknowledge the desirability of WebGL-like technology, but says that the company won't implement anything that doesn't meet its security requirements. If WebGL won't, it's hard to see what will.

Each day between now and post-Super Monday, we'll roll out a get-to-the-point offseason plan for one NFL team. Today, the Bills; tomorrow, the Falcons. After that, we'll see. Here's our three-point plan for Buffalo:
1. Keep the offensive line together
The Bills made major progress up front last season. Under the tutelage of Aaron Kromer (despite a six-game suspension for allegedly punching a teenage boy in the face) and offensive coordinator Greg Roman, the unit developed as one of the strengths of the team. Offensive tackle Cordy Glenn and center Eric Wood were a big reason for that step forward. By taking a chance on guard Richie Incognito, they added one of the best players at his position at a discount. As Glenn and Incognito are slated to enter free agency this offseason, general manager Doug Whaley must do his best to keep them in town. Whaley has labeled it as “a major point of emphasis this offseason.” Buffalo is as pressed as any team with cap space, so it could be a long shot to bring back both of them. Finding creative ways to add extra padding to the cap should be one of Whaley's top priorities to keep the line intact.
Article continues below ...
2. Consider giving Tyrod Taylor an extension
Taylor earned the starting quarterback role with his impressive play, leading the Bills to an 8-6 record in 14 starts. He also became Buffalo's first Pro Bowl QB since Drew Bledsoe in 2002. His six interceptions were a league low among quarterbacks with 10-plus starts in 2015. Since Taylor played more than 50 percent of the snaps in 2015, his three-year deal became a two-year deal. Reaching that incentive gives him more leverage in contract extension talks. Whaley has said Taylor is “on the list” of players set to score a new deal despite his being on the roster for next season.
3. Release Mario Williams
Williams may have ‘checked out,' which means he could be on his way out of Buffalo.
One of the ways Whaley can improve the team's cap situation is by getting Williams off the books. If the Bills terminate his contract, they will save more than $12 million in cap room. His five sacks in 2015 were his lowest total since he arrived in Buffalo after agreeing on a six-year deal that included $50 million in guarantees back in 2012. One unnamed Bills player told the Buffalo News last month said that Williams “totally checked out” months ago. Several reports have indicated that the plan is to, in fact, release the 31-year-old defensive end. The Bills must find a way to create pressure on the quarterback. Last year's team was responsible for the lowest sack total in franchise history despite facing the most pass attempts in franchise history.

Fox News Juan Williams drops a hint: A third-party Ron Paul presidential run...?
'People don't understand the power of his supporters.'
Source - Raw Story
Fox News contributor Juan Williams on Sunday said that this was the “age of Ron Paul” during a panel discussion about the Republican presidential primary race.
Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX), a libertarian, has gained an enthusiastic following for his strong views on limited government, free market economics and non-interventionist foreign policy. In the 2008 Republican presidential primary, his views clearly made him an outlier, but — thanks in part to the tea party movement — many of his economic positions have now been adopted by mainstream Republicans.
Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume said that Paul obviously had the most passionate supporters, which was understandable considering he was a “very nice” and “thoughtful” man with interesting ideas. But he warned some of those ideas were “way too exotic for mainstream America.”
“I think the Republican Party has to worry that when all is said and done, he might figure, ‘well, I can't make it in this party, this party is not for me,' and if he goes third party in the Fall, he is not going to be taking votes away from Barack Obama,” Hume said.
“You know I think this is the age of Ron Paul in so many ways,” Williams added. “I think he is the father of the tea party, his son is in the Senate, I think you're exactly right. People don't understand the power of Ron Paul.”

As part of its pre-debate coverage, Bloomberg posted this video entitled Republican Candidates' Own Words: Ron Paul.

Locked up in the Toronto (Don) Jail over the Thanksgiving weekend — in prison for the first time in his life — Tyrone Sparks could not wrap his head around how an afternoon at his cousin's baby shower had ended with his arrest and a three-night stay in custody. “I was in shock, I was in disbelief, that I was sitting there, 31 years old, in jail — and I'd never been arrested before,” said Sparks, now 33.
Tyrone Sparks has filed a suit against the Toronto Police for his arrest and jailing on cocaine charges following a raid on a cousin's home where he'd been attending a baby shower. The charges were later dropped with no explanation. ( Chris So / Toronto Star )
“I didn't think that this was my life.” Sparks, then a tech support employee at a downtown law firm, says he spent the 2012 Thanksgiving long weekend in custody after getting caught up in a police raid of his cousin's Carleton Ave. apartment, where he was attending a baby shower. He alleges he was beaten up by Toronto police officers, arrested without being told why, slapped with two drug-related charges for items found in the apartment — charges summarily dropped a month later, without explanation.
Article Continued Below
Still reeling from an arrest he says shattered his sense of security and justice, Sparks, alongside members of his family and his former girlfriend, last week filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against the Toronto Police Services Board, Chief Bill Blair and nine officers involved in the raid. The suit claims false arrest, negligence, assault, intentional infliction of mental anguish, malicious prosecution and multiple breaches of Sparks' Charter rights. The allegations have not been tested in court, and a statement of defence has not been filed. “We have not completed our statement of defence, so I can't comment,” police spokesman Mark Pugash said in a statement. “However, it's important to note that it is not at all unusual for lawsuit claims to fail in court. Unfortunately, the Toronto Star provides a platform for unproved claims, but rarely, if ever, lets its readers know when the claims it prints are judged to be baseless.” Among the allegations contained in the statement of claim are that officers failed to consider that an innocent person could be in the apartment during the execution of a search warrant; failed to recognize that Sparks was not their target; and arrested and charged him with serious criminal offences even though they were told he did not live there.
The incident occurred on Oct. 6, 2012, when Sparks was attending a baby shower for his cousin's son, Sparks' godson. After briefly socializing with other shower attendees in the building's party room, Sparks returned to his cousin's apartment to watch some football. Partygoers came in and out, but eventually, Sparks was alone in the room. According to the claim, Sparks suddenly heard shouting, saw the beam of flashlights, then guns pointed at him. He was ordered to put his hands up, then told to lie on the ground and put his hands behind his back so he could be handcuffed, the claim states.

As officers entered the apartment, Sparks repeatedly asked what was going on, and indicated several times that he didn't live in the apartment. As the officers moved around the home, they continually refused to tell him what they were doing, the claim states. According to the claim, Sparks did not resist officers at any point, but they accused him of failing to co-operate because he did not tell them whose room he was in or the names of the children who lived there. At one point he was searched, states the claim, and an officer found a small amount of marijuana in his jacket. He also found Sparks' driver's licence, with his address. The claim also alleges the officers abused him, including that Sparks' head was hit against the ground and kicked. Sparks was taken outside and “not provided with the reason for his arrest or his rights,” the claim states. He was held overnight at 51 Division and strip-searched, according to the claim. He was charged with possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking, possession of the proceeds of crime — related to items found in the apartment — and possession of marijuana, for the small amount Sparks had in his jacket. For nearly 24 hours he was in custody, Sparks alleges, he was not allowed to contact his family or girlfriend; he only spoke briefly with Legal Aid, he said. When he arrived at the Old City Hall courts on Oct. 7, after a night in jail, he asked “anybody that will listen,” if they could contact his family. “I said, ‘Could you let them know that I'm here? Call my mother, call my girlfriend?'” Sparks said in an interview. Sparks was held because the seriousness of the charges required that he obtain a lawyer. He was transferred to the jail, where he spent two nights, until a bail hearing on Oct. 9. While in jail, Sparks was able to make a phone call and contacted his girlfriend. On Oct. 9, be been released on bail. Six weeks later, all the charges were dropped, with no discussion in court. “Directing the clerk to withdraw these charges …” said Crown Anjie Tarek-Kaminker on Nov. 26, 2012. “OK, withdrawn at the request of the Crown,” responded Justice of the Peace Sisay Woldemichael. Sparks' cousin was not arrested during the raid. He was later charged with a drug trafficking offence and possession of property obtained by crime, but both charges were dropped. After his arrest, Sparks took some time off work. When he came back, his “head wasn't in it,” he says, and he was eventually let go. He is currently unemployed. His mother, Susan Sparks, said that in the months after the arrest, the family hardly saw him. He became short with her, and he has “not been the same person” since the arrest. Sparks and his family hope the lawsuit will help bring some closure. “I am hoping for something that acknowledges that this happened,” said Sparks, “and that this shouldn't have happened.”

Figure for greater Swansea area rises by 56 as experts warn epidemic shows no sign of easing
Measles cases in south Wales have jumped by 56 in two days as experts warn the outbreak shows no sign of ending.
The headline total has reached 942 cases in the greater Swansea area with the 10-18 age group worst hit.
The latest figures come a week after the death of Gareth Williams, 25, a father of one who had measles. The results of tests to establish the cause of his death are still awaited.
A £20m programme to vaccinate 1 million children and teenagers across England has been announced.
It has been prompted by fears that the epidemic in Wales could spread across the border into England. Just as in Wales, many people missed out on the vital MMR jab and are unprotected against the spread of the disease.
In both cases, unfounded fears that the three-in-one jab was linked to autism in children were responsible for the drop in vaccination uptake.
Public Health Wales has urged teenagers preparing to sit GCSE and A-level exams to ensure they are vaccinated.
Efforts to vaccinate thousands of children and young adults who missed out in the past are still under way.
Thousands of parents have been attending weekend drop-in clinics with their children. An urgent in-school vaccination programme has also been going on to ensure children are protected against the disease.
The outbreak in Swansea is one of the biggest to have hit the UK in the past decade.
Although the outbreak is centred mainly on Swansea, rates of measles are high throughout the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University, Powys and Hywel Dda health board areas, especially in Neath Port Talbot and north Powys.
As part of the £20m programme in England, GP surgeries, schools and community programmes will be used as vaccination centres.
The campaign will target children and young people who have not had either one or two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella jab.
It comes after Public Health England revealed there were 587 confirmed measles cases in the first three months of this year in England, more than three times the 168 cases in the same period of 2012.
“Kong: Skull Island” has begun screening for press and Splash Report's Kellvin Chavez has confirmed the project scores a post-credits stinger.
He tweeted yesterday: “KONG FANS! Make sure your butts stay on your seats for an awesome awesome after credit scene from #kongskullisland It will NOT disappoint!!”
‘Skull Island' serves as the second film in a joint cinematic universe that began with Gareth Edwards' “Godzilla” reboot the other year and has Mike Dougherty's sequel “Godzilla: King of Monsters” up next with filming on that to begin June 19th in Atlanta according to Omega Underground.
It's likely the ‘Skull Island' credits scene will tease a showdown between the giant ape and the giant lizard that will eventually come with “Godzilla Vs. Kong” in 2020. Also today, check out a new TV sport for the film below:
"Nah-na-na-na-nah-na! I can see more colors than you!" I can just hear all those scrunchy-clad-pony-tailed girls taunting me on the school playground, if only they had known about the possibility of tetrachromacy in females back then...
It has been long accepted that human color vision is based on having 3 cone receptors (trichromat) red, green and blue, but since the early 90's researches have been searching for people who have four (tetrachromat). These people would have a heightened color sense and the ability to see "rare subtleties of color." Unfortunately, for half the population, it seems in order to lay claim to such super color vision you need to have two X chromosomes. So, if you've ever been in a hopeless debate with a man who easily pairs two colors as exactly the same, and to you they're clearly not the same at all, he may not be colorblind–as you may infer during this type of situation, but rather you actually see the colors differently.
Maybe We're All Tertrachromats After All
Men, don't fear, we may still be able to call ourselves tetrachromats even if we can't say we have super color vision. As it turns out humans are better described as 'blocked tertrachromats' rather than trichromats, according to one paper. A distinction is made between "retinal tetrachromacy (having four pigments in cone cells in the retina, compared to three in trichromats) and functional tetrachromacy (having the ability to make enhanced color discriminations based on that retinal difference)" (wiki) but even this widely differs from from current perceptions:
The architecture of the human visual system, along with that of most animals, is tetrachromatic. The performance of the human system at very short wavelengths is blocked by the absorption of its own optics. Therefore it can be more properly described as a blocked tetrachromat instead of a trichromat.
This paper also expands known human chromatic visual performance from past literature:
The presence of four spectrally sensitive channels in the architecture of the human visual system (even though one is partly blocked on a wavelength selective basis) is very important in research. Besides expanding the number of photoreceptor (cone) types in the Young-Helmholtz Theory, it expands the number of chromatic axes in the Hering Theory to three. Because of this expansion, a three dimensional color space is required to describe human color vision completely (without introducing the black-white axes). Such a color space is presented below.
Spectral colors with a wavelength between 300 and 437 nm are represented along the third axes drawn in the upper right. True purple occurs along this axis between 410 and 420 nm. There is a chromatic null along the third axis near 395 nm. The color at this point is defined as lilac. It plays a role similar to azure at 494 nm and "spectral yellow" at 572 nm. Within this color space, white is defined by the intersection of lilac, azure and spectral yellow. Thus white is described by three coordinates instead of the conventional two. The precise sensation of color perceived by the human visual system in the region from 300 nm to 395 nm has not been quantified. -The Human is a Blocked Tetrachromat.
The rotation of the third axis into the vertical alignment results in a two-dimensional presentation that is quite useful except when trying to illustrate mixtures of purple and green. The resulting New Chromaticity Diagram for Research is available on this site.
The Genetics
"In an odd twist of fate, the same genetic glitch that creates color-blind males may create females with better-than-usual color vision." - 'A Life More Colorful' By Cynthia Wood
"In humans, two cone cell pigment genes are located on the sex X chromosome, the classical type 2 opsin genes OPN1MW and OPN1MW2. It has been suggested that as women have two different X chromosomes in their cells, some of them could be carrying some variant cone cell pigments, thereby possibly being born as full tetrachromats and having four different simultaneously functioning kinds of cone cells, each type with a specific pattern of responsiveness to different wave lengths of light in the range of the visible spectrum. One study suggested that 2–3% of the world's women might have the kind of fourth cone that lies between the standard red and green cones, giving, theoretically, a significant increase in color differentiation. Another study suggests that as many as 50% of women and 8% of men may have four photopigments." - Tetrachromacy
Common Colorblindness Test
"Dr. Gabriele Jordan of Cambridge University tested the color perception of fourteen women who each had at least one son with the right kind of color-blindness. She set up a test where the subjects had to manipulate and blend two wavelengths of colored light to produce any hue they liked. They then had to match their own results a second time. With normal color vision, several different combinations would match any given hue, with a tetrachromat the possible combinations to produce a visible match would be much reduced. Dr. Jordan reported that two of the fourteen women showed exactly the results she would have expected from a tetrachromat. At least one of the two women reports having a different sense of color from the people around her, with both better color matching and better color memory. While not completely conclusive, this initial study has so far provided our best candidates for natural human tetrachromats." - 'A Life More Colorful' By Cynthia Wood
How Many Colors Can You See?
The accepted number of hues an average human can differentiate between is one million. Based on the same math, a functioning tetrachromats with 'super color vision' could see 100 million colors. - post-gazette.com
Mrs M - an English social worker, and the first known human "tetrachromat" - sees rare subtleties of colour. Looking at a rainbow, she can see 10 distinct colours. Most of us only see five. She was the first to be discovered as having this ability, in 1993, and a study in 2004 found that two out of 80 subjects were tetrachromats. - The Independent
Below, Simulated tetrachromatic vision (i.e. bird vision: UV=blue, Blue, Green, Red) © Dr. Klaus Schmitt
But even if we find our tetrachromats, they may not all be created equal. If the modified color receptor is sensitive to wavelengths very close to a normal receptor, then the tetrachromat would merely have slightly better color-vision. The further apart the wavelength sensitivities of the receptors, the more the tetrachromat's vision would differ from the norm. So in all probability, even among tetrachromats few have a dramatically better color sense, but for that rare exception the world may truly be a more colorful place." - 'A Life More Colorful' By Cynthia Wood

A highly critical open letter to Vladimir Putin by leaders of Ukraine's Jewish communities was published on the website of Ukraine's Vaad yesterday.
The Vaad of Ukraine was established in 1991. Based in Kiev, it is an umbrella group that says it supports “265 Jewish organizations from 94 cities of Ukraine.”
The letter, written in Russian and co-signed by 21 Jewish leaders — including the Vaad leadership, an artist, an engineer, and others — excoriated Putin's perceived hypocrisy and asserted the signers' support of Ukrainian sovereignty “in the name of national minorities and Ukraine's Jewish community.”
Since Russian troops invaded Crimea, a peninsula in southeastern Ukraine, on Saturday, Putin has justified his military action by claiming that he is acting to protect Ukraine's Russian-speaking population.
In response to these allegations, the group spoke on behalf of a Ukrainian Jewish community that is historically “mostly Russian-speaking.”
In repeated statements from the Kremlin, Putin has asserted that Ukraine's new government is composed of “fascists and neo-Nazis,” and he decried what he said was the anti-Semitism of Ukrainian protesters in his Tuesday press conference.
“Your certainty about the growth of anti-Semitism in Ukraine, which you expressed at your press conference, also does not correspond to the actual facts,” wrote the group. “Perhaps you got Ukraine confused with Russia, where Jewish organizations have noticed growth in anti-Semitic tendencies last year.”
Calling for Putin to cease his intervention in Ukraine and his calls for pro-Russian separatism within the country, the group stated that it does not wish “to be ‘defended' by sundering Ukraine and annexing its territory.”
Instead, the authors wrote, “we are quite capable of protecting our rights in a constructive dialogue and in cooperation with the government and civil society of a sovereign, democratic, and united Ukraine.”
Among the cosigned are Josef Zissels, chairman of Vaad Ukraine; Alexander Gaidar, leader of the Union of Ukrainian Progressive Judaism Religious Communities; Grigoriy Pickman, “B'nei B'rith Leopolis” president; and Leonid Finberg, director of the Center for the Study of History and Culture of Eastern European Jewry at Kiev Mohyla National University.
Scarlett Johansson has been all over the headlines recently as many accuse her of having a conflict of interest by representing the Israeli-based company, SodaStream, and serving as an ambassador for Oxfam. That fact alone combined with her stunning beauty makes her interesting to many, but there are at least 10 more ways that the superstar stands out.
1. Johansson is a twin. Born alongside her brother, Hunter Johansson, on November 22, 1984, Scarlett has the edge as the older sibling by just three minutes. It seems that the pair both have a bit of the acting bug, as they appeared together in the 1996 dramatic comedy Manny & Lo. They also have an older brother, Adrian, who was born in 1976.
2. Johannson attended the famed Manhattan Professional Children's School. The school claims a number of stars among its graduates, including the likes of Carrie Fisher and Sarah Michelle Gellar.
3. She was rejected by New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. The now superstar was reportedly turned down in 2003, and following the rejection decided to just focus on her career. By all accounts, it seems to have worked out alright for her in the long run.
4. Johansson is a talented and accomplished singer. She recorded an album of Tom Waits covers in 2007 titled Anywhere I Lay May Head. Also in 2007, she reportedly joined the Jesus and Mary Chain on stage at the Coachella music festival. She released a second album, Break Up, in 2009 that consisted of a collection of duets with Pete Yorn. In addition, a song she recorded, Before My Time, for the film Chasing Ice was nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Song in 2013.
5. Johansson landed her first television appearance at the age of 8 when she appeared in a skit on Late Night With Conan O'Brian in 1993.
6. Johansson was deemed just too beautiful to pull off the role of Lisbeth Salander in the film adaptation of Stieg Larsson's best-selling novel The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.
7. A fact that is perhaps known to many, but may have been forgotten by some, will be interesting to both fans of Johansson and fans of another superstar, Ryan Reynolds. The two were quietly married in 2008 and quietly divorced thereafter in 2011. Johansson is currently engaged to a French journalist, Romain Dauriac.
8. Johannson's political interests are not just limited to her work with Oxfam. She has been a staunch supporter of President Obama throughout both of his terms of service. She even spoke in support of Obama at the 2012 Democratic National Convention.
9. Lindsay Lohan beat out Johansson for the lead in Disney's 1998 remake of the classic The Parent Trap. Fans of both stars can only speculate as to how the two actors' trajectories to stardom may have been different had Johansson won out.
10. Johannson is terrified of cockroaches. She reportedly woke up with one on her face at one time and now can't abide the mere thought of the creeping creatures.
Johansson has proved herself interesting as an actress from the time of her earliest film debut in 1994's North. Perhaps these 10 facts will serve to make her even more interesting to the masses as a human being.

Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and a sizable entourage will leave Ottawa on Saturday night for a Middle East trip that will include visits to Israel, the West Bank and Jordan.
The visit to Israel will be Harper's first since his election in 2006. While in Israel, he will address the Knesset - the first Canadian prime minister to do so. He will also receive an honorary degree from Tel Aviv University.
Harper's spokesman, Jason MacDonald, said the prime minister would promote commercial relations, as well as peace and security in the region, when he meets Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other leaders, as well as the King of Jordan.
Harper is known as a passionate supporter of Israel and can be expected to receive a glowing reception from Israeli leaders.

Yesterday, we brought you Ken Levine's explanation of BioShock: Infinite's 1999 mode. The response was, perhaps inevitably, divided. Here's the second part of my chat with him, in which he anticipates that, as well as addressing the fact he can only offer a biased opinion of his game, the problem with out of context headlines, tennis in BioShock, why SWAT 4 would have been a very different game under his stewardship and, yes, why “if you're a reader on Rock, Paper, Shotgun, you are sophisticated enough to not listen to what Ken Levine says.”
When we left off, Ken Levine was talking about his desire to achieve greater clarity in what he says in interviews…
RPS: It must be extra-tough to try and be completely clear in what you're saying in this age of the out of context headline, where in a moment some site might take something you said off the cuff and change its meaning by having it stand alone or be put in proximity to something else.
Ken Levine: Oh yeah, that happens all the time. That comes with the territory, but what those headlines do… There is a good thing and a bad thing about those headlines. The worst kind is when it's “Levine says so-and-so” and someone's even put it in quotes, but they're actually not quotes. They're a summation. I had this happen yesterday; somebody took something out of the [1999 mode] press release and they read the word ‘permanence' and the word ‘death' as to mean an Iron Man mode – where if you die, you can't continue. So it said “Levine said this”, and it's actually not what we said in the press release, but it sort of conflated things.
So what that kind of experience has me do, especially being more in the public eye in the past few years… and when you're just talking to somebody, like we're just having this conversation Alec, you want to just have a conversation, you just want to talk about things. But then you realise that you have this responsibility, because people are going to be reading and people are going to be analysing, to make sure that the things you say are very difficult to misinterpret or – not even misinterpretation, because that's putting the onus on the reader rather than me – that I don't say anything that lacks clarity.
So I try to be as clear as I possibly can, because people will read things and maybe they misinterpret or maybe I've misspoken, I haven't be clear enough. Not misspoken actually – misspoken is a word politicians use when they lie [laughs]. Or, when I spoke about System Shock 2 on BioShock 1, that was a completely honest thought, I really thought at the time that that was what that game was. I actually still very much feel that; I think there is a very large number of people, especially on sites on RPS, that disagree with that, so that is one of the reasons that we're thinking about this mode – to look at that audience and say ‘what were they dissatisfied about?'
And let me tell you something, I can guarantee you that somewhere in the comments section on RPS, there'll be [adopts forceful tone] ‘Levine has no idea what we were dissatisfied about! This idiot thinks that the problem in BioShock was permanence, but the problem was this' That's going to happen, and we're doing our best to look at our work, and this is not is just an external thing. When that guy said about the permanence thing, I was “oh my god, that makes total sense to me as a gamer, that is exactly something I would have liked to have played”, and the problem I'd had before was nobody had said something to me that resonated as a gamer.
Whereas people would say “oh, I hate Rapture, I hate the Little Sisters” – that doesn't resonate with me, because obviously I don't hate Rapture. It's a much harder thing to argue with: “I hate Andrew Ryan, I hate Big Daddies.” I like those things, and we can't make a game we don't like. It's much easier when someone comes to me and says “I miss permanence”, then I'm “oh, testify brother, I also miss that.” You can only make games that you want to make – you can't make a game for somebody else.
RPS: Plus, when people are disagreeing with you on something, there's the issue of presenting interviews and quotes in plain text, like you've stood on top of mountain and declared them like a commandment, as opposed to part of a discussion where there's a back and forth and the other party can seek more clarity.
Ken Levine: Yeah. I tend to read comments sections on RPS more than on a more general place, because I am that kind of gamer. There's all this weird crazy shit that I never would have heard of otherwise, all these PC games that I want to play, and that and Quarter To Three are my go-to sites for finding out about weird PC games. In comments sections, I feel a lot of the things that people feel there because I am that kind of gamer. But [sometimes] I am also being interviewed in the body of text and that's being interpreted in a certain way, and that's completely valid. I am definitely a ‘customer is always right' kind of guy: they've given us their 50 bucks, we have a responsibility to give them something they're going to enjoy. So we do the best we can when we talk about the game, we do the best we can when we design the game, but there's never a time where we make a game for somebody – we have to make a game for ourselves. If you're trying to chase some demographic that you're not part of, you're really going to fail.
RPS: That's how you end up with stuff like CityVille…
Ken Levine: Yeah… although maybe the guy who designed CityVille, maybe that was exactly the kind of game he wanted to play, I can't speak for him. But we only make games that we wanna play; when I look at the games that Irrational has made, specifically the games that are nearest and dearest to my heart, System Shock and BioShock and Freedom Force, because those are the games that as a gamer I want to play.. But then the guys on the team who made SWAT 4, I had very little to do with that, they had a passion for that experience, and I think they knocked it out the park.
RPS: Yeah, that's quietly an amazing game.
Ken Levine: Yeah, they were making the game they wanted to make. Guys like Bill Gardner, Chris Klein, Sean Robertson, they really love that game, and they wanted to make that kind of game. I think if I was leading that kind of game it wouldn't be very good: I liked SWAT 3, I played it and enjoyed it, but it wasn't one of my huge passions. These guys, they did a great job with it – if I had lead that project it wouldn't have been nearly as good.
RPS: It might have been, but in a very different way. Probably with monsters in.
Ken Levine: Yeah, after it when they turned to me and said “okay, what are we doing next?” and Vivendi wanted another SWAT game and it was my turn to lead, I was like “I can't do that. Let's make a zombie SWAT game!” We talked about that on our website; that was something I was much more interested in, but that would probably have very much disappointed the hardcore SWAT fans because that's not what they're interested in. So you do the best you can, but at the end of the day if you're making a game for somebody else it's really asking for failure.
RPS: I think the world still wants to see that zombie SWAT game, you should make it sometime.
Ken Levine: [laughs] I was watching 28 Days Later recently and I was like “ah, man – there's really a great game there.” So yeah – look, we're only human, we do the best we can, when we make the game and when we talk about the game and I just want to make sure, especially in this mode that I'm speaking with incredible clarity.
RPS: Something else that's maybe got in a way with that in the past is the conflict between this perception that Irrational, and often you specifically, are the smartest guys in the room for mainstream games, so everyone wants to ask you about philosophy and literature, but actually you're also making a game about shooting guys in the face and that doesn't always get conveyed.
Ken Levine: Yeah, certainly often when a journalist comes to us to talk about BioShock there's a disparity between… They want to talk about deeper philosophical issues, and they're less interested in the game systems – but there's a large section of the audience that just wants to shoot stuff. And I'm of two minds about this myself – I love, obviously, some of the philosophical underpinnings, and I'm certainly very interested in the historical setting, but I'm also really interested in all the game system stuff. So what's been fun, especially in the 1999 mode, is it really asks us to go back and dig into that old school gamer systems head, deeply into that space and say ‘what is the delta between BioShock and a game we would have made in 1999?'
That's been a really interesting design challenge, because it eluded me for a long time – and again I guarantee there'll be someone in the comments section saying “Levine it's still eluding you, trust me, you're an idiot.” And that may very well be true, but for me as a gamer this is the piece that was missing. I'm never going to chase [i.e. design the game towards] some gamer who's unhappy with our game, because the only gamer I can chase who's not happy with our game is myself.
People on the team, the only people they can chase is themselves. If I start reading comments section and then start chasing every single person there and it's an opinion that I don't share… maybe it'll be the right thing to do in a business sense, but I won't be able to make that game, the team won't be able to make that game, because it's not in our DNA.
If someone says “you know what your game really needs? It needs tennis, a tennis simulation.” If someone came down from the heavens and said [boomy god voice] “Levine, if you make this game and you put a tennis simulation in, you will sell ten million units”, that'd be great if I could make that, but I would fail – unless there was somebody on the team who just loves tennis, but as a creative director I would not be able to sit in level reviews and say “let's talk about the tennis section.” It would just be terrible, you can only make what you love.
RPS: Although you've got to admit, playing tennis on those skyrail things in Infinite would be a lot of fun…
Ken Levine: [laughs] That'd be pretty good. Actually, I just realised, we do have a tennis thing in BioShock – when you first get telekinesis, you have that whole little tennis room. Maybe I have a weird fetish for tennis I never thought about…
RPS: Do you think, given your urge for clarity, the world does have a clear sense of what BioShock: Infinite is yet? Having presumably seen the reportage and reader feedback around it, has the message been conveyed properly, or are people seeing it through the prism of BioShock 1 and the hype around it too much?
Ken Levine: Well, we've only talked about a segment of it, there's a percentage we haven't talked about yet. What I would say to the audience is, if you're reading Rock, Paper, Shotgun, the last thing I think you should do is buy any game based upon what the spokesperson for that game says. What you should do is wait for the game to come out, read a bunch of reviews that you trust, talk to your friends that you trust, and make your purchasing decision based on that. Not because I think anything we're saying isn't accurate or true, but because boy, you're going to get a much better opinion from the people you trust. They'll be able to give you a much better sense of what the game is, because they've played the game through, they can tell you every single thing about it.
I'm only talking right now about a segment of the game, and I'm obviously biased towards liking this game because it's towards my tastes as a gamer. There's no denying that. If you're a reader on Rock, Paper, Shotgun, you are sophisticated enough to not listen to what Ken Levine says, or not listen to what any [developer] says about any game: go to the reviews, go to the people you trust, because you know they're going be completely unbiased. This is my baby, I spent five years on this thing – you think I'm not biased? Of course I'm biased.
RPS: There's a terrible part of me that wants to use “Levine: RPS readers are too sophisticated for me” as a headline. But I won't. Or… will I?
Ken Levine: [chuckles] It's true though, your audience is very capable of following their truth about the game. They don't need me for that. I think, I hope the preview process is going to be very entertaining for them, but if they're making careful purchasing decisions, never rely on a preview process for that, because they don't need to. I'm 45, I've come to a point in my life where I can afford to buy almost any game I want, so I don't need to dig that deep into reviews – time is more of an issue for me – so I can really just try things, and if I don't like them I can just say ‘I'm not going to play that any more', and I'm very, very fortunate to be able to do that. But not everybody's in that situation, either financially or time-wise, so they should not rely on any preview process. Ever. Not because it's dishonest, but because they don't need to: they can go to a much deeper source.
RPS: Yeah, we often feel uncomfortable about writing and calling things ‘previews' on RPS, because we know to some extent it's guided by marketing, by being shown controlled elements of the game in a certain way, and need to make sure that whatever we say about it doesn't come off as though it's a review.
Ken Levine: Yeah, because how can you [the developer] be objective? It's impossible. I love this. It's our baby. If you're looking to me to give you an objective opinion, boy you're looking in the wrong place.
RPS: Thanks for your time.
BioShock: Infinite will be released… well, we don't know that yet. But hopefully soon.

The Bathini Goud family in Hyderabad hosts a peculiar exhibition every year, where they claim to provide Indians with free live fish medicine.
Since 175 years, thousands of people from all over the country have been visiting Bathini-Mrigasira Karthi Fish Prasadam, which takes place on the nights of 'Mrigasira Karti' which falls in June with the onset of the annual monsoon.
The 3cm fish is first tucked inside a live murrel or sardine fish, then dipped into a yellow herbal paste and then pressed down the throat of the suffering patients by the Goud family.
They claim that the small living fish travels wiggling its way through the human throat, pushing the phlegm and making it easier for people to breathe.
Also, the herbal dip used for the medicine remains a secret and is said to be transferred into the Goud Family by a Hindu saint in 1845.
An estimated population of 3 lac people gathered on the night of Fish Prasadam with a security force of 1000 police officers guarding on the outskirts of the exhibition.
Rights activists claim this to be an unhealthy and a ridiculous tradition.
Indian participants rest prior to receiving fish medicine from members of the Bathini Goud family at the exhibition grounds in Hyderabad

The medicine has been offered by the family of the southern Indian city to patients for the last 164 years.

People come from all over India to try their luck with the live fish medicine.

On Wednesday there was a protest in the Grove neighborhood in St. Louis city.
The protesters stood in the middle of Chouteau and Manchester — two very busy streets in St. Louis.
A couple protesters got hit by a car because they wouldn't get out of the street.
The driver in a Mercedes was arrested and taken into custody.

The judge said he had "an inability to show remorse" A man with 200,000 computer images and thousands of videos showing child sex abuse has been jailed indefinitely. Christopher Stubbings, 55, from Crawley Lane, Kings Bromley, Staffordshire, was one of the ringleaders of a worldwide abuse ring, Stafford Crown Court heard. He was ordered to serve a minimum of 12-and-a-half years in jail. Stubbings had admitted eight offences including indecent assaults on a child under 16 and the commissioning of child abuse videos. The offences also included distribution of child abuse images and possession of child abuse images. 'Deplorable and depraved' He was arrested by Staffordshire Police following a two-year investigation involving the FBI and police in Australia. The court heard when he was interviewed by Staffordshire Police, Stubbings said: "You know what men are like. Some choose to collect stamps. I choose to collect images of children." Stubbings was at the very heart of this child abuse group
Crown Prosecution Service The judge, Mrs Justice Macur, said he had "an inability to show remorse, contrition or empathy." She added the images were "deplorable and depraved - these children were abused, all of them debased, all of them humiliated". In a statement, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said he was a co-founder of a worldwide paedophile group consisting of about 60 members and within that group he was second in command and acted as its treasurer. It added one of his primary roles was to secure funding by direct pleas from him to the group's members. The CPS said: "Stubbings was at the very heart of this child abuse group, which used very sophisticated internet encryption techniques to try and avoid detection." Det Insp Ronnie Walker, from Staffordshire Police, said afterwards that Stubbings had not shown "any remorse whatsoever". Asked about the sentence, Det Insp Walker added: "It truly reflects his level of offending and the seriousness of the nature and the quantity and the levels of depravity shown within those images that we've recovered."

Meet “Lonesome George,” the last known example of the Pinta Island Tortoise, the rarest endangered animal in the world, with only “George” left. That we know about. The species was considered to have become totally extinct, until 1971 when this last specimen was sighted by rangers, who are desperately trying to find a mating female. they have even posted a $10,000 reward for that Turtle-ophile still holding out on us with the Pinta Island Tortoise in their personal collection. Hello, Michael Jackson Estate, we're looking at you. To be honest, I have no idea if MJ used to own one, but he did try to buy John “The Elephant Man” Merrick's skeleton, so who knows.
“Lonesome George” is estimated to be between 60-100 years old, likes long, long, long, long, long, long walks on the beach, and dislikes “fake types.” A romantic lettuce-eater just looking to meet that ‘special someone” who will coax him out of his shell and into the Galapagos Islands of their heart, George is a pretty special guy who would be a real “keeper” for any hot minx of a Pinta Island Tortoise female. More turtle than you could shake a Lord Howe Island Stick Insect at, for sure!
And what reclusive she-tortoise wouldn't want to cozy down on scenic Pinta Island (aka Abingdon Island)? It is one of the historic Galapagos Islands, located some 525 nautical miles off the coast of Ecuador? It's a little bit Ecuadorian Province, a little bit romantic national park, and a whole lotta biological marine reserve. Just perfect to sit back, read Darwin's Origin of the Species, and hatch a few species-extending eggs, while, in the background, the swallow-tailed gulls, aqua iguanas and fur seals frolic.
Any interested she turtles should check out this video of “turtle porn”:
So, was I right, or was I right? Is “Lonesome George” not a big hunk o' terrapin you could wrap your scaly legs around. Any serious female Pinta Island Tortoise out there looking to “knock shells” with him should contact him right away. But please… no “fast-ies” need to apply.
Give Ohio Republicans this: They plan. That's how they win elections.
In 1949, Republicans feared so-called “straight-ticket” voting might unseat U.S. Sen Robert A. (“Mr. Republican”) Taft. In straight-ticket voting, an Ohioan, by marking just one “x,” could vote for all the Republicans or all the Democrats listed on November's ballot.
In 1950, Gov. Frank J. Lausche, a Cleveland Democrat, would run for re-election. Lots of Republicans liked him. The GOP machine feared Lausche's Republican fans might mark an “x” in the straight-ticket box atop that list headed by Lausche's name. Not only would that help him. It might replace GOP Sen. Robert A. Taft with Democrat Joseph T. (“Jumpin' Joe”) Ferguson.
So, in 1949, voters, at the GOP's behest, banned “straight-ticket” voting. And in 1950, Ohioans re-elected Frank Lausche – and Bob Taft.
Joe Ferguson might not have needed much help in losing. Among his other gems, Ferguson, asked amid the Korean War what foreign policy he favored, supposedly answered, “Beat Michigan!” Still, Republicans left nothing to chance. They seldom do.
Then in 1977, Republicans found themselves, for once, agreeing with something often said by Portsmouth Democrat Vernal G. Riffe, 20-year speaker of Ohio's House. Riffe said, correctly, that “if Ohio Democrats turn out, we win.”
So Republicans convinced Ohio voters to ban election-day voter registration: More hoops, more jumps, fewer Democrats voting in Ohio elections. The same motive is behind GOP calls for Voter ID. Fewer Democratic voters, more Republican wins.
This campaign season, Republican scheming seems directed more at other Republicans (albeit, Republican rebels) than against Ohio Democrats.
Last fall, General Assembly Republicans passed Amended Substitute Senate Bill 193 which makes it tougher for third parties (legal term: “minor parties”) to get on Ohio's ballot. (The four minor parties Ohio recognizes are the Constitution, Green, Libertarian and Socialist parties)
On constitutional grounds, a federal district judge in Columbus has just killed S.B. 193, at least for this year's elections.
The bill was obviously aimed at holding down third-party voting this November by Republican conservatives who are supposedly disenchanted with Gov. John Kasich. Kasich won the governorship by just 77,000 votes in 2010. At this writing, he appears to be in good political shape. But on the Republican right, to know Kasich is not necessarily to love him. Some conservatives were stupefied because Kasich, to his credit, expanded Medicaid to help Ohio's working poor.
Officially, of course, that wasn't why Republicans passed Senate Bill 193. Supposedly they passed it because, due to lawsuits, Ohio for roughly eight years hasn't had a specific third-party ballot law. But that wasn't a problem for anybody at the Statehouse until some Republican True Believers shrieked about Kasich.
If closing such “gaps” in Ohio law were a GOP priority, Republicans would long ago have closed drive-a-truck-through loopholes in Ohio's payday-loan law. Five years ago – and with a “yes” vote of 64 percent – voters said they wanted a tough pay-day loan law. GOP lawmakers instead lolled in their hammocks.
A quick look suggests the last time a third-party candidate won a statewide race in Ohio was in 1912, when a Bull Moose Progressive, Akron's Reuben Wanamaker, won an Ohio Supreme Court seat. It also appears the last time voters elected a third-party Ohio House candidate, also a Bull Moose Progressive, was just before World War I (ironically, in GOP House Speaker William Batchelder's Medina County). That is, it's the governor's race, not down-ticket contests, that concerns the GOP.
So, as in 1949 and 1977, now in 2013 and 2014, that's the Republican way in Ohio. Talk taxes. Talk guns. But if the voters don't cotton to your candidates, don't pick other candidates. Try to pick safer voters.

We found ourselves this week talking about two very different guys, both born in Canada, who skated to triumph thanks to their fans.
If you follow hockey, you have already guessed the name of one of them: John Scott, the 6'8,” 275 lbs., unlikely Most Valuable Player in last Sunday's NHL All-Star Game. As Kelly McEvers put it on NPR's All Things Considered, Scott is a “goon-made-good.” She was invoking hockey slang to describe an enforcer — the “goon” who is charged not to score goals but to knock heads. A professional brawler, if you will, who relies more on brute force than technical skill. He protects his teammates by starting a fight; defends the goaltender by starting a fight; and entertains the crowds by, yes, starting a fight. Scott was a “journeyman” to boot, meaning that he travels from team to team and isn't considered an elite player. Essential, yes; elite, no. Sort of like the bouncer at a nightspot.

Goons are the unlikeliest candidates for the All-Star Game and you have to scratch your head to remember the last time one made it. But John Scott's fans adore him, and they voted him into last Sunday's game over the protestations of the NHL brass, who seemed to loathe the very idea of a low-life in their big showcase competition. When officials stepped in to try to stop him, even sending him briefly to the AHL, the minor league of hockey, these regular-guy fans went crazy. As Greg Wyshynski of Yahoo Sports told McEvers, “A chaotic group of miscreants and NHL fans on Reddit and social media pushed John Scott to the top of the popular vote.”
How did they do it? They took to the Internet, campaigned hard, and overrode the NHL to secure Scott's berth. Not only did he score two goals for the victory, his teammates hoisted him aloft (all 300 lbs. of him with his gear), his fans voted him MVP, and the NHL brass had to hand him the gold, a million dollars in prize money. By the end of the night, Scott was the people's champ — an everyman's hero, triumphing despite hockey's elite snobs doing their best to keep him down.
Now if you follow politics (as of course you do) you know the other Canadian-born guy in this story is Ted Cruz. He is another kind of enforcer who is always spoiling for a fight. Instead of brawling on the ice, he brawls in the courts, on the Senate floor, and on the campaign trail. In Iowa, if they had wanted an enforcer, you might think the call would have gone to Donald Trump. But Trump is merely a bully who bungles scripture. Cruz is a brute, the Crusader Warrior, armed with spike and shield and holy zeal, summoning true believers to war against the infidels. vult!
Unlike John Scott, who is said to be a nice guy, and humble, there's malice in Ted Cruz's swagger. When the Christian right in Iowa bested Trump and the GOP establishment on Monday, lofting him to victory, he shouted to the exultant worshippers, “To God be the Glory” — his self-referential pronouncement that a new Messiah had come to town.
Yet while Cruz may have won Iowa fighting the GOP elites, he's no outsider, and he's no down-to-earth “journeyman.” There is hardly an all-star team that he hasn't made: Princeton, Harvard Law School, Supreme Court clerkship, boutique DC law firm. As a teenager he told people he intended to be president. With a sharp mind and sharper elbows, he has always been determined to win MVP at all costs, never backing down from a fight, or an opportunity to climb higher.
Now, there's nothing inherently wrong with ambition, but here is another striking difference between John Scott and Ted Cruz. Even as the fiercest of enforcers, Scott remains a team player. As he says, “I make my teammates feel safe to do what they do best.”

Ted Cruz is no team player. He's out for no one but himself. And he has a history of switching teams until they fulfill his ambitions.
Cruz was on George W. Bush's team for the Florida recount in 2000, helping to stop the vote tallying there before Al Gore could be declared the winner — an ambitious 29-year-old gunning for a top post in the White House. When he didn't get one, Cruz wrote in his 2015 autobiography that it was “a crushing blow.” He landed a job at the Federal Trade Commission instead.
Cruz didn't stop fighting, but when his colleagues still didn't value him as he thought he deserved, he switched leagues and went local back in Texas. As the state's solicitor general, he began climbing the political ladder again, eventually considering a run for Texas attorney general. And when he saw an opening on the tea party team in 2012, he used it to campaign for the US Senate, picking fights with the Washington establishment that he felt had rebuffed him, and scoring an upset victory.
Once in the Senate his goon-inspired behavior soon antagonized just about everyone, including his fellow Republicans. No one was beyond the reach of his brass knuckles, sharp elbows, and forked tongue. He fought against the Affordable Care Act (including a 21-hour rant on the Senate floor), immigration reform, Planned Parenthood — and against the Anti-Christ, Barack Obama.

Now, to win the White House, Cruz has switched to the God Squad. He is the new Chosen One. His ground game in Iowa relied on scores of fundamentalist clergy, hundreds of volunteers, and his own father, Rafael, a Texas pastor who told a Christian TV channel that his son's race for the White House was divinely inspired by the Holy Spirit.
It is as calculated as any of his previous plays. Robert Draper, in The New York Times Magazine, did the math: “Of the 22 states that will be casting their ballots for a Republican nominee between Feb. 1 and March 5, 11 of them feature a Republican electorate that is more than 50 percent evangelical. Even more significant, the first state to vote is Iowa, roughly 60 percent of whose Republican caucus-goers describe themselves as evangelical Christians.”
Deus vult!

Let us pause, and think upon the words of 18th century satirist Jonathan Swift, a man so versed in the vagaries of faith he served as dean of Dublin's St. Patrick's Cathedral:
Andre Drummond had another monster game to start out his season, scoring 25 points and grabbing 29 rebounds in a 94-82 loss to the Indiana Pacers Tuesday.
The Pistons have started off 3-1, much in part to Drummond's contributions on the glass.
Here are some of the numbers behind tonight's game and his start to the season.
1 – There is only one other player to have multiple career games of at least 25 points and 25 rebounds in losses: Hakeem Olajuwon.
2 – With three steals tonight, Drummond is the first player with at least 20 points, 20 rebounds and two steals in consecutive games since Kevin Willis in 1991.
3 – Drummond is now one of three active players to have multiple games of 25 points and 25 rebounds, joining Dwight Howard and Al Jefferson.
4 – In the Pistons' first four games this season, Drummond has multiple 20 point-20 rebound games. From the Elias Sports Bureau: The last player to accomplish that was Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1975-76. He won the MVP that year.
5 - Drummond is the fifth player over the last 20 seasons with 25 points, 15 defensive rebounds and 10 offensive rebounds in a game since Kevin Love on Nov. 12, 2010.
15 – Drummond has the most rebounds by a Piston in the first four games of the season over the last 30 seasons with 78, 15 more than Bill Laimbeer, who had 63 in 1986.
34 - According to NBA's SportVU player tracking, Drummond was within 3.5 feet of a possible rebound 34 times Tuesday. He grabbed 29 rebounds, a rebounding percentage of 85.3 percent.
78 – Over the last 30 seasons, only Dennis Rodman (83) and Charles Barkley (80) have grabbed more rebounds than Drummond (78) has in the first four games of a season.
People are just beginning to notice the tall, skinny orange-and-black “Baltimore” signs that have cropped up on the city's borders.
Squinting at the one standing on a busy stretch of York Road near the county line, Wanda Johnson made the obvious connection with the colors of the city's baseball team.
“Now that you mention it, it's nice,” Johnson said, pausing before getting into her car. “It looks like something to do with the Orioles.”
Online, meanwhile, the commentary was a good bit sharper about the slim new sign – one of 15 new “gateway” markers being erected by the city on Baltimore's perimeter.
“Does the back say ‘Gurl/Boy, Bye!'?” cracked a woman posting on Facebook.
“How about ‘Home of 300 Murders'?” another observer said, suggesting a motto for the civic entrance signs. (“That's helpful!” came one woman's sarcastic reply.)
The city already has de facto welcome signs at its periphery, argued another person: “When Smooth Roads Turn Into Pothole Pavement.”
“Is it just me, or is it a little guillotine-ish?” observed still another commenter, seizing on the sharply angled bottom part of the sign that others likened to a box-cutter.
City Councilman Bill Henry suggested on Facebook that the slant might simply be an allusion to the city's angled southern border.
“It is!” said Ryan Patterson, public art administrator at the Baltimore Office of Promotion & the Arts (BOPA), with obvious relief, going on to recite the project history.
Refreshing and Unifying
Speaking with The Brew, Patterson said he almost hated to step in and “sign-splain” what turns out to be an organized “Baltimore Gateway Sign” project carried out toward the end of the Stephanie Rawlings-Blake mayoral administration.
“I was enjoying hearing all the gut reactions,” Patterson said. “This is what art is supposed to do, inspire a dialogue. People obviously care about this.”
In 2015, he said, the mayor pulled together BOPA and the Department of Transportation “to refresh and renew the city's gateway signs.”
The existing signs, in three distinct styles, were in disrepair and needed an overhaul “that would produce a unified style for the city that does not feel like a new branding campaign,” Patterson said.
After a design competition attracted local firms like Post Typography and out-of-town outfits such as Miami's R&R Studios, the job went to Baltimore-based Ashton Design.
The project – budgeted at $250,000, including stipends for the five finalists – is still in progress, according to Ashton's creative director Alexey Ikonomou.
Of the 14 small pylons, six have been erected so far, he said. The splashiest sign – a 35-foot-tall pylon-type “Baltimore” sign on Interstate 83 – won't be installed until January.
“That's going to get people talking,” Ikonomou predicted. (DOT officials were still at work late today verifying these details.)
Back to the Futura
If the signs have a familiar feel, there's a reason.
The rough template for the new signage is, it turns out, old signage. The project called for the designers to retain and coordinate with existing orange metal “Baltimore” signs dating back to the 1970s.
Patterson said the city was committed to retaining the two horizontal signs on east and west Route 40 and a vertical sign on the city's southern border on the Baltimore-Washington Parkway (I-295).
“They were drawn by hand at a drafting table by someone in the Planning Department and then cut by hand by somebody at Beth Steel,” Patterson said. “You could never afford today to duplicate the quality of those materials.”
Ikonomou, meanwhile, said he is still researching the signs' provenance and may end up attributing them to someone at Cambridge Seven Associates in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Coordinating with those old signs was a design challenge, Ikonomou said. It meant using an updated form of their font, which Ashton described in its proposal as “a quirky and unique” version of Futura.
Some typography aficionados online sniped: “A stencil font extended beyond what a real stencil would require, with no aesthetic payoff for the trouble!”
In its design proposal, Ashton said changes were needed “to increase readability, align with fabrication methods and add a new take on this typeface Baltimore has taken ownership of.”
An Orange City?
On color choice, the designers decided to stick with the original rusty-reddish-orange color of the signs from the 70s. Ashton's rationale is explained at length in its proposal.
“There is no mistaking that Baltimore is orange,” they write. “While the city government has embraced yellow for its seal, flag, vehicles and even its recycling bins – Baltimore identifies with orange.”
They go on to mention Baltimore's reddish-orange rowhouses, the orange hue of steamed crabs, the glowing script of the Domino Sugar sign at the Inner Harbor, and the orange-and-black of the Baltimore Orioles mascot bird.
(Back in the 1960s and 70s, Baltimore's atmosphere was truly orange, courtesy of the “red dust” kicked up and reflected across the southeast sky when the steel furnaces were working at full blast at Sparrows Point.)
The color scheme has seemed to get some affirmation online.
“At least it is not yellow-and-black, which is too much like Pittsburgh's colors,” one wrote, churning up ire for the Baltimore Ravens' hated rivals, the Steelers.
And as for that pointy tip, a 30-degree angle, Ikonomou said, no guillotine reference was intended. Indeed, the design theme was meant to evoke the city's flag and its physical boundary.
“These things can look simple,” he said, “but a lot of thought went into them.”
Mubarak And His Thugs: Trying To Starve The Revolution
The army is in the streets doing nothing, allowing chaos. They are not being employed for or against the people. It's a passive-aggressive stand-down. The people are jubilant, but the siege against them has only begun. Looting is beginning and hunger will be soon to follow. Mubarak is going to starve the revolution unless an alternative government can be set up.
The country's infrastructure is still in the hands of the Mubarak regime. His greatest weapon at this point is patience. He will neither instigate a slaughter nor provide any leadership. He will be able to claim his hands are clean. He will allow desperation to do what the eyes of the world will not permit him.
The ominous and mysterious disappearance of the police will be solved when the identity of the marauding gangs of thieves and looters are discovered. By then it may be too late. Hunger and fear will govern the decisions of the people. Mubarak will wait to be invited back. He will reinstate services, take his time prosecuting the revolutionaries, make a show of meaningless reforms, and the people of Egypt will be worse off than they were before.
A new, American friendly, Vice President has been appointed by Mubarak. Omar Soliman, former head of intelligence under Mubarak, a man that has worked closely with the U.S. in the failing peace process with Israel, is the first VP Mubarak has named in thirty years. Ahmad Shafiq, a military commander, the former chief of air staff, was appointed prime minister. Loyal to Mubarak, and ‘strong-men' in their own right, the only option being offered the Egyptian people is chaos, starvation, or an even more dictatorial regime.
Mubarak gave a warning of this strategy in his speech. He warned the people that freedom may become chaos, and he is doing everything he can to make it so. Starvation of the people, and terrorism from the now invisible police force, are designed to break the spirit of the revolution.
Mubarak is already blaming the revolution on an “Islamic wave.” This lie is designed to gain public from western people and will likely be parroted by the media. Mubarak has used the Muslim Brotherhood for years as a scare-crow to gain support for his regime, and has been successful thanks to Christian or Jewish bigotry, Islamophobia, and the fact that his lies serve their agendas.
Unless the revolution can organize it's own maintenance, and it's own ‘government' if you will, through Twitter, Facebook, social media, telephone, fax, Ham radio, leaflets, whatever… as it managed the uprising, Mubarak will will starve the revolution. Unless the people take back the infrastructure, the revolution will die.
When the people realize this and try to regain their infrastructure and achieve self government they will come in direct conflict with the army, and the army will have to choose. The people of Egypt must decide whether they will make that move before desperation escalates and the secret police establish chaos. Once that happens Mubarak will be hard to remove. He will claim justification for ‘restoring order' and will use any means possible to do so.

The Philadelphia 76ers have clearly turned the corner. They currently sit at 12-8 and appear ready to finish above .500 for the first time in five seasons. It has been youth leading the charge for the reinvigorated franchise with Robert Covington, Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons each standing out in their own ways.
For the 297 minutes that Covington, Embiid and Simmons have been on the floor together, the 76ers have outscored opponents by an average of 16.0 points per 100 possessions. In those minutes, the team has had an offensive rating that would rank as the second-best in the league across the entire season and a defense that would lead the NBA by a healthy margin. As one more point of comparison, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, and Draymond Green have played 313 minutes together and the Warriors are +18.2 in those minutes.
The 76ers trio is talented and versatile, capable of transforming the rest of the supporting cast into a legitimate contender, if not now then in the near future. With Markelle Fultz hopefully on the mend, the Philadelphia 76ers have what they waited for through all their recent lean years. Each member of the group has distinct strengths and what makes them so special is they way they complement each other.
Covington's Effectiveness
Covington has gotten the least attention of the three but the Sixers valued him enough to offer him a four-year extension earlier this month. As a traditional 3-and-D wing, Covington's skill set is not exactly unique, but his effectiveness certainly is. Covington has made 42.5 percent of his 3-pointers on the season, including 41.4 percent of his 7.0 catch-and-shoot attempts per game.
Covington pairs that strong outside shot with suffocating defense. He has the footspeed and frame to defend both big and small wings. He's currently fourth in the league in deflections per game, at 3.5. He doesn't create much offense for himself off the dribble but his shooting helps space the middle of the floor for Simmons and Embiid and his defensive versatility means that Philadelphia can be creative with lineups and orientations without sacrificing matchups at one end of the floor.
Simmons' Playmaking
What Simmons brings to the table is his playmaking -- he's 6-foot-10 but is currently leading the team with 7.2 assists per game. From the power forward position, he is the initiator of the team's offense, leading Philadelphia in touches and time of possession. It's the worst-kept secret in the league that Simmons is a reluctant and generally unreliable outside shooter but his size, creation and passing ability means he's still able to exploit mismatches and make a large positive impact on the offensive end.
31 PTS. 18 REBS.
Ben Simmons is the first rookie with that many PTS & REBS in a game since Shaquille O'Neal in 1993.

Embiid's Versatility
Embiid is perhaps the most versatile of the three, offering a unique blend of talents for a player his size. He's a strong rim protector -- opposing players have made just 47.5 percent of their shots inside of six feet when Embiid is the closest defender, the third-best mark in the league among the 30 players who are challenging at least 5.0 interior shots per game. On offense, he's a willing 3-point shooter, even if the accuracy is lagging at just 25.5 percent right now.
Embiid's biggest strengths as a scorer are inside the paint. He's in the 65th percentile as a post-up scorer, averaging 0.94 points per possession. Overall, 48.6 percent of his made field goals are unassisted, a rate that's comparable to Andrew Wiggins or Bradley Beal. His true shooting percentage is 57.3 percent, about the same as DeMarcus Cousins or CJ McCollum.
More Embiid:
First player in @NBAHistory to ever record 46 PTS, 15 Rebs, 7 AST & 7 BLK in a single game (@EliasSports). pic.twitter.com/QAKromMS3G — NBA.com/Stats (@nbastats) November 16, 2017
Simmons and Embiid are unique in that they move traditional guard roles -- facilitation and shot creation -- into the frontcourt. With Covington's shooting helps ensure that there's plenty of space for them to work and buoys their efficiency with the added value of 3-point shots. On defense they have immense potential and the same kind of versatility to adjust to all sorts of matchups.
The 76ers are far from a finished product but in Simmons, Embiid and Covington, they have a core they can trust to keep moving them closer to their ultimate goal of championship contention.
After last night's game the Marlins optioned Brad Hand to Double-A Jacksonville and called up reliever Chris Hatcher.
The Marlins did this to keep Hand on a normal starting everyday pitching rotation. Had the Marlins not sent him down, it would've been about 10 days before he started again. And that is not something you do with a 21 year-old arm. It is important to keep him on his normal starting routine. To take his place on the 25-man roster the Fish called up Chris Hatcher.
You remember Chris, he was called up as a catcher in 2010 and got a little playing time. While he only appeared in five games and didn't get a hit during any of those, he did exhibit a very strong arm. So the Marlins converted him to a relief pitcher. In Jacksonville this season he was 2-1 with a 2.31 ERA while posting a 10.03 K/9 and 3.86 BB/9. In other words, he throws hard but isn't always around the plate.
The good news for Gaby is that he is no longer the emergency catcher.
It will be interesting to see Hatcher's delivery to the plate. Normally a catcher who are converted to a pitcher will have a very short-arm delivery. It just goes with the territory.
Don't expect Brad Hand to return to the rotation anytime soon. The Marlins are trying to stretch out Clay Hensley while he is rehabbing with plans of using him as the fifth starter. Hensley was a starter for the Padres back in 2006 but that was more than a few years ago. He has the stuff to start, but should the Marlins decide to do this, and it appears they are, it could prove very interesting.
Personally, I would've stretched out Burke Badenhop. But K-Lay will probably do fine.
Across 166 pages of internal State Department documents -- released Friday by a pair of Republican congressmen pressing the Obama administration for more answers on the Benghazi terrorist attack -- slain U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and the security officers assigned to protect him repeatedly sounded alarms to their superiors in Washington about the intensifying lawlessness and violence in Eastern Libya, where Stevens ultimately died.
On Sept. 11 -- the day Stevens and three other Americans were killed -- the ambassador signed a three-page cable, labeled "sensitive," in which he noted "growing problems with security" in Benghazi and "growing frustration" on the part of local residents with Libyan police and security forces. These forces the ambassador characterized as "too weak to keep the country secure."
In the document, Stevens also cited a meeting he had held two days earlier with local militia commanders. These men boasted to Stevens of exercising "control" over the Libyan Armed Forces, and threatened that if the U.S.-backed candidate for prime minister were to prevail in Libya's internal political jockeying, "they would not continue to guarantee security in Benghazi."
Roughly a month earlier, Stevens had signed a two-page cable, also labeled "sensitive," that he entitled "The Guns of August: Security in Eastern Libya." Writing on Aug. 8, the ambassador noted that in just a few months' time, "Benghazi has moved from trepidation to euphoria and back as a series of violent incidents has dominated the political landscape." He added, "The individual incidents have been organized," a function of "the security vacuum that a diverse group of independent actors are exploiting for their own purposes."
"Islamist extremists are able to attack the Red Cross with relative impunity," Stevens cabled. "What we have seen are not random crimes of opportunity, but rather targeted and discriminate attacks." His final comment on the two-page document was: "Attackers are unlikely to be deterred until authorities are at least as capable."
By Sept. 4, Stevens' aides were reporting back to Washington on the "strong Revolutionary and Islamist sentiment" in the city.
Scarcely more than two months had passed since Stevens had notified the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice and other agencies about a "recent increase in violent incidents," including "attacks against western interests." "Until the GOL (Government of Libya) is able to effectively deal with these key issues," Stevens wrote on June 25, "the violence is likely to continue and worsen."
After the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi had been damaged by an improvised explosive device, earlier that month, Stevens had reported to his superiors that an Islamist group had claimed credit for the attack, and in so doing, had "described the attack as targeting the Christians supervising the management of the consulate."
"Islamic extremism appears to be on the rise in eastern Libya," the ambassador wrote, adding that "the Al-Qaeda flag has been spotted several times flying over government buildings and training facilities ..."
The documents also contain evidence that the State Department's denials of requests for enhanced security in Benghazi in the months leading up to the attack may have contributed to the ability of the attackers to plan their assault on the consulate and annex grounds without being detected.
"I've been placed in a very difficult spot," said Eric A. Nordstrom, the regional security officer who testified before a House hearing last week, in a Feb. 12 email to a colleague, "when the ambassador (Gene Cretz, at that time) that I need to support Benghazi but can't direct MSD (a mobile security detachment) there and been advised that DS (Diplomatic Security) isn't going to provide more than 3 agents over the long term."
"DS is hesitant to devout (sic) resources and as I indicated previously, this has severely hampered operations in Benghazi," wrote Karen Keshap, a State Department manager, to main State in Washington the day before. "That often means that DS agents are there guarding a compound with 2 other DOS (Department of State) personnel present. That often also means that outreach and reporting is non-existent."
Earlier that day, Feb. 11, a colleague of Keshap's, Shawn P. Crowley, had apologized to her and other officials in an email for "being a broken record" on the subject of inadequate security in Benghazi. Crowley added: "(T)omorrow Benghazi will be down to two (DS) agents. ... This will leave us unable to do any outreach to Libyan nationals ... and we will be extremely limited in the ability to obtain any useful information for reporting."
These exchanges followed a dire report to top DS officials a few days earlier from Nordstom. In a Feb. 1 memorandum, the officer warned that "Al-Qaida affiliated groups, including Al-Qaida In the Islamic Magreb (AQIM), and other violent extremist groups are likely to take advantage of the ongoing political turmoil in Libya. The U.S. Government remains concerned that such individuals and groups ... may use Libya as a platform from which to conduct attacks in the region."
By Feb. 20, Nordstrom was noting the easy access that neighborhood militias enjoyed to "military grade weapons, such as RPGs and vehicle mounted, crew-served machine guns or AA weapons (23mm)," as well as "AK-47s, heavy weapons, and vehicle mounted weapons."
In the days leading up to Sept. 11, warnings came even from people outside the State Department. A Libyan women's rights activist, Wafa Bugaighis, confided to the Americans in Benghazi in mid-August: "For the first time since the revolution, I am scared."
The documents were released by two lawmakers who have been active in probing the Benghazi case, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah. In a letter to President Obama, dated Oct. 19 and accompanied by the documents, the lawmakers faulted the administration both for providing inadequate security before Sept. 11, and for allegedly obfuscating the nature of the events on Sept. 11.
"Multiple warnings about security threats were contained in Ambassador Stevens' own words in multiple cables sent to Washington, D.C., and were manifested by two prior bombings of the Benghazi compound and an assassination attempt on the British ambassador," the congressmen wrote. "For this administration to assume that terrorists were not involved in the 9/11 anniversary attack would have required a willing suspension of disbelief."
State Department spokesman Mark Toner said, in response to the latest documents: "An independent board is conducting a thorough review of the assault on our post in Benghazi. Once we have the board's comprehensive account of what happened, findings and recommendations, we can fully address these matters."
At the State Department briefing Friday, spokeswoman Victoria Nuland declined to comment on published reports alleging that an official working for the Central Intelligence Agency had informed the Obama administration on Sept. 12 that the Benghazi murders were an act of terrorism.
Thursday night on The Daily Show, host John Oliver launched a blistering attack on the big banks by noting an important change to the board game Monopoly: the jail is being removed.
“Yes, you heard right,” he remarked. “The game designed to teach children how capitalism works has removed the ‘go to jail' option to reflect the financial system they're going to grow up in, presumably replacing it with a ‘get yelled at by Congress and then go directly to the Cayman Islands' option.”
Oliver explained that Goldman Sachs was able to manipulate the price of aluminum to their own benefit thanks to bank-owned warehouses.
“Goldman can bet on the future price of aluminum while simultaneously having the ability to goose the future price of aluminum if that's something they'd find interesting or profitable,” he said. “In the stock market, that's what known as insider trading. In the commodities market, that's known as simply Thursday — or Monday or Tuesday or Friday or Wednesday.”
Though regulations force Goldman Sachs to move aluminum out of its warehouses, the financial giant simply moves aluminum from warehouse to warehouse. The artificial inflation of aluminum has cost American consumers more than $5 billion over the last three years.
“Now that you think about it, the new version of Monopoly is actually perfect, you just move pieces of metal around and around in a circle collecting money whenever you want and it's guaranteed that nobody's going to jail,” Oliver concluded.

(RPI) The Dallas shootings have ushered in a very new world for U.S. citizens. For the very first time, a drone has been used on U.S. soil to kill an American without trial or charges.
The suspected shooter in yesterday's tragic killings, U.S. Army veteran Micah Xavier Johnson, was, according to police and press reports, holed up in a parking garage and would not give himself up. After hours of what police claimed were fruitless negotiations with Johnson, a weaponized robot was sent to where he was hiding and blown up, taking Johnson with it.
Get past the horror of what Johnson was accused of doing and think about that precedent for a moment. Is it not chilling?
RPI regular contributor Peter Van Buren, a retired State Department official who did a tour in Iraq, put a very fine point on the “robot” bomb:
We have the first law enforcement use of drone (albeit with wheels not wings) to kill someone w/out trial in America https://t.co/l0Db8h0ASM — Peter Van Buren (@WeMeantWell) July 8, 2016
Indeed, even without wings, this was a drone sent in to kill an American suspected of a crime.
Police claim that continuing the negotiations was pointless and attempting to capture him would have put officers at risk. He was supposedly shooting. While no sane person wants police officers to be killed, risk is something we are told they willingly accept when they sign up for police duty. There are plenty of low-risk jobs out there.
The media and opinion-leaders are presenting us with a false choice: if we question the use of drones to kill Americans — even if we suspect they have done very bad things — we somehow do not care about the lives of police officers. That is not the case. It is perfectly possible to not want police officers to be killed in the line of duty but to wholeheartedly reject the idea of authorities using drones to remotely kill Americans before they are found guilty.
African-American Dallas protester Mark Hughes was wrongly identified by Dallas Police as a suspect in the shootings. Police tweeted photos of Hughes marching with protesters openly carrying a rifle, as is permitted in Texas.

Police claimed he was involved in the shooting. He was a suspect just like Johnson was a suspect. During questioning they told Hughes that they had video of him shooting people, which was a lie. What if police had sent in a drone to take out Mark Hughes? What will happen in the future to a future Mark Hughes, falsely accused by police of being involved in a shooting? Will we come to accept murder without trial?

MOSCOW — Vladimir Putin's government has denied allegations that Russia was involved in alleged attempt to kill Montenegro's pro-Western prime minister.

"We, obviously, categorically deny a possibility of official involvement into arranging any illegal actions," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday in a response to a question on the investigation into a plot to murder Milo Djukanovic.
Montenegro's chief special prosecutor said Sunday that Russian nationalists were behind an alleged coup attempt. It was said to include plans to assassinate Djukanovic because of his government's bid to join NATO.
Milivoje Katnic said the investigation leads to the conclusion that "nationalists from Russia" organized a criminal group that planned to break into the Balkan country's parliament on election day, kill the prime minister and bring a pro-Moscow coalition to power.
Some 20 Serbian and Montenegrin citizens, including a former commander of Serbia's special police forces, were arrested in Montenegro during the Oct. 16 vote. Fourteen of them remain in custody, including some who have fought for pro-Russia rebels in eastern Ukraine.
Russian officials have denied any involvement. But they have openly supported the "patriotic" parties that are against Montenegro's membership bid in the Western military alliance.

"We don't have any evidence that the state of Russia is involved in any sense ... but we have evidence that two nationalists from Russia were organizers," Katnic told reporters.
Serbian authorities reportedly deported an unspecified number of Russian operatives who were monitoring Djukanovic's movements from Serbian territory.
"Special prosecution of Serbia had those persons under its supervision ... and prevented them from realizing their plan," Katnic said. "Those persons are not on the territory of Serbia any more. I don't know where they are now, in Russia or somewhere else."
He said the coup plot was for 500 people to enter Montenegro on election night to "cause violence ... and hire professional sharpshooters to kill the prime minister."
Katnic added: "The plan was to stop Montenegro on its Euro-Atlantic path, especially to prevent it from entering NATO."
Djukanovic also led the tiny Adriatic nation to independence from Serbia in 2006.
Montenegro has been invited to join NATO despite strong opposition from its traditional Slavic ally Russia. With Montenegro joining, Russia would lose strategic access to the Adriatic Sea and Serbia would remain its only ally in the region.
NATO's Deputy Secretary-General Rose Gottemoeller, who visited Montenegro last week, said she expects the country to become a member next spring after all 28 NATO member states ratify the agreement in their respective parliaments.
Over the 25 years he has spent at the pinnacle of the tiny Adriatic state's politics, Djukanovic has oscillated between the presidency and the prime ministership with only two short stints out of power in 2006 and 2010.
With a population of 650,000 people, Montenegro was a rare former Yugoslav republic that split peacefully from Serbia, avoiding the bloodshed that followed similar moves by Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo.

Google has begun routinely encrypting Web searches conducted in China, posing a bold new challenge to that nation's powerful system for censoring the Internet and tracking what individual users are viewing online.
The company says the move is part of a global expansion of privacy technology designed to thwart surveillance by government intelligence agencies, police and hackers who, with widely available tools, can view e-mails, search queries and video chats when that content is unprotected.
China's Great Firewall, as its censorship system is known, has long intercepted searches for information it deemed politically sensitive. Google's growing use of encryption there means that government monitors are unable to detect when users search for sensitive terms, such as “Dalai Lama” or “Tiananmen Square,” because the encryption makes them appear as indecipherable strings of numbers and letters.
China — and other nations, such as Saudi Arabia and Vietnam, that censor the Internet on a national level — will still have the option of blocking Google search services altogether. But governments will have more difficulty filtering content for specific search terms. They also will have more trouble identifying which people are searching for information on sensitive subjects, experts say.
The development is the latest — and perhaps most unexpected — consequence of Edward Snowden's release last year of National Security Agency documents detailing the extent of government surveillance of the Internet. Google and other technology companies responded with major new investments in encryption worldwide.
Chinese officials did not respond to questions about Google's decision to routinely encrypt searches there, but the move threatens to ratchet up long-standing tensions between the American tech powerhouse and the world's most populous nation.
“No matter what the cause is, this will help Chinese netizens to access information they've never seen before,” said Percy Alpha, the co-founder of GreatFire.org, an activist group that monitors China's Great Firewall. “It will be a huge headache for Chinese censorship authorities. We hope other companies will follow Google to make encryption by default.”
Alpha, who like other members of the group uses a pseudonym to evade Chinese authorities, noted that Google began encrypting searches in the country more than two months after GreatFire.org publicly challenged the company to do so in an opinion piece published by Britain's Guardian newspaper in November.
That piece came in response to a speech by Google's executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, in which he said, “We can end government censorship in a decade” through expanding encryption. GreatFire.org said the company didn't need to wait 10 years; it could encrypt all searches in China far more quickly.
Google denied that the group's agitation had anything to do with the rollout of encryption technology in China, saying that it began in February for unrelated reasons. All searches made from most modern browsers will be encrypted in the coming months. The completion date for the worldwide rollout is not yet clear, the company said.
“The revelations of this past summer underscored our need to strengthen our networks. Among the many improvements we've made in recent months is to encrypt Google Search by default around the world,” spokeswoman Niki Christoff said in an e-mailed statement. “This builds on our work over the past few years to increase the number of our services that are encrypted by default and encourage the industry to adopt stronger security standards. ”
Google largely pulled out of mainland China in 2010, moving many of its operations to the quasi-autonomous base of Hong Kong after refusing to comply with orders to censor searches or redirect them to preferred sites — something that competitors who remained behind still do.
Since then, the company's share of the search market in China has dwindled to as low as five percent, according to Beijing-based market-research firm Marbridge Consulting. The vast majority of Internet users there use the Chinese search engine Baidu, even on phones running Google's Android operating system.
This means that the effect of Google's increased use of encryption could be limited in its reach since those who use Google in China — typically tech-savvy and young — often already know ways past the Great Firewall.
“Those who are technically sophisticated don't really need another tool to get around censorship,” said Jason Q. Ng, author of “Blocked on Weibo: What Gets Suppressed on China's Version of Twitter (and Why). Ng added, though, that Google's change was certainly welcome since it would remove barriers for everyone and make information faster and easier to access.
Google began offering encrypted search as an option for some users in 2010 and made the protection automatic for many users in the United States in 2012. The company began encrypting traffic between its data centers after The Washington Post and the Guardian, relying on documents provided by Snowden, reported last year on the massive extent of Internet spying by the National Security Agency and its allies. Microsoft and Yahoo soon followed with similar initiatives.
Encrypted search has come more slowly in other parts of the world, and especially to those using older browsers. Firefox, Safari and Google's own Chrome browser support automatic encryption, but older generations of Microsoft's Internet Explorer — still popular in China and much of the world — do not. Internet Explorer 6, which was first released in 2001 and does not support encrypted Google searches, is used for 16 percent of Chinese Internet traffic, according to NetMarketShare.com, which tracks usage.
The move to routine encryption could spark backlash from Chinese authorities, who constantly tweak their Great Firewall to block the flow of unwanted content and also to maintain the ability to monitor Internet users in China.
“The Great Firewall is entirely a moving target,” said Richard Clayton, a computer security researcher for the University of Cambridge, in England, who has studied Chinese Internet filtering. “They are tweaking it all the time.”
The censorship poses an obstacle to Chinese businesses that are trying to expand internationally because they lack reliable access to sites with global audiences, such as Facebook. It can be hard to determine what the government will block on any given day.
“In China, a lot of things are like this,” said Jiang Tao, founder of CSDN, a Chinese software developer community. “You don't know what you can do, what you can't do. No one tells you.”
Google's growing use of encryption could prompt China to block Google searches altogether or even all services offered by the company. Though Google has a much smaller market share in China than elsewhere in the world, it is still widely used by international firms and some others, meaning there could be economic consequences to an outright block.
Another option would be what experts call a “man-in-the-middle attack” that would allow Chinese censors to intercept encrypted traffic and decode it before it reaches Google servers. For many users, such an attack would be obvious because their browsers would warn that the communication had been accessed before reaching its intended recipient. Users would be free to proceed with the query, even in the face of a man-in-the-middle attack, but the protection offered by Google's encryption would be lost.
Privacy advocates, who long have criticized Google, said its expanded use of encryption will do nothing to curb the company's own tracking of the Web site visits, e-mails and search queries of its users. Such information helps the company target advertising, the key source of revenue for the company.
“It's a good move to encrypt as much as possible, but I really think Google is grandstanding here,” said Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, an advocacy group based in Washington.

Nearly 7 trillion gallons of water have thrashed Louisiana over the past week. Since the torrential rainfall and flooding started August 8, more than 40,000 homes have been damaged. Governor John Bel Edwards asked volunteers to help clear the debris and shovel mud from homes, saying on Tuesday, “Not everyone can do this on their own.”
CNN crunched the numbers to illustrate the severity of the damage caused by this 500-year flood and estimated that the sheer volume of water is enough to fill more than 10.4 million Olympic-sized swimming pools. The community of Watson was hit the hardest with about 31 inches of rain falling in the early hours of the morning.
So far, according to the governor's office, 11 people have died as a result of the flooding. On the bright side, 20,000 residents and 1,000 pets have been rescued thanks to the combined efforts of the Coast Guard, National Guard, EMTs, and brave bystanders.
According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a flood this destructive customarily only comes around about once every 500 years. As rare as this natural occurrence may seem, five other 500-year floods have happened across the country since last August. In Louisiana's case, 12 parishes have been categorized as disaster areas by the Obama administration, with 12 more requesting the designation and emergency assistance.
For those beginning the cleanup process, an image has been circulating on Instagram that offers helpful advice for homeowners.
Steve Spurrier's trying to shake off the remnants of what has been the most disappointing season of his 10-year career at South Carolina during the Gamecocks' bye week.
He could use Taylor Swift's help.
“I was telling our coaching staff, I think Taylor Swift's got a song called ‘Shake it Off.' Ugh. That's what we're trying to do, shake it off and get ready for the Florida Gators next week,” Spurrier said in an exclusive interview with The State's Josh Kendall published Tuesday. “That's what we're going to try to do, see if we can regroup and try to win a close game. You know we've had our share of close ones, though we've struggled on defense and so forth.”
South Carolina's fifth loss in nine games Saturday night immediately sparked retirement questions for the 69-year-old Head Ball Coach after Spurrier walked away from the podium during his postgame presser after a brief statement.
RELATED: Spurrier walks out of postgame press conference
The Gamecocks' all-time winningest coach says he's planning on returning next season, but doesn't want to discuss his future any further.
Spurrier's never taken losing easy.
“You probably have some questions that I'm going to have a tough time answering,” Spurrier said to The State. “If it's got anything to do with coaches coming back next year, me coming back next year, I am just going to refrain from all of that. Let's get through this season here and see where we are all at is probably the smartest thing for all of us to do right now.”
Two of my favorite things on earth are snow and snowboarding, especially at the Wolf Creek Ski Area. Because of a recent injury coupled with avalanche fatalities that have hit too close to home, I spend most of my time inbounds.
For six seasons, Vail Mountain was my home base, and I got several seasons of 100 plus days of riding. I've since moved to Durango, and my home mountain is now Purgatory with Telluride, Wolf Creek and Silverton each being close-by mountains that I ride several times a season. There are many pros and cons to both large and small resorts, and although I can see the appeal of heated sidewalks and gondolas with Wifi, I've come to prefer small privately-owned mountains with unobtrusive features and structures that have been there since the inception of the resort. Wolf Creek Ski Area is no exception to that developed appreciation.
Wolf Creek Ski Area
To the Colorado ski world, Wolf Creek is synonymous with big snow. There are very few cuts and groomed trails, and most of the terrain is tree skiing and hike-to bowls. Consistently reporting the highest snowfall in Colorado every year, I have had countless double-digit powder days at Wolf Creek and have had more 20+ inch powder days there than all other ski resorts I've ridden combined. Since there is not much traffic at the resort, fresh turns can be found four or five days inbounds after a storm. Am I giving a secret away? Not really.
Tucked away in the southwest corner of the state, Wolf Creek is on a mountain pass on Highway 160 between the quaint towns of South Fork and Pagosa Springs. It's a mountain so infrequently traveled that you will start recognizing the other skiers and riders by your third run. La Plata County airport outside of Durango is the nearest airport located 105 miles away. Denver and Albuquerque are the closest gateway airports and are 275 and 200 miles away, respectively. Given its accessibility, only locals, serious skiers/riders and powder hunters are the folks that generally ski Wolf Creek.
Wolf Creek Ski Area's southern location makes for easy traveling for the tourist from Texas. I think this is how Red McCombs discovered Wolf Creek. I think. I'm getting ahead of myself, but I expected to find a passion for skiing, a story of childhood trips to Wolf Creek, a love for snow to be reasons for McCombs, a Texas billionaire who has owned the Minnesota Vikings, Denver Nuggets and San Antonio Spurs, to want to build an 8,000 person luxury resort on Wolf Creek Pass. Why else would someone want to build a resort in the middle of nowhere next to a ski mountain that the average skier would have no interest in going to? I have found nothing, however, not one article describing Red's passion to ski. Then why?
Let me back up. This isn't just a story of my love snowboarding and the outdoors or a rant against unnecessary development. This is a story of how a rich billionaire from out of state could reach his tentacles down to our local officials who were supposed to be protectors of our pristine and precious land.
It's a 30-year fight between the communities of the San Juan Mountains and Red McComb's and his team that began in 1986. It started as a plan for Red McCombs to build an 8,000 person village (the Village) on Wolf Creek Pass. After the original in 1986, it was determined that there was no access to public roads to the original land space of the Village. After trying various ways of gaining site access, in 2014 the US Forest Service (USFS) did another land deal with the developer and as a result, public roads could access the new land. However, in 2014 environmentalists, lobbyists and locals questioned the impact on the precious wetlands surrounding the new land. Using laws surrounding the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), community activists requested documentation of the processes determining that the construction of the village would comply with environmental laws. Ignoring the FOIA requests, the USFS and McCombs continued to obtain approval on the process of construction of the Village.
However, in 2015, a judge ruled that the US Forest Service inappropriately withheld documents from the public and ordered them to produce the documents. Finally, in November of 2015, 60,000+ pages of Forest Service documents were released. Some of the quotes from the documents and emails are as follows:
Thomas Malecek, who was a district ranger at the time of the email wrote on August 24, 2012 about Dan Dallas, who was the Rio Grande Forest Supervisor at the time, “Dan's main concern wasn't the letter, but the emails around the letter that might be a little damaging in the event they are not all deleted in case we get a foia … remember we are swimming with sharks and need to keep the emails from even the remote appearance of whatever, so make sure you burn this once read!”
“I'll have (our lawyer) send it electronically through an email … so it will remain attorney-client privilege and not subject to FOIA,” Randy Ghormley, a wildlife program manager, wrote. He also asked his employees to communicate via “hardcopy so it would not be subject to FOIA” in an email chain about environmental impacts the Village would have on endangered species and remote wilderness.
Although we cannot see exactly what was discussed because of the attorney-client privilege laws and because documents were intentionally concealed by legalities and document destruction, it is clear that the Forest Service was trying to hide something. It makes me sad that I cannot trust our local government officials who are paid (by us!) to protect our land and act on our best interest and the interest of the protected land.
And it still raises the question, why does Red McCombs, a man who has already owned several professional sports teams and is currently trying to buy the Oakland Raiders, is already a billionaire and ranked among the 1,000 richest people in the world, and is 88 years-old want so badly to build a village on Wolf Creek Pass?
If somehow this goes through you could always don a pair of snowboard skins and go skin up the backcountry near his property. Ski in ski out for everyone?
Our tiny mountain that is hard to access, has no nightlife, not very many easy runs, and arguably, for the fair-weather skier, has too much snow. Why? At this point, I think he just cannot be told “no”. It's a pissing match, and he'll fight it until he dies. I've got no doubt in my mind that this community will fight for as long as it takes.
THIS IS NOT WHAT COLORADO NEEDS!!! or any mountain town for that matter
Knesset Member Hanin Zoabi of the Arab Joint List was slammed Wednesday by Culture Minister Miri Regev and Knesset Member Oren Hazan of the Likud party after accusing the opposition of hypocrisy over its failure to stand up against racism as it does against corruption issues.

"You should have boarded the Marmara again and travelled to Gaza," Minister Regev said to Zoabi during a Knesset discussion on a bill barring police from making recommendations on indictments against public figures. "Go to Gaza, traitor," she reiterated in Arabic.

"You and your friends should thank the state for honoring minorities," Regev said. "You and your friends, (former Knesset Member (Azmi) Bishara and others have gotten used to enjoying what the state has to offer, travelling across the world and delegitimizing the state. Having Trojan horses like her is our punishment.
"Don't you dare say a bad word about IDF soldiers," Regev warned. "The fact that you're still here is a stain on Israeli democracy.
"You people love death, we are moral," she added.
Zoabi and Hazan. 'Will kick you out of here' (Photo: Zohar Shahar, Amit Shabi)
Earlier, Zoabi told the Knesset: "This opposition is more hypocritical than the Right, creating a false impression of democracy."
She was interrupted by MK Hazan, who shouted: "Will I forsake my state to this terrorist? To this criminal?"
Zoabi went on, arguing that "the opposition wants it all. They want to be liberal leftists and to maintain an oppression regime, they want to maintain an image of peace and to support apartheid. You can't enjoy this feeling of enlightenment. In democracy, a war is a war against war crimes, against the occupation and in favor of the Palestinians' rights."
Good morning and welcome to my weekly weather report on the immediate past, present and future of weather in the Bayou City.
PAST
Houston's had a really consistent run of cold weather during the last three-and-a-half months.
We can pinpoint the beginning of the cold spell to Oct. 6, 2013. The day before the high temperature was 93 degrees (shudder).
Since then the temperature hasn't risen to 90 degrees or higher, and 64 out of 105 days, or 61 percent, have recorded below-normal temperatures. October, November and December have all had monthly average temperatures below normal, and it's looking very likely that January will join them.
In short, while it hasn't been an extremely cold winter, it has been consistently cold since early October.
Anyway, let's do the numbers for last week.
Date High Temp. Low Temp. Average Departure Rainfall Monday 71 45 58 +5 0.24 Tuesday 70 35 53 0 0.00 Wednesday 59 36 48 -5 0.00 Thursday 70 33 52 -1 0.00 Friday 63 39 51 -2 0.00 Saturday 69 32 51 -2 0.00 Sunday 69 41 55 +4 0.00 Average 67.3 37.3 52.7 -0.1 0.24 (tot.)
PRESENT
This week's weather will start out with some foggy areas, but that will burn off later this morning under partly sunny skies.
The region also will see rising humidity levels today, under the influence of a southerly wind. High temperatures today should rise into the mid-70s today before the next cold front moves through tonight, say forecasters with the Houston/Galveston office of the National Weather Service.
The front will bring highs on Tuesday through Thursday down in the 60s, and Wednesday morning will be chilly, with lows in the mid-30s.
Last week I called attention to the possibility of a very cold end to the month of January in the upper Midwest, and it looks like that will come to pass. And while some of the Arctic air will filter into Texas, it appears unlikely that the city will see lows in the low 20s like it did earlier this month.
This core of very cold air will reach the upper Midwest by Tuesday, with temperatures more than 30 degrees below normal across parts of Minnesota and Michigan.
It's not clear how far this Arctic air mass will push into the southern United States, including Texas, but a front should reach the Houston region on Thursday.
Of interest is the fact that while the air will be cold, there should be some moisture remaining in the atmosphere after the cold front. This could allow for the possibility of some freezing rain or sleet on Thursday night, especially to the north of Houston, but possibly in the city itself. Lows on Friday morning should be below freezing for parts of the metro area.
The atmosphere should dry out by Friday. The day itself should be quite cold, with highs only rising into the 40s.
By the weekend, in the wake of the front, temperatures should climb into the upper 50s on Saturday and mid-60s on Sunday, with lots of sunshine.
FUTURE
Are you wondering when winter will end?
Well, we're not there yet my friends. Although Houston passed the historical peak of winter in early January, the city has often received very cold weather in February, too.
The average date of the last freeze at Bush Intercontinental Airport doesn't come until March 1. It's a little earlier for Hobby Airport, which is closer to the coast and a good proxy for locations to the south and southeast of downtown Houston. The average date of its last freeze is Feb. 8.
SUMMARY
My rating scale for this week's weather goes from 0 to 28, the number of shots under par Spring golfer Patrick Reed ended his round Sunday at the Humana Challenge, winning the PGA Tour event.
My number: 21.

The new 81-mile Morecambe Bay cycle route offers a scenic, leisurely introduction to long-distance cycling – and, says our northern editor, a great excuse to gorge on the region's excellent food and drink
I have made stops on bike rides for many reasons – to admire a view, or to have a tantrum, a dip or an emergency sausage roll. But this was the first time I'd taken a break for a meditation session. I had originally intended to visit Conishead Priory near Ulverston for a restorative slice of victoria sponge: this startling gothic-revival country house is home to the World Peace Cafe, which does fabulous and remarkably cheap homemade cake. Then I noticed a sign advertising twice-daily free meditation classes and thought I might as well give one a whirl. When in Cumbria …
There can't be many ancient priories with a Buddhist temple in the back garden. But in the 1980s, a bunch of peace-loving monks rescued the dilapidated Conishead and turned it into a college for Buddhist studies.
I felt a bit uncomfortable wandering around the temple in my cycling shorts and not exactly box-fresh socks but no one batted an eyelid. And I was tickled to see the very modern offerings left at the shrines: boxes of Twinings tea, cereal bars and a tin of Celebrations.
At 12.30pm a gong sounded and a softly spoken Antipodean skinhead rounded up a handful of us for 15 minutes of silent contemplation. I had to fight the desire to lie down for a nap on the cosy cushions (note to future visitors: if a cushion has a red cloth on it, it's reserved for ordained nuns and monks only).
The Buddhist temple at Conishead Priory
I made this inner peace pitstop while I was riding the new Morecambe Bay cycleway, which launched in June. It's an 81-mile route that runs from Glasson Dock, five miles south of Lancaster, all the way around the huge bay to Barrow-in-Furness. Sustrans, which designed and signposted the spectacular ride, suggests tackling it over four days, taking a liberal number of stops to enjoy some of the finest food in the north of England. It's much quieter, and easier, than cycling in the heart of the Lake District.
The first time I tackled the new cycleway, I cheated and took the train from Arnside to Grange-over-Sands to cut off a corner of the sands. Having now also ridden the long way around, I'd advise anyone in a hurry to take that shortcut – with the usual warning about train companies' bone-headed attitudes towards bicycles (you can't book bikes on this route, so you have to take your chances and hope a peloton hasn't boarded before you). The best bits of the cycleway lie south and west of here, and you'll save yourself a not particularly memorable 15 miles of meandering through mozzy-plagued salt marsh.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Aynsome Manor Hotel, Cartmel
I cheated because I was going to be late for dinner at Aynsome Manor, a charming country house hotel just outside Cartmel. Less well-known and a little rougher round the edges than the more famous L'Enclume nearby, this family-run hotel does seriously delicious food with old-fashioned but incredibly attentive service. I began with seared king scallops topped with crispy Lakeland pancetta and then grilled fillet of black sea bream with a Chardonnay and onuga (herring roe) cream sauce.
I made the mistake of refilling my boots with a full English breakfast the next morning. A mistake because the biggest hill on the route is from Cartmel to the Bigland Hall Estate. It's hardly a monster – a climb of about 145 metres – and much easier if tackled from the Cartmel side (there's a 23.3% – section if you come the other way), but a trial with a bellyful of eggs and bacon nonetheless.
Despite the hills, it's advisable to take panniers – to fill with goodies from places like the Sticky Toffee Pudding factory in Flookburgh and Furness Fish, supplier of Morecambe Bay potted shrimps, in Grange-over-Sands. On the way back I weighed myself down a with hunk of cheddar from Cartmel Cheeses and three bottles of beer from Unsworth Yard Brewery, also in Cartmel.

Beer lovers are well catered for on the route. I bumped into an old teacher in Silverdale (hi Mr Alker!), who insisted I call in to the Snug Micropub at Carnforth station, better- known as the filming location for Brief Encounter. This convivial bar is so tiny I couldn't help but strike up conversations with fellow drinkers, one of whom had brought in some cider from his holidays that the landlord seemed happy for him to pass around.
A mile or two north, at the foot of Warton Crag, is Old School Brewery, which on the second Friday of the month opens as a pub (house-brewed ales £2.50 a pint). When passing through Lancaster, the Sun Hotel and the canalside Waterwitch are decent.

For those riding the route from Barrow (a good idea given the prevailing sea breezes), the restored art deco Midland Hotel in Morecambe makes a classy stop-off, particularly for afternoon tea. I stayed the night, which was a real treat for a Morecambe lass who spent her teenage years knocking about on the prom as the Midland grew ever more dilapidated.
Most of the route is on smooth country lanes, with the exception of a section of towpath between Hest Bank and Carnforth on the Morecambe side, the estuary towpath from Glasson to Lancaster and a mile or so of gravel between Haverthwaite and Greenodd. Grinning and bearing the gravel is preferable to the fast and scary A590.

The nicest bit is probably the stretch between Ulverston and Grange-over-Sands. Time hasn't been kind to Barrow, but the stretch from Conishead Priory via Gleaston Watermill is worth exploring — the Watermill has a great licensed cafe plus a converted pig sty dubbed “The Poshest Pig Let in Cumbria”. It is perfect for couples seeking a peaceful retreat, and a fitting overnight stay for a route combining peace and gluttony.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boston is the U.S. city best placed to capitalize on the shift to a digital economy, with the tech-centered San Francisco Bay Area second as it lost ground because of worsening quality of life, a report said on Wednesday.

The analysis of 25 cities' competitiveness by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation and others said it aimed to show which are ready for the digital revolution expected to transform every industry, from robotics to healthcare.
The analysis, “Innovation That Matters 2016,” ranked cities in six categories: talent; capital; industry specialization; culture, such as quality of life and regulation; and ties among entrepreneurs, universities, corporations, governments and others.
“The wake that this will leave behind has the potential to either be disastrous or game-changing for every city in the country,” Donna Harris, the co-chief executive of 1776, a Washington start-up fund that helped write the report, said on a conference call.
After Boston and the Bay Area, the top 10 cities in order were Denver; Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina; San Diego; Austin, Texas; Los Angeles; Philadelphia; Washington, D.C.; and New York.
California's Bay Area, home to Silicon Valley, was by far the leader in overall start-up activity. The region had 6,000 business launches from 2011 to 2015, twice the number of second-placed New York.
The Bay Area also has more money invested and the most tech talent, the report said.
But the region “is becoming too cutthroat to inspire success,” the report quoted area entrepreneurs as saying. They said the area's digital sector was not well-integrated with local universities and communities.
The Bay Area's quality of life also ranks 22nd among the 25 cities, possibly because of the rising cost of living, the report said.
The Boston area, home to Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, ranked third in start-ups, but finished on top of the list because of greater cohesiveness among universities, institutions and residents. It also boasts a fifth-place ranking for quality of life.
The report said that digital healthcare was by far the biggest sector for start-up businesses, even though the Bay Area, Boston, Los Angeles and New York showed an even breakdown across industries.
Besides the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation and 1776, the report was co-authored by Free Enterprise, an online Chamber magazine.
In a recent post for The Globe and Mail, in which I outlined the five essential payment strategy recommendations for small merchants in 2015, Bitcoin was deliberately omitted in the list.
Nonetheless, its absence raised a lot of questions: Why would one of the most innovative and promising new payment solutions not be a major consideration for small merchants?
As payment technologies advance, small businesses can benefit greatly from adopting quicker and cheaper ways to process transactions. And Bitcoin, which peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks, has been hailed by some as a promising way for retailers to grow their business and attract new customers.

Wrapped in the glittering allure of bleeding-edge innovation, it's easy to see why Bitcoin may be perceived as a tempting proposition for merchants, especially those eager to attract young, tech-savvy customers. Its low fees, international accessibility and cash-like properties add up to financial benefits that are tough to ignore. But every benefit is shadowed by risk that you need to be aware of if you're considering adopting this emerging cryptocurrency for your business. Ultimately,you'll need to determine your comfort level with the risks that come alongside the rewards.
If you're unsure whether Bitcoin is a good bet for your business, here are five considerations you'll want to think about.
Bitcoin costs less to process than other digital payment methods
Upside: Bitcoin transactions are cheaper than credit card transactions. While credit card fees average about 3 per cent, Bitcoin transactions cost merchants significantly less at about 1 per cent, which means merchants keep a lot more money in their pocket. And what small business owner doesn't want that?
Downside: Bitcoin isn't fee-free, however, and as transaction volumes grow, so does the potential for fee creep. Currently, in order to convert Bitcoin payments, merchants must pay a service provider like Coinbase or BitPay to exchange their Bitcoins into dollars. Expect to pay per transaction or per month.
The likes of Microsoft, Dell, Expedia and Overstock.com now accept Bitcoin
Upside: What started as a fringe currency with a handful of passionate proponents has become an advanced marketing strategy for hundreds of small businesses and a growing number of Fortune 500 companies. Bitcoin's got cachet in many desirable target markets, and its seamless international accessibility makes it an easy decision for businesses looking at global expansion.

Downside: According to a recent survey, 65 per cent of Americans are not at all familiar with Bitcoin. That's a significant portion of the population that hasn't even heard of the currency, let alone used it. Bitcoin is still in its early growth phase, and has a long way to go before it reaches anything close to mainstream usage.
Bitcoin is fast cash for your business
Upside: Unlike credit card payments, which can be held in escrow for up to a week, Bitcoin is money in your pocket just 10 minutes after the transaction is complete. Plus, there are no chargebacks or transaction reversals with Bitcoin, unlike with most other forms of payment, so you don't have to worry about returns or payment disputes.
Downside: Bitcoin's widely fluctuating currency value means money you made yesterday could be worth considerably less today unless you converted it into dollars immediately, which comes at a fee.
Once free from centralized oversight, Bitcoin is slowly being regulated
Upside: Once a pure peer-to-peer currency free from government oversight, as Bitcoin usage grows, so too does the likelihood of mechanisms being put in place to regulate and safeguard the currency. In Canada, it's already happening with crackdowns on money laundering and terrorist activity financing by way of the virtual currency. And the recent launch of the first licensed U.S. Bitcoin exchange means even more security and tighter regulation for the fledgeling currency.

Downside: For those with libertarian leanings, Bitcoin has been something of a payment panacea relatively free of government regulation. That may have been good for consumers, but isn't necessarily in the best interest of small businesses.
Bitcoin may be the beginning of a whole new way to pay
Upside: The appetite for and interest in the digital cryptocurrency is evidenced by the thousands of articles, discussion threads and daily transactions in the currency. And for merchants, it opens up the marketplace to a whole host of new customer segments.
Downside: Despite its advancements, Bitcoin's future remains uncertain. Along with security and regulatory issues, a constantly changing landscape of players and a lack of understanding among the majority of consumers, it's still in its nascent stages and could yet fade into obscurity or remain in the domain of cryptocurrency enthusiasts.
If you're willing to trade risk, volatility and an ever-changing payment landscape for the prospect of a global marketplace and lower costs, then Bitcoin may be right for you. But if you're like most small merchants who simply can't afford to take those kinds of risks, you may be better off waiting for the early adopters to iron out Bitcoin's biggest bumps.

It's not just women in science who have it rough. Architects experience similar sexism at work, shows a new survey by Architect's Journal. More than 70% of female architects who participated in the survey reported experiencing sexual discrimination, harassment or bullying at work. This reflects a troubling 10% jump from last year.
The study, titled “Women in Architecture,” draws on 1,104 responses from professionals in architecture, academia, engineering and other related fields, of whom 20% were men. And although it focuses on the UK, anecdotal evidence suggests the same grim scenario pervades architecture on the other side of the Atlantic.
Yen Ha, a principal at Front Studio Architects in New York City, tells Quartz that discrimination comes from all sides—clients, brokers, engineers and most consistently from contractors. At one project kick-off meeting, she recalls a real estate agent telling a contractor, “I'll have the real architect send the plans to you.”
“It's inevitable, it happens every single time,” Ha says.
The missing 32%
This kind of broad discrimination may be one reason that few women pursue the profession. In the US, men and women graduate from architecture school in roughly equal numbers, but only about 18% of licensed practitioners are women, according to the American Institute of Architects (AIA).
Why do so many trained architects abandon their metier? Another commonly cited reason for the drop off is that female architects with children have less time to devote to the highly competitive profession, and struggle to break back in after taking time off. “There's a big stigma for leaving architecture,” explains Rosa Sheng, who leads The Missing 32% Project, a multi-year investigation by the San Francisco chapter of the AIA. “Once you leave, it's like falling out of the pearly gates of heaven: You can never get back in,” Sheng told Architect Magazine in 2014.
“It's really rare to find women in architecture who have kids,” says Ha, who has two children of her own. According to the Architect's Journal study, 87% of survey respondents said that children had set back their careers.

The fight for more female starchitects
Mirroring the industry's gender disparity, there are few female role models in architecture. Zaha Hadid—the prize-winning Iraqi-British architect whose futurist buildings and personal candor frequently make the news—may be the field's lone living female celebrity. “I love that Zaha is this crazy presence in the field,” observes Ha. “She's a woman and she's putting herself out there. I think it makes huge difference.”
Hadid was the first and only solo female winner of the Pritzker Prize, the profession's most prestigious honor. The only other female laureate in Pritzker's 37-year history is Japanese architect Kazuyo Sejima who shared the honor with her partner Ryue Nishizawa in 2010. In 2013, Pritzker's jury famously denied Denise Scott Brown's petition to be recognized with her husband and design partner Robert Venturi.
In an effort to establish new female heroes, in 1998, the Royal Institute of British Architects and the Arts Council of England established the Jane Drew Prize, named for a revered English architect (and rumored M16 operative). But after the first year, controversy plagued the initiative, and it was put on hold until 2012, when Architect's Journal took over the prize and gave Hadid the honor. This year's winner, French architect and professor Odile Decq, is only its sixth recipient.
Ha says she's contemplated leaving architecture entirely, but doesn't want to leave the profession even more out of balance. “There are not a lot of women in architecture,” she says. “I feel like I would be letting down womankind by leaving. There's a responsibility to keep on working and to stay visible.”
Security firm Bitdefender preyed on the privacy-conscious tendencies of the smartphone user when it released its Clueful app last July, with its aim to snitch on apps which may be using your private data, UDID, or other such sensitive info they've often no business snooping through. Rather than allowing iOS users to continue believing in the fallacy that every app developed follows stringent ethical practice, Bitdefender sought to expose and in turn, inform users of exactly how apps may use your data without your knowing.
We live in a Digital Age, but whilst happy to sound-off on Twitter when a sensitive subject or issue is raised (Read: "Instagram is going to sell our images, abandon ship!" hysteria), most of those proclaiming to care about their privacy and security are decidedly reckless in applying it in practice. This is where Clueful comes in. No user is going to run in-depth analyses of every single app they install, so as a security firm, Bitdefender has done the leg work in producing an app which identifies flagrant abusers of your personal data.
The original app, as so often is the case where Apple was concerned, was subject to impromptu departure in the height of last year's summer, and although neither Bitdefender nor Apple were to explain the reasoning behind its departure, it would seem unlikely that the Cupertino took too kindly to the presence of what it may have seen as an ‘anti-app' app, defaming the legitimacy of its iconic store.
Nonetheless, a Web app is something Apple interfere with, and once again offers an easy-to-navigate database of apps and info on how they may share your personal data. As well as the search function, there's also feature to check out the App Store's ‘top free' apps, the biggest offenders, and those most recently analyzed by Bitdefender.
If you want to check out the Clueful app, point your browser to www.cluefulapp.com Two of the biggest offenders include apps by the name of "Free Music Download" and "Free Video Download". Should that be surprising?

President Obama's jobs bill was defeated in the Senate on Tuesday. While the vote remained open, it failed to attract enough support to stay alive in the chamber. The vote may end the bill's legislative life as a unified package while opening the door for efforts to pass pieces of it in coming months.
Republican opposition had assured defeat of the jobs bill for some time but Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has worked for weeks to try to unify Democrats in support of cloture on the package. Democrats hoped their relative unity would highlight GOP opposition to a measure that polls well.

When Valerie Taylor spotted a family of newcomers looking lost in the hustle and bustle of rush hour at Toronto's main Union Station on Wednesday, she offered to help them find their train. What she didn't know was that some 50 people would do the same, on a day that would turn out to be one of her most memorable trips home ever.
Taylor, a psychiatrist at Toronto's Women's College Hospital, said she was heading home on Wednesday after what had been a hectic few days. The heat was blazing, she was tired and looking forward to getting home, when she spotted a large family with two baby strollers and several heavy bags.
They looked confused, she said, and a young woman was trying to help them.
Taylor went over to see if she could lend a hand.
"Are you new here?" she asked. Only one of the children, who said he was 11, could speak much English.
"Yes," he said. They had just arrived from Syria four months ago, he told her, and were looking to get to Ancaster, about 85 kilometres southwest of Toronto, to spend a few days with family there.
'People started trying to problem-solve'
Taylor was headed in the same direction and offered to take them to the right train. To their surprise, strangers began to take notice and to help carry the family's bags up the stairs and onto the train, some riders even making room to give the family a place to sit, Taylor said.
But once they'd boarded and the 11-year-old showed Taylor the address they were headed to, she realized they were on the wrong train. It was London they were headed to, another 100 kilometres past Ancaster, and the Lakeshore West line they were on wouldn't get them there.
"Right away people started trying to problem-solve," Taylor said, some looking on their phones for the best way to get the family to London. "It was just: 'We have a goal, we have to get these people there.'"

Meanwhile, Taylor tracked down a GO Transit staff member on the train to try to find a solution, all the while the eyes of the second-oldest child — a nine-year-old boy — wide with wonder as she kept disappearing from their car and re-emerging with new information.
The staff member was able to speak to GO Transit's central control, and together they determined that the family could take a train to London from Aldershot station. The only problem: being a Via Rail train, it would cost a few hundred dollars — significantly more than the money they had in their plastic bag.
"All the other people on the train started helping again — people were trying to give money, somebody was calling their friend who spoke Arabic," Taylor said. She decided to accompany the family to Aldershot to make sure they got on the right train.
Acts of kindness
She'd also decided she would pay for their train tickets and helped them to enter their information into the self-serve kiosk.
If this was somebody who... was here from Victoria or Calgary or St. John's or Syria — it didn't matter. - Valerie Taylor
"The 11-year-old was a little bit suspicious, like, 'Okay, we've been in this country four months ... I don't know why everyone's trying to be so helpful,'" Taylor said.
But together he and Taylor entered the necessary details into the computer so that they could buy the tickets.
That's when a woman came running across the station and yelled, "Stop, stop! Don't pay for anything!"
It was a staff member. "I just got a call from the head office," she said. "GO is sending a bus."
In the end, though, Metrolinx, the agency in charge of regional transit, sent the family to London in two cabs, spokesperson Anne Marie Aikins told CBC News. The next train and bus weren't expected for some time so it was decided that was the best way to transport mom, dad and all six kids, one of whom was disabled and had a special stroller, she said.
It was yet another act of kindness in a string of so many Taylor witnessed that day. In total, she estimated about 50 people had helped in some way or another to get the family to London.
"It really was quite amazing," she said. "It was really just groups of random strangers coming together to just do the right thing and help this family connect with their relatives for the weekend."
'They're all connected'
"If this was somebody who ... was here from Victoria or Calgary or St. John's or Syria — it didn't matter," Taylor said.
Taylor said she was overwhelmed leaving the train station. Having missed her own stop to take the family to Aldershot, she got into a cab, where, she figures, the emotion of the day must have been visible on her face.
The driver, himself an immigrant, noticed and asked if she was OK. His concern only made her more emotional.
"I'm fine," she told him, "and you need to stop being nice or this is only going to get worse."
Amid all the chaos of that day, Taylor didn't get the name of the family and said she has no idea who they were. But it was a day she'll never forget, as she recounted in a Facebook post Wednesday.
"It really was one of the most moving things that I've ever had the privilege to be a part of," she said.
In particular, she said, she'll never forget the look on the nine-year-old boy's face as Taylor relayed information to and from the GO train staff member. He couldn't figure out how she could get from car to car.
"How are you doing that? How are you getting in and out?" he asked her at one point with what she said was a light in his eyes.
"They're all connected," she told him.
Correction, 6/1/2016: An earlier version of this story said that Subotica is south of Belgrade. This was incorrect. It is north of Belgrade.
On August 8, 1995, in the Croatian town of Dvor, a band of soldiers rounded up nine disabled refugees inside a school and executed them.
Metres away, a unit of Danish peacekeepers watched the massacre unfold. They had a clear view - through the large shattered windows - into the main hall, where most of the victims were shot dead.
They didn't know if the perpetrators were Serbs or Croats. But they had an idea who the victims were. They watched as one crumpled in a wheelchair, others on to crutches and walking sticks. They all had mental and physical disabilities.
The conflict
After the collapse of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, the region erupted into conflict. Croatia had seceded and fought Serb separatists in a war that lasted from 1991 to 1995, in which an estimated 40,000 people were killed.
In 1995, a United Nations-negotiated ceasefire came into effect. Danish forces were part of a peacekeeping mission to monitor the ceasefire.
In early 1995, a Danish company under the command of Jorgen Kold set up camp in Dvor, on the border with Bosnia.
The soldiers recalled feeling like they were on holiday when they first arrived - sunbathing inside the UN camp.
But when, in August 1995, the Croatian army launched an offensive to wrest back Serb-held lands, the UN peacekeepers were jolted from their illusionary holiday.
"You are to remain neutral and take care," were the UN's orders.
"It was like being in a war movie but without taking part in it," explained Henrik Terpager Staal, who was then a UN peacekeeper. "It was as if a bell jar was covering the [UN] camp."
"There was fighting all around the camp. People were shooting everywhere."
A 15-minute massacre
They watched as Serbs fled in cars, horse-drawn carriages and on foot, heading towards Bosnia. An estimated 250,000 people left in just days.
The school in Dvor served as a resting point for the refugees.
On August 8, four days after the offensive began, an officer sent a radio dispatch: 12 to 15 soldiers were moving towards the school. They were a motley crew, dressed in plain clothes and camouflage. It was impossible to tell which side they belonged to.
By this point, most of the refugees had already left the school. The former peacekeepers said they didn't know that so many disabled Croats and Serbs had been left behind inside.
Staal was positioned on the boundary of the UN camp with a machine-gun.
He recalled what happened next. "I make eye contact with one of them. I don't know if he's a Croat or Serb. He lights his cigarette, and I light mine. We nod to each other as if we're saying, 'There's no immediate danger.'"
The atrocities should have been stopped. We allowed murder to be committed without doing anything. Thomas Karstenskov, former peacekeeper in Kold's unit
A few men entered the school, then a hand grenade went off.
From their observation post, just 35 metres away, the peacekeepers had an unobstructed view of the main hall, where they saw some soldiers enter, leading elderly and disabled people with their hands behind their heads.
Former peacekeeper Jan Wellendorff Pedersen recalled seeing the soldiers talking, then one suddenly wheeling around. He heard a shot. One of the disabled people fell to the ground.
"Then the soldier turns the other way and shoots the old lady in the wheelchair," he said.
After killing nine people at the school, the soldiers left.
An order that never came
Pedersen was troubled by his unit's failure to act.
"Watching them get away with it and leave like they'd been shopping, I wasn't a big fan of that, and not being able to do a thing, especially because I knew they were few compared to us. If the order had come to 'fire at will', we could've raised our guns and shot directly into the main hall," he said.
But the order never came.
Kold is now 61. He has soft blue eyes, blond hair that is cropped short, much like it was when he was stationed in Croatia, and a quiet, serious demeanour.
Twenty years on, the massacre still haunts him.
"I didn't know that it was an impending massacre," he said, explaining that he could only have acted in "self-defence".
"I could not have prevented it."
The words of the parents of his men - "Remember to bring my son home" - played constantly in his mind, he said, explaining that had he intervened, he would have risked losing some of them.
"None of my men were here as individuals. [They were] under my command and under a UN mandate which didn't exist any more. Therefore, we were asked to return to the camp, keep our heads down, be quiet, and not get involved in the fight.
"If the order had been 'fire at will', we probably would've shot," Staal said. "But then, I'm sure some of us wouldn't be here today."
The victims
The victims' bodies laid untouched for four days in 30-degree temperatures until the peacekeepers ventured into the school. Four of the nine were never identified.
The victims had been evacuated from a psychiatric hospital in Petrinja, 60km from Dvor, when the shelling began there.
They left with nurses, but "the system had broken down. There was no one left to take care of them. Chaos," remembered Bozo Bajlovic, who organised the evacuation.
He said those patients who "could walk and think clearly" probably joined the refugees heading for Bosnia. "Those who couldn't go stayed behind. And what happened, happened."
Ljubica Janjanin was a passenger on the bus carrying the patients. She had volunteered to help to evacuate the patients so that she and her daughter could escape the fighting as well. She remembered holding one of the women in her lap. She was small - "like a child", she said.
They were all received at the school in Dvor. The civilians were taken into the big classroom, and the patients were taken to the small classroom. When the soldiers arrived on August 8, they took the disabled to the main hall and executed them.
Two of the victims were women from Janjanin's hometown, Petrinja, and she wants justice for them.
Return to Dvor
But the case has never been solved.
In August 2014, Kold returned to Dvor to try and find out who was responsible for the killings.
He travelled there with Villy Bogelund, the former chief investigator into the massacre for the UN war crimes tribunal.
I believe that shooting a disabled person who isn't a possible threat is as brutal as it gets. It's the same as shooting a child. Villy Bogelund, former chief investigator into the Dvor massacre
"I believe that shooting a disabled person who isn't a possible threat is as brutal as it gets. It's the same as shooting a child," said Bogelund.
Twenty years on, Kold barely recognised the school, but immediately spotted the main hall where, he said, "the disabled were liquidated".
He met Janjanin, who told him: "We looked at you and expected you to come to us. But no one came."
Kold explained that he didn't notice that they were asking for help. "Yes, of course we saw somebody, but couldn't see that they were ill or what I hear now, that they actually asked for help."
"We looked so much at your soldiers that it was impossible for you not to see us. It's not like we were ants. We tried using gestures and all kinds of things, but no one reacted," Janjanin replied.
She said she remembers the peacekeepers looking away or turning their backs. "We were used to the fact that the UN always took care of civilians. Maybe you should have come to us inside the school."
But the unit was instructed not to leave the camp or interfere, Kold explained.
"Why couldn't you at least have taken the disabled across the bridge to Bosnia? Then we could all have a clear conscience today," asked Janjanin.
The killers
At the time of the massacre, both Croatian and Serbian forces were in the vicinity of Dvor. Neither side has admitted to the killings.
General Mile Novakovic was a commander of the Serbian forces in Dvor. He was convicted in absentia by a Croatian court for war crimes committed in 1993. He died in September 2015, a year after we talked to him in his garden in the city of Subotica, north of Belgrade.
Novakovic insisted that he couldn't be sure where his troops were at the time of the massacre.
"Our only mission after everything had fallen apart was to let the column of refugees passes without any disturbance and get out of the way of the shootings and slaughter," he said.
He blamed the Croatian army.
Colonel Bruno Cavic was a commander of the Croatian forces in Dvor. He denied that any of his men were in the town on August 8, 1995. But he offered a hypothesis as to why the disabled might have been killed.
"Sometimes, in your mind, you think you are doing something good for them, you are ending their suffering, and you end it ... You cannot help them; you don't want to leave them to the cruel enemy who is coming," he said, shrugging. "For me, that is one of the explanations."
According to Kold, his unit observed at least three Croatian soldiers, with baseball caps and backpacks, near the camp on the morning of the massacre.
"Either they're covering it up, or someone doesn't want to remember," he said.
'An impossible mandate'
But Kold cannot forget.
"I have felt very sorry since 1995 and up to today," he said.
"It wasn't our job, but I still feel disappointed in myself. Could we somehow have helped? No, we would have been hit. There was no mandate, and the war took place among the refugees."
Bogelund believes the peacekeepers had an "impossible mandate".
Kold thinks the people who defined it never accounted for "how to help those around us.
"The soldiers found that hard to understand, and none of the people on either side were informed of what we were not allowed to do, so they expected us to help them."
He believes the mandate needs to be made clearer for peacekeepers in future conflicts.
But former peacekeeper Thomas Karstenskov is clear about what he thinks should have been done.
"The atrocities should have been stopped," he said. "We allowed murder to be committed without doing anything."
And having offered that axiom, he returns his aim to the enemy, and unleashes another barrage.
"Can I ask," I begin, "why are you shooting?" "Because I hate Front National," Yue tells me simply. "If you use violence, doesn't that reduce you to their level?" "I don't know," Yue answers, after awhile. "I don't care. FN equals violence."
The server lag from so many people throwing up so much gunfire slows the battle to a slow motion firefight, but I manage to wade up to TonTonCarton Yue, who is strafing the FN building with a chaingun usually associated with an AC-130 gunship, than a political protest.
The first night I arrived at the protest against the Second Life headquarters of Front National , the far right French political party of Jean-Marie Le Pen, it was ringed on all sides by protesters with signs to wave and statements to distribute. By the second night I came (this was late last week), the conflict had become more literal, for many Residents had armed themselves. Multi-colored explosions and constant gunfire shredded the air of Porcupine, a shopping island which FN had inexplicably picked for the site of their virtual world HQ , in December.
I'm pretty sure I know what Dr. King would think of a protest against an anti-immigrant political party, but if you asked me what he'd say after the thing devolved into a virtual conflagaration of mini-guns, cursing Frenchmen, and exploding pigs, well, there I'm somewhat at a loss.
It didn't begin like this. After Front National took root, at least two groups, antiFN and SL Left Unity, rose to oppose them. They had placards and T-shirts, and billboards on the land of sympathetic neighbors, all making plain that FN's arrival in Second Life was distinctly unwelcome. For their part, Front National members-- mostly muscular young men dressed in white T-shirts with the FN logo-- stood inside their headquarters, impassively watching the outrage build outside.
An unneighborly message from the nearby Autistic Liberation Front
"This nationalist idea that Front National is advocating is something that has spread all over Europa like a virus," Ichi Jaehun tells me. "It's [as if] the history of the 20th century has already been forgotten. It is time to say enough!"
Ichi Jaehun rallies the protest
Her concern is not alarmist. On a US spectrum, Front National is perhaps one or two notches to the right of Pat Buchanan, but unlike Buchanan (who garnered just half of one percent in the 2000 Presidential election), Le Pen's political base is far more substantial.
Diverse avatar protesters gather outside FN headquarters
In France's 2002 election, Le Pen forced a runoff against President Jacques Chirac, and with his belligerent nationalism and calls to forcibly exile non-European immigrants from the country, garnered a popular vote of 18%. (An 18%, it's worth noting, who were evidently unconcerned or agreeable to Le Pen's grotesque dismissal of Nazi gas chambers as a mere "detail of history".)
Another Presidential election looms this June, and the fear is recent immigrant riots in Paris and other woes will bring more French to the flame-shaped banner of Front National. When they arrived in-world, an official press release boasted that FN was "the first political party in France and in Europe to open an official and permanent representation in Second Life"-- an evident move to position themselves as a technologically savvy, forward-thinking party of a new Europe. (Their version of Europe, that is.)
FN's new neighbor, the SLLU
But the SL Left Unity group had press releases of their own. "We have acquired land next to the FN office," one announced, "and will be manning a protest there until FN go or are ejected. Wherever fascists are we will ensure they get no peace to corrupt and lie to decent people."
The announcement went on: "The whole idea of a 'race hate' group is in direct violation of Linden Lab's own Terms of Service, and if the rules are being read to say they aren't in violation, then Lindens need to look at the rules again." (This is an apparent reference, by the way, not to the TOS, but Linden's Community Standards, which forbid "use of derogatory or demeaning language or images in reference to another Resident's race, ethnicity, gender, religion, or sexual orientation". But while Front National may have run counter to those standards in the real world, it's uncertain if their SL chapter ever has.)
Besides such organized oppostion, at least some resistance was impromptu.
"I find the FN in type 'francais' in the Search mode and I was revolting by this," a French Resident named Zok Greene tells me in fractured but eager English, explaining why he'd joined the protest. "And more because it's the presidential election in France in Juin and Le Pen was 'presenté'... and why?!! You can't try to get vote like this, it's a game!"
Thomas the Tank Engine's Holographic Attack
It's unclear when the shooting started, or who fired the first shot (several witnesses claim FN security forces assaulted them with "push guns", weapons capable of flinging a Resident across the island like a ragdoll), but in the final days of last week, at least, the assault raged from both sides. It's also unclear if the anti-FN protest groups were involved in the escalating violence-- Officers with both antiFn and SLLU haven't replied to my Instant Message-- though by personal observation, at least a few members seemed to be. Since Porcupine is not a damage-enabled area, weapons there have about as much stopping power as pointing one's finger at the computer screen and saying Bang Bang. But get enough projectiles flying, and server lag is bound to ground anyone's use of the area to a halt. (Or in my case, cause the Second Life viewer to crash.)
And so it raged, a ponderous and dreamlike conflict of machine guns, sirens, police cars, "rez cages" (which can trap an unsuspecting avatar), explosions, and flickering holograms of marijuana leaves and kids' TV characters, and more. By California time, the battles often culminated at 2am, 3am, and even later into the small hours of the American clock, when Residents in Europe are most active. So amid the exchange of salvos, the chat log was choked over with pro and anti-Le Pen curses, most in French. And when the lag was not too overwhelming to stream audio, the whole fracas was accompanied by bursts of European techno.
A pig munition, primed to blow
One enterprising insurrectionist created a pig grenade, fixed it to a flying saucer, and sent several whirling into Front National headquarters, where they'd explode in a starburst of porcine shrapnel. A few native English speakers joined the fray, though at least one missed the point in either direction, unhelpfully shouting "The French stink! Get out of Second Life!" and the like amid the conflict.
And so, while America slept, the battle against extremism raged on thus in Europe.
By last weekend, whole sections of the FN office were gone, apparently lost to lag or sabotage, their banners and posters floating in mid-air. And FN members seemed notably absent, too. Frenchman Zok Greene pronounced himself satisfied with that turn of events.
"Would it have been better to debate their ideas or even just ignore them?" I ask him. "Now they can claim they were 'suppressed' and their free speech was infringed."
"No," Zok insists. "With these persons we can't debate or ignored. We can't because it's not acceptable."
By today, the headquarters of Front National has entirely disappeared from Porcupine; in its place, a tiny casino has sprung up overnight, and is already receiving customers.
In honor of the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., a special sun is made to arc across the grid of Second Life today. If you look close enough, you'll see it's inset with the face of the man who was so untimely cut down, when far too much of his work remained. In his country, the world beyond, and, perhaps, in worlds he never could have imagined.
And in this way, Dr. King literally shines down on an empty field, where once the forces of division made a bid to establish themselves. But I wonder what he'd make of the subsequent reaction, from high-minded words and protest, to decidedly violent uncivil disobedience. (Like intolerance, most physical attacks are also prohibited by Second Life's Community Standards.)
As for Front National, though they're gone from the land of Porcupine, they claim to be unphased.
"They're a bunch of losers," FN Officer Wolfram Hayek tells me grinning, when I ask about the protesters. "We're gonna tighten security and come back."
Anthony Divers is seen moments before a violent confrontation with a security guard
James Street between Bold Street and Hunter Street West, just south of the underpass, was busy with both pedestrians and traffic when "more than one shot was fired by the police officer." But Gennaro won't say how many shots.
"The SIU understands that there were many people in the area," said Gennaro. "Specifically, we know there were persons on a transit bus stopped on James Street and others walking on the east side of James Street. The unit is appealing to these persons and asking them to contact us."
Witness Khalid Yousaf told The Spectator the man was shot twice: "Then he fell down."
Yousaf, a Blue Line cab driver, was pulling out of Augusta Street onto James Street South when he spotted the man on the west sidewalk. He thought he'd try picking up a customer, but then the police officer showed up and Yousaf realized something was wrong.
The officer told the man to stop walking away. "He never stopped. He walked the opposite way," Yousaf said.
The officer followed and kept telling the man to stop, he added. Then the man turned to face the officer and stretched out his arms at his side and palms facing the officer, Yousaf said.
"Then, he fired."
Yousaf couldn't speculate as to why the officer shot the man.
Patrons of James Street bars near Augusta rushed outside after hearing shots ring out.
"All we heard was a crack and then someone yelled, 'A police officer just shot a person,'" said Jeff Hart, who was in Uno Mas, at 150 James St. S.
Witnesses, who didn't see the shooting but took in the ensuing commotion, describe officers running to the scene.
"There was an echo. You couldn't miss it," said Dale Graham, who was at the YMCA.
Graham left his third-floor room and went to see what had happened.
"I could see a guy on the ground."
Heavily armed officers arrived on scene, Graham said. Police, then paramedics, attended to the man.
Paramedic supervisor Craig McCleary said EMS transported him to St. Joseph's hospital where he died.
Others say police who were providing security for a crew shooting a television show nearby rushed to the scene after hearing the shots.
"They were running down James," said Jennifer Hart, who was with her husband, Jeff, in Uno Mas.
"It's just weird for Hamilton," Jeff added.
Just before the shooting, police were called to an assault at the corner of King William Street and Catharine Street North.
Security camera footage from the Film Work Lofts at 80 King William St., which was also provided to police, shows a man walking around the building and at times leaning against it. A woman security guard approaches him and the two have what appears to be a heated discussion. It ends with the man hitting the woman once and walking away.
The time stamp on the video is 11:33 p.m. and it lists the view as Catharine Street.
The manager of Club Seventy-Seven, Dirty Dog Saloon and The Underground says the woman works for them. He says she has not returned to work since Friday.
The SIU says the person involved in the assault did not receive medical attention.
Divers are "a very loving and caring brother and friend and there's nothing he wouldn't do to help those he cared about," said Daniel. "He is going to be sadly and deeply missed by many whose lives he brightened and affected. I'm personally so deeply heartbroken and lost over this. He was always there for me and carried me through some of my hardest times. Times I'd not have made it through without his love, support, and guidance."
Divers' Facebook page lists his college as the "School of Hard Knocks" and says he's a personal trainer.
Yellow police tape created a perimeter around the scene Saturday — from just south of Bold Street to Hunter Street and from James to John streets.
Behind the tape, a cruiser was parked in front of an out-of-service city bus.
A backpack and other discarded items could be seen on the street just outside the James South driveway to the Hunter Street GO station.
A small orange cone was placed on the street near the Chateau Royale condo building, to mark where blood still dotted the road Saturday afternoon.
The SIU has assigned seven investigators and three forensic investigators to the case. They have designated one subject officer and eight witness officers.
Both the SIU and Hamilton Police were on scene Saturday.
Hamilton officers looked under garbage cans and in bushes along James South, and an officer directed a search dog to leap up and sniff more than a dozen planter boxes in front the Chateau Royale. Police would not say what they were looking for.
Anyone with information about the shooting is asked to contact the SIU lead investigator at 1-800-787-8529 ext. 2038.

Some classic cannabis strains like Blue Dream, Sour Diesel, and Granddaddy Purple never go out of style. But beyond these household names, which strains are lining up for their turn in the spotlight? We took a look at traffic to strain pages and found these seven varieties to be booming among Massachusetts consumers. But will they live up to the hype?
Alien OG
Featured in our lineup of strains that deliver the best bang for your buck, Alien OG promises potency alongside flavors of sharp pine and lemon. This strain is best saved for THC heavyweights looking for a strong, euphoric ride.
Banana Kush
With an aroma reminiscent of ripe bananas, Banana Kush delivers cool, calm effects that play well with almost any activity. Share Banana Kush among friends to spark conversation or enjoy it in a solo sesh before diving into your next creative project.
Sweet Tooth
What's not to love about a strain that smells like sweet candied berries and wildflowers? Covered in a sugary mess of crystal resin, Sweet Tooth eradicates stress and replaces it with a blissful, dreamy headspace.
Goji OG
It's easy to get lost in the multifaceted aroma of Goji OG. Leading with the scent of exotic berries, this widely sought-after strain leaves you with a fruit bowl of flavors on the exhalation.
GG1
A sister strain to the famous GG4, this flavorful cut offers the same mega-punch of potency alongside an invigorating pine flavor. Look to GG1 for a heavy-handed high combined with deep physical relaxation.
Candyland
Glistening with sugar-like trichomes, Candyland is a treat for the eyes especially. Its sweet, woody aroma draws you in, and with the exhalation comes electrifying cerebral energy that makes the world feel just a little bit brighter.
ACDC
Sometimes, it's nice to harness the benefits of cannabis without a foggy head. With ACDC, you can remedy symptoms and stress with a clear mind, as this strain contains only trace levels of THC.
Alpine Beer Company 2351 Alpine Boulevard, Alpine
Green Flash Brewing Co. 6550 Mira Mesa Boulevard, Mira Mesa
They've learned to live with stymieing limitations over the years, but life is getting better for fans of Alpine Beer Co. (2351 Alpine Boulevard, Alpine). The deal owner and brewmaster Pat McIlhenney struck up with Green Flash Brewing Company in the summer of 2013 is finally bearing fruit. The first big batch of Alpine beer produced at Green Flash's Mira Mesa facility was brewed in March. That run of Nelson IPA has been well received, with consumers reporting it tastes exactly like Nelson produced at Alpine's brewery. Next up will be monthly batches of Duet IPA and Hoppy Birthday, in that order.
There may be even more in store for the many who love this craft cult favorite. But first, McIlhenney wants to make sure that love is wide-ranging enough to justify investment in the next step. On Monday, a message was sent to Alpine e-newsletter subscribers briefly explaining that the company is mulling over an opportunity to lease the space formerly occupied by the defunct restaurant and bakery, Alpine Bread Basket (1347 Tavern Road, #22, Alpine).
The electronic communique addressed the fact that the limited space of Alpine's barbecue-centric brewpub and tasting room have turned some would-be fans off, and explained that landing the Bread Basket would give them a larger venue with a lot more seating. Of course, the rent would be higher, so McIlhenney asked fans to reply back to let him know if there would be enough interest for them to snatch up the opportunity without losing his shirt. It's an interesting way of gauging customer sentiment, but craft brewing is a different kind of industry. If you'd like to weigh in, send Alpine your feedback.
Initially I was planning to fuse Goku Black with Dark Naruto (the one from the waterfall of truth). But then I realized that Dark Naruto isn't actually a character, but a inner variation of character, like a "transformation" so to speak.Goku Black, or just "Black" as he's normally referred to, the infamous villain who destroyed Trunks's future in the meanings of fulfilling his wicked plan of killing all human beings - merged with Uchiha Shin, the test subject body who fights for a world where war will keep the evolution of human beings in motion.Black is fascinated with the power of the saiyans and Shin has a fixation on the Uchiha clan. Black desires to find Trunks and Shin idolizes Itachi, so both of them have some relation with Truntachi (Future Trunks and Itachi fusion) I truly hope you like itPersonally I think he kinda looks like a Lord Sith, which is cool xDGoku Black and Uchiha Shin do not belong to me, only this concept.
Story highlights Sanders said Democrats must focus on winning over working-class voters
The demonstration was initially organized to oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership
(CNN) Bernie Sanders is back on the stump.
The independent senator from Vermont, who has emerged as a party leader in the aftermath of Hillary Clinton's defeat last week, said Thursday that progressives must dedicate themselves to winning over voters who turned to Donald Trump on Election Day.
In a speech to hundreds of supporters and activists gathered on a chilly fall afternoon in Washington, Sanders pinned Trump's victory on the Democratic establishment's failure to engage with millions of Americans who feel forgotten by political leaders and hemmed in by stagnant local economies.
"The party has got to recognize some very important realities that Donald Trump, in fact, recognized," Sanders said, keeping up a drumbeat he began last week in a New York Times op-ed and has returned to in a round of subsequent appearances. "And that is, yes, we are better off today economically than we were eight years ago, we've made a lot of progress in a lot of areas. But there are millions and millions of people today, working-class people, middle-class people, who are living in despair. And we have got to recognize that reality."
Sanders campaigned heartily for Clinton after she clinched the Democratic nomination this summer, but as the American left begins to consider its options in the wake of a slow-building electoral wipeout -- Republicans now control the White House, both chambers of Congress, and dominate state politics -- he and the movement that fueled his campaign are moving quickly to grab hold of the party.

Historian claims the Psalter is ‘undoubtedly' the property of martyred saint, and that he may have been holding it when he was murdered
A Cambridge academic believes he has discovered Thomas Becket's personal book of psalms, an ancient manuscript the martyred saint and so-called “turbulent priest” may have been holding when he was murdered in Canterbury Cathedral in 1170.
Dr Christopher de Hamel, a historian at Cambridge University, stumbled across the book during a conversation with a colleague. De Hamel, author of the just-released Meetings with Remarkable Manuscripts, had said that books belonging to saints were generally not used as relics, and his fellow historian replied that he knew of an exception.
Who owned this Canterbury psalter? Read more
He showed de Hamel an entry from the Sacrists' Roll of Canterbury Cathedral, dating to 1321, which gave a detailed description of a Psalter, or book of psalms, in a jewelled binding, that was then preserved as a relic at the shrine of Becket in the cathedral. Becket, archbishop of Canterbury from 1162 to 1170, was murdered by four knights inside the cathedral, who took on the task after supposedly hearing Henry II remark: “Who will rid me of this turbulent priest?”
De Hamel said that he read the Psalter's description, and realised he had seen it before: an Anglo-Saxon Psalter in Cambridge's Parker Library bears the same description on its flyleaf. It is undoubtedly the same manuscript from Becket's shrine, he believes.
A 16th-century note says the book once belonged to Becket, but “everyone has always said it was ridiculous,” said de Hamel. “Becket is a big name and there's a list of his books. This isn't one of them.” But a link had not previously been made between the 14th-century inventory and the Parker manuscript.
In a piece in Saturday's Guardian Review, De Hamel lays out how the Psalter was clearly made in Canterbury, and dates from the very early 11th century. It was probably, he said, made for the private use of an archbishop, likely Alphege, who was archbishop from 1005 to 1012, when he was killed by the Danes in Greenwich. Alphege was later canonised, and was Becket's personal patron saint.
“People hadn't matched it up, and suddenly there it was,” said de Hamel. “The inscription says this is the Psalter of the archbishop of Canterbury. It clearly is a private Psalter … I assume Becket had come across the book and taken it into his own possession.”

The academic also points to the stained glass window in Trinity Chapel in Canterbury, which shows Becket holding a book of the Psalter's size, in a similarly decorated binding. The window is above the site of the shrine of Becket, and is almost contemporary to the saint's death, made around 1200. The shrine was destroyed in the 16th century by Henry VIII.
“Of course he is going to be shown holding something you could have seen on the shrine – that's part of ­­the marketing,” said de Hamel. “The shrine was destroyed, and nothing from it survives, except possibly this. It would have been seen by pilgrims to the shrine [including] Chaucer. And it was sitting quietly in Cambridge.”
De Hamel said he was “absolutely sure” that the Parker library manuscript is the book that sat on Becket's shrine. “Whether it really belonged to Becket - well, I wasn't there. But I bet it did. [The creators of the shrine] obviously absolutely believed it was his. And I expect it was,” he said.
“Of course I want this to be the book he was holding when he died – but we don't know he was holding a book. We do know that when he died he commended his soul to St Alphege … It was clear to him it was coming. He left the room, and the knights there. He went upstairs, kitted himself out with his archiepiscopal [appurtenances], his ring, his mitre, and walked into the cathedral where they caught up with him and did it. Whether he also picked up the Psalter, I don't know. There's certainly no blood on the manuscript, but I don't think there's any doubt that moments after his death, they swept it up and said this is the most personal possession of the martyr. He would have had it on his person: it was his talisman of the divine.”
Becket's death has been commemorated many times over the centuries, by authors ranging from TS Eliot – who immortalised it in Murder in the Cathedral – to Alfred, Lord Tennyson. In his A History of Britain, Simon Schama writes that Henry II, enraged by Becket's excommunication of those responsible for crowning his son, did not actually utter the famous phrase about the “turbulent priest”.
Instead, writes Schama, the knights heard the “much more alarming outcry” from the king of “What miserable drones and traitors have I nourished and brought up in my household who allow their lord to be treated with such shameful contempt by a low-born cleric?”
Becket's death on 29 December 1170, at the hands of the knights Reginald FitzUrse, William de Tracy, Richard le Bret and Hugh de Morville, who took the king at his word, is recounted in disturbing detail by eyewitness Edward Grim:
The stricken martyr bent his knees and elbows, offering himself as a living sacrifice, saying in a low voice, ‘For the name of Jesus and the protection of the church I am ready to embrace death.' But the third knight inflicted a grave wound on the fallen one; with this blow he shattered the sword on the stone and his crown, which was large, separated from his head so that the blood turned white from the brain yet no less did the brain turn red from the blood; it purpled the appearance of the church with the colours of the lily and the rose, the colours of the Virgin and Mother and the life and death of the confessor and martyr.
In his piece for Review, de Hamel called the Psalter “a tangible link with one of the very great figures of history”, adding that “nothing else imaginable has such personal intimacy”.

Vollmann Writes About Fukushima's 'Quiet Horror' In 'Harper's Magazine'
David Greene talks to writer William T. Vollmann, who has gained an almost cult-status for his immersion-style storytelling. Vollmann traveled to Japan's now defunct Fukushima nuclear power plant.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
The last time we checked in with the journalist William T. Vollmann, he had made an alarming discovery. He made freedom of information request to see any government documents that pertained to him. And wouldn't you know it, he learned that the FBI had suspected him of possibly being the Unabomber.
Strange things seem to follow Vollmann or maybe it's that he follows strange things. He's gone to extremes to put himself in the middle of stories about war and crime, this time, a nuclear fallout. It's been nearly four years since an earthquake and tsunami triggered the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl in a large exclusion zone known as the red zone now exists around Japan's Fukushima's nuclear plant. Vollmann visited and writes about the quiet horror of the place in the March issue of Harper's Magazine. He describes many former residents as nuclear refugees.
WILLIAM T. VOLLMANN: They are very, very attached to the place where they were born. And they're hoping someday to go back. You know, decontamination is making some progress in many, many areas. But the fact is they can't really decontaminate the forest, the mountains and so forth unless they were to clear-cut everything.
GREENE: And so the people you're talking about who are attached, are they going back to their homes even with the great risk?
VOLLMANN: Most of the people in the red zones are allowed to return very, very briefly once or twice a year to their homes to take care of them. In October, I went to the city of Okuma, and I met one resident who had returned. He was dressed up in his anti-radiation gear, and he was pruning the bushes in front of his house. But it's very, very quiet in these places, very eerie. You sometimes see wild boar walking down the streets. Residents tell me there are many rats in their houses. I've seen rat droppings, but I haven't seen the rats.
GREENE: Some of your writing here was just so apocalyptic where there was just this invisible thread that you couldn't see or feel. I mean, can you paint me just a portrait of one of these places that you saw?
VOLLMANN: It's beautiful in a way sometimes. You know, the Goldenrod is covering a lot of these houses that were wrecked by the tsunami. You see wild birds. The salmon sometimes are spawning, and it's hard to believe that it's dangerous. But then you find, oh, you know, this drain pipe, that sewer grating, this grassy area that looks very, very inviting, it's insanely radioactive and I better stay away from it. And then in the centers of the cities, everything is sad and broken. There are weeds growing through the sidewalk, and the feeling of horror just kind of grows as you go back and back to these places.
GREENE: Is there an encounter with a person that sort of stands out in your mind?
VOLLMANN: There was a very kind man, Mr. Endo, who agreed to take me to his house in Tomioka.
GREENE: This is inside the red zone.
VOLLMANN: Yes, and I remember looking inside his house, and it was just a jumble of wreckage and rat droppings that had been shaken up by the tsunami. And one of the crazy things about being a nuclear refugee is that you are still on the hook for the mortgage of your radioactive house...
GREENE: Huh.
VOLLMANN: ...Unless it is more than 50 percent damaged by the tsunami. So poor Mr. Endo is still having to pay his mortgage and saying, you know, it would've been so much better for me if my house had collapsed. He has no real hope of ever going back and living there. He's in his 60s.
GREENE: William Vollmann, I'm just curious. I mean, last time we spoke, we talked about how the FBI thought you might be the Unabomber. You've traveled with the Mujahideen. You've smoked crack with prostitutes in California. I mean, you have a certain style of sort of your reporting where you want to be in the middle of something, so to speak. And here, you're exposing yourself to radiation. I mean, what drives you?
VOLLMANN: Well, one time I read an E.O. Wilson book about the ants.
GREENE: E.O. Wilson. You're talking about the famous Harvard naturalist and professor, right?
VOLLMANN: That's right. Yeah. He says that it's common in ant colonies for the older female ants to take more and more risks. They've already reproduced, and if they don't come back, it's no real loss to the ant colony. And I'm an older person. I'm 55. I've reproduced. I'm going to die in any event, so I have less to fear. And I would really like to try to do some good in the world before I die and, you know, if I get cancer as a result, it's no real loss. The more I see of, you know, the disasters that nuclear power can cause, the more I think I would really like to describe this and help people share my alarm.
GREENE: We've been speaking with author and journalist William T. Vollmann. Mr. Vollmann, thanks so much for coming on the program. We appreciate it.
VOLLMANN: Oh, thanks for having me back. I appreciate it, too.

Getty Images Do a Google Image search for "robotics" and you'll see the expected: Cute, humanoid machines reminiscent of a sci-fi movie. "Industrial robotics" yields something else: Images of iron arms on swinging pedestals constructing cars on an assembly line.
The reality is somewhere in between. In 2016, hulking machines are still executing heavy-duty tasks, but humanoid types are increasingly working alongside humans on assembly lines.
Manufacturing isn't that different from everyday life—smart robots are showing up in factories just as they're invading our homes. "People say the robots are coming," said Sander van't Noordende, group chief executive of Accenture's products group. "But I think they're already here."
Eyed robots
Robots have typically been used in an industrial setting to complete repetitive tasks. However, a new wave of robots can adapt and learn new tasks much like a human. In 2012, for instance, Rethink Robotics introduced Baxter, a human-sized robot ranging from 3 feet tall and 165 pounds to 6 feet and 300 pounds. Spend a few minutes teaching Baxter how to do a simple task, like putting something on a conveyor belt or packing a box, and he can do it forever. But you can also teach something Baxter new after that, so he's endlessly adaptable.
Baxter has since been overshadowed by Sawyer. The younger sibling can lift more than Baxter and do more precision work. Like Baxter, he's safe to work around. A monitor screen sports animated eyes. "They're actually indicators," said Mike Fair, manager of application systems at Rethink Robotics, of Sawyer's eyes. "You're not surprised what he's going to do next." The eyes also make Sawyer more human-like. "We tried to give him personality," Fair said. "It makes people feel more comfortable about working around robots."
Similarly, Germany's pi4 has a robot called Anna that can learn a new motion just by being guided to do so. pi4 also recently spun off a unit that rents robots. "The robot then gets paid like a worker minimum wage, €8.50 per hour," said Ralph Schmidt. "But this worker then works like three workers, overnights also."
Expect more of their type. MIT professor Daniela Rus doesn't see robots replacing humans necessarily, but rather helping them perform physical tasks the way smartphones help us execute mental work today. Rus's Distributed Robotics Lab at MIT has built robots that can tend gardens, bake cookies and cut a birthday cake, among other tasks.
Influence on manufacturing
While robots are up and coming, they are not commonly seen on the shop floor. Robots are currently used for about 10 percent of all the tasks they could be employed for, according to the Boston Consulting Group.
That's not always the case. Japan has more industrial robots-306,700-than in all of North America, according to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR). The auto industry also over-indexes for industrial robots. Some 35 percent of all industrial robots are helping make auto parts, while another 29 percent are making the cars themselves, according to the IFR.
Such robots perform unsubtle work like hefting heavy things, painting and applying glue. As the robots get smaller and more agile, their list of chores will expand. Renault uses units that weigh 64 pounds and drives screws into engines.
These more agile robots will likely boost the bots-to-human ratio in manufacturing. The global robotics market will grow from $25.69 billion in 2014 to $53.22 billion in 2020, according to Research and Markets. The Boston Consulting Group predicts by 2025, the share of manufacturing tasks performed by robots will jump to 25 percent.
The outlook for robots
In 2016, there's evidence that robots can help with more and more tasks. Amazon's Echo, a cylinder device that uses artificial intelligence, has become a hit. Robots also help vacuum and mow the lawn. In addition, robotic process automation is taking on white-collar work like data entry and some IT jobs.
For years, the manufacturing industry has held the robots largely at bay because of their relative clunkiness. Now that they're getting more lithe, it will be hard to hold them back.

This article is about the Australian gold mine. For the basketball arena also known as the Super Pit, see UNT Coliseum
The Fimiston Open Pit, colloquially known as the Super Pit, was Australia's largest open cut gold mine until 2016 when it was surpassed by the Newmont Boddington gold mine also in Western Australia. The Super Pit is located off the Goldfields Highway on the south-east edge of Kalgoorlie, Western Australia. The pit is oblong in plan view and is approximately 3.5 kilometres long, 1.5 kilometres wide and over 600 meters deep. At these dimensions, it is large enough to be seen from space.[1][2]
The Super Pit is owned by Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines Pty Ltd, a company owned 50:50 by Barrick Gold Corporation and Newmont Mining Corporation. The mine produces 850,000 ounces (28 tonnes) of gold per year, and employs around 550 employees directly on site.
Earlier stages [ edit ]
Originally consisting of a number of small underground mines, consolidation into a single open pit mine was attempted by Alan Bond, but he was unable to complete the takeover. The Super Pit was eventually created in 1989 by Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines Pty Ltd.[3]
Barrick Gold acquired its share of the mine in December 2001, when it took over Homestake Mining Company. Newmont became part-owner of the mine three months later, when it acquired Normandy Mining in February 2002.[4]
Geology [ edit ]
Most of the good gold mined in the Super Pit occurs within ore lodes formed by ancient shears in a rock unit called the Golden Mile Dolerite. The gold mining area of Kalgoorlie-Boulder-Fimiston has long been called the Golden Mile because of the geographical concentration of rich mines in that area, even though the lodes occur in an area over 2 km in width and 1 km in depth. It also mines nickel.
Production [ edit ]
Mining is via conventional drill and blast mining via face shovels and dump trucks. Around 15 million tonnes of rock is moved in any given year, consisting primarily of waste rock.
Gold within the Golden Mile lode system is unusual in that it is present as telluride minerals within pyrite. In order to recover the gold, the ore must be crushed, passed through a gravity circuit to recover the free gold present in some of the higher-grade lodes, and then subjected to flotation to produce an auriferous pyrite concentrate. This is then roasted at a small smelter outside Kalgoorlie-Boulder to liberate the gold from the tellurides, with doré bars poured.

Does your race determine your biological age? Controversial research claims black people age more quickly - and are up to THREE YEARS older in health terms
Researchers say black people appear to be biologically three years older older than whites
Biological age differences by race increase up until ages 60-69, and then decline
Higher biological ages among blacks fully account for their higher mortality risk
Black people age more quickly than white people, a controversial new study has claimed.
Researchers say that the researcher could shed new light on higher mortality rates in black people.
They say the biological age differences by race increase up until ages 60-69, and then decline.
Differences in biological age between blacks and whites appear to increase up until ages 60-65 and then decline, the team found.
HOW THEY DID IT The current study uses data on 7,644 black and white participants, ages 30 and above, from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The researchers calculated each participant's 'biological age' by looking at 10 biomarkers that have been linked to aging, including C-reactive protein, serum creatinine, glycosylated hemoglobin, systolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol.
The team compared then compared biological ages of blacks and whites as indicated from the biomarkers.
'Our results showed that, on average, blacks tend to be more than three years older biologically than whites,' Morgan Levine and Eileen Crimmins of the University of Southern California's Davis School of Gerontology. wrote in the journal Social Science and Medicine.
'Blacks experience morbidity and mortality earlier in the life course compared to whites,'
'This is consistent with findings from previous studies reporting that blacks tend to have levels of biological risk factors that are indicative of someone significantly older chronologically.'
'Such premature declines in health may be indicative of an acceleration of the aging process.'
The team found that the difference in age can be up to three years.
Differences in biological age between blacks and whites appear to increase up until ages 60-65 and then decline, presumably due to mortality selection.
The researchers calculated each participant's 'biological age' by looking at 10 biomarkers that have been linked to aging, including C-reactive protein, serum creatinine, glycosylated hemoglobin, systolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol.
The study uses data on 7,644 black and white participants, ages 30 and above, from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
They also noted their body-mass index, level of education, and whether they were present or former smokers.
'On average, the biological age for blacks was 53.16 years,' compared to 49.84 years for whites, the researchers report.
The team say the cause could be stress-related.
'Everyday stressors associated with being black may negatively impact physiological functioning and, under chronic exposure, accumulate over the lifespan and contribute to growing disparities in biological risk,' the authors wrote.
'Furthermore, if such environmental, behavioral, and mental factors contribute to an acceleration of the aging process, we would expect that persons who are aging the fastest should have the highest risk of mortality, and thus (have a) lower life expectancy.'
He compares ZZC to 'Pet Shop Boys, neo-classical and math-rock'
Biffy Clyro frontman Simon Neil has given more details on what to expect from his ‘weird and conceptual' solo project as ZZC – revealing that an ambitious and adventurous tour is also in the works.
Neil revealed his solo project ZZC back in 2014, when he contributed a track to the rescoring of the ‘Drive' soundtrack alongside Chvrches, The 1975 and more. Following on from his side-project Maraduke Duke, Neil will be going it alone with a new release next year. As anticipation continues to gather, the rock trio caught up with NME ahead of their intimate performance at London's Omeara for the nomination party for the VO5 NME Awards 2017 – when Neil opened about the adventurous nature of his new project.
“I'm gonna do some shows for it,” he told NME. “It's going to be a lot more conceptual. I've got a few really, really cool ideas for it. It's going to be almost like the Pet Shop Boys. I'm going to be singing like Neil Tennant and my wife Francesca's going to be like Chris Lowe at the back. She's going to look like the girl from ‘The Ring'. I'm giving this all away now, but I'm going to get projections of people playing instruments and as I move around the stage I'm gonna join in. it's quite a lot of choreography.. it sounds like it won't be ready for this year at all!”
Neil added: “The music gets kind of weird – it's not mainstream. I've got a seven and a half minute masterpiece I call ‘The Myth' – it's this neo-classical thing that goes into a little bit of math-rock. I think it's one of the best pieces of music I've ever written. It started as a score for an imaginary movie.”
The Greater Toronto Hockey League (GTHL) today announced the progressive elimination of body checking at the “A” level commencing with the Minor Bantam level in the 2015-16 season. The GTHL Board of Directors proposed the rule change, which was approved by GTHL Member Clubs and Associations with a majority vote of 326 to 195 during a General Meeting today at Humber College in Toronto.
The rule change is a result of feedback received from a league-wide survey on the topic of body checking conducted during the 2013-14 season. The majority of respondents in that survey supported the removal of body checking at the “A”level.
The GTHL Board of Directors initially proposed a rule change at the GTHL Annual General Meeting in June 2014 to move forward with the progressive elimination of body checking at the “A”level for the 2015-16 season; that motion was then amended at the meeting to commence in the 2014-15 season, but the amended motion was subsequently defeated by a slim margin.
The GTHL Board of Directors called today's General Meeting to ensure potential changes to the body checking rules were considered and resolved before tryouts begin in April.

HOUSTON – The World Series was roiled by a race-related incident in Friday night's Game 3 when Houston Astros first baseman Yuli Gurriel made a racist gesture in the wake of hitting a home run off Los Angeles Dodgers starter Yu Darvish.
TV cameras caught Gurriel, a Cuban, making a slant-eyed gesture and laughing after his home run off Darvish kick-started a four-run second inning.
Gurriel apologized afterward, saying he did not mean to offend Darvish, a native of Japan.
MORE FROM GAME 3
“Yesterday I was commenting that I'd never had any success against Darvish, and the gesture was saying that I wish he would look at me like one of them and maybe he'd throw me an easy pitch so I can do something,'' said Gurriel, who was 1-for-7 in his career against Darvish before the home run. “At no point did I mean that in an offensive way. On the contrary, I've always had a lot of respect for them.''
Gurriel, who had a successful stint in the Japanese league in 2014 before defecting from Cuba and signing with the Astros in July 2016, also acknowledged using the word “chinito'' – little Chinese guy – in the dugout in reference to Darvish.
“In Cuba and in other places, we call all Asian people Chinese,'' Gurriel said. “But I played in Japan and I know they find that offensive, so I apologize for that. I know they don't like it.''
Darvish, the Japanese right-hander in his sixth major league season, said after the game that he'd seen a replay of the sequence and said he was “disappointed” in Gurriel's gesture.
"Acting like that…is disrespectful to people around the world," Darvish said through his interpreter after the Astros' 5-3 victory in Game 3. "I try not to care much about it, but he played in Japan and I have a lot of respect for him, so I try not to think about it too much against him."
Darvish seemed subdued, but forgiving of Gurriel's gesture.
"Nobody's perfect. And everybody's different," he says. " And we're going to have to learn from it. We are all human beings. That's what I'm saying. We'll learn from it and we have to go forward."
Dodgers teammate Kike Hernandez said he talked to Darvish about the incident and said Darvish was "extremely disappointed, as expected." Earlier this season, Toronto Blue Jays outfielder Kevin Pillar was suspended three games for directing a homophobic slur toward an opponent. It's not likely such a punishment would be adjudicated between Major League Baseball and the union during the World Series, but MLB has shown a greater intolerance for hateful speech.
"I'll let the league handle that one," said Hernandez, a native of Puerto Rico. "All I can say it's disappointing to me. It's just unfortunate that he did that right after that and not thinking that the cameras were on him.
"I'm sure (Darvish) is (stung). If it was meant toward Puerto Ricans, I'd be really disappointed. If he is really mad inside and didn't say much, I'm really proud of him for handling it the right way and remaining professional."
MLB commissioner Rob Manfred is expected to meet with Gurriel before Saturday's game.

The recent rise in public awareness about so-called fake news is, by any measure, a good thing.
It has crystallized national attention on some of the new and increasingly shrewd forms that misinformation now takes. It has sparked a debate about whom — apart from those who create and profit from it — is responsible for the dissemination of these lies. It has prompted the sharing of tips, tools and strategies to help the public avoid being fooled by falsehoods, including a new warning system by Facebook.
And it delivered an unmistakable and near-tragic reminder of the very real power of information — accurate or otherwise — when a misguided vigilante gunman stormed a Washington, D.C., restaurant on Dec. 4, having read online that it was home to a child sex-slave ring in which Hillary Clinton was involved. (“The intel on this wasn't 100%,” the man later said.)
But awareness of this phenomenon has also prompted a sharp and contemptuous backlash from those who insist on applying the “fake news” label to anything they wish to dismiss — including (or maybe especially) the mainstream news media itself. (For examples of this, just read the comments on articles or social posts that reference fake news, like this one, this one or this one.)
It is a backlash that ironically, though perhaps not surprisingly, stems from the very cynicism that helps fake news and other kinds of misinformation to take hold in the first place. It is, in short, a backlash against the very concept of credibility, a hallmark of the post-truth era in which personal beliefs and emotion are the new benchmarks for assessing the quality of information, and the number of facts held in common are rapidly diminishing as a result.
Left unchecked, this widespread cynicism about the value, and even the practice, of quality journalism may well render meaningful public discourse all but impossible — and jeopardize American democracy itself.
This is the “fake news” conversation we need to be having now.
We need to grapple with the context in which entirely fabricated pieces of information about the 2016 presidential campaign not only gained the trust of so many citizens, but also outperformed (based on an analysis of Facebook “likes,” comments and shares) real reporting by standards-based news organizations. We need to come to terms with the way the exposure of these outright falsehoods has quickly morphed into a cross-partisan denunciation of the very news organizations who alerted the public to their prevalence and profitability.
A starting place for this process is public attitudes toward institutional news media. In a September Gallup poll, only 32% of Americans expressed “a great deal” or “a fair amount” of confidence in the mass media “to report the news fully, accurately and fairly.” This is the lowest number since 1972, when the organization began asking this question, and an 8 percentage-point drop from the previous year. A Pew Research Center survey conducted in early 2016 found that a stunning 8% of Americans think that the news media “do nothing positive.”
It might be tempting to stop there and conclude that this lack of trust is wholly deserved — that these numbers are a direct reflection of the quality of journalism today. But doing so overlooks the strong likelihood that this trend is largely fueled by a disconnect between what quality journalism is and how it is perceived by a considerable portion of the public. This divide is complex, but we can begin to close it through news literacy efforts that help consumers understand how to recognize quality journalism when they see it, and how to constructively respond when they don't.
For example, at the News Literacy Project, we teach students to run any piece of information, regardless of its origins, through what we call a “Check” process. Does the piece cite multiple credible sources? Have assertions been verified and backed up by relevant documentation, such as studies, records, statistics and other fact-based evidence? Does the creator make an effort to minimize bias and avoid false balance? Is the piece fair in that it provides adequate context and the opportunity for the subjects discussed responding to any criticism? While we acknowledge that these standards of quality journalism are often imperfect in practice, we encourage students to develop these habits of mind and to hold the news media accountable to these standards and to be skeptical about information that doesn't at least attempt to meet them.
But news consumers also need to acknowledge the role their own biases play in evaluating the news they consume.
As readers and viewers, we often see unmistakable bias in the appearance of a report that damages a cause or a candidate we care about (but rarely the other way around). We want the issues most dear to us to dominate the news cycle, to be covered the way they are by openly partisan alternative outlets. We tend to turn to hyperbole to describe our frustrations, alleging agendas and preconceived narratives and coverage blackouts by “the media,” instead of offering more specific and reasonable assessments of the reporting that we perceive as imperfect. And we often underestimate the extremely challenging nature of journalism itself — a discipline that, as New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen has pointed out, is “uniquely vulnerable to criticism” because it is produced quickly under necessarily impractical circumstances, then widely shared and “endlessly argued over.”

It's worth adding here that a portion of the mistrust of news media is deserved, especially when it comes to political coverage. We're frustrated with on-the-one-hand/on-the-other-hand reporting and the artificial balance it tends to produce. We are rightly wary of horse-race coverage that focuses more on public perceptions, poll numbers and the process of the campaign than on candidates' policy proposals and other substantive issues. And while newsrooms have made strides in becoming more representative of the communities they cover, they are still not nearly as diverse as they need to be, especially at the highest levels.
But we shouldn't pretend that most of the problems in journalism are easy to prevent or solve. And we shouldn't allow our frustrations with some news coverage to eclipse our recognition of the role that quality journalism still plays in our democracy. We shouldn't mistake the “endless” arguments and discussion that journalism ignites as a signal of widespread incompetence among reporters and editors. And we certainly shouldn't tolerate anyone recklessly equating the work of propagandists and “fake news” opportunists with that of journalists.
Doing this — which is all too common across social media and anywhere else people are discussing “fake news” at the moment — only serves to deepen the cynical distrust that is threatening the existence not just of the American press, but of the very concept of truth in our society.
If that is lost, we may find out just how fake “news” can get.

New Delhi: Drawing attention towards a fading Orwellian legacy in Bihar, a new documentary film makes an impassioned plea to preserve the celebrated British author's birthplace in Motihari. George Orwell was born as Eric Arthur Blair in 1903 in the small lake town of Motihari in Bihar's then undivided Champaran district, the same place from where Mahatma Gandhi kicked off his first satyagraha for freedom struggle in 1917.
The 'Animal Farm' fame author died in London on January 21,1950 and the film titled "Orwell, But Why?" was screened at a college in Motihari yesterday as a tribute on his 64th death anniversary. Director Bishwajeet Mookherjee said the "film is not his biography but an attempt to save his fading link to this small town of Bihar".
"People asked me why an Englishman's legacy be preserved in a place associated with Gandhi's freedom struggle no less. And, this film attempts to address exactly that question. The purpose is to dispel the ignorance about Orwell from local people's minds and to educate them as to why we need to preserve his memory," Bishwajeet told PTI over phone.
The Delhi-based young filmmaker, who went through Orwell's biography and his other novels for the research work, said, "Either people here don't know who he (Orwell) was or those who know his name, don't know what his ideologies were." "In his first novel 'Burmese Days', which he wrote based on his Burma years, spent working for the Indian Imperial Police there, one finds reflections of his anti-imperialist position... He was also fond of Indian food. Orwell loved India, but India has not loved him back, especially people of his birthplace," he said.
Commissioned by the Rotary Lake Town in Motihari, the 23-minute film also captures the struggle of 'Orwell lovers' to hold on to a "dilapidated heritage" that had almost slipped out of hand. The '1984' author's birthplace in Bihar was reportedly first identified by Scottish journalist Ian Jack, who came to Motihari in search of his home in 1983, a journey that proved more than symbolic.
Jack wrote of his experiences of "finding" Orwell's house in his book 'Mofussil Junction' under the chapter 'George Orwell in Bihar'.

Often a team plagued by losing seasons, front-office upheaval and the departure of the club's cornerstone player would be pretty low on the list of desirable landing spots for free agents.
That hasn't been the case, however, with the Buffalo Sabres.
Despite the team's abysmal 21-51-10 record and last-place finish this past season, the Sabres were able to attract high-caliber talent on the open market as the club continues to revamp its personnel in hopes of turning things around.

The Sabres, with first-year general manager Tim Murray at the helm, landed former Montreal Canadiens captain (and Rochester, New York native) Brian Gionta, as well as skilled winger Matt Moulson (who returned to Buffalo after being flipped to Minnesota at the trade deadline).
Even the acquisition of Josh Gorges via trade with the Habs took a pitch -- Gorges called former Habs teammate Gionta to consult whether to waive his no-trade clause this summer.
Not bad for a team that floundered at the bottom of the league standings for virtually the entire year before finishing 30th.
And the influx of new talent, new management and new coaching staff (Ted Nolan was hired in November before receiving an extension this summer, while assistants Arturs Irbe, Bryan Trottier, Danny Flynn and Tom Coolen recently joined the staff) brings a culture change.
“The thing is, it started over a year ago,” said former Sabres goaltender Martin Biron, who still resides in the area with his family. “They traded three captains -- Jason Pominville, Thomas Vanek, Steve Ott, with Ryan Miller also traded -- so that's four guys gone in a 12-month span. They retooled, rebuilt, brought in some picks, some young players and prospects to try and build from the ground up.”
According to Biron, who retired last season while playing for the New York Rangers, that push toward progress likely started at the behest of team owner Terry Pegula.
“From being in this area, and living here, that change of direction probably came from the top, from Terry and Kim [Pegula] on down. They did a lot of studying and crunching numbers on success and where it comes from. It comes from the draft and developing players,” Biron told ESPN.com in a telephone conversation.
That change of direction likely winnowed the list of GM candidates that ultimately led then-president of hockey operations Pat LaFontaine to select Murray as the guy to lead the team (LaFontaine curiously resigned a few months later, less than four months after taking the job). Murray had experience in drafting and developing players from serving as the GM of the AHL's Binghamton Senators and as the assistant GM of the Ottawa Senators.
“When they switched things up [following the dismissal of former GM Darcy Regier], that was a hot topic on the table. How will you be able to accomplish this?” Biron said of the development aspect. “I think the biggest part of his hiring knew [Murray] was going to be on board with that.”
Though they have seen some of the team's biggest names and most beloved players leave, the Sabres boast some well-respected veterans as well as some burgeoning young leaders such as Drew Stafford. Add in some prospects who are challenging for a spot and a bevvy of draft picks in the future and the Sabres are all of the sudden an interesting team to watch.
One thing that could prove to be an Achilles' heel, however, is their goaltending. After trading Miller to the St. Louis Blues last season, the Sabres are left with Jhonas Enroth and Michal Neuvirth, neither of whom are considered bonafide starters.
“Obviously, that is a bit of a question mark moving forward,” Biron said. "For many years people in Buffalo have been lucky to have top goaltenders, [Dominik] Hasek, [Ryan] Miller, now they're going into a bit of an unknown with Enroth or Neuvirth."
But Biron insists that the Sabres are well-stocked between the pipes with an abundance of quality goaltending prospects.
Nathan Lieuwen gained some NHL experience with seven games last season. They also have Calvin Petersen, Russian netminder Andrey Makarov and a pair of Swedes: Jonas Johansson and Linus Ullmark, the latter of whom caught Biron's eye at a recent development camp.
Biron probably will be keeping tabs on those prospects given his new position as director of goaltending at the HARBORCENTER Academy of Hockey, which will open in October.
Between that and regular television work as an analyst for TSN, NHL Network and French-language RDS, Biron won't be sitting back and taking it easy during retirement.
Already this summer he's barely had a spare moment bouncing between his son's baseball and football schedule and his daughters' horse shows.
“It's better that way,” Biron said. “I can't sit around.”
Ratings For ‘Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D.' & ‘The Flash' Hit Series Low
It's not all good news when it comes to TV's superheroes. While Supergirl on The CW soared to new heights in the ratings, The Flash has hit a series low and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. continued its rating decline.
The Flash only brought in 2.6 million viewers and hit a rating of 1.o, which is a new low for the series. The Flash has introduced a new storyline with “Flashpoint” but fans don't seem to be responding to this season like they did early on. Following The Flash, No Tomorrow did see an increase in viewers, bringing in 850,000 viewers and a 0.3 rating.
ABC's S.H.I.E.L.D. also didn't hit rating goals this week. S.H.I.E.L.D. only drew 2.56 million viewers and earned a 0.8 rating. This is a series low for the show and put them in third place during the 10 p.m. time slot. S.H.I.E.L.D. has been gaining busy on the Internet and amongst fans, especially with the introduction of Robbie Reyes (Ghost Rider).
The Flash and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. return next week with new episodes.

The discovery of an Earth-like planet outside our solar system has rejuvenated the conversation about life elsewhere in the universe. Dubbed Gliese 581g, the planet is thought to be Earth-like because it is orbiting about its sun in the so-called "Goldilocks Zone," where the temperature would permit liquid water on its surface. Most planets are either too cold or too hot to have liquid water on their surfaces. Gliese is 20 light years from Earth and located in the constellation Libra.
Finding intelligent life elsewhere in the universe would be the most provocative discovery of all time. Carl Sagan was a tireless enthusiast for searching, believing that it would transform our view of ourselves. More recently, SETI astronomer Jill Tarter echoed Sagan's wistful comment about how such efforts, even if they turn up a null result, might enable us to "calibrate our place in the universe."
Discovering life on other planets, especially intelligent life even remotely like us, would be marvelously stimulating, a cosmic version of Robinson Crusoe discovering Friday's footprint and realizing that he was not marooned in isolation from fellow humans. All of a sudden, the universe in its vast emptiness would not seem quite so purposeless, as we could envision countless other life forms sprinkled throughout the cosmos. I can imagine looking up at the night sky with a license to wonder how many of those stars were the suns of alien civilizations.
Communicating with aliens would ratchet up the interest, especially if we were able to travel and visit. No doubt many would eagerly reach out in peace; others would call for a global defense. Glenn Beck would call for a pre-emptive strike, unless he thought he could sell some books there.
The most peculiar of all reactions to aliens -- and one we don't have to wonder about -- would have to be that of Ken Ham, the biblical literalist who runs the Creation Museum and heads up Answers in Genesis. Ham is a tireless promoter of the belief that the ancient writers of Genesis made scientifically accurate statements about the universe. Never mind that those writers lived in cultures that thought the Earth was flat and the heavens were a solid dome overhead. Somehow, when Genesis was penned -- or, technically, transcribed after centuries of oral tradition -- those writers spoke with scientific accuracy about a universe of planets, stars and galaxies that their readers knew nothing about.
In the Young Earth Creationist worldview promoted by Answers in Genesis and like-minded organizations, the sin of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden affected more than just the Earth. "The Bible makes it clear that Adam's sin affected the whole universe," says Ham. "This means that any aliens would also be affected by Adam's sin."
In the Creationist worldview on display in the Creation Museum, sin inaugurated sickness, disease, and the decay associated with the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Prior to Adam's sin, the laws of physics were different, since there could be no decay. So, according to the Answers in Genesis website, "another compensating restorative process may have prevented any net decay of the universe." This restorative process ended with Adam's sin, and now the Second Law of Thermodynamics was unbalanced, and the entire universe began to run down.
The creative interpretative scheme used by the Young Earth Creationists leads them to find biblical support for claims about laws that science discovered centuries later. Other Young Earth Creationists suggest that the Second Law of Thermodynamics actually appeared for the first time as the scientific consequence of sin.
In this view, the sin of the first human affected everything, even stars trillions of miles away. To see how odd this claim is, imagine that there were life forms on Gliese at the time of Adam's sin. What would this sudden cosmic change look like to the Gliesans, as the entire universe, including their planet, was suddenly cursed? In the Creationist worldview, Gliese would have been a paradise, like the Earth before Adam sinned. Presumably the citizens would have been very happy, immortal (since there was no death before Adam sinned), and getting along fine with docile herbivores, and the laws of physics would not be causing everything to decay -- no need for Gliesan dryers to have lint filters. All of a sudden, because of an act on a planet trillions of miles away, Gliese would have been stricken with inexplicable suffering, death, and different laws of physics.
This worldview undergirds the displays in the Creation Museum. Highly creative interpretations of cosmic events are forced into the Bible, doing great violence to the text. Bronze Age scribes are transformed into uncomprehending secretaries, writing things about an undiscovered universe that nobody could have possibly understood for centuries.
And, adding insult to injury, even though human sin on a distant Earth wrecked their planet, the poor Gliesans "can't have salvation," says Ham. "Only descendants of Adam can be saved." To even "suggest that aliens could respond to the gospel is just totally wrong," he says.
Wladimir Balentien aiming to become Japan's home run king
TOKYO (TR) – Succession to Japan's home run crown is just a few swings away.
In the bottom of the ninth on Wednesday at Meiji Jingu Stadium, former major leaguer Wladimir Balentien, the right-handed slugger for the Central League's Yakult Swallows, uncoiled his burly frame to pound a hanging curve ball into the seats in left field.
The solo shot was his 51st round-tripper of the year, inching him closer to 55, the single-season record first set by Sadaharu Oh five decades ago and later equaled by Karl “Tuffy” Rhodes and Alex Cabrera.
With 31 games left on the schedule, the native of Curaçao knows that getting to 55 could become challenging as Nippon Professional Baseball is not known for playing fair when foreigners approach the record considered to be unrivaled.
“As (the record) nears, pitchers will be reluctant to throw strikes,” said Balentien in a statement issued on the Swallows' Web site after the game, an 11-7 loss to the Chunichi Dragons. “I sense that, but I'm concentrating on hitting strikes.”
Oh, the former first baseman and manager who is one of the most highly regarded sports figures in Japan, set the record in 1964 when he was with the Yomiuri Giants. Since then there has been a blatant effort on a number of occasions — notably in games involving Oh himself — to ensure that it remains intact.
The Hanshin Tigers' Randy Bass entered the last game of the 1985 season with 54 home runs. He was walked four times by the Yomiuri Giants, who were managed by Oh.
In 2001, Tuffy Rhodes, while playing for the Kintetsu Buffaloes, came into the final five games of the year with 55 home runs. The outfielder faced challenges similar to Bass in games against the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks, a team also skippered by Oh.
“They didn't throw me any strikes,” said Rhodes by email, referring to the games against Fukuoka. “I had to swing at two pitches (out of the strike zone) if I wanted to hit.”
The following year, Alex Cabrera, then of the Seibu Lions, as well complained about a lack of pitches over the plate after his pursuit of the record also stalled at 55.
Speculation has started in Japan's tabloid media about whether Balentien will suffer a similar fate. The online Business Journal went as far as to suggest that the negative publicity from a repeat of unsportsmanlike behavior would endanger Tokyo's bid to host the 2020 Olympic Games. (The International Olympic Committee is scheduled to announce the winning city on September 7.)
As to the fans, a survey of 30 spectators entering Meiji Jingu Stadium (Yakult's home field) on Tuesday night found that 27 supported Balentien's bid to surpass Oh.
However, the slugger is hitting long balls at such a prodigious clip the matter is shaping up to be a moot point. The home run on Wednesday was his 17th in August, a new record for a single month.
Balentien, whose three-year MLB career included stints with the Seattle Mariners and Cincinnati Reds, was out of the Yakult lineup for the first 12 games this year due to a leg injury he suffered while playing for the Netherlands in the World Baseball Classic. His output over the next 100 games has put him on pace to hit 66 home runs — a figure updated regularly by the “Coco Meter,” which invokes the outfielder's nickname, on the team's Web site.
But no matter how many balls Coco sends into the seats, his performance may come under a degree of scrutiny.
In June, commissioner Ryozo Kato admitted that a more lively ball was covertly put into play at the start of the year in an effort to induce more home runs, which had dropped off after a “uniform” ball was introduced after the 2010 season to better match that used in international play.
It worked. With a month remaining in the season, teams have thus far collectively slugged more than 1,050 home runs, a figure that already exceeds the total from last year (881) and the year before (939).
But those concerned that the ball is unfairly “juiced” will need to consider that this year's pace still lags that of the season before the change, when batters hit a total of 1,605 home runs.
Balentien's spectacular year has not come from nowhere. His two previous seasons with the Swallows coincided with the “dead ball” era. Yet the outfielder still managed to slug 31 home runs during both of those campaigns.
For Yakult, the exploits of Balentien, who also leads the Central League with a .339 batting average, are the highlights of what has mostly been a dismal season. The team is buried in last place, seven games back in the hunt for the league's final playoff spot.
“I know the team is counting on me,” he said. “Even though we have been losing I've been fighting, and will continue until the end.”
With the chase winding down, Rhodes said that he does not have any advice to offer Balentien, saying the slugger is “doing just fine.”
Balentien believes in approaching it one at-bat at a time. “I just want to keep hitting well for a longer period,” he said.
At least 200 professionals from the döner supply business were expected to fill the Ernst-Reuter Haus in the centre of the German capital on Saturday for the convention to make contacts, swap ideas and eye up the latest in meat-on-a-pole technology.
Until the 1970s döner meat had always been eaten on a plate – the story is that a guest worker in Germany was the first to wrap it in bread and add salad, sauce and loads of spices, unknowingly creating a new industry.
Now it is estimated that around 60,000 people work in the 15,500 döner shops around the country, while the idea has taken off in many other countries not only in Europe but also recently as far away as Vietnam.
The supply business is an interesting one in Germany, with only around 100 companies supplying the 122,000 tons of döner meat consumed here each year.
And while the döner shops are often teetering on the edge of financial survival, a good living can be made producing the giant spits of flash-frozen spiced lamb meat, according to Yunus Ulusoy, from the Centre for Turkey Studies in Essen.
“The spit producers have been very successful in the market for many years. Without them there would be no more döners,” he said.
He said stacking the slices of meat on and around the spit is considered a highly complicated and technical business, with most of those who serve the kebabs not being able or willing to make their own.
“Döner shops are often run in order to secure the financial existence of the family because there is no alternative, and not because one wants to work in the gastronomy business,” said Ulusoy.
The owners thus buy in the meat spits, pre-cut salads, pre-mixed sauces and ready-baked bread from the supply industry, he said.
These suppliers create and maintain customer networks through personal contacts and trust – which is often rooted in a common Turkish heritage, added Ulusoy.
Their knowledge of the Turkish language, culture and their understanding of the Islamic rules for preparing meat means Turkish-rooted suppliers are generally trusted more than Germans, said Tarkan Tasyumruk, chairman of the Turkish Döner Producers Association in Europe, ATDID.
Suppliers are often recommended by friends and contacts, he added, but said that the aim of the DÖGA meeting should be to increase competition between them in order to secure the long-term survival of the industry in Germany.
One suggestion to contribute to this is on show at the conference – the robotic döner slicer.
Using a digital camera and computer-steered knife, the robotic slicer can tackle any shape of döner spit, spotting uneven or uncooked bits of meat and adjusting its movement accordingly.
Its creators say it requires less space than a person, needs no training and eliminates not only accidents but also unpleasant human factors such as sneezing.
MADISON, Wis. - A Madison man who crashed into a coffee shop on Williamson Street early Sunday morning had been drinking and smoking synthetic marijuana, police say.
Officers were called to Mother Fools at 2:46 a.m. on a report of a crash.
Police said Todd A. Tantillo, 54, drove his van through flashing red lights at Ingersoll Street and Williamson Street and struck an SUV containing six people broadside, pushing it completely into the coffee house, according to the release. The van was traveling south on Ingersoll Street, and the SUV was traveling east on Williamson Street.
The 30-year-old driver of the SUV and his five passengers were taken to a hospital. Three were kept overnight, and one remains hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries. A passenger in Tantillo's van was not injured.
Tantillo was arrested on suspicion of third-offense operating while intoxicated, injury by intoxicated use of a vehicle, failure to stop for a flashing red signal, operating while revoked, failure to install an ignition interlock device, felony bail jumping and on two warrants.
This Insane Saved By the Bell-Themed Bar Is Your Childhood Fantasies IRL
Listen up, Preppy! It seems that on-screen Gilmore Girls and Full House revivals just aren't enough to scratch our nostalgia itch anymore, and we're starting to see IRL versions of our favourite TV shows from childhood. A Saved By The Bell-themed bar and diner is set to open in Chicago's Wicker Park neighbourhood this summer, and by the sounds of its decor and menu, you won't even know you're not at Bayside High!
The bar, Saved By The Max (named after the Bayside crew's favourite hangout The Max), will feature custom detailed decor and a full kitchen so you can order some AC Sliders, a Preppy BLT, some Macaroni & Screech, the Belding Fries, a Lisa Turtle Milkshake and more. With custom themed cocktails and daily costume contests, this place, whose location has not yet been announced, will be just as rammed as The Max after school.
So far, over 3,000 people are listed as going on the Facebook event. It's only there for the month of June, so unless Zach Morris shows up and does a time out to freeze the moment, you'd better make your travel plans now!
What other TV or movie-themed pop-ups would you like to see? Let us know on Twitter at @britandco!

My Quest for the Perfect Mac Keyboard
Background
I have a new iMac, and I'm looking for the perfect keyboard for it. The beautifully designed aluminum Bluetooth keyboard that comes with it is great in many ways, but I'm accustomed to the feel of a proper mechanical keyboard, and this mushy, low-travel robber-dome membrane keyboard just won't cut it.
So, the perfect keyboard needs to have several qualities. It needs to have the “multimedia” keys necessary to control the screen brightness and volume, since there's no other way to adjust these on an iMac, as well as the eject key (necessary for activating the screen lock, in addition to ejecting the optical media), and I'd like it to have the playback control keys, as well.
Also, to match the Mac aesthetic, including the Mighty Mouse, it should probably be white. It should also be compact, but of course retain full-sized keys.
I don't think this keyboard currently exists, so it looks like I'll have to build it.
A New Contender
I've done some research and soul-searching to come up with my ideal Mac keyboard, which ends up looking something like this:
My ideal compact Mac keyboard, option 1 My ideal compact Mac keyboard, option 1
Or this even more compact version:
My ideal compact Mac keyboard, option 2 My ideal compact Mac keyboard, option 2
A new keyboard has come out within the past few months called the Noppoo Choc Mini. It has a layout that's somewhat similar to my proposed arrangement, although several of the keys are in different places, and some keys are missing (like eject). It also has some unnecessary keys. (Pause? Scroll Lock? Do even Windows users use those?)
Noppoo Choc Mini in white Noppoo Choc Mini in white
The Choc Mini has a good build quality. It uses Cherry MX mechanical keyswitches, which I know I like. (For those familiar with these keyswitches, the Choc Mini is available with MX brown, blue, black, and red, so you get to choose the tactile feel and click.) The keyswitches are plate-mounted, which gives it a very solid feel. The keycaps are made of a very nice feeling, thick POM plastic. The overall result is a high quality keyboard.
It's not sold outside of China, so buying one can be a little tricky. Fortunately, qtan will have them shipped to you directly from China quickly and inexpensively. I got mine in a week.
And lastly, because of some tricks pulled by the controller to try to make it “n-key rollover” over USB, it behaves really bizarrely when connected to Macs. It's really just useless with Macs. (And it's not quite right on some other equipment I've tried it on, either.) Ironic starting point in my quest for my ideal Mac keyboard.
However, I figure I can reprogram it to be close to the keyboard I want. It may not be perfect, but it ought to be pretty good. To start this project, I'll need to take a look inside the Choc Mini.
US Box Office Revenue Finally Drops; But Not Because Of Infringement
from the make-better-movies dept
1. Obviously, the absence of a must-see mass-market movie. When moviegoers hear about "Avatar" or "The Dark Knight," they blast off from home base and land in a theater seat as quickly as they can
2. Ticket prices are too high. People have always made that complaint, but historically the movies have been cheap compared to concerts, major league sports and restaurants. Not so much any longer. No matter what your opinion is about 3D, the charm of paying a hefty surcharge has worn off for the hypothetical family of four.
3. The theater experiences. Moviegoers above 30 are weary of noisy fanboys and girls. The annoyance of talkers has been joined by the plague of cell-phone users, whose bright screens are a distraction. Worse, some texting addicts get mad when told they can't use their cell phones. A theater is reportedly opening which will allow and even bless cell phone usage, although that may be an apocryphal story.
4. Refreshment prices. It's an open secret that the actual cost of soft drinks and popcorn is very low. To justify their inflated prices, theaters serve portions that are grotesquely oversized, and no longer offer what used to be a "small popcorn." Today's bucket of popcorn would feed a thoroughbred.
5. Competition from other forms of delivery. Movies streaming over the internet are no longer a sci-fi fantasy. TV screens are growing larger and cheaper. Consumers are finding devices that easily play internet movies through TV sets. Netflix alone accounts for 30% of all internet traffic in the evening. That represents millions of moviegoers. They're simply not in a theater. This could be seen as an argument about why newspapers and their readers need movie critics more than ever; the number of choices can be baffling.
6. Lack of choice. Box-office tracking shows that the bright spot in 2011 was the performance of indie, foreign or documentary films. On many weekends, one or more of those titles captures first-place in per-screen average receipts. Yet most moviegoers outside large urban centers can't find those titles in their local gigantiplex. Instead, all the shopping center compounds seem to be showing the same few over-hyped disappointments. Those films open with big ad campaigns, play a couple of weeks, and disappear.
Every year for the past few years, we've been noting that, even as the MPAA whine and cries about "piracy," it's been doing record business at the box office . It's been up, up, up. Until this year. It appears that there's been a rather slight downturn in box office take , though it still exceeded $10 billion. A lot of people are focused on fewerbeing sold, but the number of tickets is a pretty meaningless measure. What matters is revenue, and that's still strong, if slightly off from its previous highs. But, of course, no businesssets a record.And what's good here is that it seems most folks involved in the movie business seem to recognize that online infringement has nothing to do with the dropoff in box office revenue this year. Reports are chalking it up to "a combination of a weak economy and expanding home entertainment options." The most thoughtful explanation I've seen comes from Roger Ebert, who puts forth a series of compelling reasons why box office revenue is down , starting with the lack of good quality movies that are "must sees."The key thing about the reasons he gives? Almost every one is something thatif it only was smart enough to have a long term strategy.Definitely a huge and important point. If you don't make quality films that people want to see, the box office is going to suffer. It seems that the industry has become so risk averse these days, that it keeps churning out rather formulaic pieces -- sequels and reboots, mainly. Sometimes you can do those kinds of movies in amazing ways ("The Dark Knight" is certainly one example), but too frequently these movies seem to rely on their "built in" audience, rather than working to find an audience. So the ticket sales decline.This was bound to happen and there are two reasons for it. The first is that the industry was experimenting with different price points, and when that happens, sooner or later you're going to find the ceiling. That finally happened. I don't think it's wrong that there were experiments with price points, but the industry needs to be careful to avoid continually pushing those boundaries.The 3D issue is a bigger one. As I've noted in the past, it'sthat the industry looked toto give people more of a reason to buy. Doing things like 3D films and IMAX films give people good reasons to go to the theaters, rather than watching at home... but in typical Hollywood fashion, they understood the superficial aspect ("ooh, with 3D we can charge more") and ignored the real underlying reasons why it worked ("we have to addvalue"). So they just rushed out a bunch of crappy 3D movies where the 3D added no value, and people started rejecting it. As they should. If the industry had focused on real value, rather than just assuming "3D = more money" perhaps this wouldn't be an issue.Preaching to the converted here. Some of us have been arguing this point for a decade and are still amazed that the theater owners and the Hollywood studios just don't seem to get it. People go out to the movies because it's a-- with part of the key point being the experience. You can cook your own dinner at home, but people like to eat out at restaurants. What's amazing is just howthe experience has become, and how little effort most in the industry (with a few notable exceptions!) have made in trying to improve the overall experience. If the theaters and Hollywood actually focused on improving the overall experience, they'd be havingbetter performance.This goes back to number 3, really. The food is a part of the experience. Making it ridiculously overpriced doesn't contribute to the overall experience at all. You can price it reasonably, make a good profit and use that to attract more people to the theater. Or you can do what the theaters do and seek to gouge.I'd argue it goes beyond just other forms of, to competition from other forms of. The wider internet has grown quite a bit over the past few years, and video games, in particular, have become a much, much, much bigger industry. Plenty of people who might have wanted to go out to see a movie in the past, might prefer to just stay home and play video games online instead.This is also a big one that gets very little attention, unfortunately. It's typical Hollywood thinking though. They're driven solely by the hits, and haveunderstood the value of solid movies that can make a profit without being a blockbuster. We're not even talking about the full long tail here, but anything beyond the "short head." If Hollywood stopped thinking in terms of finding only the "big hits," and actually looked at how to make profitable movies, they'd do things pretty differently. Unfortunately, that's just not how they think.All in all, I believe the movie industry will eventually figure this out, though it may take some outsiders and fresh thinking, rather than today's studio bosses. Unfortunately, in the short term, we're likely to hear the MPAA and others pretend that the decline has something to do with "piracy," when there's little (if any) evidence to support that.

Last week, to mark the 51st anniversary of Fidel Castro's revolution, a couple of thousand Cubans assembled on a plaza facing the American diplomatic mission in Havana. They danced to amplified salsa music and paid little heed when a man on stage tried to excite them with shouts of "Viva Fidel! Viva Raúl! Viva la Revolución!"
It was a far cry from the days when vast crowds gathered to hear Castro deliver extended rants against imperialism and promise his people a glorious future. Today Castro is frail and out of sight. His elderly brother, Raúl, did not turn out for this year's anniversary either. Their sclerotic immobility aptly reflects the collapse of hope that defines Cuba today.
Vestiges of revolutionary enthusiasm survived into the 1980s, when I last visited Cuba. Millions had already lost faith in the promise of Caribbean communism, but millions still clung to it. Today believers are hard to find. People I met told me that they had a burst of hope two years ago, when Castro retired from active politics and turned the regime over to his brother. But life remains much as before, and the island has slipped into paralysing lassitude. "Finding enough food for our families and a roof over our heads is the extent of our dreams these days," one man sighed.
Who would have imagined that Cuba would become an importer of food – even importing sugar, of all things, from the United States, of all places? Or that an entire generation of Cubans – those born in the early 1990s, when the end of Soviet subsidies brought a plague of hunger to the island – would be born malnourished and grow up stunted? Or that the birth rate would plummet, leaving the prospect of an aging population without working people to support it? Or that most groceries would be for sale only in hard currency, which is unavailable to most Cubans? Or that fishing would be all but forbidden because the regime fears that anyone with a boat will make straight for Florida? Or that the country Americans once treated as a giant bordello, a hotbed of degradation that Castro set out to wipe away, would once again become the hemisphere's leading destination for sex tourists?
Cuba's tragedy is different from the one that envelops nearby countries such as Haiti or Honduras. This country has both the human and natural resources to become happy and prosperous. What stands in its way is the regime's stubborn insistence that private enterprise is by nature evil.
"We have three successes: education, health care and social equality," one Cuban told me. "And we have three big problems: breakfast, lunch and dinner." Another put it more directly. "In 51 years of revolution, we have not learned that agriculture is what keeps a country alive."
Most Cubans are desperate for work, and vast amounts of land lie fallow. If allowed to plant food and sell it freely, people here could once again feed themselves. The regime, however, realises that this would be a profound capitulation to history. Better to let a nation waste away than to compromise the principle that the state must control everything.
What does the future hold for this benighted island? With President Obama facing a host of more important challenges, a quick change in the foolish American policy of isolating Cuba is unlikely. Nor does anyone here expect a transition to democracy after the Castro brothers die. There is little prospect that a Havel or Mandela or Walesa could emerge here.
The military will likely remain Cuba's dominant institution. It will allow a managed opening, and will become the business partner of foreign investors – including Cuban-Americans – in a variety of joint ventures. Tourism will flourish. There will be space for private enterprise. A decade from now Cuba will be a better place than it is now. It will remain, however, far from fulfilling its enormous potential. Few outsiders will care, because Cuba, once a powerful force whose revolution inspired the world, has become poor and insignificant.
Key's Visual Novel, Rewrite, Is Headed To PlayStation 3
By Sato . November 25, 2014 . 10:00am
Rewrite is one of Key's major visual novel titles, which was released for PC back in June 2011, with artwork by Air and Clannad character designer Itaru Hinoue. Game Jouhou reports that the game is headed to PlayStation 3.
One of the biggest changes to the game is how all the characters will now be fully-voiced, and boasts more work for pictures, sound, and BGM than any other ports from a Key game thus far. We can expect to hear more details on Rewrite's port in the near future.
Meanwhile, you can check out the game's opening video of the original game in our previous report.
Rewrite is slated for release in Japan on February 11, 2015 for PlayStation 3.
After announcing earlier this week that they managed to run Linux on the PS4, the Fail0verflow hacking crew promised they would publish their sources once in a stable state. They just published a github link on Twitter, which contains their PS4 fork of the Linux Kernel.
What is this PS4 Linux source code, and is it useful for me?
Unless you're a PS4 hacker with a Kernel exploit in your possession, these sources will most likely not be useful for you at this point. Fail0verflow have explained during the CCC conference that although they will actively work on providing a Linux port for the PS4 community, they will not provide the hacks/Jailbreaks/exploits they used to install and run it in the first place.
We know that several PS4 hacking groups have PS4 exploits running, so it will be interesting to see what these groups do with this newly announced github repository. For the individual reader, you'll want to check who forks the Fail0verflow github, as a hint to whom might have running exploits 😉
For those of you interested to jump into the code and understanding what changes Fail0verflow have been working on, the best way is probably to look at the full diff of the PS4 Linux port compared to the base.
When will Linux for the PS4 be released?
For the “end user”, you'll still have to wait for several things to happen before any of these gets released: this Linux port to be finalized, a group of hackers to release a working PS4 Jailbreak, and someone connecting the dots together between the exploit and booting Linux. Don't hold your breath, but this might happen sooner than most think.

The Republican tax plan would force the government to slash billions of dollars' worth of core services unless Democrats relent, according to a new report.
A letter from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to Democratic Rep. Steny Hoyer on Tuesday said that because of a congressional rule, essential programs like Medicare could face deep cuts unless some Democrats agree with the GOP to waive the provision.
The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act, or Paygo, requires tax cuts and other types of legislation to pay for themselves; if they don't, Paygo triggers automatic spending cuts to offset any new debt added by the legislation.
According to the CBO, since the GOP's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is expected to add roughly $1.5 trillion in new debt over the next 10 years, Paygo would force spending cuts of $150 billion a year on average to offset the reduced revenue.
The letter from the CBO said the cuts in 2018 would total $136 billion, including slashing the budget to core programs like Medicare. The CBO said Paygo would force a cut of $25 billion from Medicare — the maximum amount allowable — and then cuts totaling "between $85 billion to $90 billion" from other programs like the federal student-loan program and farm subsidies.
These cuts can be waived — but not under the process being used by the GOP to pass the tax bill. The process, known as budget reconciliation, allows Republicans in the Senate to avoid a Democratic filibuster and pass the bill on a party-line vote.
The Paygo wavier, however, would not qualify for reconciliation consideration and would need at least 60 votes. Since Republicans have only 52 seats in the Senate, they would need eight Democrats to get on board to waive these requirements.
Democrats say the Paygo cuts would fall on Republicans, which are pushing the expensive tax legislation on a purely partisan basis. This would, in theory, give Democrats leverage to demand changes in the tax bill to win Paygo support.
The GOP, on the other hand, would say Democrats knew the consequences and held the Paygo cuts hostage to block the tax bill.
Regardless of who shoulders the blame, the Paygo implications could throw another massive question mark into the already volatile tax-bill negotiations.
Although she didn't publish her first novel until she was 42, Phyllis Dorothy James had been writing since childhood.
Now a celebrated crime writer, she has penned more than 20 books, including The Children Of Men, and the Adam Dalgliesh mystery series.
At the age of 93, she says she wants to write just one more detective novel.
Here are her top 10 tips for being an author.
1. You must be born to write
You can't teach someone to know how to use words effectively and beautifully. You can help people who can write to write more effectively and you can probably teach people a lot of little tips for writing a novel, but I don't think somebody who cannot write and does not care for words can ever be made into a writer. It just is not possible.
Nobody could make me into a musician. Somebody might be able to teach me how to play the piano reasonably well after a lot of effort, but they can't make a musician out of me and you cannot make a writer, I do feel that very profoundly.
2. Write about what you know
You absolutely should write about what you know. There are all sorts of small things that you should store up and use, nothing is lost to a writer. You have to learn to stand outside of yourself. All experience, whether it is painful or whether it is happy is somehow stored up and sooner or later it's used.
I love situations where people are thrown together in unwelcome proximity. where all kinds of reprehensible emotions can bubble up. I think you must write what you feel you want to write because then the book is genuine and that comes through.
I believe that someone who can write, who has a feeling for words and knows how to use them will find a publisher. Because after all, publishers do still need to find new writers. We all get old and we die and that's that and there have to be successors.
3. Find your own routine
I think all we writers are different. It's interesting, isn't it, how different we are?
Some people have to have the room, the pen and others do everything on a computer. I write by hand and I can write more or less anywhere as long as I've got a comfortable chair, a table, an unlimited amount of biros to write with and lined paper to write on. And then the next day when my PA comes, which she does at 10 o'clock, then I've got quite a lot to dictate to her and she puts it on to the computer, prints it out and I do the first revision.
In a sense, therefore, I revise as I go. It's important to get up early - before London really wakes and the telephone calls begin and the emails pile up. This is the best time for me, the time of quiet in the morning,
4. Be aware that the business is changing
Goodness gracious, how the world of publishing has changed! It is much easier now to produce a manuscript with all the modern technology. It is probably a greater advantage now, more than ever before, to have an agent between you and the publisher.
Everything has changed and it's really quite astonishing, because people can self-publish now. I would once have thought that that was rather a self-defeating way of doing it but actually publishers do look at what is self-published and there are examples of people picking up very lucrative deals.
5. Read, write and don't daydream!
To write well, I advise people to read widely. See how people who are successful and good get their results, but don't copy them. And then you've got to write! We learn to write by writing, not by just facing an empty page and dreaming of the wonderful success we are going to have. I don't think it matters much what you use as practice, it might be a short story, it might be the beginning of a novel, or it might just be something for the local magazine, but you must write and try and improve your writing all the time. Don't think about it or talk about it, get the words down.
6. Enjoy your own company
It is undoubtedly a lonely career, but I suspect that people who find it terribly lonely are not writers. I think if you are a writer you realise how valuable the time is when you are absolutely alone with your characters in complete peace. I think it is a necessary loneliness for most writers - they wouldn't want to be always in the middle of everything having a wonderful life. I've never felt lonely as a writer, not really, but I know people do.
7. Choose a good setting
Something always sparks off a novel, of course. With me, it's always the setting. I think I have a strong response to what I think of as the 'spirit of a place'. I remember I was looking for an idea in East Anglia and standing on a very lonely stretch of beach. I shut my eyes and listened to the sound of the waves breaking over the pebble shore. Then I opened them and turned from looking at the dangerous and cold North Sea to look up and there, overshadowing this lonely stretch of beach was the great, empty, huge white outline of Sizewell nuclear power station. In that moment I knew I had a novel. It was called Devices and Desires.
8. Never go anywhere without a notebook
Never go anywhere without a notebook because you can see a face that will be exactly the right face for one of your characters, you can see place and think of the perfect words to describe it. I do that when I'm writing, I think it's a sensible thing for writers to do.
I've written little bits of my next novel, things that have occurred to me. I've got the setting already. I've got the title, I've got most of the plot and I shall start some serious writing of it next month, I think.
9. Never talk about a book before it is finished
I never talk about a book before it is finished and I never show it to anybody until it is finished and I don't show it to anybody even then, except for my publisher and my agent. Then there is this awful time until they phone.
I'm usually pretty confident by the time I've sent it in but I have those moments when I think, 'well I sent it to them on Friday, by Saturday night they should be ringing up to say how wonderful it is!'
I'm always aware that people might have preferences and think that one book is better than another.
10. Know when to stop
I am lucky to have written as many books as I have, really, and it has been a joy. With old age, it becomes very difficult. It takes longer for the inspiration to come, but the thing about being a writer is that you need to write.
What I am working on now will be another detective story, it does seem important to write one more. I think it is very important to know when to stop.
Some writers, particularly of detective fiction, have published books that they should not have published. I don't think my publisher would let me do that and I don't think my children would like me to. I hope I would know myself whether a book was worth publishing. I think while I am alive, I shall write. There will be a time to stop writing but that will probably be when I come to a stop, too.
We often wonder just where the righties we know get the factual garbage they spew. Many are sincere, but the Republican noise machine and truth are mutually exclusive. The greatest violator of all is, of course, the Republican Reichsministry of Propaganda, Faux Noise. This is especially true where ObamaCare is concerned.
Ashley Dionne, a recent guest on Mike Huckabee's show, claimed that her insurance premiums would jump from $75 per month to $319 per month for her family. She proclaimed the act to be the "Unaffordable Care Act" and went even further, claiming her future and that of her children had been ‘raped.'
Unfortunately, someone forgot to mention to Ashley that her premiums were offset with subsidies, so she would really pay $223 per YEAR as well as receiving assistance with copayments. Oops.
Last Friday Sean Hannity hosted a special on how the Affordable Care Act is hurting Americans. It's a claim we hear every day from Ted Cruz on down to your average right wing Twitter troll. Every time I hear it, I wonder how it is even possible that so many are in so much pain over a law that opens up the health insurance market to everyone.
Evidently I'm not the only one with those questions. Eric Stern, a former aide to Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer and one of the key people involved in Montana's exchange, took a hard look at the "regular people" claiming they were harmed by Obamacare.
Stern called the people who appeared on Hannity's show to get more detail on their stories. Surprise! It seems there was more to every single one…
Since I was young, there was always one thing that frightened me above all else. Demons, creatures and Twisted monstrosities from hell, none of these even came close to how terrified I was when Mr Barlow opened his unholy eyes and stared down the camera at me. I'm of course talking about Tobe Hooper “Salem's Lot” and the creepy Barlow who's eyes are indeed something from the darkest pits of hell. I've never felt fear like I did when I first saw that film, and it started a strange fascination with the many different vampire forms that cinema created. In particular, the eyes were always intriguing for me. I loved how intimidating there were, how they changed from normal to frightening in the space of a couple of seconds. Sometimes the change was subtle, sometimes it was quite dramatic, but it was always enough to tell you that something was not quite right.
I wanted to share with you my personal fascination, by illustrating the different eyes through film history. There are many vampire films out there, so i've picked my personal favorites from across cinema. I hope you enjoy this as much as I enjoyed putting it together. It's been a crazy look into a side of cinema we rarely look.

Despite hearing an apology, description of openness with development officials and report that a slow-moving legal case was due to be settled within three months, city councillors moved last week to seize the languishing Vail Court property near Central Square.
The 0.65-acre property at 139 Bishop Allen Drive, a block from Massachusetts Avenue and the heart of Central Square, will become affordable, senior or transitional housing, city officials have said. The council has freed up $3.7 million to give the owners in return for the eminent domain land taking – the fair-market value determined by an appraisal commissioned by the city.
The Abu-Zahra family and its Six-S Realty Trust had its own plans to transform the decaying parking lot and 24 apartment units, which have been boarded up for about a decade while family members squabbled over ownership and development rights.
“For a very long time, the case was not really pursued very aggressively or vigorously. It's only been in the past several months, really, that there's been a lot of activity on it,” attorney John Maciolek admitted while testifying for his client, Said Abu-Zahra, during public comment Sept. 26. He said Abu-Zahra had his own ideas about reviving the property for residential use that had been outlined to city planners in the spring, and that he would still “simply like an opportunity to conclude that litigation and try to redevelop the property on his own.”
The pace of development “may not be to everyone's liking, but simply because it's moving at a slow pace does not, to my way of thinking, provide a good reason for taking the property,” Maciolek told councillors.
Eminent domain proceedings are typically taken against blighted property, with the rationale that the land can be improved to better serve the public good. In his own public testimony, Abu-Zahra acknowledged that the city had a case – “With great apologies to the City of Cambridge management for the condition of the building that Vail Court is a blight on the neighborhood, it is also a blight on the owners of Vail Court” – but the ongoing poor condition of the property was because “our hands are tied” by the court case, which prevented anyone from applying for building permits until ownership was established. The units were boarded up and secured against entry in January, however, after a threat of fines and “further action” by the city's Inspectional Services Department.
Seizing Vail Court has been discussed by the council for years, including a renewed push by Mayor E. Denise Simmons two years ago that led to the current action. Trustees were still “very surprised” to see the proposal arrive for a vote, Abu-Zahra said.
The votes enabling the land-taking – including freeing up the $3.7 million from the city's “free cash” – passed 8-0-1, meaning eight councillors were in favor and none were opposed, though Nadeem Mazen opted to mark himself “present” instead of vote because his friendship with the Abu-Zahras could be seen as a conflict of interest. Over the past couple of years he has been an intermediary between the family and city when officials complained the Abu-Zahras were slow to respond to them, but his use of Vail Court parking for a campaign bus during that time raised eyebrows. “These are people I know and support and have grown up with, and for that reason I don't think I'll be able to render an impartial judgment,” Mazen said.
“That being said, I was all set to agree with the city had I thought they were misleading us in any way about being tied up in court. I was set to say, ‘Hey, it's the right time to take this property – in fact, it probably was the right time a long time ago.' But these are honest people who are trying to move through their issue and use their property appropriately,” Mazen said. “I'm surprised to see this come up close to the end of the year, when judgment [in court may be] rendered.”
At the time of the vote, Maciolek said Abu-Zahra could file a legal appeal and seek to block the land taking. As of Wednesday, that decision hadn't been made, and Maciolek was unsure how quickly the city would act.
A call to the city's Community Development Department wasn't immediately returned.
Pepe the Frog‘s decade-long journey from webcomic character to everyman meme to alleged hate symbol has been a topsy-turvy one, but his importance to the meme economy cannot be denied. The trope of trading and collecting “Rare Pepes,” distinctive images of the famous frog, has been part of meme culture for years. And now there's real money behind it.
A February article from Reddit's Meme Insider, a parody trade publication dedicated to serious coverage of memes, explains how the fictitious market for Rare Pepes became a booming business.
The piece, by pseudonymous redditor JeffTheDunker, describes how the Rare Pepe economy initially functioned on a system of “Good Boy Points,” a largely fictitious currency that people would trade for new and unique images of Pepe. It started out circa 2015 as a 4chan in-joke about an autistic kid who would exchange “Good Boy Points,” earned by doing chores for his mom, for precious “chicken tendies,” and somehow they became the dominant imaginary currency of the Rare Pepe economy.
Good Boy Points were unsustainable, though, because there was no accountability in the system: Anyone could fabricate their Good Boy Point totals. In short: the points just weren't real.
Additionally, the idea that there was value—even imaginary or purely social value—in Rare Pepe memes caused the demand for Pepes to go up, and the market to become flooded by new content.
“When [Rare Pepes] breached mainstream media outlets, early adopters and speculators around the globe packed their bags for good, as the Pepe had, in their minds, become useless,” JeffTheDunker explains in Meme Insider.
In early 2015, a poster on 4chan's /r9k/ board, incensed at the mainstream popularity Pepe was starting to enjoy, tried to kill the meme by distributing a collection of more than 1,200 Rare Pepes, labeled “the end is nigh, hope you cash out now.”
4chan called this Pepe massacre “the Peppening,” and it led to posters jokingly watermarking their best Rare Pepes “do not save”:
The watermarks obviously did nothing to protect the Pepes, other than making them uglier, and the Rare Pepe economy looked doomed. But what if there were a way to regulate Pepes and make them impossible to copy?
We've seen Rare Pepes traded on Craigslist before, where physical drawings or printouts of the frog that were offered in exchange for cold, hard cash—sometimes as much as $100. We've even seen them sell on eBay for nearly $100,000—probably as a joke. But JeffTheDunker also suggests there's a real demand for unusual digital images of Pepe, even though it seems like those images should be trivial to replicate.
Enter: the blockchain. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin use it to make sure that digital money is unique to its owner and can't simply be copied or faked, and now it's being applied to Rare Pepes.
A blockchain-based platform called Counterparty lets users make anything into a unique digital token, and “anything” now includes Rare Pepes.
On the Pepe trading hub RarePepeWallet.com, you'll find hundreds of Rare Pepe images, all formatted to look like trading cards. Each exists in a limited quantity, anywhere from one to thousands, and no new copies will ever be issued.
Rare Pepes Rare Pepe Wallet
Traders can buy and sell the Pepes using Counterparty currency, but they prefer a cryptocurrency called PepeCash, which currently trades at 302 PepeCash to the dollar.
The selection of Pepes for sale, as JeffTheDunker points out, is a little weird right now: Because the site was created by crytocurrency nerds, many of the Pepe trading cards for sale there are Bitcoin-themed. There's one called “Shitcoin Pepe,” and one named after mysterious Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto.
RarePepeWallet.com
These aren't necessarily the Pepes that posters on 4chan and Reddit would consider “dank” (most Pepes aren't presented in card form, after all) but their rarity makes them a commodity. A one-of-a-kind card called “OnlyOnePepe” is currently on sale for the PepeCash equivalent of $11,589. Meanwhile, the “Top Cuck” Pepe, with 10,000 copies in circulation, can be yours for less than a dollar.
RarePepeWallet.com
The universe of Rare Pepes is constantly expanding, too. There are already more than 500 distinct cards, and collectors can submit their own original Rare Pepes for consideration. All it takes is a payment of 4,000 PepeCash (roughly $13), a dank idea, and some design skills.
The rules for approval are stringent:
Submissions must be ORIGINAL. Our rareness quality team examines each Pepe for rareness. (no stealing!) Our experts understand that lots of Pepe's borrow from each other to an extent, but try to add as much Original content as possible. Also make sure your Pepe is dank. Check latest submissions on the directory to compare.
This manual approval process means none of the 1,200 compromised Pepes from the 2015 “Peppening” is likely to show up on the site. Some of them may still be dank, but they're no longer rare.
One thing you'll notice about the selection of Pepe cards—and the Rare Pepe trading community at large—is that they don't carry even a whiff of Pepe's status as an alt-right, white supremacist, pro-Donald-Trump icon.
“Most of the community don't think Pepe is an alt-right thing. Some (like me) think that we should Make Pepe Great Again and free him of that connotation,” Pepe trading enthusiast Django Bates told the Daily Dot via email. “Also, you have to be aware that Pepe as a symbol of hate and racism by alt-rights is a merely North American thing. The rest of the world does not see Pepe in that context. But our Rare Pepe trading community is global. We have people from Japan, Spain, France, the U.S., Switzerland (myself), Russia, Turkey, South Africa and many other countries.
“Pepe is a meme. If alt-right idiots use it for there bullshit, then be it. Pepe is much greater and does not care about them. Pepe is a mirror. And a mirror is not racist, just because a racist is using it.”
So, instead of Trumpist Pepes, you'll find card designs like My Little Pepe, which might be the most expensive Rare Pepe ever sold. It recently changed hands for 1 million PepeCash (currently about $3,300).
rarepepewallet.com
The proud owner of My Little Pepe, alias American Pegasus, told the Daily Dot, “Only one of these exist, and it belongs to a tier of the rarest pepes of all—uniques with only a single card issued.”
rarepepewallet.com
“But that Pepe wasn't listed for sale in Counterparty,” American Pegasus continued. “Instead the seller only would accept cold hard PepeCash. A million of them to be exact. And so I'm darn glad I had some handy, and was able to score the trade.”
We're a long way from Good Boy Points now. The Rare Pepe economy is based on real money, and PepeCash is starting to take off. A recent price jump seems to have been triggered by a January Vice article and an article Wednesday in France's Le Monde that introduced Rare Pepe Wallets to a new group of meme fanatics.
Unlike most other digital currencies, this one is tied to the enthusiasm for an underlying product: Pepes. Even though you don't need PepeCash to buy Pepes, Pepe enthusiasts find it nice to own for a number of reasons.
“PepeCash offers a fun and abstract way to value Rare Pepes apart from their underlying Counterparty value,” American Pegasus explained. “As we know, with money, the value is in the utility. There are several exciting PepeCash-only features being planned, such as an entire exchange based off PepeCash and a Pepestarter crowdfunding platform. Ultimately it's best for the Pepeverse to have a highly liquid asset like this that can act as a base token for all things Pepe.”
No matter how much money you dump into Rare Pepes, though, you'll never own them all. There are a handful of one-of-a-kind Pepes, and some of their owners may have lost the passphrases to their Pepe wallets or may never sell their precious rares.
Regardless of how formal and secure the Rare Pepe Economy gets, though, it wouldn't be Pepe without a little trolling. Cryptocurrency blog Bitcoinist calls Rare Pepe Wallet “a satirical indictment of the altcoin markets,” especially the novelty digital currencies that are either jokes or shabby get-rich-quick schemes. Remember Dogecoin, the currency named after a Shiba Inu dog meme?
“In what can be seen as a satirical jab at this growing [altcoin] culture, Rare Pepes create a metaphorical representation of the pump and dump absurdity and legitimizes it through the use of the Bitcoin blockchain's immutability,” Bitcoinist's Ryan Strauss wrote in November.
The people trading Rare Pepes and PepeCash don't see them as just another flash-in-the-pan alternative currency, though.
PEPE is going to be the next DOGE, only bigger. DOGE was just a shitcoin clone, PEPE is a counterparty asset that can literally rarify memes — 🐔ActualAdvice_BTC (@ActualAdviceBTC) February 13, 2017
Dogecoin, for example, was just a rebranded Bitcoin running on the same technology. PepeCash is different because of its connection to the Rare Pepe cards themselves, which are fun to collect and desirable to meme aficionados on their own terms.
“I deeply believe that it is a lot more interesting as Dogecoin, which was only a currency,” Bates told the Daily Dot. “This is not just a currency. It is Blockchain driven meme assets you really can own. It is also helping to develop Counterparty, the protocol that is used to create and trade these assets.”
On the Rare Pepe Traders group chat, there's plenty of excitement about the PepeCash boom, but it's also clear that the traders and card creators have a passion for the meme.
“With pepetrading there are several things coming together as an extra: Memepower, Curiosity, Human nature of collecting all sorts of stuff, Hope for profit, Community, Interest in Blockchain Technology and above all – the lust to make fun about everything and everybody,” Bates wrote. “It's the mix of it all.”
One Rare Pepe designer, Nymity Nymz, told Le Monde, “I think these are just the beginnings of an industry,” and said it's even possible he could live on his Pepes someday.
Nymz, who described himself to RarePepeNews.com as a “Rapper, ghostwriter, FinTech Guru,” also told the site that the reason he creates Rare Pepes is “for 2020.”
A Rare Pepe, he said, “is something that has the potential to outlive us all.”
EDMONTON - Baseball fans have heard of Moneyball and hockey fans have seen their teams stock up on stats gurus recently, but transit users in Edmonton have benefited from statistical analytics for years.
Transit security officers receive a daily crime forecast telling them where and when trouble on the transit system is likely to happen, allowing them to respond proactively to problems.
“We were lucky enough to hire a brilliant analyst with a daily crime forecast that has proven to be very effective and, in fact, it's often the envy of other operators across the country,” said Edmonton Transit Service security director Ron Gabruck.
Daily, weekly and monthly information is analyzed to produce a report that gives transit peace officers a guide to the trouble hot spots and emerging trends on the system.
“It tells us that, for an example, at eight o'clock on a Tuesday night, there is a strong likelihood that there will be issues at a certain location. We try to get there at 7:45 and put it out,” said security director Ron Gabruck.
According to a report obtained by the Journal through freedom of information request, Edmonton Transit tracks the time and location of all security incidents on the system, creating an annual map of trends. Such incidents can include everything from fare evasion and public intoxication to assaults on transit operators and public littering.
The report shows, for example, that problems tend to bubble up at LRT stations between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. Two notable exceptions are the Bay/Enterprise Square LRT station, which sees a spike in incidents between midnight and 3 a.m., perhaps due to its proximity to bars and restaurants downtown on Jasper Avenue, as well as the Century Park station, which has a spike between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. That anomaly is likely due to the fact Century Park, located on 111th Street just north of 23rd Avenue, is the southern terminus of the line and a hot spot for commuters, some of whom are likely trying to avoid paying the fare.
The trend data also shows which bus routes will tend to have the most problems; in 2013, that was the No. 8 bus, which had 359 incidents, almost 100 more than the No. 9 route, which had the second-highest number of incidents, at 263.
Part of the sheer number of incidents could be the size of the route — the No. 8 is very long, starting in Abbottsfield in the north east, heading west through Coliseum station to the old municipal airport, then downtown, and all the way to Mill Woods in the south.
But the 263 incidents on the No. 9 route, which goes from Eaux Claires in the north to Southgate in the south, are particularly interesting, since they jumped 42 per cent from 2012. The only route with a bigger percentage increase in problems was the No. 3 last year; that route, which goes from Jasper Place north past Westmount, then down south through downtown and east to 62 Street and 115 Avenue, had 123 incidents in 2013, but that was a staggering 68 per cent jump from 2012.
Transit officials, however, rely on daily forecasting more than that annual report. They say the forecast is more sophisticated because it takes into account weekly and monthly numbers and areas that have emerging problems that won't necessarily show up on the annual report.

We are now watching a monumental dust-up over the ACA.
Hell-bent on fulfilling their campaign promise, the Republicans have trotted out killing Obamacare as their first priority now that they have that power. Meanwhile the Democrats are pushing back hoping to salvage a key component of President Obama's legacy.
What's most disappointing is that this has become just another us against them, red vs. blue debate that we've come to expect (and accept) from Washington, D.C., politics.
Relatively absent is any thoughtful discussion and analysis of just what would be the most viable and effective strategy for making affordable health care sustainable and available to all, something both sides claim as a main objective. We're not starting with a complete unknown here. If you believe WHO data, there are numerous examples from other developed countries that are apparently providing equal or better quality healthcare at a much lower cost than we are.
Unfortunately, there's a somewhat prevailing attitude that, since the U.S. is the brightest light bulb on Earth, why waste time looking at and perhaps following the examples of others. I have no personal stake in this matter (I'm not covered under Obamacare), nor do I make any claim to be knowledgeable on the overall merits or lack thereof of that program. My opinions are guided by my own life experience. I am a retired employee of the state of California. From day one of my 35 years of employment, I had a monthly paycheck deduction for Medicare and another for the state sponsored healthcare program. This is what we call the "individual mandate"; no choice.
Looking back, I am eternally grateful there was no choice since, while in my 30s and 40s, I might have been stupid enough to forgo health insurance payments in lieu of other higher priorities at the time; I'm healthy, why pay for something I don't need?
Now at 72, I consider myself a relatively healthy person, however in the past 10 years I've had two hip replacements, a surgically reconstructed wrist, and treatment for prostate cancer, all paid for through Medicare and my supplemental insurance coverage.
In the absence of those, the cumulative cost would have been astronomical and paramount to bankruptcy.
My point is that my own personal experience has led me to the opinion that affordable health care should be a right, not a privilege and financial contribution toward that right should be a requirement, not a choice.
The Republican approach is to make health care and health insurance market based. Free it up for competition between private, for-profit providers and that will solve the cost control problem. I think that's entirely appropriate for things like buying a TV, a car, a home, etc. For matters of necessity like police and fire protection — and healthcare — I'm not convinced that's the proper approach. I've come to believe for matters such as healthcare and health insurance, a single payer, universal system is the simplest and most effective approach.

When a Washington-based Metallica tribute band called Blistered Earth played in Portland on Saturday (April 23), their tour van was robbed and their equipment -- guitars, amps, drums, pedals and all -- was stolen. The band shared the unfortunate news on their Facebook a couple of days later, which immediately resulted in an outpour of support and even coverage by local Oregon news stations.
In fact, the story caught so much attention, it was seen by Metallica themselves. And now, thanks to the legendary rockers, the show can go on for Blistered Earth -- Metallica is replacing everything.
"Sometimes when bad things happen it really brings out the best in people," Blistered Earth wrote in a Facebook post. "Thanx to the the attention you guys helped bring to the matter of our stolen gear & KATU and KOIN in Portland airing the story, James & the rest of the guys in Metallica ( thanx guys) have seen fit to replace our equipment."
While Metallica has yet to comment about the generous gesture, the band's act of kindness was likely a way for them to pay it forward because they've been in Blistered Earth's shoes. Like the tribute band, Metallica were the victims of an equipment robbery early in their career, as Blistered Earth's drummer Shawn Murphy noted to M.I.R.P. magazine.
"They have a firsthand knowledge of how shitty this feels. But, I never thought it would come to this," he said. "It's pretty awesome that they would do that."
Take a look at everything that was stolen from Blistered Earth, which Metallica will be replenishing:

Looks like Oliver will be getting in touch with his soft side for Arrow season 3, according to spoilers by executive producer Greg Berlanti.
Find out what else Berlanti had to say on the upcoming season:
On Olicity...
"None of us like to throw stuff out there and then not deal with it in some way. It doesn't mean it occupies the story and that's all we deal with, but you want to be fair to the audience," Olicity is "something that we've been working toward and building toward since she first showed up on the show," he says. "We deal with it head-on in the premiere, but there aren't a lot of superheroes who are married. It's more that we're dealing with the finale than we are with them."
On amping up the humour...
"There's more of that [humor] throughout," Berlanti says of Oliver's change in demeanor in the new episodes. "He doesn't have Slade hunting him anymore. Things are in a happy place for everybody."
Ra's al Ghul dark presence in episode 4...
"There are some great twists and turns in terms of what their dynamic is." Ra's is "looming" in the background at the start of the season. "We try with the big bads to make every season feel different and for them to be reflective of what we want to put the hero through and characters through."
Thea's re-invention...
"A lot of secrets with Thea," says Berlanti,. "You'll see more of that," Berlanti promised, on those training scenes of Thea in the trailer, along with time with father Malcolm "It's a great twosome to watch onscreen."
As for wether Thea will become Speedy...
"She went away to become someone else. The question is, did she?"
Are you looking for a lighter Oliver? And what are you most looking forward to seeing in the upcoming third season?
In a sport that is not known as a ‘team' game, doubles comes as close as we can get, to playing as a team on the same court. Today we take a look at some of the most successful and revered doubles pairs, over the recent years.
Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi
The pair that made India visible on the radar of tennis, Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi were singularly responsible to bring glory to their country in the sport of tennis. They won three grand slam titles together, and made it to the grand slam finals six times in their career. Although their history is marred with controversy and personal problems, the pair toured up until 2002, briefly returning to reunite in 2011. This Indian pair, who had considerable success on all surfaces, stands fifth on our list.
This is the sixth “worst movies of the year” post I've written, and every year the worst movies share the same problems: bad plot construction, unintentionally unlikable protagonists, and the reprehensible treatment of female characters. (Click on the title of each movie to read my original review.)
Most of this year's crop of bad movies have the standard problems, but I give credit to Zila Ghaziabad for making it onto the list for a whole new reason: failure to appreciate the strength of the Censor Board's opposition to smoking.
While all Indian filmmakers know that scenes in which a character smokes are likely to be tagged with an onscreen warning that reads, “Cigarette smoking is injurious to health,” director Anand Kumar refused to capitulate in Zila Ghaziabad. As a result, the warning appears onscreen for nearly half of the movie. It's so distracting that I'm almost convinced it was deliberate and that the whole movie is Kumar's dig at the Censor Board.
Among movies that stunk in more conventional fashion, Bajatey Raho, Bullett Raja, and Fukrey were full of plot holes that never should've made it out of a first draft, let alone into a finished project. Fukrey wins bonus points for a racist scene in which a character refers to a group of black bodyguards as the “Chicago Bulls.”
I, Me aur Main and Ramaiya Vastavaiya were hampered by really, really unlikeable lead characters. Not to be outdone, Grand Masti featured not one, but three total jerks in leading roles. I'm awarding bonus points to Grand Masti for racism, sexism, and making a joke about gang rape.
Grand Masti wasn't the only movie to try to make light of rape or treat it as a plot device. The threat of rape was used to provoke the male leads in R… Rajkumar and Himmatwala. Both movies try to make that case that a woman's only defense against rape is a strong male family member or boyfriend.
As patronizing as that idea is, it's still not as abhorrent as the violently sexist message of my worst film of 2013: 3G. This poorly written horror movie cites pornography as the primary reason romantic relationships fail, but never suggests that the problem lies with those who view porn. Instead, it explicitly blames the women who perform in porn (and implicitly blames any woman with a sex drive). Want to get rid of porn? Kill all the porn stars!
At the same time that the movie blames sexually active women for provoking the violence committed against them, directors Shantanu & Sheershak go out of their way to portray actress Sonal Chauhan as a sex object. The camera ogles her breasts and buttocks while she writhes around on the beach and on a kitchen island (something I'm guessing she doesn't do for fun when she's at home alone).
Shantanu & Sheershak fail to recognize their own hypocrisy. Who's more responsible for Chauhan's depiction as a sex object: Chauhan — a paid performer — or the men who told her what to do and how to pose, filmed her, paid her, and then counted on others to pay to watch what they filmed?

Following recent hacks against Sony, Anthem and other major corporations, the White House has moved to form a new central agency that will pool resources from existing programs in order to monitor and combat cybersecurity threats.
According to the Washington Post, the Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center (CTIIC) is modeled after the National Counterterrorism Center, which was formed after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks to help agencies quickly share intelligence to thwart terrorism on U.S. soil. In that vein, the CTIIC will connect the dots between federal agencies that have cybersecurity departments, including the CIA, the FBI, the NSA and the Dept. of Homeland Security.
Obama: 'No Hacker Should Be Able to Shut Down Our Networks'
The Obama administration will announce the new center on Tuesday in an address by White House homeland security and counterterrorism adviser Lisa Monaco.
"The cyberthreat is one of the greatest threats we face, and policymakers and operators will benefit from having a rapid source of intelligence," Monaco told the Post. "It will help ensure that we have the same integrated, all-tools approach to the cyberthreat that we have developed to combat terrorism."
According to officials, the North Korean hack of Sony Entertainment was the catalyst for the center's creation. Obama wanted to know who was responsible for the attack, so Monaco gathered key agencies involved in the investigation, including the FBI, the NSA and the CIA, and asked them to report back their findings. She received multiple reports, but lacked a way to integrate all the data -- so she asked the FBI to produce the report, which then pointed the blame at North Korea. The CTIIC would be responsible for working with various agencies to gather, analyze and disseminate information going forward.

President Obama hinted at the center's formation in his State of the Union address on Jan. 20, saying the government would streamline its cybersecurity intelligence efforts "just as we have done to combat terrorism."
KUNDUZ, Afghanistan — Airstrikes carried out by the American military killed at least 13 civilians on Saturday in the northern Afghan province of Kunduz, according to residents and officials in the area, a difficult battleground for both Afghan and American forces.
The airstrikes took place in the Chardara district, where Afghan commandos, often advised by the American military and supported by United States air power, had been carrying out operations for several days.
After overnight airstrikes against the Taliban, several residents said the fighters forced them in the morning to help them retrieve the bodies of their fighters from the rubble, at which point the airstrikes resumed.
Capt. Tom Gresback, a spokesman for the United States military in Afghanistan, said they were aware of the claims and were looking into them.
Cutting the overseas aid budget in order to spend money on flood defences would be a false economy, the shadow chancellor has said.
John McDonnell warned that much of the spending send to developing countries was targeted at helping them green their economies and that it was already playing a role in preventing future flooding.
“If you look at a lot of the money that we're spending overseas it is to tackle climate change,” he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

“We're tackling the issue at source – we're reducing dependency on fossil fuels. If we do that it would be a short-term saving but a long-term cost.”
Mr McDonnell said the problem was that spending on flood defences had not been consistent across governments.
He called for all political parties to sign up to a long-term spending plan drawn up by experts in concert with local authorities who knew their at-risk areas best.
“We've got to take this issue beyond party politics. People don't want to hear party-political knockabout from this,” he said.
“We cannot be a situation where there's this stop-start approach to investment.”

Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk this weekend called for development aid to be cut and diverted to flood defence spending .
"Why do we spend money in Bangladesh when it needs spending in Great Britain?” he said.
“What we need to do is to sort out the problems which are occurring here and not focus so much on developing countries. That has to be our priority."
Mr McDonnell's overall fiscal plans do not restrict investment in infrastructure and under them he would not have to cut money from elsewhere in order to increase spending on flood defences.
He has argued that such investments pay for themselves in the long run.
George Osborne has however pledged to also rein in capital spending as part of his overall surplus target and would have to cut money from elsewhere in order to boost provision and stay within his targets.
A House of Commons Library note published in November 2014 found that spending on flood defences during the last Labour government – between 1997 and 2010 – increased by three quarters in real terms.
It however said central government spending from 2010 onwards had been cut by around 20 per cent compared to the previous spending period.
David Cameron defended the Government's record on flood defence spending, however, arguing that more cash was on the way.

Nova Scotia's premier dug in hard against Ottawa's carbon price scheme Tuesday, saying his province “definitely won't” impose a carbon tax.
Stephen McNeil also backed a decision by his environment minister, Margaret Miller, to walk out of federal-provincial meetings in Montreal over Ottawa's plan.
READ MORE: Nova Scotia let down, surprised by Ottawa's carbon price plan: minister
Miller joined her counterparts from Newfoundland and Labrador and Saskatchewan who also left Monday's climate-change talks after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stood in the House of Commons and dropped his plan on the provinces.
“We talked about it,” said McNeil. “When it became obvious, when the prime minister stood up, that they'd already made up their mind . . . it just became obvious that the minister should come home and figure out how we fit into this.”
The federal plan calls for a $10-per-tonne price on carbon starting in 2018. That would rise by $10 per tonne each year until reaching $50 per tonne in 2022.
Trudeau gave the provinces two implementation options – either their own direct price on carbon that meets or exceeds the national floor price, or a cap and trade system.

McNeil said any imposition of either measure would be “up to the government (Ottawa) to make” if his province fails to choose.
“I will not be implementing a carbon tax. We believe there are other ways to achieve (reductions) and we are hoping to work with the national government to make that happen.”
Newfoundlanders blind-sided by announcement
In St. John's Tuesday, Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Dwight Ball said many people felt blind-sided by Trudeau's announcement.
“I think there are a number of provinces that are concerned with how it unfolded,” he told reporters.
“It's fair to say that people were expecting an opportunity for further discussions which would lead into the anticipated first ministers' meeting in early December this year.”
“We want to have more discussions.”

McNeil said his province has led the country in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and has already met Canada's target of a 30 per cent reduction in emissions from 2005 by 2030. He repeated that his province is looking at some sort of recognition for that work.
“There is a Canadian province (B.C.) that already has a carbon tax and there are others that have cap and trade,” he said. “They have not had the success at reducing greenhouse gases like Nova Scotia.”
McNeil was less definitive about Ottawa's cap and trade option, saying he wasn't sure whether it would work for Nova Scotia. He said the province is running models on its potential effects.
But he continued to dismiss the carbon tax, saying that it would simply put a greater financial burden on people who need to drive in a largely rural province like his own.
McNeil believes a better way would be a North American plan for the auto industry to implement further engine emissions standards.
“It would get us to what we are trying to achieve, which is a reduction in greenhouse gases,” McNeil said.

Ball said his province is essentially already collecting about $70 a tonne on carbon pollution after doubling the gas tax to 33 cents per litre as of June 2. It was supposed to be a temporary measure as the government faces a projected $1.8-billion deficit.
But Ball said keeping the tax as a carbon price is one option the province is considering. Legislation to allow carbon pricing in some form has been on the books since the spring, he added.
Details must be worked out first, however: “What is the impact of a carbon tax for the long term on how we offer services?”
Ball said his province should be getting “offsetting” credits from Ottawa for building the $11.4-billion Muskrat Falls hydro project in Labrador. When completed, it will raise electricity rates while putting the province almost totally on renewable energy, he said.
Ball also clarified Tuesday that he never told his environment minister to walk out of Monday's meeting.
Perry Trimper told reporters in Montreal that he was leaving “at the direction of my premier.” But Ball said that direction was, simply, for Trimper to use his own judgment on whether to stay or go.
“He has my support. I have confidence in Perry Trimper. He was there. This is far from over.”
“Vampir Cuadecuc” is a ghostly film as well as the ghost of a film and perhaps the ghost of cinema itself.
Made in 1970 by the Catalan filmmaker Pere Portabella, “Vampir Cuadecuc” is among the most highly regarded avant-garde films of the past half century and has also been among the hardest to find. It is now available on disc from the British company Second Run Features in a zone-free format compatible with most DVD players and computers.
“Vampir Cuadecuc” was filmed on the set during the production of the Spanish director Jess Franco's “El Conde Dracula” (“Count Dracula”), a relatively modest vehicle for the redoubtable onscreen bloodsucker Christopher Lee. It could be variously characterized as a wildly impressionistic production documentary, a deranged remake of F. W. Murnau's silent classic “Nosferatu,” or an eccentric assemblage of outtakes. (According to the DVD notes by Stanley Schtinter, the word “cua de cuc” is Catalan for “worm's tail” and also refers to the bit of unexposed film stock at the end of a roll.)
Using a hand-held 16-millimeter camera and high-contrast black-and-white film stock, Mr. Portabella filmed central scenes from the Franco movie as though he were spying on its making. Amid the mysterious comings and goings, which include much kinetic rushing through the woods, the Portabella film emphasizes details like the crude bat puppets fluttering outside the window of a woman soon to receive Count Dracula's attentions. Ambient sound is almost entirely suppressed in favor of a musique concrète score by the Catalan multimedia artist Carles Santos in which rolling thunder and tolling bells are interspersed with passages of incongruously languorous lounge music.
There are currently over 1 Billion websites on the web. That number is growing as more of the world gets connected and technology makes it easier for people to have a voice and online presence through things like a website. This growth is being enabled by the explosion of technologies like open-source Content Management Systems (CMS).
Over a third of the websites online are powered by four key platforms: WordPress, Joomla!, Drupal, and Magento. -WordPress is leading the CMS market with over 60% market share. This explosion and dominance by WordPress is facilitated by global-user adoption, a highly extensible platform and focus on end users. Other platform technologies have experienced growth in more niche markets, like Magento in the online commerce domain with large and enterprise organizations, and Drupal in large, enterprise, and federal organizations.
This user adoption however brings about serious challenges to the internet as a whole as it introduces a large influx of unskilled webmasters and service providers responsible for the deployment and administrations of these sites. This assessment is amplified in our analysis, which shows that out of the 11,000 + infected websites analyzed, 75% of them were on the WordPress platform and over 50% of those websites were out of date. Compare that to other similar platforms that placed less emphasis on backwards compatability, like Joomla! and Drupal, the percentage of out-of-date software was above 80%.
As of March 2016, Google reports that over 50 million website users have been greeted with some form of warning that websites visited were either trying to steal information or install malicious software. In March 2015, that number was 17 million. Google currently blacklists close to ~20,000 websites a week for malware and another ~50,000 a week for phishing. PhishTank alone flags over 2,000 websites a week for phishing. These numbers reflect only those infections that have an immediate adverse effect on the visitor (i.e., Drive by Download, Phishing) and do not include websites infected with Spam SEO and other tactics not detected by these companies.
At Sucuri, we are well-situated to provide a unique perspective into what is happening once a website is hacked, and we have shared those findings in this report. We begin by trying to understand how websites are being hacked, then theorize and summarize those findings with quantifiable, measurable data collected from our customers.
This report will provide trends based on the CMS applications most affected by website compromises and the type of malware families being employed by the attackers. This report is based on a representative sample of the total websites we worked on for Quarter 1, Calendar Year (CY) 2016 (CY16-Q1). A total of 11,485 infected websites were used. This is the sampling that provided us with the most consistent data from which we could prepare this report.

Here is yet another example of women getting a pass for a reason that would never apply to a man:
A FORMER dinner lady who had sex with a 14-year-old boy has been spared a prison term because it would have meant her four children would be put into foster care.
That makes perfect sense. A person commits a crime, but because they have a family who depends on them, said person should not face the consequences of their actions. We can be sure, of course, that the crime in this instance was completely harmless and the offender had no idea she violated the law:
Terri Spragg, 35, had sex with the young lad on several occasions – including on the kitchen floor – warned him not tell anyone because it was illegal.
So Spragg not only pursued the victim, gained his trust, and abused him, but she also clearly knew it was wrong.
That is likely why she was convicted on seven charges. Of course, the judge wasted little time holding the victim responsible:
She appeared for sentencing at the Isle of Wight Crown Court yesterday where Judge John Price said: “He started having feelings for her. He became very fond of you. Then it became a sexual relationship.” He added: “I have read his victim impact statement. He says it has caused great upset. He was not able to talk to his parents and found it difficult to get on with people at school.” Judge Price continued: “He could not legally consent, in practical terms, he did. He was very fond of you. “
In other words, Spragg preyed on a boy who was infatuated with her. That obviously makes it acceptable, which would explain the decision to give Spragg a pass on jail time:
However, he spared her a spell behind bars because it would have meant her four children going into foster care. He said: “They would be taken from you and would go into different homes. It breaks up the family. I have no problem locking you up but I have to take into account the effect on the children.”
That is a contradiction. If you do not want to lock her up because she has children and you do not want them placed into foster care, you do have a problem locking her up. You also have a problem with warped morals. The sentence the woman faced was 15 months. She would not serve the complete sentence, and upon release she would receive custody of her children. While one can argue that a year in foster care is not the best situation, neither is allowing a woman who groomed and preyed on a vulnerable boy to get away with child rape.
That is effectively what Judge Price did.
Spragg's lawyer also played the “pity her” routine, arguing his client was “vulnerable” because she is a single mother and suffered a miscarriage. According to him, “This relationship gave her some sort of self-worth.”
Yes, of course. Adult women need barely pubescent boys having sex with them in order to feel any self-worth. That she requested the boy lie about it out of fear of legal punishment means nothing.
Spragg did not get away completely unscathed. She will have to register as a sex offender for five years, although given that she is female, it is unlikely to result in anything significant.
Cases like this one highlight the double standard used in abuse cases. No man who abused a 14-year-old girl could argue that he should not face jail time because of his family. No judge would accept such a silly argument. Yet this happens in far too many cases involving female offenders.
The most troubling part of this attitude is that female offenders essentially know they can rape and threaten their victims and walk out of court. None of this help victims of abuse. Rather, it sends the message that there is little point in victims reporting female offenders.
After you've mapped all the networky bits, it's time to move on to identities and access.
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that you can use to manage users and user permissions under your AWS account.
IAM is where a lot of the magic and good stuff lives. It's extremely complicated but extremely powerful, and likely where you will be investing a lot of your reconnaissance and persistence efforts.
Listing users will give you a feel for both the size of the account and the scope of attack surface.
aws iam list-users | jq '.Users [] .Arn'
People tend to name users using either their identity or the intended purpose of the account.
"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/JohnSmith"
"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Twitter"
"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/IntegrationBot"
...
In large enterprise accounts you may find yourself in the odd situation of the user list being tiny. That could be because authentication is federated via a SAML provider. To reveal this situation, list the identity providers using the IAM API.
aws iam list-saml-providers | jq ‘.SAMLProviderList [] .Arn'
Most of the major 3rd party identity services integrate seamlessly with AWS so its not unusual for one of those to be returned.
“arn:aws:iam::123456789012:saml-provider/Octa”
“arn:aws:iam::123456789012:saml-provider/PingIdentity”
The SAML provider an organisation uses for AWS authentication is highly correlated with the provider they use for other cloud services and internal systems — Yay for single sign-on. Knowing this can dramatically change other tactics you employ and reduce rage from banging your head against an invisible 2FA brick wall.
However, the true power of IAM is in roles. Roles are assumed by users authenticating via SAML. Roles are how Amazon recommends you start your EC2 instances and how it forces you to work in newer services like Lambda. Roles are the magic that gives you keyless API calls. Roles are the future.
You can use roles to delegate access to users, applications, or services that don't normally have access to your AWS resources. For example, you might want to grant users in your AWS account access to resources they don't usually have, or grant users in one AWS account access to resources in another account. Or you might want to allow a mobile app to use AWS resources… Sometimes you want to give AWS access to users who already have identities defined outside of AWS, such as in your corporate directory. Or, you might want to grant access to your account to third parties so that they can perform an audit on your resources.
If roles are the future, the ‘list-roles' function is the Almanac from Back to the Future Part II.
aws iam list-roles | jq '.Roles [] .Arn'
In general role names also tend to be quite descriptive. The full list of role ARNs is critical in escalating privileges and moving laterally within AWS.
"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/LambdaRole"
"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/AdminRole"
"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/TestRole"
...
Conveniently, if you are bored and want to go through all user, role, and policy data with a fine-tooth comb (the hyphen is important because I'm not sure what you'd do with a fine tooth-comb?!), there's an API to retrieve all the details at once.
aws iam get-account-authorization-details
Finally, while SSH key pairs aren't strictly part of IAM — they are predictably part of EC2 — they are another identifier that can help with mapping how an organisation deals with access.
aws ec2 describe-key-pairs | jq '.[][] .KeyName'
You should see a list of key names, which might tell you who has access to resources and for what purpose. Shared keys might make for good targets.
"janes-ssh-key"
"team-shared-key"
"product-deployment-key"

Voting results of Canadian Muslims, 2015[32] Liberal Party 65% New Democratic Party 10% Conservative Party 2% Other party 2% Did not vote 16% Not eligible to vote 5% In a 2016 Environics poll, 83% of Muslims were "very proud" to be Canadian, compared with 73% of non-Muslim Canadians who said the same thing. Canadian Muslims reported "Canada's freedom and democracy" as the greatest source of pride, and "multiculturalism and diversity" as the second greatest. 94% of Canadian Muslims reported a "strong" or "very strong" sense of belonging to Canada. 48% of Canadian Muslims attend mosque at least once a week. 53% of women wear some sort of head-covering in public (48% wear the hijab, 3% wear the chador and 2% wear the niqab). Both pride in being Canadian and having a strong sense of belonging had increased in Canadian Muslims as compared to a 2006 survey. Mosque attendance and wearing a head covering in public had also increased since the 2006 survey.[33] A 2016 survey found that 36% of Canadian Muslims (47% of those aged 18-34) agreed that homosexuality should be generally accepted by society, while 43% disagreed. Older Muslims (55%) and those with the lowest incomes (56%) were more likely to disagree.[33]

On 12 December 2011, the Canadian Minister of Citizenship and Immigration issued a decree banning the niqab or any other face-covering garments for women swearing their oath of citizenship; the hijab was not affected.[34] This edict was later overturned by a Court of Appeal on the grounds of being unlawful. People such as Tarek Fatah[35][36][37] and Ensaf Haidar[38][39] have called on the burka to be banned.

Abstract
We conducted an online survey using a set of factual science questions that are commonly administered to assess fact-based scientific literacy. We report that the online population performed substantially better on this standard assessment than the traditional survey population. For example, it has been widely reported that 1 in 4 Americans does not know that the Earth revolves around the Sun, whereas among the online population, this ratio is reduced to 1 in 25. While new online platforms provide researchers with unprecedented ease of access to a large sample population for studying trends in public knowledge and attitudes, generalizing from online population samples to the US population at large poses a considerable challenge. We discuss the potential reasons for this discrepancy and the implications for conducting research online.
Image copyright AFP Image caption The ceasefire will come into force on 20 July, the Farc announced in Cuba
Colombia's Farc rebels have announced a one-month unilateral ceasefire.
The Farc has been taking part in peace talks with the Colombian government since 2012, but violence has increased in recent weeks.
The Farc's chief negotiator at the talks in Cuba, Ivan Marquez, said he hoped the ceasefire, starting on 20 July, could lead to a bilateral truce.
The government welcomed the move but gave no sign it would do likewise and said the rebels needed to do more.
"We appreciate the gesture of a unilateral ceasefire by the Farc but more is needed, especially concrete commitments to speed up the negotiations," President Juan Manuel Santos said on Twitter (in Spanish).
For his part, Mr Marquez said the truce would "create favourable conditions in order to advance with the opposing side toward a bilateral and definitive ceasefire."
Image copyright EPA Image caption Hostilities with the Colombian military have escalated recently
Four countries helping to facilitate the peace talks - Cuba, Norway, Chile and Venezuela - issued a call on Tuesday for a de-escalation in the violence.
A previous Farc ceasefire was called in December, but clashes resumed in April with the killing of 11 soldiers and subsequent bombing raids on rebel positions.
Farc suspended that unilateral ceasefire on 22 May.
Since the ceasefire ended, several dozen rebels and soldiers have been killed.
In June, the group blew up an oil pipeline, which contaminated water and left at least 16,000 people without supplies in the municipality of Catatumbo in the north.
The talks in Havana, which began in November 2012, are aimed at ending more than 50 years of conflict. More than 200,000 people have been killed since hostilities started in 1964.
Negotiations have continued despite the violence, and agreement has been reached on several points.
Hardware makers will unite behind Google's Android as the primary operating system for tablet computers, according to Nvidia's CEO.
Tablets are shaping up to be one of the highlights of the annual Computex show in Taipei, where hardware makers are showing off their latest products and prototypes. Most manufacturers are expected to show off tablets, with some designed to run Android and others Windows. But Windows isn't the best choice for a tablet, said Jen-Hsun Huang, president and CEO at Nvidia.
"Windows is too big and it's too full featured for smartbooks and tablets," Huang said, speaking with reporters in Taipei on Monday. Smartbook is a term used to describe low-cost laptops containing processors designed by Arm instead of x86 chips from Intel or Advanced Micro Devices.
"The good news is that we finally have an operating system to unite behind. Android is an operating system that has gained a tremendous amount of momentum all over the world," Huang said.
Android was originally developed with cell phones in mind but computer makers wasted no time putting it to use in other devices. Several hardware makers showed off netbooks running the OS at Computex last year. In addition, Acer shipped a version of its Aspire One netbook that came with Windows XP and Android installed.
"Android has become the fastest growing mobile operating system in the world and, in fact, it has surpassed the iPhone in terms of growth and in terms of users," he said.
The iPad's success proved there is widespread demand for tablets and set the bar high for rivals. Apple sold 1 million iPads during the first four weeks it was on sale, winning praise from users for its sleek and intuitive user interface, as well as its long battery life. Matching Apple's success won't be easy and will require modifications to optimize Android for tablets.
"Andy Rubin and his team [at Google] know exactly where the industry needs to go. Android started out as a phone but it's not lost on them that the tablet is going to be very important and that the Android operating system has to evolve, and be enhanced in certain capabilities, in order to be a good tablet operating system," Huang said, citing graphics performance as one area where Android needs to be improved to match the iPad.
Nvidia has a vested interest in seeing the tablet market take off. The company is selling its own Arm-based processor, called Tegra 2, that's designed for tablets. The chip combines a dual-core Arm processor, a graphics processor, and other components on a single piece of silicon. While tablets based on Tegra 2 have yet to hit the market, they will go on sale before the end of this year.
"I think we'll have to wait until this fall. The operating systems are coming together, the devices are coming together," Huang said.
The techniques – dubbed "gaming" – are used to create the illusion that fewer crimes are being committed and that a bigger proportion are being solved.
Rodger Patrick, a retired Detective Chief Inspector, claimed that the methods are tacitly approved of by senior officers, police watchdogs and the Home Office.
The claims will reignite the debate about the validity of crime statistics after recent figures suggested that crime fell four per cent in the second quarter of this year, and following the admission by a police watchdog that some forces are failing to record violent crime properly.
:: "Cuffing" – in which officers make crimes disappear from official figures by either recording them as a "false report" or downgrading their seriousness. For example, a robbery in which a mobile phone is stolen with violence or threats of violence is recorded as "theft from the person", which is not classed as a violent crime.
:: "Stitching" – from "stitching up", whereby offenders are charged with a crime when there is insufficient evidence. Police know that prosecutors will never proceed with the case but the crime appears in police records to have been "solved".
:: "Skewing" – when police activity is directed at easier-to-solve crimes to boost detection rates, at the expense of more serious offences such as sex crimes or child abuse.
:: "Nodding" – where clear-up rates are boosted by persuading convicted offenders to admit to crimes they have not committed, in exchange for inducements such as a lower sentence.
Dr Patrick, who researched the subject for a PhD, said: "The academics call this 'gaming' but police officers would call it fiddling the figures, massaging the books or, the current favourite term, 'good housekeeping'. It is a bit like the police activities that we all thought stopped in the 1970s."
Serving police officers confirmed that the tricks were being used and gave examples of how they had been implemented.
In one case, an offender shot at another man at close range but missed and broke a window behind his target. The offence was recorded as criminal damage rather than attempted murder.
In another example, a man robbed in a city's red-light district – an area he had been innocently passing through – was told by officers they would be unable to record the crime without informing his wife he had been the area, leading to the complaint being withdrawn.
One detective, who declined to be named, said: "Name any crime and I'll tell you how it can be fiddled."
Simon Reed, vice-chairman of the Police Federation, which represents front line officers, said: "This research demonstrates that senior officers are directing and controlling widespread manipulation of crime figures.
"The public are misled, politicians can claim crime is falling and chief officers are rewarded with performance-related bonuses."
Last month Denis O'Connor, the Chief Inspector of Constabulary, published an official report into the way police record violent crime and admitted the figures may be skewed by "perverse incentives" around government performance targets.
Dr Patrick's research highlighted figures from his own former force, West Midlands, which reveal what happened when senior officers cracked down on one of the gaming techniques.
Rank and file officers were told in 2002 that informal police warnings could no longer be counted as a detection for common assaults.
Within 12 months the number of recorded common assaults dropped from 22,000 to 3,000 while thousands more crimes switched to the category "other woundings".
"Such a rapid adjustment indicates the organisational nature of the phenomenon and suggests some form of co-ordination and direction by management," the research said.
"The scale of the 'gaming' behaviours measured in this thesis ... suggested senior officers were either directly orchestrating the behaviour or turning a blind eye to it."
Dr Patrick believes other gaming techniques are still being used in forces across the country.
The report also warned that the use of "stitching" was "significant", while "cuffing" had continued after the introduction of Home Office rules which were supposed to guarantee and standardise the way crimes are recorded.
"Cuffing" can involve a situation where a victim of crime is accused of making a false crime report, and is therefore treated like a suspect rather than an injured party, Dr Patrick said.
"You cannot have members of the public who have been victims of crime coming to the police for help and being treated like suspects. That is not right and it will erode confidence in the police," he said.
Dr Patrick found that watchdogs such as Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) and the Police Standards Unit had a "general tendency to underplay the scale and nature" of gaming.
He was scathing of HMIC's failure to tackle the problem, noting there were no examples of chief police officers being publicly criticised by inspectors for this type of crime figure manipulation.
HMIC tended privately to refer examples of widespread gaming to the Home Secretary or the police authority rather than "hold the chief constable to account" because of the risk of political embarrassment, he said.
Dr Patrick concluded that HMIC inspectors should be made accountable to Parliament rather than the Home Office, and suggested they should be drawn from other professions rather than solely from senior police ranks.

LONDON (Reuters) - Ferrari team principal Maurizio Arrivabene has made clear where his allegiances lie after Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone suggested he could do more for the sport.
Ecclestone, 84, told the official formula1.com website at the weekend's Monaco Grand Prix that team bosses needed to be more prominent.
When it was put to him that Arrivabene was “quite a character”, he replied: “But only for himself and not for Formula One”.
Arrivabene, a marketing man who previously worked for team sponsor Philip Morris and took over his high-profile new job last November, said his responsibilities were to Ferrari.
“With all due respect, I don't have to respond to Bernie for what I do, but rather to Mr Marchionne,” said the Italian, referring to the Ferrari chairman and Fiat Chrysler chief executive, in a comment to Reuters.
“If Bernie has doubts about my way of doing, he should ask the team.”
Ferrari's fortunes have been transformed since Arrivabene took over as the third principal in the space of a year at Maranello.
Sebastian Vettel was second in Sunday's Monaco showcase race, his fifth podium finish in six races since he joined from Red Bull, and Ferrari are now established as the closest rivals to champion Mercedes.
Last year they failed to win a race, their first blank season for 21 years.

Queensland – While sleeping in bed with her fiancé, a former Miss Australia awoke to a police flashbang grenade disfiguring her face and melting her hand. Although she required immediate medical attention, paramedics did not arrive at the scene until 40 minutes later.
Crowned Miss International Australia in 2013, Felicia Djamirze was asleep in bed with her fiancé, Dean O'Donnell last week, when a police flashbang grenade landed in their bedroom. Accused of drug trafficking, the former Miss Australia was placed under arrest as police waited 40 minutes for an ambulance to arrive. The cops refused to allow Djamirze to see her injuries even though she suffered third-degree burns to her face and right hand.
During a series of early morning drug raids, Queensland Police callously decided to toss a flashbang grenade into the bedroom of alleged Rebels biker associate Dean O'Donnell. Despite the fact that the police had been conducting surveillance on the house, the cops chose to throw the flashbang into the room while O'Donnell was asleep with his fiancée.
“The police treated this like a military operation which was entirely unnecessary,” Djamirze's lawyer, Chris Ford, told the Daily Mail. “There was a high level of both physical and electronic surveillance. The police must have known my client was sleeping in a confined area when they tossed the stun grenade into her bedroom.”
Still hospitalized on Monday, Djamirze has endured two surgeries to repair her melted hand while at risk of losing sight in her right eye. Although she now suffers from PTSD after the police raid, the former Miss Australia has reportedly started a GoFundMe page dedicated to helping burn victims and trauma patients. As Djamirze denies the drug trafficking charges against her and her fiancé, O'Donnell has been charged with both drug trafficking and possession of illegal weapons.
While staying with relatives in Habersham County, Georgia, the Phonesavanh family had been asleep when a SWAT team executed a no-knock search warrant just before 3:00 a.m. on May 28, 2014. Before the police entered the room with guns drawn, Habersham Deputy Charles Long tossed a flashbang grenade into 19-month-old Bounkham Phonesavanh's crib. The explosion blew a hole in the baby's face and chest, covering him in third-degree burns.
The search warrant had been intended for Bounkham's cousin who was suspected of making a $50 drug sale. The suspected cousin no longer lived in the house and was later arrested without incident. After being transported to an intensive burn unit, Bounkham was placed into a medically induced coma. Habersham County officials refused to cover the baby's medical expenses.
On the evening of January 5, 2011, 68-year-old Eurie Stamps was in his pajamas watching television when SWAT officers forcibly entered his home with a battering ram and tossed in a flashbang grenade. Not a suspect of any crime, Stamps complied with Officer Paul Duncan's orders to lie facedown with his hands on his head. Duncan claims his bulky equipment caused him to lose balance and accidentally discharge his weapon. Stamps died on the floor with a bullet in his back. The suspect, his stepson Joseph Bushfan, had already been arrested outside the residence minutes before the raid.
Just past midnight on May 16, 2010, a Detroit SWAT team tossed a flashbang grenade into the living room where 7-year-old Aiyana Stanley-Jones had been sleeping on the couch. As the flashbang incinerated her blanket, Aiyana was immediately shot in the head by Officer Joseph Weekley. Weekly claimed that Aiyana's grandmother had reached for his weapon, but ballistics and another officer's testimony refute his accusations. Police later realized they had forcibly entered the wrong apartment. The suspect, Chauncey Owens, lived upstairs.
On January 4, 2008, Tarika Wilson had been holding her 14-month-old son when an Ohio SWAT team broke down her front door. Sgt. Joe Chavalia entered the residence shooting both Tarika and her infant son. Unarmed and not suspected of any crimes, Tarika died of her wounds while her child survived. Chavalia was charged with two misdemeanors, negligent homicide, and negligent assault. An all-white jury convened for three hours before returning with a not guilty verdict.
During a drug raid in Modesto, California, 11-year-old Alberto Sepulveda was lying facedown on his bedroom floor when Officer David Hawn entered the room and fired his shotgun. Claiming his shotgun accidentally discharged, Hawn refused to accept responsibility for taking Alberto's life on September 13, 2000. Clearing Hawn of any criminal charges, former Attorney General Bill Lockyer admitted, “Unfortunately, too many times the deployment of a SWAT team has resulted in the unintentional death or injury to a peace officer or member of the public.”
The concept of the SWAT team formed as a reaction to the 1965 Watts riots. Since that time, the federal government has been pouring increasing amounts of money and military-grade weapons into the hands of law enforcement agencies. Citing the wars on drugs and terror to rationalize their actions, federal assistance from the DOD's 1033 Program and the DOJ's Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant has been escalating the militarization of American police forces.
By sidestepping the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, the U.S. government has blurred the divisions between the military and the police, and the Australian government appears to be following in step. The executions of no-knock search warrants too closely resemble the night raids conducted in Afghanistan and Iraq. When the police become the military, the enemy becomes everyone.

One person was injured when the giant tree came down. Gus Rosendale reports.
An enormous (and that's an understatement) tree somehow fell on a Bronx neighborhood street Tuesday, stretching from one yard all the way across the roadway and enveloping at least three homes in its sprawling branches.
One person suffered minor injuries in the 9:45 a.m. accident and was taken to the hospital. The individual is expected to be OK. Some homes also appeared damaged, but the extent was difficult to ascertain from chopper and ground footage.
Neighbors expressed disbelief there weren't more injuries given the tree fell at a time people were heading to work and camp.
It's not clear why the tree fell, but one neighbor speculated recent rain may have eaten away at the root structure.
Gigantic Tree Mysteriously Falls in the Bronx, Swallowing Homes in Branches
Chopper 4 showed just how huge the tree really was. Here's raw video over the scene. (Published Tuesday, July 11, 2017)
Traffic delays should be expected in the area as authorities work to clear the behemoth carcass from the road.
Nintendo game pulled over child porn concerns
Posted
A Nintendo game withdrawn from sale in Europe due to child pornography concerns but given a PG rating in Australia has had its classification revoked.
Dead Or Alive: Dimensions caused a stir in Sweden, Norway and Denmark after it was found players could look up the skirts of its big-breasted, scantily clad characters who were apparently under 18.
Nintendo in Europe then decided not to distribute the latest edition in the long-running Manga cartoon-style combat series.
But Nintendo Australia spokeswoman Heather Murphy told ABC News Online last week the characters in question were listed as N/A (no age) for their age in the Australian version.
"It doesn't state the ages of all the players, and the ones who do have an age in their profile are not under 18," she said.
"They're not listed as underage. They're listed as no age.
"Nintendo didn't rate this game. Tecmo Koei didn't rate the game. The classification branch did.
"They're a government body and look at the content and have given it a PG rating."
In February, the game was given its PG rating with advice that it featured "mild violence and sexualised gameplay".
But media attention caught the eye of Home Affairs Minister Brendan O'Connor, who demanded answers from the Classification Board.
The board then issued Nintendo with a show cause notice giving the company one week to prove why the game should not have its classification revoked.
But on Friday it did just that - a move welcomed by Mr O'Connor.
"The material in this game is clearly not appropriate to be played by children," he said in a statement.
"I am pleased the Classification Board took swift action to address community concerns."
It means Dead Or Alive: Dimensions will not be available in Australia again unless it is reclassified.
Last month Mr O'Connor's department released draft guidelines on the introduction of an R18+ rating for video games ahead of a meeting next month to decide whether to push ahead with the new laws.
Games that do not qualify for the current MA15+ rating are not sold in Australia, but the higher classification would drastically loosen restrictions on drug use, nudity and language.
All states and territories need to agree on the classification for it to go ahead.

I think the more organic the dialogue system the better. What I mean by organic is that the actual human player is deciding on responses and the choice of response determines success instead of stats. Options can still be gated by stats some of the time, but can also be gated by in-game research. So if the player has taken the time to read some in-game lore, to talk to minor NPCs and find things out, he'll have more options in a conversation. Options can also relate to missions the player has completed and areas he's explored.The reason combat is inherently more fun than dialogue (at least to me) is that combat provides multiple routes to success and multiple levels of success. Did you win without anyone getting killed? Seriously hurt? Hurt at all? Did you win without using your grenades? Etc. Dialogue is almost always binary. Either you got what you wanted or you didn't. Boring.As an aside, quests are also often completely binary. If a player fails a quest, he's likely to reload and try again. I'd like quests with three levels of completion, or which give you a different but not totally negative outcome for "failure".
How Much Does Google Know About Me?
It's no secret that Google, the world's most popular search engine, is also the world's most successful data accumulation company ever. Google has been compiling data on its users for years. The amount of data they have accumulated is enough to build a comprehensive profile about who you are, where you go, what you do, and what you view online. What's more interesting is that all of this information is available for you to view online at google.com/dashboard.
How Much Does Google Know About Me?
Without getting into too much detail here some things you can find out about yourself – courtesy of Google.
GMAIL: Google can track the number of emails in your account since it was first opened. Google also stores every Gchat conversation you had been involved in.
CONTACTS: Google knows all about the people you email the most. Heck they even know about your old college buddy that you've been chatting with for a couple weeks now – he's currently your number one most contacted.
YOUTUBE: Google lists all of the videos you have been watching on YouTube. That's a lot of cat videos!
GOOGLE PLAY: Do you download a lot of apps from the Google store? Don't deny it – Google knows.
GOOGLE SEARCH: If you think that tracking the type of queries you type in Google's search bar is bad, they also know the time of day you search the most.
ANDROID DEVICES: Your mobile device isn't safe from Google either – specially if you have an Android phone. They keep track of all the synced Android devices you own.
PASSWORDS: Is Google Chrome your default browser? Well Google knows the number of website passwords that are saved in Chrome's Browser.
DOCS: Do you create, store and view important documents on Google Docs? Sure you do! Google knows how many you have on file from yourself and from others.
WEBSITE ANALYTICS: It's nice to know you that you can use Google Analytics to track how many people visit your own website. It's also nice to know that Google keeps track of this data for themselves as well.
PHOTOS: Albums, photos, favorites, your galleries URL – it's all there.

MONEY is just a commodity. Why does it occupy so much of your attention?
Ironically, that elusive, “gotta-have-it-to-make-me-happy” ingredient of life is available everywhere! Getting your hands on it and making it do the things to change your life is the tricky part. It all starts in your head!
If you're thinking “money CAN'T buy happiness” you're right. Or are you? Although I've never seen happiness in a box or at a half-off sale, I believe just by having some of it to spare you CAN attract happiness into your life. Happiness in the form of “less stress” allows you to think and act differently. With extra money and knowing how to use it wisely you invite happiness in the form stress minimization into your everyday life. So technically, money can't buy happiness, but just having some, can facilitate it!
I'm R.E. Kennedy. I feel your frustration. I rode the horse you're on for years until I uncovered some secrets that changed my life and hopefully might change yours too. Until this past four year recession-fiasco, money was plentiful and life was great. If you're not having any “luck” with money right now, it may be because you're allowing yourself to harbor negativity, and in that, you're not alone. Right now the media's regurgitating a continual replay loop about unemployment, government debt, homes being sold-short, foreclosed or underwater, and none of that is good news at all. So when you read my “PLAN” you may suspect that I'm NUTS! I get that. Maybe I am, but it's working for me.
Not enough of us are able to hop onto the smart money track to wealth multiplication and prosperity while a temporary window of opportunity remains open. Sorry, there is no exclusive right to own it or ride it…but I've been able to identify, describe and predict it. If you DON'T consider my plan from YOUR own perspective I can guarantee that it will not improve your future.

The widespread loss of forest to sugarcane fields on the island of Mauritius has forced kestrels living there to survive by speeding up their life histories, according to a report published online on February 20 in the Cell Press journal Current Biology. By getting an earlier start, the birds are managing to have just as many offspring, even though they die sooner.
Those changes to the kestrels' life history are apparently driven entirely by their early life experiences, the researchers say.
"This adaptive, plastic response is a testament to how resilient this species is," says Samantha Cartwright, a postdoctoral researcher from the University of Reading and lead author on the study. "It has narrowly avoided extinction in the 20th century and is now persisting in a landscape very different from what it would have originally evolved to occupy."
The kestrels' future remains in doubt, given that less than two percent of the native forest that once covered Mauritius remains today. Kestrels already can't live at all on many parts of the island, most of which has been converted to agricultural land.
In 1974, Mauritius kestrels were labeled "the rarest birds in the world," with only four individuals living in the wild. They are now the most intensively monitored wild tropical raptors in the world, which made them a good case study for questions about the effects of habitat change.
The researchers analyzed 23 years of longitudinal data on the Mauritius kestrel to find that females born in territories affected by habitat change shifted investment in reproduction to earlier in life at the expense of late life performance. They also had lower survival rates as young adults.
"We found that birds from both types of habitat still ultimately produce the same number of offspring in a lifetime," Cartwright says. "The strategy is a good one: breeding when younger compensates for the increased risk of dying sooner."
While the birds may be making it for now, Cartwright emphasizes that their shifted life history should serve as a warning about the extent to which human activities have already influenced wild species.
"Taken together, our results suggest that human activities can have a persistent effect on the life histories of wild organisms through natal environmental effects," the researchers write. "Given the ubiquity of human-induced habitat change, the patterns we report could be widespread but remain poorly documented due to the short-term nature of most studies that attempt to quantify only the immediate impact of habitat change on fitness traits."

Chatting to people here in Holland, their perception of Australia is that we are very hard on immigration. This false reality stems from them getting their news from the general mainstream media. Much like back in Australia we think that Europe has been completely overrun with immigrants because that is what we see on the news.
I have to explain to them that while we stopped the boats, and made a very big deal out of doing so, that was only a sideshow compared to what has been going on as regards to legal immigration into the country for the past 15 odd years. John Howard changed the immigration rules in the early 2000s, with the resulting change being that the average yearly migration rate since that period has been 210,000 people per year whereas previously the average was 70,000.
This change occurred in Australia with no effort to involve the Australian population in the decision or even let them have a say. Discussion was forbidden under the guise of political correctness. Any attempt to have the discussion was instantly dismissed as racist rantings on the part of the interloper stupid enough to inquire as to why we were bringing in hordes of second and third world peasants.
Every political party since Howard has been in cahoots with this new attitude. And up until now the mainstream media has been entirely complicit in the immigration agenda as well. But journalists tend to live in the inner areas of cities like Melbourne and Sydney, and it seems like reality is finally catching up with their misplaced ideology. That is the only explanation that I can come up with for a piece on news.com of all places titled, John Howard's bait-and-switch: Is it time for a debate on the mass immigration ‘Ponzi scheme'?:
Our cities are bursting at the seams, roads and services are congested, and house prices are skyrocketing — particularly in Sydney and Melbourne, which attract the lion's share of new Australians. Over the last 12 years, Sydney has added 20 per cent to its population, or 800,000 people. Melbourne has added one million people over the same period, or 27 per cent. According to state government projections, Sydney will add another 1.7 million people over the next 20 years, which works out to 87,000 people a year, or 1650 people per week. Melbourne is forecast to add 97,000 people per year, or around 1870 people per week, for the next 35 years. “It's clearly unsustainable,” said Leith van Onselen, chief economist with MacroBusiness. “The problem isn't that immigration is good or bad, it's just that the level is far too high for Australia to digest.” According to Mr van Onselen, dubbed the “Unconventional Economist”, Howard “effectively ran a bait-and-switch policy”. “He scapegoated the very tiny number of people coming by boat, and at the same time opened the floodgates on people coming by plane,” he said. “Howard never articulated why he was doing that, he just did it, and unfortunately the following governments, Rudd, Gillard, Abbott and now Turnbull, just followed.”
This is the sort of questioning line that we are used to seeing in publications like The Spectator or Quadrant, not news.com. Living standards have declined dramatically in Australia over the past 20 years under this relentless search for more people to move there, and all fueled by the desire for certain favored elements of the economy to benefit from the massive population influx.
A 30% rise in Melbourne's population over that time period is beyond belief. The city was unlivable when I was there, which is more hilarious when you consider the fact that Melbourne routinely tops the annual “most livable cities in the world” garbage poll. It's not just a result of poor planning that the city's infrastructure is completely compromised. No city in the world that is already established would be able to cope with that sort of permanent influx over that space of time.
I will state it for the record that Melbourne and Sydney are not Australia. They are some sort of hybrid futuristic nightmare landscapes, completely detached from the Australian culture that exists outside their boundaries. But these multicultural megalopolises suck in the wealth of the nation as governments frantically attempt to patch over the ever widening cracks that these gigantic disasters are beginning to fall through.
Now the property bubble is starting to affect regional towns as well, as native Australians begin fleeing from Sydney and Melbourne. And all the while the city of Canberra, capital of the nation and home to the public service, sits serene and content in its exclusivity and wealth that is built on the back of the engorged salaries that bureaucrats now enjoy as opposed to those suffering in the private sector.
The great horror for Australian politicians of the last 10 years has been a potential downturn in China and the complete end of the mining boom in the West. To that end they have actively engineered a false messiah, equating the wealth of the nation to a continually rising population. But as native Australians are forced to watch their adult children trading in suburban backyards for tiny apartments in Chinese designed high rise apartment towers, slowly the penny is dropping for sections of the media as well.
The question is not whether the conversation will begin but if it is already far too late to have it.
Image caption Lord Scriven said South Yorkshire Police was taking members of the public 'for mugs'
The force at the centre of the Rotherham abuse scandal has been branded "incompetent" after it released incorrect figures on its own work.
South Yorkshire Police said a "clerical error" meant it gave the BBC the wrong data on charges brought for child sexual exploitation (CSE) offences.
It put out a correction on the day Lib Dem Lord Scriven raised the issue in the House of Lords.
The force said it acted "as soon as the error came to light".
'Ridiculous excuse'
In its earlier response, South Yorkshire Police said it had charged one person for every 16 CSE complaints, compared to an average across nine other forces of one in five.
But, the revised figures said, of 681 CSE complaints, the force had charged 177 people and summonsed a further 22 to court - making an average of one charge for every 3.4 complaints between January 2013 and January 2015.
Lord Scriven said: "I find it all rather strange that on the day they know I am to ask a question in the House, they find a clerical error.
"If you take the weak and ridiculous excuse of human error on the original figures, the low conviction figures along with the reports so far done on South Yorkshire Police on CSE, incompetence is the most charitable word you could use for their lamentable progress so far.
"This footwork over figures by South Yorkshire Police just reinforces my view they are incompetent and the Chief Constable needs to go."
The force did not dispute separate Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) figures which showed child abuse prosecutions in South Yorkshire were a fraction of those brought by police in London, Greater Manchester, the West Midlands, Thames Valley and Hampshire.
The Jay report of August 2014 previously revealed at least 1,400 children were subjected to appalling sexual exploitation in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013.
It revealed "blatant" collective failures by the council's leadership, senior managers had "underplayed" the scale of the problem and South Yorkshire Police had failed to prioritise the issue.
Police watchdog Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary found in July the force still needed to make "major improvements" to some child protection procedures.
South Yorkshire Police said tackling CSE was a "priority" and it was committed to building on its progress.
"We have a dedicated multi-agency team established in each district, which focus on CSE to prevent offences, to protect vulnerable children, and to hold offenders to account," said the force.
The Avenue Recording Company to vacate current location by March 31
It's a sad day for Saskatoon's musicians.
The Avenue Recording Company has long been a fixture of the city's music scene. Located above Amigos Cantina just off of Broadway, the studio was responsible for recording countless local albums. Seriously, it's probably easier to list off the local bands that DIDN'T record here.
Yesterday, the owners of the studio announced that the space would be closing via their Facebook page.
Well everybody,
It is with great sadness that we have to announce the studio will be closing. Due to the landlords choosing not to renew our lease we will have to be all torn out of our current location by March 31st.
We are not gone yet though. We want to go out with a bang and work with as many of you great Saskatoon musicians as possible in the next 2 months. So for those of you who we haven't worked with yet, or would love to work with again, let's make some magic.
UPDATE: Jordan Smith, one of the owners of the studio, says he does not plan on relocating.
Lots of feels for this one. My own band had recorded an album there last year. Lots of mid-afternoon beers, arguments, loud buzzy amps, sweaty headphone ears, sitting on an exercise ball, more arguments, weird jokes and total rock and roll magic.
Ominocity would like to wish a heartfelt thank you to everyone at The Avenue Recording Company for your contribution to making Saskatoon a little more tolerable and the best of luck in your future endeavours.

First they went New World with higher education and now this. Haven't we seen these abstinence-only programs fail time after time? If they can hold their coalition together long enough, they may completely out flank the Teabaggers on the right and become the gold standard for modern right wing extremism. The Guardian:
A group which is opposed to abortion in all circumstances and favours an abstinence-based approach to sex education has been appointed to advise the government on sexual health.
The Life organisation has been invited to join a new sexual health forum set up to replace the Independent Advisory Group on Sexual Health and HIV.
Stuart Cowie, Life's head of education, said: “We are delighted to be invited into the group, representing views that have not always been around on similar tables in the past.”
TV3 has put its Garda-themed soap opera Red Rock into a production hiatus.
The makers are currently completing the next batch of 23 episodes, which now won't be shown until 2018, and the drama will then cease filming for the time being.
The production is obliged to shortly vacate its set at the old Player Wills cigarette factory site in Dublin, as its lease is coming to an end and the site has been earmarked for redevelopment.
Cast and crew were informed of the move by producers today.
TV3 indicated it was exploring potential new sites for filming the drama, including the possibility of building a set adjacent to its premises at Ballymount in Dublin. However, it is unable to confirm at this stage that more episodes will be made.
TV3 director of programming Bill Malone said a decision about its future would be taken in early 2018.
Although Red Rock is “a great show” that “ticks a lot of boxes for TV3”, its return depends upon the ratings performance of the filmed episodes, TV3's broader schedule needs and the need for the group to “cut its cloth” to suit the current television market.
“There are a lot of factors that determine why a show is or isn't recommissioned,” Mr Malone said.
New season
Red Rock will stay off air over the next few months, having originally been scheduled to return to screens in September as part of TV3's new season of programming, which it launches next Wednesday.
The broadcaster has invested €11 million to date in Red Rock, which is made by Element Pictures, run by Ed Guiney and Andrew Lowe, and Angel Station, a company run by former EastEnders producer John Yorke.
Created by Peter McKenna, it is Ireland's most successful television export thanks to deals with Amazon Prime and the BBC, where it airs in a summer lunchtime slot and has won audiences of more than a million.
Audience ratings in the Irish market are modest, especially when compared with RTÉ's Fair City, and have shown little sign of momentum, but the soap often reaches more than 200,000 people a week and has performed well on-demand.
While these factors largely point in favour of a resurrection at a new filming location, TV3 Group has undergone major changes since the soap was first developed, changing its relationship with the programme.
Red Rock first aired in January 2015, at a time when TV3 had lost UK soap operas Coronation Street and Emmerdale to its then rival UTV Ireland.
But in late 2016, those soaps returned to TV3 following parent company Virgin Media Ireland's acquisition of UTV Ireland. TV3 has also since sought to develop a wider drama slate, commissioning a new six-part series for 2018 called Darklands and a second series of Smalltown.
The broadcaster last autumn switched the format of Red Rock from two 22-minute episodes a week to a single 44-minute episode, which including ad breaks filled an hour-long slot on the channel on Monday nights.
The show then took an unexpected “mid-season break” last November, while its future was debated. This meant it was noticeably still Christmas in the fictional Dublin suburb in the episodes that aired this spring.
TV3 has been aware since the start of the production that it would eventually have to vacate its current set, where the most commonly used exterior is of the Red Rock Garda station.
Final episode
It is expected that the final episode to be filmed this year before the production shuts down will depict the closure, either temporary or permanent, of the Garda station, although it is understood that the producers do not plan a major, cast-decimating stunt such as the notorious Emmerdale plane crash.
In its three-year history, the Ifta award-winning Red Rock has tackled storylines such as grooming and statutory rape, Garda corruption, gang violence and drug addiction.
Alongside regular moments of comedy and light relief, there have been two births, several murders and even more cliffhangers.
In 2015, former TV3 Group chief executive David McRedmond called the launch of the soap “the most important thing that TV3 has ever done”. It is said to have created employment for about 100 people, although the nature of the industry means this number would not have related to full-time positions.
The Thing is a so-called resonant cavity microphone, consisting of a resonant cavity, combined with a condenser microphone. The diagram below shows an 'educated guess' of the construction of The Thing, based on various reports and publications. The device consists of a copper cylinder with a highly polished silver-plated interior, that acts as a high-Q resonant cavity of the reentrant type. At the center is an adjustable mushroom-shaped disc with a flat surface, acting as a capacitor in combination with a very thin 75µm membrane that closes the open end. An antenna enters the cavity through an insulated hole in the side of the cylinder and is capacitively coupled.
The cavity has a diameter of 19.7 mm and is 17.5 mm long. The antenna is ~22.8 cm long (9"). The membrane, or diafragm, at the front of the cylinder is just 75 micrometers thick (3 mil). The tuning post can be adjusted to increase or decrease the capacity of the mushroom. The flat face of the mushroom has machined grooves to reduce the pneumatic damping 1 of the diafragm. According to one report [24], the distance between the mushroom and the diafragm was 230µm.
The dimensions of the cavity are carefully chosen so that it is resonant at a very high frequency (e.g. 1320 MHz). It is then illuminated, or exited, by a strong signal from the outside, as shown in the illustration below. Any sound in the room (speech) causes the membrane to vibrate, which decreases and increases the space inside the cavity and also the capacity between the membrane and the mushroom. As a result, the bug produces a combination of Amplitude Modulation (AM) and Frequency Modulation (FM). In practice, only the AM component was used by the Russians.
It is currently unclear what the illumination frequency was. In the original investigation reports, it is suggested that the illumination frequency was the same as the resonance frequency (i.e. the output). Although this poses technical restrictions, such as overloading of the receiver, it is the most likely scenario. Receiver overloading can be solved by using directional antennas (e.g. helical antennas) and by mixing part of the transmitted signal with the input of the receiver, in order to cancel-out the excess signal. The block diagrams below give some useful suggestions.
The antenna problem can be solved effectively, by adding a 3-port circulator between the transmitter and the receiver, as illustrated in the diagram below. The circulator ensures that all transmission power is passed to the antenna and that returned energy is passed to the receiver.
In theory, it would also be possible to use a sub-harmonic of the resonance frequency as the illumination signal. Such sub-harmonics are often easier to generate at high power, and cause far less interference between transmitter and receiver. Take for example 440 MHz, which is 1/3 of the resonance frequency of our example above. 2 In that case, the cavity is used as a tripler.
However, in order for the cavity to generate the 3rd harmonic of the exitation frequency, it must have non­linear properties, such as thin oxidized layers between contacts, similar to a semi­conductor (diode), or loose contacts, in which case the cavity acts as a contact generator. In the given situation, this effect is arbitrary however, and its behaviour would be difficult to predict and to reproduce. It is therefore unlikely that the Russian resonant cavity was used as a multiplier.
This year is shaping up to be a big one for the Westside. Two more transformative projects could soon be on the way on Howell Mill Road, just south of Westside Provisions District.
According to What Now Atlanta, developer Allen Morris is planning two refreshingly unique Westside buildings. The designs might not win universal applause, but they certainly make the cookie-cutter, mixed-use mushrooms sprouting across Atlanta seem uninspired.
The first project, located on the west side of Howell Mill Road, would bring 407 residential units and retail space to three acres behind Northside Tavern. Standing nine stories, the building — designed by Oppenheim Architecture + Design and Dwell Design Studio — is slated to feature luxury amenities that include a yoga studio, lounge, pool bar, outdoor kitchen, community garden, and deck with views of Downtown, Midtown, and Buckhead.
Across the street, on the site of eyesore Star Metals, the developer plans a glassy mixed-use project. Featuring a mix to include offices, apartments, restaurants, and (hopefully) a grocery store, the terraced building would be a distinctive compliment to its neighbor. And with an estimated price tag of $210 million, a major investment in a booming area.
DETROIT (WWJ) – Who is Joumana Kayrouz?
She's the personal injury attorney with the long blonde hair, whose face is bigger than life on hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of buses and billboards around town.
If you've driven anywhere in the city of Detroit, you've seen her: The hair. The lips.
But is there more to Kayrouz than meets the eye?
She says, “I am the American dream. You're looking at it,” … and she means it.
Kayrouz came to this country 27 years ago from Lebanon with her husband. They had $1,000 in their pockets. Period.
She earned a degree from Yale University and then went on to graduate from Wayne State University Law School.
Kayrouz speaks several different languages and she now runs the second largest personal injury law firm in Michigan.
“I want to continue to break barriers, as a woman. I want to inspire other women,” she said.
Kayrouz is Catholic, and is deeply spiritual. “Being a lawyer is a calling. I want every person who meets me to see God on my face today. I want to do His work. I want to serve,” she said.
Kayrouz describes herself as a hardworking single mom, a dog lover, and a very ordinary person.
And what does she think about those bus pictures?
“I don't really like looking at myself on the buses and the billboards. I'm like, eeewww!”
PEP 492 and PEP 525 introduce support for native coroutines and asynchronous generators using async / await syntax. This PEP proposes to add asynchronous versions of list, set, dict comprehensions and generator expressions.
Python has extensive support for synchronous comprehensions, allowing to produce lists, dicts, and sets with a simple and concise syntax. We propose implementing similar syntactic constructions for the asynchronous code.
To illustrate the readability improvement, consider the following example:
result = [] async for i in aiter(): if i % 2: result.append(i)
With the proposed asynchronous comprehensions syntax, the above code becomes as short as:
result = [i async for i in aiter() if i % 2]
The PEP also makes it possible to use to await expressions in all kinds of comprehensions:
result = [await fun() for fun in funcs]
Chemnitzer Linux-Tage was this year again a great event. The mainly german speaking visitors enjoyed a well organised fair of mixed open source community and business booths, talks and workshops.
On the Oyranos project booth discussed old friends various colour management topics and concepts. We felt that colour management terms and concepts inside the open source community are behind the awareness of other comparable graphic techniques like for instance font rendering. The more I find it amazing, that there is a core of users, which try hard to understand ICC techniques.
One topic with neighboring openSUSE people was of course the strong rose awareness around colour management during the recent discussions on the KDE core-devel list. What I found encouraging is, many people inside the KDE community see it important to collaborate. And so I think we in the OpenICC community should accelerate on our formal recommendation efforts for sharing colour data and configurations. An other related point was made, that it would be not helpful to stall projects in a too long wait for constructive discussions to come to live. I tried this sometimes and see now that balance between discussion and start for actual work could be improved. Good to get so much feedback about OpenICC core stuff in great face to face discussions.
With openSUSE'es Tom I discussed his improvements on the new open build service (OBS) search page layout, which is a great ongoing work. But much to my surprise he could point me to a nice and long wanted OBS feature, which I now integrated into the Oyranos download pages. That is, OBS provides embeddable download instructions for each distribution package of a project. These easy instructions show end users, how to install the desired software including all dependencies from OBS. Thanks for this valuable hint, which makes our colour management packages in OBS much more accessible to our users.
Looking around I found the mageia distribution interesting and would find it great to see this distribution integrated into OBS once a successful version 2 comes out this spring. But of course there are other interesting distributions out there to integrate into OBS. One advantage of OBS for me as a maintainer is as well, that I can test my packages prior to release in one go.
On the FFmpeg booth we discussed the idea that 3D lookup textures are a very simple way of exchanging colour transforms. I will surely look deeper into this and want to find a useful format to exchange 3D shader data for OpenGL textures. In CompICC a 16-bit PPM image helped for debugging. Lets see if we can find a more common and useful format to reuse.
Our collective understanding of the framers' view of the appropriate relationship between religion and government has been clouded by the divisive nature of contemporary politics. On one side are those who say history counsels against any governmental acknowledgement of religion. Challenging them are those arguing that the same history endorses governmental assistance and support for a wide range of religious activities.
Fortunately, we are not restricted to such simplistic choices. The framers were capable of sophisticated thinking, and they approached this issue with far more nuance and subtlety than is generally appreciated.
The framers saw religion as both a force for magnificent good and unspeakable evil. John Adams wrote to Thomas Jefferson after both had left the White House, "Twenty times, in the course of my late reading, have I been on the point of breaking out, 'this would be the best of all possible worlds, if there was no religion in it!!!'" But, Adams quickly added, he feared that, "Without religion, this world would be something not fit to be mentioned in polite company -- I mean hell."
Those who founded our nation feared divisiveness, sectarian violence and intolerance, yet they also believed that religion could help unify a diverse nation. The general understanding they developed can be traced to three distinct strands.
The first can be considered a philosophical justification, that government must not invade sanctity of human intellect. For Jefferson, the fight to prevent religious establishments was based on his "eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man."
The second strand might be called a political rationale. George Washington, as head of the Continental Army, realized that great sensitivity to religious differences was essential to avoid, "the smallest uneasiness & jealousy among the Troops." As president, he wrote: "Religious controversies are always productive of more acrimony and irreconcilable hatreds than those which spring from any other cause."
Lastly, many supporters of religious freedom were motivated by religious concerns. A leading exemplar is John Leland, a Baptist minister who was instrumental in James Madison's election to the Virginia Ratifying Convention and one of the most important advocates for amending the Constitution to protect religious freedom. Leland would preach that the biblical admonition "My kingdom is not of this world" meant that "religion, in all its parts, is distinct from civil government." He argued that the "Government should be so fixed, that Pagans, Turks, Jews and Christians, should be equally protected in their rights."
These approaches combined to produce a national consensus. It was widely accepted that American citizens were to have absolute "freedom of conscience." As George Washington wrote during the Revolutionary War, "While we are contending for our own liberty, we should be very cautious not to violate the rights of conscience in others, ever considering that God alone is the judge of the hearts of men, and to him only in this case they are answerable."
Next, the federal government was prohibited from regulating or funding religious activities. In 1811, Madison vetoed a bill granting land to a church which had accidently erected a building on federal property. Madison declared that this grant would violate the Constitution by setting a "precedent for the appropriation of funds of the United States for the use and support of religious societies."
The framing generation also disapproved of governmental speech that favored a particular denomination. John Adams, the only one of the first four presidents to use explicitly Christian language in his speeches, was also the only one who was not reelected. His 1799 thanksgiving proclamation had implored, "through the grace of His Holy Spirit we may be disposed and enabled to yield a more suitable obedience to His righteous requisitions." In a letter written after his retirement, Adams belatedly recognized, "Nothing is more dreaded than the national government meddling with religion."
Yet, this distinction between religion and government was not understood to cleanse all religious references from political speech. As presidents, Madison, Jefferson and Washington all employed sincere religious language in their inaugurals. Madison, for example, gave his pious supplication to "the guardianship and guidance of that Almighty Being whose power regulates the destiny of nations."
To the framers, phrases like "Almighty being," "Creator," "holy author of our religion," and even "Almighty God," were expansive enough to permit each individual to join in the experience of a conscientious communion with the rest of their nation. As Jefferson wrote, such language demonstrates an intent to include, "the Jew and the Gentile, the Christian and Mahometan, the Hindoo, and infidel of every denomination." One is free to disagree, of course, but the framers' goal was to communicate to all, including the Deistic, agnostic, and atheistic, that they were fully valued members of the political community.
The Framers Top Ten: Essential Writings on Religious Freedom
The story of the development of religious freedom in America is not the simple narrative conveyed by contemporary political partisans. There is prejudice as well as acceptance, clarity followed by frustrating ambiguity and moments of courage mixed with political expediency. The following, in chronological order, are 10 of the most important statements from the founding generation concerning religious freedom. They begin with the anti-Catholic prejudice of the Continental Congress and continue through the attempts of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison to create a society that can truly foster true liberty of conscience.

When this campaign is over, let's not forget Donald Trump's steady use of anti-Semitic stereotypes and images throughout the campaign—ideas we can expect he'll continue to use when the election is over and he tries to re-invent himself as the leader of a white supremacist nationalist movement and the public face of a new media empire (Trump TV?) with his supporters Roger Ailes (former head of Fox News who has a history of making anti-Semitic comments and was responsible for Fox News' anti-Semitic crusade against the phony "war on Christmas"), Stephen Bannon (head of Breitbart News known for his own anti-Semitic remarks), and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer (the money behind Breitbart News).

Trump's anti-Semitism comes in different shapes and sizes. He verbalizes it, encourages it, enables it, tolerates it, and makes excuses for it. What he doesn't do is condemn it.
Trump's most recent anti-Semitic remarks were in a speech, and a tweet, last week that included this line: "Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers, her special interest friends and her donors." Trump didn't need to use the word "Jew." The imagery of a global banking cabal will be familiar to anyone who has read The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, the anti-Semitic forgery that has fueled anti-Jewish violence for over a century. These are well-known anti-Semitic code words. The speech, typical of Trump's paranoid conspiracy theories, was designed to fire up Trump's white nationalist, anti-Semitic base.
Trump's chronic anti-Semitism is often overlooked when reporters and others itemize the long laundry list of the GOP candidate's bigotry and offensive comments, including sexism, racism, and insults directed toward Muslims and the physically disabled. Trump has often retweeted messages from white supremacists and anti-Semites, including the image of Clinton with a Jewish star and $100 bills in the background and the headline "Most Corrupt Candidate Ever."
In response to Trump's repeated claim about the election being rigged, the popular right-wing site Daily Stormer wrote that "People aren't going to quietly go home if the Jews steal this election from us." Other sites supporting Trump have posted similar slurs.
Anti-Semitic comments on social media have skyrocketed, because Trump is bringing these ugly stereotypes, once relegated to the lunatic fringe of the internet, into the mainstream. A new Anti-Defamation League uncovered more than 2.6 million tweets with anti-Semitic comments and images between August 2015 and July 2016, a huge upsurge from the previous year. Many of them identified themselves as Trump supporters or Clinton haters, and many (including death threats) were directed at Jewish journalists who had been critical of Trump.
Trump's comment about Clinton's ties to an international banking conspiracy was not an offhand remark. He has a history of making anti-Semitic remarks, including this comment in a speech during this campaign to the Republican Jewish Coalition (a tiny group): "I know why you're not going to support me. You're not going to support me because I don't want your money ...Look, I'm a negotiator like you folks, we're negotiators."

In an interview where he was asked if he'd read any of Hitler's speeches, Trump said: "If I had these speeches, and I am not saying that I do, I would never read them... My friend Marty Davis from Paramount gave me a copy of Mein Kampf, and he's a Jew." (Davis is not Jewish.)
Trump's frequent references at his rallies and during the debates to Sidney Blumenthal, George Soros and Debbie Wasserman-Schultz—Jewish supporters of Hillary Clinton—is no accident. This is not random name-dropping; these are dog whistles aimed at his racist and anti-Semitic supporters.
He once tweeted: "I promise you that I'm much smarter than Jonathan Leibowitz—I mean Jon Stewart @TheDailyShow. Who, by the way, is totally overrated." While Stewart has often referred to himself as Jewish, only an anti-Semite would refer to Stewart's Jewish-sounding real name in this way.
Earlier this year Trump initially refused to condemn and reject support from former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, the well-known racist and anti-Semite.

One of Trump's foreign policy advisers, Joseph Schmitz, is accused of bragging that he pushed out Jewish employees when he was Defense Department inspector general a decade ago. He also made comments denying the magnitude of the Holocaust.
When accused of fostering anti-Semitism, Trump often reminds people that his daughter Ivanka is married to a Jew (Jared Kushner) and converted to Judaism. But even members of Kushner's family have expressed their concern about his excuses for Trump's ugly remarks.
In most presidential election over the past 50 years, about 70-80 percent of Jews typically vote for the Democratic candidate, higher than any demographic group except African Americans. Don't be surprised if this year 85-90% of Jews vote for Hillary Clinton.

The likely uptick in Jewish voting for this year's Democratic candidate is due as much to Jews' overall liberal views on abortion and women's rights, environmental and economic policy, and opposition to Trump's ugly comments about Muslims and others than to their concerns about his repugant anti-Semitism. But Trump's anti-Semitic remarks surely compounded their opposition to the Republican demagogue.
House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell initially ignored Trump's anti-Hillary Jewish star tweet last July until they were embarrassed into denouncing it. But most Republican leaders have not condemned Trump's persistent anti-Semitism or the upsurge of Jew hatred he has encouraged.
A handful of Jews still support Trump, including Steve Mnuchin, who is a Wall Street banker and hedge fund billionaire as well as Trump's finance chair, and Sheldon Adelson, a billionaire casino owner and GOP mega-donor whose newspaper, the Las Vegas Review Journal endorsed Trump this week. When will they come to their senses?

Cartoons have been a highly visible and influential part of American popular culture. From Thomas Nast's political satirical drawings in the late l9th century to the oft-mimicked 20th century image of Charles Dana Gibson's “Gibson Girl” and John Held's famous flappers, social and political statements were made that influenced our culture.
Probably the most interesting cartoonist and social commentator of his era was Thomas Aloyius Dorgan, known to all as “Tad,” a nickname he took from the first, middle and last initials of his name. A Bayside resident for many years, he was born in San Francisco in 1877 and moved to New York in 1905 to work for William Randolph Hearst at the New York Journal. Ten years later he was sharing a desk with Damon Runyon, who was to become a lifelong friend. Nearby worked another young artist, George Hermann, who was developing a cartoon called “Krazy Rat.” Ring Lardner also was a feature writer in that same office, and all appeared each Sunday in Hearst's “City Life and Drama, Editorial Section.”
As a sports writer and newspaper columnist, Dorgan influenced the vernacular of the flapper and “hip flask” era early in the last century. His columns and cartoons helped establish a permanent place for slang expressions in the American language.
Dorgan's skillful cartooning was recognized country-wide, a craft in which he excelled despite a handicap caused by an accident early in life which left him with only a thumb and forefinger on his right hand.
Before coming to New York he had been an established newspaper cartoonist for the San Francisco Bulletin. His boyhood friend from those San Francisco days was boxer “Gentleman” Jim Corbett, who beat John Sullivan for the title in 1892 after 21 rounds. Corbett also was to make his home in Bayside near 35th Avenue and 221st Street.
Among the expressions coined by Dorgan were: “23 skidoo,” “Yes, we have no bananas,” “dumb bell,” “Dumb Dora,” “cake-eater” and “drugstore cowboy.” When the Flatiron Building in Manhattan was built on 23rd Street, there were wind currents created that blew up the ladies' skirts as they alighted the street cars and apparently many young men came to view the sight. The police would rout them off the streets by shouting “skidoo,” meaning, get lost, thus the expression came to be “23 skidoo.”
Tad, his friends reported, had a penchant for nicknames. He also liked to take shortcuts in his writing, often cutting out superfluous “a's” and “the's.” He coined the expression, “hard-boiled egg,” and it became tagged to Runyon. He also enjoyed calling his mother “Flynn,” referring to her Irish origins.
A writer and cartoonist, he often startled his readers and critics by displaying an amazing literary style, though it always was couched in a humorous vein. Many of the slang expressions Tad originated or made famous through his work became part of our language. Two songwriters who picked up on “Yes, we have no bananas,” made a great deal of money from that phrase. Dorgan also is known for adding to our vocabulary “indoor sports” and “outdoor sports.”
There are conflicting stories about the origin of “hot dog,” and though Dorgan often is credited with the name, there still remains much debate. The sausage we know of today began over 900 years ago and had its origin in Frankfurt, Germany, and sometimes was known as a “frankfurter.” Because of its shape it also was known as a “dachshund sausage,” and first was served on a bun in the United States in the 1880s. Frankfurters also were called “franks,” “red hots” and “wieners.” In 1906, Dorgan was in the press box at a baseball game and heard the cry, “get your red-hot dachshund sausage.” It was then, it is claimed, that he was inspired to coin the phrase, “hot dog.”
Dorgan wrote a column about happenings in Bayside called, “Toby Types,” which will be discussed in this column at a later date. He knew the townspeople well and spoke fondly of them. His son, I believe, was a student at Bayside High School in the late 1930s.
Thomas Aloysius Dorgan died in 1929 and on May 2 of that year, Runyon wrote a tribute: “The music has stopped. Tad is dead. Ray of sunshine has been turned to shadow. A peal of joyous laughter has been suddenly hushed.” The entire piece was republished 58 years later in 1987.
Tad Dorgan is buried in Cypress Hills Cemetery around the corner from his boyhood friend, Corbett.

In what amounts to a declaration of war on the Roberts Supreme Court, Senate Democrats said Wednesday that they will force a vote this year on a constitutional amendment to overturn several landmark First Amendment campaign finance rulings and give Congress explicit powers to set donation and spending limits for all federal campaigns.
Sen. Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat driving the effort, said the justices have taken the First Amendment too far and need to be reeled in by Congress.
He said he had the blessing of fellow Democratic leaders to bring the amendment to the floor for a vote “rather soon.” They acknowledged that they have little hope of succeeding but said the vote was a way to send a message to the justices.
“The First Amendment is not absolute,” Mr. Schumer said. “The only way that we can save American democracy, so that people still believe it's one person, one vote and there's a semblance of fairness, is a constitutional amendment.”
The move kicks off a fundamental debate over free speech, the limits of congressional powers and the nature of political campaigns.
Opponents said they were shocked that Democrats would attempt to amend the Constitution to limit something that the Supreme Court has called a fundamental right and that the move was another way to try to insulate lawmakers from having to hear from voters.
“Campaign finance reform restrictions are always pitched as ‘Let's prevent corruption, let's hold politicians accountable,' and they do exactly the opposite,” said Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas Republican. “Every single restriction this body puts in place is designed to do one thing — protect incumbent politicians.”
Campaign finance has been a touchy issue for decades but has taken on a more pointed tone in recent years.
In his 2010 State of the Union address, President Obama scolded the justices, sitting directly in front of him in the House chamber, for their Citizens United decision issued just days earlier.
In that case, a divided Supreme Court ruled that interest groups could raise and spend money freely to run ads defending their positions in elections. That struck down key parts of the campaign finance laws Congress enacted, including parts of the 2002 McCain-Feingold campaign finance law.
Democrats argue that the court has unleashed a spree of big-spending billionaires intent on distorting democracy. On Wednesday, they again singled out the Koch brothers, who support conservative causes.
But the Supreme Court has ruled that campaign spending is free speech and thus entitled to strong First Amendment protections, particularly in cases in which members of Congress disagree with what is being said.
“Money in politics may at times seem repugnant to some, but so too does much of what the First Amendment vigorously protects,” Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said in his majority opinion in this year's McCutcheon v. FEC case. “If the First Amendment protects flag burning, funeral protests, and Nazi parades — despite the profound offense such spectacles cause — it surely protects political campaign speech despite popular opposition.”
One of Chief Justice Roberts' former colleagues, retired Justice John Paul Stevens, testified to the Senate on Wednesday that the court has it wrong. He said that when elections are at stake, Congress should be allowed to impose a level playing field for all candidates.
“While money is used to finance speech, money is not speech,” he told the Senate Rules and Administration Committee.
Democrats' amendment, sponsored by Sen. Tom Udall, New Mexico Democrat, would overturn the landmark 1976 Buckley v. Valeo case that set the outlines of modern campaign finance jurisprudence, as well as the Citizens United decision and the McCutcheon ruling from just a few weeks ago that overturned limits that prevented individuals from giving to as many campaigns as they want.
The amendment would give Congress explicit powers to put a total limit on how many campaigns could raise or spend, and how many outsiders could spend to support or oppose federal candidates. It also would allow states to impose their own restrictions.
Mr. Udall's amendment specifically says it wouldn't infringe on freedom of the press.
But Mr. Cruz said that raised all sorts of thorny questions.
“Why does a corporation like The New York Times or CBS or any other media corporation … enjoy greater First Amendment rights than individual citizens?” Mr. Cruz said.
Amending the Constitution is difficult. It would take approval by two-thirds of each house of Congress — something that is unlikely in either chamber right now — and then would have to be ratified by three-fourths of the states.
In the wake of the Citizens United decision, Democrats tried but failed to get legislation allowing more disclosure through Congress. Those changes would have required only a majority vote, so the chances are dim for more powerful changes envisioned in the constitutional amendment.
The last amendment that was ratified was more than 40 years ago, when the 26th Amendment granted those 18 and older the right to vote.
A 27th Amendment, restricting Congress‘ ability to change its own salary, was ratified in 1992, but it was proposed as part of the original package in 1789 that became the Bill of Rights.

1. Myth #1: There were Irish slaves in the American colonies.
As historian and public librarian Liam Hogan has written: “There is unanimous agreement, based on overwhelming evidence, that the Irish were never subjected to perpetual, hereditary slavery in the colonies, based on notions of ‘race'.” The enduring myth of Irish slavery, which most often surfaces today in service of Irish nationalist and white supremacist causes, has roots in the 17th and 18th centuries, when Irish laborers were derogatorily called “white slaves.” The phrase would later be employed as propaganda by the slave-owning South about the industrialized North, along with (false) claims that life was far harder for immigrant factory workers than for slaves.
What's the truth? Large numbers of indentured servants did indeed emigrate from Ireland to the British colonies of North America, where they provided a cheap labor force for planters and merchants eager to exploit it. Though most crossed the Atlantic willingly, some Irish men and women—including criminals as well as simply the poor and vulnerable—were sentenced to indentured servitude in Ireland, and forcibly shipped to the colonies to carry out their sentences. But indentured servitude, by definition, came nowhere close to chattel slavery. For one thing, it was temporary; all but the most serious felons were freed at the end of their contracts. The colonial system also offered more lenient punishment for disobedient servants than slaves, and allowed servants to petition for early release if their masters mistreated them. Most importantly, servitude wasn't hereditary. Children of indentured servants were born free; slaves' children were the property of their owners.

2. Myth #2: The South seceded from the Union over the issue of states' rights, not slavery.
This myth, that the Civil War wasn't fundamentally a conflict over slavery, would have been a surprise to the original founders of the Confederacy. In the official declaration of the causes of their secession in December 1860, South Carolina's delegates cited “an increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the institution of slavery.” According to them, the Northern interference with the return of fugitive slaves was violating their constitutional obligations; they also complained that some states in New England tolerated abolitionist societies and allowed black men to vote.
As James W. Loewen, author of “Lies My Teacher Told Me” and “The Confederate and Neo-Confederate Reader,” wrote in the Washington Post: “In fact, Confederates opposed states' rights — that is, the right of Northern states not to support slavery.” The idea that the war was somehow not about slavery but about the issue of states' rights was perpetuated by later generations anxious to redefine their ancestors' sacrifices as a noble protection of the Southern way of life. At the time, however, Southerners had no problem claiming the protection of slavery as the cause of their break with the Union—and the Civil War that followed.
3. Myth #3: Only a small percentage of Southerners owned slaves.
Closely related to Myth #2, the idea that the vast majority of Confederate soldiers were men of modest means rather than large plantation owners is usually used to reinforce the contention that the South wouldn't have gone to war to protect slavery. The 1860 census shows that in the states that would soon secede from the Union, an average of more than 32 percent of white families owned slaves. Some states had far more slave owners (46 percent in South Carolina, 49 percent in Mississippi) while some had far less (20 percent in Arkansas).
But as Jamelle Bouie and Rebecca Onion point out in Slate, the percentages don't fully express the extent to which the antebellum South was a slave society, built on a foundation of slavery. Many of those white families who couldn't afford slaves aspired to, as a symbol of wealth and prosperity. In addition, the essential ideology of white supremacy that served as a rationale for slavery, made it extremely difficult—and terrifying—for white Southerners to imagine life alongside a black majority population that was not in bondage. In this way, many non-slave-owning Confederates went to war to protect not only slavery, but to preserve the foundation of the only way of life they knew.
4. Myth #4: The Union went to war to end slavery.
On the Northern side, the rose-colored myth of the Civil War is that the blue-clad Union soldiers and their brave, doomed leader, Abraham Lincoln, were fighting to free the slaves. They weren't, at least not initially; they were fighting to hold the nation together. Lincoln was known to personally oppose slavery (which is why the South seceded after his election in 1860), but his chief goal was preserving the Union. In August 1862, he famously wrote to the New York Tribune: “If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves, I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that.”
The slaves themselves helped make the case for emancipation as a military aim, fleeing in droves beyond the lines of approaching Union armies. Early in the conflict, some of Lincoln's generals helped the president understand that sending these men and women back to bondage could only help the Confederate cause. By the fall of 1862, Lincoln had become convinced that acting to end slavery was a necessary step. A month after his letter to Greeley, Lincoln announced the Emancipation Proclamation, which would take effect in January 1863. A more practical wartime measure than a true liberation, it proclaimed free all slaves in the rebel states, but not those in the border slavery states, which Lincoln needed to remain loyal to the Union.
5. Myth #5: Black soldiers—slave and free—fought for the Confederacy.
This argument, a staple among those seeking to redefine the conflict as an abstract battle overstates' rights rather than a fight to preserve slavery, does not hold up. White officers in the Confederacy did indeed bring slaves to the front during the Civil War, where they cooked, cleaned and performed other labors for the officers and their regiments. But there's no evidence to suggest that significant numbers of black soldiers fought under the Confederate banner against Union soldiers.
In fact, until March 1865, Confederate Army policy specifically prohibited blacks from serving as soldiers. Some Confederate officers wanted to enlist slaves earlier: Gen. Patrick Cleburne proposed enlisting African-American soldiers early in 1864, but Jefferson Davis rejected the suggestion and ordered it never to be discussed again. Finally, in the last weeks of the conflict, the Confederate government gave in to Gen. Robert E. Lee's desperate plea for more men, allowing slaves to enlist in exchange for some kind of post-war freedom. A small number signed up for training, but there's no evidence they saw action before the war's end.

If you've been paying attention to custom motorcycles for more than fifteen minutes you'll be aware of Yamaha's evergreen SR400. In the west its dominance of the scene is a relatively recent phenomenon, but custom builders in Japan people have been doing it for decades. One of these shops is Heiwa motorcycles, who've re-birthed this tidy little SR400 bobber.
I say re-birthed because this bike was actually completed years ago. But in a story familiar to many the bike that had undergone hundreds of hours of work was thrown down the road and was in dire need of repairs. So including the initial build, the (limited) time spent on the road and then it's final horizontal tango and then rebuild means this bike has being worked on the last five years.
Now the majority of the work Heiwa does is on Japanese staples like the W650 and Honda Rebels. But clicking through their website shows plenty of SR400's in a similar vein to this one. It's easy to become desensitised to them, but there's quite a bike of work going on here – and some of it particularly difficult and expensive due to the Japanese market. But more on that later.
In the meantime the engine has had a fresher up – and the 400cc SOHC engine has been been taken to 526cc's. With the SR that means a change in flywheel to the old 500cc model and a high compression piston. It also runs a lumpy cam and a gorgeous Keihin FCR41mm flat slide carburetor. It's a combination that's time eternal in Nipon, like sake and karaage chicken or vending machines that sell used women's underwear.
But outside of that the SR's modifications are easier to spot. The engine itself has larger fins welded on and and painted barrel, head and sidecovers and runs a free flowing exhaust. The frame has been chopped and the aftermarket fender and tank sports a green sunburst finish – complete with 007 inspired graphics – as it's the 7th SR the team has built.
The controls are a favourite setup of the guys at Heiwa, as Kengo Kimura explains. ‘We wanted a clean look across the handlebars and to do that I needed to get rid of the decompression level. So we rerouted everything and made it a food decompression. I haven't seen that method done yet!' Helping this along is a neat little switchblock from Posh.
One interesting thing to note with this SR is that it runs a very unusual wheelset for the Japanese market. The mag wheel ‘boat anchors' derided by so many in the west are a very hot item in Japan and change hands at ridiculous sums of money. If I had a dollar for every set I've been offered and turned down…
…Well, I could probably afford an SR like this. Bobber SR400's are frequently overlooked by the custom scene who opt for bigger displacement American v-twins. But there's something about a little single beastie like this that looks just right to me. They're light, nimble little things that, after some engine work, would be a blast to ride.

Eddie Jones named new Stormers coach share this
Cape Town - Decorated international rugby coach, Eddie Jones, will take over the role as head coach of the Stormers at the start of the 2016 Super Rugby season.
The former Wallabies head coach and 2007 World Cup-winning Springbok technical advisor will assume the Stormers coaching reins from Allister Coetzee, who moved to Japan after the Stormers' SA Conference-winning 2015 Super Rugby campaign.
“Our Director of Rugby, Gert Smal, always promised that he would deliver the best and in Eddie Jones I am more than satisfied that we have appointed the best coach to take over the reins of the Stormers,” said WPRFU President, Thelo Wakefield.
“Eddie is no stranger to South African rugby and we look forward to making him feel welcome and ensuring that he brings more silverware to Newlands.”
Having guided the Brumbies to Super Rugby success back in 2001, Jones coached the Wallabies between 2001 and 2005 - delivering Tri-Nations and Bledisloe Cup success, as well as taking them to the 2003 Rugby World Cup Final on home soil.
The 55-year-old will best be remembered by South African fans for his role in the Springboks' 2007 Rugby World Cup triumph, whilst he has also previously held coaching roles with the Reds (in Australia), English club Saracens and Japanese outfit, Suntory Sungoliath.
And just this weekend, Jones gave the rugby world a reminder of his abilities and tactical appreciation by guiding Japan to a shock 34-32 win over the Springboks in 2015 Rugby World Cup action in Brighton.
Speaking about Jones's appointment, Smal said: “As I said from the start (of our search for a coach), this has been a thorough process, which saw me look both internally and externally.
“Eddie was always on my mind in terms of potential external candidates and it's a massive coup that we have signed a coach of his ability - really, his coaching credentials and achievements do speak for themselves.
“I really enjoyed our interactions and working with Eddie during the 2007 World Cup, he can add even more value here - both in terms of pushing for trophies and, importantly, in helping the continued development of our coaches and players.”
Jones commented: “I am a coach that enjoys a challenge and I see this job as a huge challenge, but one that excites me tremendously.
“Having worked with the Springboks in 2007, and in the process working closely with people like Gert Smal, Allister Coetzee, Jean de Villiers and Schalk Burger, it gave me a brief taste of what Stormers rugby and Western Cape rugby is all about.
“I am well aware of the responsibilities that come with this job, one of the biggest franchise jobs in world rugby, but I am also excited about the talent available in the Stormers squad and the potential of this playing squad. This is a challenge I am looking forward to.”
Jones will arrive in Cape Town at the conclusion of his 2015 Rugby World Cup commitments with Japan's national team.
“We will get Eddie here as soon as we can after the Rugby World Cup, so he can get started with his 2016 preparations. He is obviously focusing on Japan's World Cup campaign at present, where he has already made a significant impact, but we look forward to welcoming him here as soon as he is able to get here,” said Smal.
Smal, meanwhile, also confirmed that Robbie Fleck (attack) and Paul Treu (defence) would remain in their respective Super Rugby roles, with a new senior forwards coach potentially on the union's shopping list ahead of 2016.
WP Rugby recently confirmed the signing of outstanding young Springbok lock Pieter-Steph du Toit, as well as the retention of four young Bok stars, Frans Malherbe, Eben Etzebeth, Siya Kolisi and Damian de Allende on long-term deals.
New signings Jano Vermaak (scrumhalf) and JP Smith (prop) are already part of WP's Currie Cup squad, whilst experienced loosehead prop JC Janse van Rensburg and Springbok speedster Cornal Hendricks will join WP Rugby ahead of the Stormers' 2016 Super Rugby season.
“Our new Currie Cup coaching team of John Dobson, Dawie Snyman, Paul Treu and Vlok Cilliers is working well together and Robbie Fleck has done very well in his new role as head coach of our Under-21 team. Having a guy like Eddie to learn from could only be a good thing for all of our coaches here at WP Rugby - from junior level upwards,” said Smal.
“Eddie's appointment, along with our new player acquisitions - with more signings to still be revealed, is a clear sign of our intentions to challenge for Super Rugby silverware and to continue with our success in local competitions, both at senior and junior level.”
AN UNLUCKY frog took a giant leap for mankind when it was (accidentally) launched towards space by a NASA rocket.
The frog's unfortunate journey was captured by one of NASA's cameras set up for the launch of the LADEE spacecraft at the Wallops/Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport in Virginia last Friday, Universe Today reports.
And yes, the photo is real.
Wallops spokesman Jeremy Eggers confirmed the picture was legitimate and was not altered in any way.
So how did a frog end up on a rocket launchpad? A likely explanation is that the frog was attracted by a pool of water that sits at the launchpad. The water protects the pad from damage during launches and suppresses noise.
NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) is now on its way to the moon, where it will gather information about the lunar atmosphere for the US space agency.
It's expected to arrive in about three weeks. But sadly, we're not sure the frog will be as lucky.
It's no wonder that young girls who don't look like any of these celebrities can grow up feeling ugly. They tell this to themselves when they don't find anyone they look like on TV - and they hear it from their peers, too.
When I was a teenager, I remember my well-meaning white girlfriends telling me: ‘Radhika, you're quite pretty for an Indian. If you were white, you'd be, like, seriously pretty.' It makes me feel a bit sick now, but at the time I genuinely took this as a compliment. If it wasn't for my skin colour, I thought, maybe I'd also be considered hot and boys would put me on their top 10 lists.
I was lucky; I got over it. As I became slightly older and slightly wiser, I recognised that what they were saying was utter rubbish. But not everyone is able to do that.
It's why I've been so appalled to read about the coverage of singer Lil' Kim and her new look.
Earlier this week, she posted an Instagram snap of six selfies where her skin looks lighter, her face shape slightly different and her hair blonde. Quite frankly, she looks like white (see main picture).

When Jamie Kuntz kissed his much-older boyfriend at a football game last September, the 18-year-old all-star had no idea it would set off a chain of events that would stir up a national media storm and throw his life into chaos.
Now, as Kuntz struggles to pick up the pieces, he finds himself out of the closet, out of school and out of football. But could the Midwesterner find a welcoming college team in Southern California, where one local football coach tells San Diego Gay & Lesbian News that he doesn't see why not.
First, a little background
Kuntz, a linebacker with the North Dakota State College of Science (NDSCS) Wildcats, had sustained a concussion while practicing with his team earlier in the week and was relegated to film duty when they traveled 930 miles to play against Snow College in Pueblo, Colo. on Sept. 1, 2012.
Because Kuntz would be in the stadium's press box filming game footage for his coaches instead of knocking helmets on the field, he had an opportunity to spend time with his boyfriend, a 65-year-old Denver resident who drove to Pueblo for the occasion. While alone in the box, Kuntz and his boyfriend made out a little, a spontaneous moment that was supposed to be private but was somehow seen by a teammate down on the field and later reported to head football coach Chuck Parsons.
After the game, with most of the team already seated on the bus ready for the long trip back to Wapheton, N.D., Parsons asked Kuntz to step off the bus so they could speak privately.
“Coach asked me ‘What happened in the press box?'” Kuntz told San Diego Gay and Lesbian News in an exclusive interview. “I just played dumb and said I didn't know what he was talking about. Then he asked me ‘Who was with you?'” Kuntz said he started getting nervous and then did what nearly any 18 year old 930 miles away from home would do. He lied. “I told him it was my grandpa.”
Kuntz said the lie came easy. “I didn't even think about it,” he said. “I've been living a lie for 18 years, so it came natural when someone asked something that even hinted at me being gay.”
The long ride home
Eventually Kuntz was allowed back on the bus for what had to be the longest ride of his life. About 16 hours later, once safely back in Wapheton, Kuntz came clean. He sent a text message to his coach stating that he had lied and admitting to the affair. Parsons ordered him to his office on Monday at 1 pm.
At the meeting, Kuntz was told he was no longer a member of the football team. Parsons justified his decision in a letter stating that the linebacker had become a distraction and lied to his coach. Kuntz pleaded to stay on the team but Parsons refused. With that, a player the coach wanted badly enough to give a scholarship had his Wildcats career ended before it began.
The media effect
Confused and shell-shocked, Kuntz decided to reach out to gay blogger Dan Savage to tell his story. He told the blogger that regardless of the lie, there was no doubt he was kicked off the team because he was gay. He would say other Wildcats players had also lied and still others had done much worse, yet they were all still on the team.
Savage ran with the story and it soon went viral, appearing on Huffington Post, Associated Press, FOX Sports and ESPN's “Outside the Lines.”
The resulting media attention required Coach Parsons defend his decision to the media. He explained matter-of-factly that Kuntz had lied and that was the reason he was removed from the team. Parsons didn't seem to care that Kuntz came clean voluntarily and less than 24 hours later. The coach also never seemed to consider whether the question was appropriate to ask in the first place, or how the teenager might feel answering it while 930 miles away from home.
The spotlight was so intense that college officials felt the need to defend the embattled Parsons and issue a statement by the school's president John Richman:
“All students and faculty must abide by college policies, and this one is very clear. Despite how this is being portrayed by some, Jamie's sexual orientation had nothing to do with his dismissal from the football team. NDSCS is a welcoming campus where individual differences are valued and respected.”
Coming out to mom
Before the story could break, though, Kuntz needed to call his mom. He had to tell her he was coming home, that he'd been kicked off the football team and that he was gay. He also had to tell her that he had a boyfriend who was 65 years old, and that they had met via the Internet.
What happened next is what doesn't happen every time a son comes out to his mother — she was contacted by the Associated Press.
Without a lot of time to process what was happening — the loss of her son's education and his dream of playing football, and the shock of his coming out — Rita Kuntz told AP she had accepted the news that her son is gay.
“I love Jamie and I'm proud of him,” she would tell the wire service, “but I know what the school did was wrong.” As far her son's relationship, she said the man 47 years her son's senior, was “taking advantage” of Jamie.
After the storm
When all the stories had been written and Kuntz's sexual orientation and relationship had disappeared from website landing pages, there was still a teenager, now 19, in small town Dickinson, N.D., who still loves his boyfriend and the game of football and desperately wants to get back on the field.
While he has tried to figure out the best way to do that, he has received support from several NFL personalities, most notably are outspoken Minnesota Vikings punter Chris Kluwe and Baltimore Ravens linebacker Brenden Ayanbadejo.
In defense of May-December relationships
He has also been criticized by some in the gay community who have called his relationship “sick” and “disgusting” on various blogs. He knows many people will or have read about him and stop when they find out his boyfriend is much older, never processing the rest of the story — how he was forced out of the closet and forced out of football.
Kuntz also fiercely guards his boyfriend's identity and privacy.
For his part, Kuntz is unapologetic.
“I really don't give a sh*t if people think I'm a freak,” he said, “because those people would most likely not say anything to us in person. Grow a pair! It's whatever. It's funny, though, how us ‘gays' are always saying ‘Love is Love' to the straight people who hate us, but then we turn on our own when we don't approve of the age? How can we expect homophobes to understand gay people, if gay people can't understand love? It baffles me.”
As for Rita Kuntz, Jamie says his mother has come around to accepting his relationship. “We sat down and talked about him,” he said. “We have cleared everything up. I mean, it's not every day your son comes out and says he has a 65-year-old boyfriend in the same day!”
Kuntz says he gets to see his boyfriend every couple of months and the two have known each other about a year.
Back to the field?
The linebacker, who is 6 feet tall and weighs 215 pounds, says he won't give up on his dream of playing football and while he doesn't know when or where he'll be putting on another uniform, he's spending long hours in the gym making sure he's ready.
“I love football,” he said. “Sometimes the early mornings and long running sessions in the afternoon are a drag, but it needs to be done. I will be in the best shape of my life when my time is called.”
Kuntz knows that his sexual orientation will most certainly be known to his new teammates and coaches, wherever and whomever they might be. There will be no hiding or secrets this time.
While that may be liberating, it may also be limiting. Certainly he won't be welcome back to the Wildcats of eastern North Dakota, but what about other cities?
Could Kuntz be coming to San Diego?
SDGLN contacted Mesa College head football coach Henry Browne to ask if a gay player would be welcome there. We shared a little about Kuntz's story and Coach Browne replied, “I can't imagine he would have that problem in a metropolitan area.”
When asked if Coach Browne had been told by some of his players that another player might be gay, would he feel the situation needed to be addressed, Coach Brown replied, “I have no idea why that would be a problem.”
Kuntz wants to play for a major college but needs to get some academic credits out of the way first. That said, a community college football team is on his radar and he has already reached out to some coaches in Southern California. He doesn't know what the impact of all the attention will be on his football career.
Last year's publicity might help by getting coaches interested in watching his Youtube highlight reel and deciding they need a fast, aggressive linebacker on their team. It might also cause coaches to shy away, worried that Kuntz might have residual baggage from the dust-up.
One thing's for sure. The effect so far has been profound. “I'm out, and I'm not playing football,” he said. “I just hope I can play again.”

Before the 2010 congressional elections, Rep. John Boehner (R-Ohio) and his fellow GOPers developed and implemented a simple campaign strategy: say “where are the jobs?” over and over and over. Even though the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office had declared thst President Barack Obama's stimulus package had created or saved about 3 million jobs and a recovery (albeit weak) was under way, the Republicans blamed Obama for screwing up the economy (not Wall Street or the Bush-Cheney administration). In politics, an attack doesn't have to be fair or accurate to work—and this one did.
Since then, have you heard Boehner screaming about jobs? No. He and his comrades have focused on one thing: cutting government spending, which will undoubtedly lead to job loss in the short run (if not the long run). Wait—that's not fair. They've also focused on abortion (with legislation that would make it harder for a woman who was raped to obtain federal assistance for an abortion), Planned Parenthood (with legislation that would defund the outfit), NPR (ditto), and American Muslims (with today's hearings on radicalization among Muslim Americans). There's not been much talk of jobs.
Consequently, this new poll from Bloomberg is hardly a surprise:
Americans say President Barack Obama lacks an effective strategy for improving the U.S. economy. They have much less confidence in the Republican vision for success. By a margin of 51 percent to 40 percent, a Bloomberg National Poll shows Americans say Obama lacks the right formula for long-term growth, a goal he presented in his State of the Union address with the phrase “win the future.” The Democratic president still does better than Republicans: When asked who has a better vision for the years ahead, 45 percent of poll respondents chose Obama and 33 percent picked the Republicans.
Four months ago, the GOPers shellacked the Democrats. They became the new kids on the block and claimed they were eager to refurnish their image with the American public. Yet once in power, they have reverted to their old ways—culture war and spending cuts. Meet the new boss, same as the…

The 60 NHL players will be trimmed down to one with the winner being announced in a dramatic unveiling of the EA SPORTS NHL 13 Cover Athlete at the 2012 NHL Awards on June 20 in Las Vegas.“(Malkin) deserves it too. He's been good all year,” Fleury said. “He's a fierce competitor. We'll see what happens.”Fleury was an avid video gamer in his younger days growing up in Sorel, Quebec.“Growing up I was always a Montreal fan because I'm from there,” he said, “but Pittsburgh had some mean teams in the 90s, so many good players, so Pittsburgh was another team I like to play as.”Malkin is well on his way to winning his second Art Ross Trophy as the NHL's scoring champion with 99 points – a nine-point lead over second-place Steven Stamkos. Malkin also ranks second in the league in goals (46) and fifth in assists (53). Malkin also won the Art Ross in 2009 with 113 points (35G-78A).Malkin has carried the Penguins this season in the absence of captain Sidney Crosby for all but 16 games. Despite not having one of the most dynamic players in the world in their lineup for most of the season, the Penguins still boast the NHL's No. 1 offense with 247 goals – led by the efforts of Malkin.Fleury has been the backbone of the Penguins over the past two seasons. He leads the NHL with 41 wins (tied with Nashville's Pekka Rinne) while posting an impressive .915 save percentage and 2.30 goals-against average. Fleury's 41 wins are a new career high.Fleury was named Team MVP last season after carrying the team plagued with long-term injuries (including to their top three centers, Malkin, Crosby and Jordan Staal ).

SAN CARLOS, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--TiVo (NASDAQ: TIVO), the global leader in entertainment technology and audience insights, today released follow-up findings from its 2016 TiVo consumer survey, focusing on the behavior of U.S. millennials and how this coveted demographic interacts with video content, products and services in contrast to other generations.
“The media industry is facing a perfect storm with increased choice and access to content, at the cost of massive fragmentation and frustrated consumers,” said Paul Stathacopoulos, vice president of strategy and strategic research, TiVo. “The coveted millennial demographic is in the eye of this storm, consuming the most content across the most services and platforms. However, members of this generation have short attention spans, and they are the most likely to ‘show dump' when access to content becomes challenging. These are cautionary signs for content owners who rely on loyalty and continued engagement to rationalize and realize returns on their investments in creative properties.”
Continuing the conversation around “show dumping,” TiVo found that millennials and Generation Z viewers are the most likely to give up on shows they previously enjoyed when it becomes too difficult to access them, either finding the content trapped behind paywalls or spread across a variety of entertainment sources. On the other hand, TiVo's survey also revealed that the millennial generation spends the most time each day watching video content – there is simply a limit to how many hoops they are willing to jump through before quitting on a specific show:
A staggering 54 percent of millennials have “show dumped,” giving up on a show they previously enjoyed because it became too difficult to access the content, in contrast to just 17 percent of boomers
of millennials have “show dumped,” giving up on a show they previously enjoyed because it became too difficult to access the content, in contrast to just of boomers Millennials also consume the most amount of content, more than 6 hours per day
per day Millennials spend 32 minutes per day searching for content to watch, a number boosted by the number of services and devices they have in the home
In contrast to other generations, millennials are most comfortable with video entertainment services and devices, likely driven by their desire to stay at the forefront of the newest content and best available innovations in entertainment technology:
73 percent of millennials have streaming video devices at home
of millennials have streaming video devices at home 91 percent pay for at least one subscription streaming service
pay for at least one subscription streaming service On average, millennials own 3 streaming devices and subscribe to 2.7 paid streaming services, providing them with a myriad of entertainment options and access points
The complex, multi-service entertainment setup in most millennial homes splits viewing time across many platforms and services. millennials have high expectations for cross-platform discovery solutions, which are largely unmet:
83 percent of millennial pay-TV subscribers use the programming guide every day
of millennial pay-TV subscribers use the programming guide every day 53 percent of millennials want recommendations on what to watch
of millennials want recommendations on what to watch 55 percent would pay to simplify search across platforms
would pay to simplify search across platforms 43 percent of millennials use voice commands every day where only 8 percent of Boomers feel comfortable enough with the technology to do the same
of millennials use voice commands every day where only of Boomers feel comfortable enough with the technology to do the same 46 percent of millennials feel extremely frustrated when they cannot easily find and access the programs they want to watch, in contrast to just 20 percent of boomers
These results illuminate millennial viewing habits and the existing gap between viewer expectation and the current limitations of the discovery experience available to the average consumer. To appeal to millennials and future generations, best-in-class content and technology are necessary to capture continued interest, engagement and satisfaction.
These generational results are the U.S. subset of the overall research findings from an online survey of 5,500 pay-TV and OTT subscribers across seven countries worldwide with 2,500 interviews completed in the U.S., and 500 interviews completed in each additional country, including the U.K., France, Germany, China, Japan and India.

Lillian Fall Release 2013
We could hole up in our winery and make wine, vintage after vintage. Gallons of perfumed liquid filling barrel, puncheon and foudre; stacked to the ceiling in teetering towers of steel and oak. We would worry over the vines, sink, knee-deep, into the sweet must, squeeze corks into the necks of myrtle-tinted bottles. We would be happy.But not really. We would be lonely…and we would be broke.Transactions between wineries and individuals—between you and us—are, in their own way, conversations that inform the basis of our relationship. But the reality is, our relationship has evolved and can evolve further.To this end,It started with a idea; brilliant in it's crystalinity: If we have 500 cases of wine and 1000 customers, each customer will have six bottles of wine held in his name. Ideas, however, get corrupted, changed. What started out as an idea based on equality and loyalty has morphed into something less noble. Somehow we've begun to rely on an overly complicated system that at its best is fairly annoying and at its least attractive, wrought with conceit.Until today, if you wanted to buy our wine, the conversation would have looked like this:You sign up to be a part of the mailing list…we tell you that we have no wine for you but that we may (fingers crossed) soon…we reach out to you at some point in the future to let you know that we've found some wine for you and that we will be sending you an allocation…we send you an offering…you have to remember your user ID and password to log in to view your allocation…you order some wine…we process your order…you find that we didn't offer you exactly what you would have liked…you reach out to us to request more or less that you were allocated…we tell you to bear with us until we know if we'll be able to create an order that will reflect what you'd actually like…we update your order (or tell you that we were unable to do so and that we'll try to do better next time around)…There's no enduring satisfaction to this.We cannot, in fact, think of any other consumer relationship with such ingrained complexity and rigid sets of barriers. Whether one's interest is in cars or croquet mallets, bottarga or Broadway tickets, the only requirement for purchase is sufficient funds. Why should the experience be so dramatically different with wine?We've come to believe that it should not. In an effort to make the whole experience of our wines more fluid, more beautiful; we have removed all impediments, made everything much more straightforward, open and easy. We want to move this conversation to a place that reflects the generosity and connection that have long been the hallmark of our relationship with you.Our doors are open. Please visit our website www.lillianwinery.com to order what you'd like in the amount you'd like, visit us at the cellar if you find yourself in the area, call us on the phone to let us know if there is something we can do for you or drop us a line and tell us what you think of the wines.We'd like to take this opportunity, once again to thank you for your wildly generous support and enthusiasm for the work that we do. We are keenly aware that were it not for this relationship we would be alone in the long shadows cast by the wine that we've made.Fondly,Maggie
AT&T's rivals are likely to cry foul over the company's practice of "zero rating," in which it exempts its own video services from data-cap usage. WSJ's Shalini Ramachandran explains how this could impact the proposed AT&T-Time Warner merger, on Lunch Break with Tanya Rivero. Photo: Bloomberg
AT&T Inc.'s practice of exempting its streaming video services from data-usage caps is rankling competitors and shaping up as a major issue for regulators set to weigh the telecom giant's proposed $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc.
When AT&T rolls out its $35-a-month DirecTV Now online TV service this month, its wireless subscribers will be able to stream as much as they want without it counting toward their monthly data caps. But if the same customers binge on outside services like Netflix or Hulu, those...

My sisters warned me that it would happen like clockwork: a day will come in your twenties, when you will stare at the door of your refrigerator and find it cluttered with countless wedding invites – and they were right. In a span of two weeks, I found myself committed to seven black tie weddings all in one summer. When I decided to meet up with an old college friend over drinks, we naturally found ourselves commiserating over the growing pile of invitations on our fridges, and the dwindling selection of contemporary cocktail dress options out there. Something needed to be done (hint: we founded Mestiza to fill this white space!).
The friend in question was of course, my future business partner and Mestiza's CEO, Louisa Rechter. It was that very night over drinks downtown that we were both hit with the entrepreneurial bug. Feeling tipsy and inspired, we made the decision then and there to name our hypothetical company Mestiza New York, Mestiza meaning a woman of mixed ancestry: a brand that celebrated our shared Filipino-American heritage; a brand inspired by the glamorous photographs of our mothers and grandmothers in the Philippines during the 60's.
The phrases “vintage wanderlust”, “ornate embellishments”, “gilt details”, and “bold silhouettes” all came to mind. Those first few months Louisa and I lead double lives, dreaming up our collection after hours and on weekends, devising a plan of attack and gathering up enough courage to quit our day jobs and dive-in head first.
Like any company in its infancy, we started small: seven trunk shows for friends and family, a small collection launched on a very crude online store, and a twelve piece capsule presented at an indie tradeshow called Brand Assembly – all a sequence of tiny steps that led us to landing a dream partnership with Neiman Marcus on our third season.
Looking back at those first 3 seasons of Mestiza, it all blends together: a bunch of muddled memories of late night design brainstorms, afternoons schlepping around the garment district, cold calling random stores in the feeble hope they would pick up our little collection. It was a hustle for sure. Everything came back into focus the day we sprinkled a little bit of fairy dust on our digital SS17 look book (a nifty little shoot we did on a 3K budget), said a little prayer, and hit “send” on a buyer list of over 3,000 emails.
The fairy dust (or prayer) must have worked because our look book magically drifted into the inbox of the dress collection buyer of Neiman Marcus, and she happened to like what she saw. She had a last minute cancellation in her schedule for her trip to NYC and decided to come meet us – it was one of those moments when the stars aligned. In 24 hours, we frenetically pulled together the collection from our pattern maker and factory and presented her the line. What we thought was an exploratory meeting ended up being the biggest order we had seen up to that point, and we were off to the races.
The excitement and fear of starting your own company is palpable. It is even more so with two very naïve founders who knew nothing about designing clothes or running a company. Everything about Mestiza was trial by fire and uncertain, except for two fundamental principles: the first being that we wanted to create beautiful dresses inspired by our shared Filipino-American heritage, and the second being that at its core we would have a brand that had socially impactful values.
After a trip to the Philippines over the holidays, my mother, who is a longtime philanthropist, introduced us the perfect partnership: The Habi Philippine Textile Council. They are an amazing organization based in Manila whose mission is to sustain the Philippine cotton industry, as well as support female textile weavers in the nation. Along with annual donations to the organization, we also integrate their hand woven fabrics into our collection each season and sell them exclusively on our website.
The women of Habi come from different regions of the Philippines to congregate under open-aired huts and weave fabrics with their traditional techniques. We give them minimal creative direction and a flexible production schedule, as we want the textiles to reflect the authenticity of their culture. Not only are the fabrications beautiful, but each Mestiza x Habi piece also helps to sustain the Philippine cotton farming industry, providing a steady paycheck for women, and keep a centuries-old artisanal craft alive for us to admire.
This is still just the beginning. The highs and lows of sustaining a fashion company in a retail market that's less than stellar are daunting. There are days when Louisa and I want nothing more than to fast forward the next few years to when Mestiza is a supernova brand with serious star power. But the inevitable growing pains of building something impactful still exist, and the imminent climb to reach a household name status still hovers over our heads.
I think the successes we've had so far are attributed to our mutual passion, drive, and ambition to make beautiful things and we have a vision for the brand that has not wavered since day one. I have no doubt that the next few years will be equal parts exciting, terrifying, and stressful, but I think we have a fair shot with just the right amount of hard work and of course, a little bit of fairy dust.
MESTIZA NEW YORK was created and inspired by a shared Philippine-American heritage between co-founders Alessandra Perez-Rubio and Louisa Rechter. Under the creative direction of Alessandra, the collection offers show-stopping styles characterized by gilt details, unexpected textures and bold necklines. Each piece is designed with a nod to vintage wanderlust; from Spanish Matador brocades, 1960's bell sleeves and Filipino Colonial silhouettes.
In just their third season, MESTIZA NEW YORK is now available at Neiman Marcus and on NeimanMarcus.com along with Bhldn.com and specialty boutiques Two Skirts, Julian Gold and more. The collection has also been spotted on the red carpet on chic fans including Chrissy Teigen, Ashley Graham, Kate Walsh, America Ferrera and Molly Sims.
Just going to clear up some questions, though again understand there are many, many things I can't talk about as unless it's out there in public, I will get a pretty severe telling offAll of the above are elements that have been confirmed though, it's worth watching Clint's interview here if you haven't seen it already:Is there is a full day night/cycle - Yes, the game is not set in perpetual darkness! What you saw in the E3 Stage Presentation was footage captured from the E3 show floor demo. This starts at sunset, but at it's a time limited demo of ten minutes with accelerated levelling (much like the original Crackdown demo) most of the footage got captured as it transitions to night time and you don't quite get to sunrise in 10 minutes!Multiplayer/Destruction - Campaign was designed to be played offline in single player, but can also be played online in 4 players Co-Op. Both don't feature the large scale world destruction as we wanted to make it accessible to as many people as possible. The competitive multiplayer will feature large scale destruction, MS will show it I'm sure when they're ready, but E3 is all about the Campaign side of the game. It is also a conscious gameplay choice for Campaign, razing the city to the ground doesn't feel like the kind of thing the good guys should do.Who is working on the game - We (Sumo) have been involved with the game from the start and we're principally handling the Campaign side of the game. It's a group effort though with Reagent and Cloudgine who are principally handling the competitive multiplayer. Some elements are shared, some are unique based on the gameplay needs.Why didn't you show more in the E3 Presentation - We were one of the 52 games on show, plus we're on the show-floor and we've got many press presentations booked over E3. I suspect they felt we could let the game talk more by itself! Plus don't forget that Crackdown is a very freeform game, it's hard to get that across as we're very definitely trying to avoid it being a scripted experience. Any given situation can be approached in a number of ways depending on the skills you've chosen to focus on.Does the announcer (Voice of the Agency) return - Absolutely. Some things are Crackdown DNA, this is one of then.Length of game/number of maps - This one I have to leave out specifics till MS talk more about the game, but we're expecting it to be comparable to previous Crackdown games.Like I say, I know there are multiple interviews happening so more should be revealed over the next few days and I'll be surprised if there isn't any show floor footage as folks get into the booth.I also appreciate folks remembering All-Stars Transformed which was my previous major gig before this one
Test fixtures, configuration files, and log files all need to be both human and machine readable. YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a less-verbose data serialization format than XML and has become a popular format among software developers mainly because it is human-readable. YAML files are simply text files that contain data written according to YAML syntax rules and usually have a .yml file extension. In this article, you will learn the basics of YAML and how you can integrate a PHP YAML parser into your projects.
Understanding YAML Syntax
YAML supports advanced features like references and custom data types, but as a PHP developer, most of the time you'll be interested in how YAML represents enumerated arrays (sequences in YAML terminology) and associative arrays (mappings).
The following is how to represent an enumerated array in YAML:
- 2 - "William O'Neil" - false
--ADVERTISEMENT--
Each element of the array is presented after a hyphen and a space. It's syntax for representing values is similar to that of PHP (quoting strings, etc.)
The above is equivalent to the following PHP:
<?php array(2, "William O'Neil", false);
Generally, each element will appear on it's own line in YAML, but enumerated arrays can also be expressed on a single line using brackets:
[ 2, "William O'Neil", false ]
The following code shows how to represent an associative array in YAML:
id: 2 name: "William O'Neil" isActive: false
First the element's key is stated followed by a colon and one or more spaces, and then the value is stated. Having just one space after the colon is sufficient, but you can use more spaces for the sake of better readability if you like.
The equivalent PHP array of the above YAML is:
<?php array("id" => 2, "name" => "William O'Neil", "isActive" => false);
And similar to enumerated arrays, you can express associative arrays on a single line using braces:
{ id: 2, name: "William O'Neil”, isActive: false }
With one or more spaces for indentation, you can represent a multi-dimensional array like so:
author: 0: { id: 1, name: "Brad Taylor", isActive: true } 1: { id: 2, name: "William O'Neil", isActive: false }
Note that although the second level arrays are enumerated arrays, I have used the syntax for mappings (colons) instead of the syntax for sequences (hyphens) for clarity.
The above YAML block is equivalent to the following PHP:
<?php array( "author" => array( 0 => array("id" => 1, "name" => "Brad Taylor", "isActive" => true), 1 => array("id" => 2, "name" => "William O'Neil", "isActive" => false) ) );
YAML also allows representing a collection of data elements in the same document without requiring a root node. The following example is the contents of article.yml which shows several multi-dimensional arrays in the same file.
author: 0: { id: 1, name: "Brad Taylor", isActive: true } 1: { id: 2, name: "William O'Neil", isActive: false } category: 0: { id: 1, name: "PHP" } 1: { id: 2, name: "YAML" } 2: { id: 3, name: "XML" } article: 0: id: 1 title: "How to Use YAML in Your Next PHP Project" content: > YAML is a less-verbose data serialization format. It stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language". YAML has been a popular data serialization format among software developers mainly because it's human-readable. author: 1 status : 2 articleCategory: 0: { articleId: 1, categoryId: 1 } 1: { articleId: 1, categoryId: 2 }
While most of YAML's syntax is intuitive and easy to remember, there is one important rule to which you should pay attention. Indentation must be done with one or more spaces; tabs are not allowed. You can configure your IDE to insert spaces instead of tabs when you press tab key, which is a common configuration among software developers to make sure code is properly indented and displayed when it's viewed in other editors.
You can learn the more complex features and syntax that YAML supports by reading the official documentation, the Symfony reference, or Wikipedia.
YAML Need Not Be an Alternative to XML
If you're researching YAML with your favorite search engine, you will undoubtedly find discussion on “YAML vs XML”, and naturally when you first experience YAML, you would tend to prefer it over XML mainly because its easier to read and write. However, YAML should be another tool in your developer arsenal and need not be an alternative to XML. Here are some advantages of YAML and XML.
Advantages of YAML
Less-verbose, easy to compose, and more readable
Need not have tree structure with a single parent node
Advantages of XML
More built-in PHP support compared to YAML
XML has been the de facto standard for inter-application communication and is widely recognized
XML tags can have attributes providing more information about the enclosed data
Despite its verbosity, XML is more readable and maintainable when the hierarchy of elements is deep compared to YAML's space-oriented hierarchy representation.
Considering the advantages of both languages, YAML seems to be more suitable for collections of different data sets and when humans are also among the data consumers.
Choosing a PHP YAML Parser
A YAML parser is expected to have two functionalities, some sort of load function that converts YAML into an array, and a dump function that converts an array into YAML.
Currently PHP's YAML parser is available as a PECL extension and is not bundled with PHP. Alternatively, there are parsers written in pure PHP which would be slightly slower compared to the PECL extension.
The following are a few YAML parsers available for PHP:
PECL extension
Is not bundled with PHP
Will need root access to the server to install
Symfony 1.4 YAML Component
Implemented in PHP
Will work in PHP 5.2.4+
Need to extract from Symfony framework
Symfony 2 YAML Component
Implemented in PHP
Will work in PHP 5.3.2+
SPYC
Implemented in PHP
Will work in PHP 5+
My preferred choice is the Symfony 1.4 YAML Component because of its portability (it works with PHP 5.2.4+ versions) and maturity (Symfony 1.4 is a well established PHP framework). Once you've extracted the YAML component from the Symfony archive, YAML classes are available under lib/yaml . The static methods load() and dump() are available with the sfYaml class.
Editor Note Oct 28 2012: The accompanying code on GitHub has been updated to use Composer for obtaining the PHPUnit and Symfony 1.4 YAML Component dependencies.
Integrating a PHP YAML Parser into Your Project
Whenever you integrate a third-party class or library into your PHP project, it's good practice to create a wrapper and a test suite. This let's you later change the third party library with minimal changes to your project code (project code should only refer the wrapper) and with the assurance that change won't brake any functionality (test suites will tell you).
Following is the test case ( YamlParserTest.php ) I created for my wrapper class ( YamlParser.php ). You need knowledge of PHPUnit to run and maintain the test case. You can add more tests if you'd like, for wrong file names and file extensions other than .yml , and other tests based on the scenarios you encounter in your project.
<?php require_once "YamlParser.php"; class YamlParserTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase { private $yamlParser; public function setup() { $this->yamlParser = new YamlParser(); } public function testMainArrayKeys() { $parsedYaml = $this->yamlParser->load("article.yml"); $mainArrayKeys = array_keys($parsedYaml); $expectedKeys = array("author", "category", "article", "articleCategory"); $this->assertEquals($expectedKeys, $mainArrayKeys); } public function testSecondLevelElement() { $parsedYaml = $this->yamlParser->load("article.yml"); $actualArticle = $parsedYaml["article"][0]; $title = "How to Use YAML in Your Next PHP Project"; $content = "YAML is a less-verbose data serialization format. " . "It stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language". " . "YAML has been a popular data serialization format among " . "software developers mainly because it's human-readable.n"; $expectedArticle = array("id" => 1, "title" => $title, "content" => $content, "author" => 1, "status" => 2); $this->assertEquals($expectedArticle, $actualArticle); } /** * @expectedException YamlParserException */ public function testExceptionForWrongSyntax() { $this->yamlParser->load("wrong-syntax.yml"); } }
And here is the wrapper class:
<?php require_once "yaml/sfYaml.php"; class YamlParser { public function load($filePath) { try { return sfYaml::load($filePath); } catch (Exception $e) { throw new YamlParserException( $e->getMessage(), $e->getCode(), $e); } } public function dump($array) { try { return sfYaml::dump($array); } catch (Exception $e) { throw new YamlParserException( $e->getMessage(), $e->getCode(), $e); } } } class YamlParserException extends Exception { public function __construct($message = "", $code = 0, $previous = NULL) { if (version_compare(PHP_VERSION, "5.3.0") < 0) { parent::__construct($message, $code); } else { parent::__construct($message, $code, $previous); } } }
Summary
So now you have the knowledge of what YAML is, how to represent PHP arrays in YAML, and how to integrate a PHP YAML parser into your projects. By spending little more time with YAML syntax, you will be able to grasp the powerful features it offers. You may also consider exploring the Symfony 1.4 and 2 frameworks that use YAML extensively. And if you're interested in playing with the code from this article, it's available on GitHub.

Market researcher Clotaire Rapaille was interviewed for an episode of Frontline on advertising and marketing back in 2003. I like what he had to say about the differences in how the French and Americans think about cheese.
For example, if I know that in America the cheese is dead, which means is pasteurized, which means legally dead and scientifically dead, and we don't want any cheese that is alive, then I have to put that up front. I have to say this cheese is safe, is pasteurized, is wrapped up in plastic. I know that plastic is a body bag. You can put it in the fridge. I know the fridge is the morgue; that's where you put the dead bodies. And so once you know that, this is the way you market cheese in America.
I started working with a French company in America, and they were trying to sell French cheese to the Americans. And they didn't understand, because in France the cheese is alive, which means that you can buy it young, mature or old, and that's why you have to read the age of the cheese when you go to buy the cheese. So you smell, you touch, you poke. If you need cheese for today, you want to buy a mature cheese. If you want cheese for next week, you buy a young cheese. And when you buy young cheese for next week, you go home, [but] you never put the cheese in the refrigerator, because you don't put your cat in the refrigerator. It's the same; it's alive. We are very afraid of getting sick with cheese. By the way, more French people die eating cheese than Americans die. But the priority is different; the logic of emotion is different. The French like the taste before safety. Americans want safety before the taste.
MONTREAL, QC—After giving a speech in Montreal yesterday, former US president Barack Obama met Justin Trudeau for a private dinner, during which the pair set a new world record by uttering the phrase "Dear God help us all" a combined 5,792 times.
According to witnesses working in the kitchen at Montreal's Liverpool House, Obama walked into the restaurant and gripped Trudeau in a hug, at which point both men whispered to each other in unison, "Dear God help us all."
"Dear God help us all" was then uttered another 270 times each immediately after the two sat down at their table. As both men contemplated the state of the world under current US "President" Trump, they stared at each other in an exhausted, terrified silence. After 20 long minutes, Obama boldly broke the tension by pounding the table with his fists and shouting, "DEAR GOD HELP US ALL."
"Dear God help us all", Trudeau agreed thoughtfully, wistfully even, as he slowly reached out his hand and, choking back tears, placed it on Obama's forearm to soothe him, fully aware that not even the gentlest touch could help comfort a man who had built so much for his country despite the profound and mind-boggling obstacles, only to watch it all get thrown in a raging dumpster fire by a petulant orange child in an ill-fitting suit.
Christophe Janicki, a longtime server at Liverpool House who waited on the men last night, reports that when he arrived at the table to take their drink orders, both Obama and Trudeau could only mutter "Dear God help us all" at a barely audible volume. At this point Obama had moved to Trudeau's side of the table so that the two could hold each other tightly and try not to tremble so much.
"I took their suggestion and just kind of improvised," Janicki shrugs. "I had the bartender whip up a custom drink called 'Dear God Help Us All'. It's just straight-up vermouth with a full bottle of vodka for a chaser."
Dear God help us all.
As the dinner progressed, Trudeau and Obama were able to enjoy precisely four moments of relative levity, during which they chatted about their kids and summer plans.
"But as soon as the summer came up, both of them suddenly seemed kind of unsure about whether the world would still be intact by that point," Janicki explains.
A heavy silence descended. Trudeau stared into his drink and shook his head.
"Dear God help us all," he said.

Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May's launches her election manifesto in Halifax, May 18, 2017. REUTERS/Phil Noble
HALIFAX, England (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Thursday there would be dire consequences for Britain if it failed to get a good Brexit deal, and said the coming five years would be among the most challenging in our lifetime.
May made the remarks during a speech presenting her Conservative Party's policy pledges to voters ahead of a June 8 parliamentary election the party is widely expected to win.
“Make no mistake, the central challenge we face is negotiating the best deal for Britain in Europe,” May said.
“If we fail, the consequences for Britain and for the economic security of ordinary working people will be dire. If we succeed, the opportunities ahead of us are great.”

A seven year history shaped by warring ideas on what was best for the game season after season has brought us to the present day on the timeline of competitive Team Fortress 2 -- every protracted debate on unlocks, maps and team sizes has been a step on the journey so far.
The received wisdom of balance through whitelists and class limits goes largely unchallenged; if it ain't broke, don't fix it... right? However, in late 2014 persistent rumours of official ranked matchmaking have got us all thinking what exactly that might mean for current competitive formats...
What would Valve's Game look like?
I certainly don't have the answers, but it would seem counterproductive for the developers to ban the very weapons they wish to sell in the Mann Co. Store. So I would proffer a fairly safe assumption that whitelists would not feature in the official vision of competitive play. You will most likely have some preconceptions about which items are unsuited to competition. I mean even highlander, a game mode which prides itself on being all-inclusive, refuses to play with a few particularly unpopular weapons.
Fuck all that. Unfurrow that nerdbrow and resist the urge to theorycraft. We are here to bring you a bunch of unrestricted showmatches featuring a pool of Europe's top players... actually just the ones that didn't relinquish control of their bowels at the mention of the Quick-Fix or the Gunslinger.
The team size will be six and the current ETF2L class limits will apply -- you can have two of any class that begins with ‘S' that isn't Australian. Why 6on6? Well, as anyone that plays MvM can tell you, six is the only team size officially endorsed by Valve's matchmaking. Kappa. That and to maintain some level of familiarity. Baby steps.
Teams will be drafted by two captains and pitted against each other in best-of-three series, with team comms available as Twiggy & Admirable cover the whole thing on the back-to-back Sundays of December 14th and 21st at 21:00CET / 15:00EDT in a live TeamFortress.TV edutainment spectacular.

HYDERABAD: Police in Telangana on Sunday held three accused including two juveniles for gangrape of a tribal girl, who was preparing for an exam to join the police force.
The shocking incident occurred in Telangana's Karimnagar district. According to police, the accused were batchmates of the girl and all were preparing for police recruitment examination.
While a youth and a juvenile committed the rape, another juvenile filmed the act on his mobile phone, police said.
G. Srinivas (22), and the two juveniles were all produced before a court, which sent them to judicial custody.
While Srinivas was sent to Karimnagar jail, the two juveniles were shifted to a remand home.
They have been booked under Nirbhaya Act, the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and the Information Technology Act.
Though the incident occurred near Veenavanka village in Karimnagar district on February 10, it came to light only three days ago after the victim told her parents.
The victim's relatives beat up the accused, who had to be admitted to a hospital in Warangal district. Police took them into custody after they were discharged from the hospital.
According to police, the crime was committed when the accused and the victim were returning home after watching a movie. Another girl accompanying the victim reportedly escaped after the accused took them to a nearby hillock.
Taking a serious note of the incident, the state government has asked police to take strong action against the accused.
Telangana Finance Minister E. Rajender, under whose constituency the incident occurred, said the guilty would not be spared.
TRS MP K. Kavitha said the accused were booked under three stringent legislations.
Part 1: The Facts of the Matter
No one knows what will emerge ultimately from the talks beginning in Geneva Oct. 1 between Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany on the matter of the Tehran government's nuclear program.
Iran says it looks forward to the talks and promises to be forthcoming. But judging by the stance of the United States, Great Britain, France and Germany last week at the UN conferences in New York and the G20 meeting in Pittsburgh, draconian sanctions may be enacted against Iran in a few months. This would result in yet another crisis that the world doesn't need just now.
Russia and China — which hold veto power in the Security Council that can weaken or prevent additional sanctions — have up to now resisted the Obama Administration's drive for tough new UN punishments. President Barack Obama met separately during the week with Russian President Dmitri Medvedev and Chinese President Hu Jintao in an effort to obtain their agreement to threaten more stringent sanctions should Iran procrastinate during the talks.
The White House later suggested to the press that Medvedev may be coming around to Obama's point of view, but this seems to be based on very skimpy evidence — a remark that “in some cases sanctions are inevitable.” Hu evidently didn't even go that far. China opposes sanctions in principle as a means of resolving international disputes.
Moscow and Beijing do not subscribe to the negative depiction of Iran promoted by Washington, Tel Aviv, London, Paris and Bonn. They understand the situation to be far more complex than the U.S. and its allies publicly acknowledge.
The Iran question suddenly took center stage Sept. 25 during a week of hectic political activity. The White House set up a hastily arranged and theatrically produced press conference at the start of the G20 meeting in order to detonate a political bombshell intended to destroy Tehran's contention that it is only interested in nuclear power, not nuclear weapons.
The conference opened with Obama standing at the microphone with French President Nicholas Sarkozy and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown positioned solemnly to his left and right. It was explained that German Chancellor Angela Merkel would have joined the trio but was delayed.
Obama then declared that Iran had for several years been secretly building an underground plant in mountainous terrain to manufacture nuclear fuel near the city of Qom about 100 miles from Tehran, in addition to the plant and facilities in Natanz already known to the world. He suggested the new plant was intended to produce weapons without the world's knowledge, though that was not proven.
Obama then charged that “Iran's decision to build yet another nuclear facility without notifying the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] represents a direct challenge to the basic compact at the center of the non-proliferation regime … Iran is breaking rules that all nations must follow … and threatening the stability and security of the region and the world.” Refusal to “come clean,” he said, “is going to lead to confrontation.”
Sarkozy and Brown followed Obama and seemed to go even further than the American leader in denouncing Iran, explicitly demanding harder sanctions. Said Brown: “The level of deception by the Iranian government, and the scale of what we believe is the breach of international commitments, will shock and anger the entire international community.”
The New York Times reported that “after months of talking about the need for engagement, Mr. Obama appears to have made a leap toward viewing tough new sanctions against Iran as an inevitability … American officials said that they expected the announcement to make it easier to build a case for international sanctions.”
The majority of House and Senate members have long been critical of Iran's government and the new allegations have only fanned the flames of their hostility. Right wing Florida Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the leading Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, declared: “The U.S. and other countries must immediately impose crippling sanctions on the Iranian regime, including cutting off Iran's imports of gasoline. The world cannot stand by and watch the nightmare of a nuclear-armed Iran become reality.” Massachusetts Democrat John Kerry, chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated “now is the time to supplement engagement with more robust international sanctions.”
As intended, the hyped disclosure created headlines around the world. It probably convinced many Americans, already primed to detest Iran, that Tehran is building nuclear bombs to obliterate the U.S. and Israel. This is not an unlikely conclusion for many people to accept after 30 years of Washington's incessant campaign to demonize the government that overthrew and replaced America's puppet, the dreaded Shah of Iran. The U.S. broke diplomatic relations with Iran after this act of lèse majesté and the subsequent “hostage crisis,” and has nourished a grudge to this day.
If push does come to shove with Iran it is important to remember how effortless it was to hoodwink the majority of American politicians and the masses of people into backing a completely unnecessary war against Iraq. As in the buildup to the unjust invasion of Iraq, today's U.S. corporate mass media is playing its principal part to perfection — uncritically echoing government distortions about the danger of Iran's nonexistent nuclear weapons. The Iran situation is different, but yet similar in terms of mass public manipulation and the possibility of a future confrontation getting out of hand.
Can this be, once again, a situation of high-stakes geopolitics where things are rarely as they seem? We think so. Let's look at the immediate charge against Iran, based on the “revelations” of the last week, then take on the bigger picture in Parts 2 and 3.
The “shocking” news may have been delivered with a sense of surprise and high urgency, but U.S. intelligence agencies, joined by their counterparts in some allied countries, were aware since 2006 that Iran was constructing a second uranium processing plant that still remains under construction and is not operational. According to a Sept. 26 article circulated by the McClatchy newspaper group quoting a U.S. intelligence official, “There was dialogue with allies from a very early point.”
Bush Administration Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnel first informed Obama about the facility soon after he won election. He has been kept up to date since then. Before going public with the information last week, the president saw to it that several other governments were told in advance, as was the IAEA and others.
Washington officials claimed Iran became aware “in late spring” that the U.S. was spying on the “secret” facility. They said Iran then informed the International Atomic Energy Agency Sept. 21 about the existence of its project, implying Tehran did so because its cover was blown. In a statement Sept. 24 the IAEA acknowledged that Tehran had informed them that a “pilot fuel enrichment plant is under construction in the country,” and that it “also understands from Iran that no nuclear material has been introduced into the facility.”
Iran insisted to the Vienna-based IAEA and the world that the enrichment plant under construction is designed only for fueling nuclear power installations. Soon after Obama's G20 speech, Iran's Atomic Energy Organization declared the new “semi-industrial enrichment fuel facility” was “within the framework of International Atomic Energy Agency's regulations.” Press reports said “The head of Iran's nuclear program suggested UN inspectors would be allowed to visit the site.” The invitation was extended before Washington's demand that it do so.
A quite unruffled Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad appeared at a press conference in New York after Obama's disclosures. He seemed to regard the American president's allegations, and the staged manner in which they were delivered, not only the making of a mountain out of a molehill but an act of bad faith just before the talks are to begin, suggesting non-threateningly that Obama will come to regret his confrontational demeanor.
Ahmadinejad told the press that the plant in question wouldn't be operational for 18 more months and that it did not violate the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). He went further and said nuclear weapons “are against humanity [and] they are inhumane,” comments in keeping with his recent calls for eliminating all nuclear weapons. The Iranian leader also said that Iran informed the IAEA about the plant only a few days ago instead of when ground was broken because construction had reached the stage where it should be reported, not because it found out that a U.S. spy agency was watching.
What are we to make of this? First it must be understood there is a dispute over the IAEA's safeguard provisions governing the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Iran considers itself to be in total compliance with the NPT, and this appears to be true. Inter-Press Service reporter Jim Lobe wrote Sept. 25 that “Under the basic Safeguards Agreement of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of which Iran is a signatory, member states are required to declare their nuclear facilities and designs at least 180 days before introducing nuclear materials there.”
According to an article in the Sept. 26 New York Times by Neil MacFarquhar, “Tehran's stance hinges on different interpretations of the agency's regulations, said Graham Allison, the director of Harvard University's Belfer Center and an Iran nuclear expert.
“For two decades, the agency required Iran to report only when nuclear material [for uranium enrichment] was introduced to a facility. By 2003 it rescinded that, in line with the guidelines for most [but not all] countries, demanding reporting when construction began, Mr. Allison said. But the agency never declared Iran out of compliance when Tehran claimed the old agreement was still in place.”
In talking to the press after Obama's speech, Ahmadinejad said that the new facility would be completed in 18 months, so under Iran's understanding of its responsibilities, the notification was a year in advance. The U.S. maintains that Iran informed the IAEA when it learned U.S. spy agencies had become aware of the plant, but if that were so, why did Tehran wait three months before contacting the nuclear agency? Had they acted out of fear of being exposed as non-compliant wouldn't they have contacted IAEA immediately?
“What we did was completely legal, according to the law,” the Iranian president said. “We have informed the agency, the agency will come and take a look and produce a report and it's nothing new.” According to the Associated Press Tehran's notice to the IAEA specified that the enrichment level would be up to 5%, suitable only for peaceful purposes. Weapons-grade material is more than 90% enriched.”
The AP also noted that the IAEA now “says Iran is obliged to make such a notification when it begins design of such facilities” and that “a government cannot unilaterally abandon such an agreement.” This is confusing, of course. But since Iran was never designated as non-compliant and was allowed to proceed under the previous rules for years after it registered its rejection of the new terms, the thunderous criticism emanating from the U.S., Britain and France appears to have no serious merit.
Story highlights Nearly 50 alleged members of a nationwide gang are charged in federal indictment
Allegations include murder, racketeering, drug trafficking and bank fraud
Documents show inner workings of a corporate-style crime syndicate
Atlanta (CNN) Several leaders of a notorious nationwide gang were charged in sweeping federal indictments unsealed Wednesday in Atlanta and Memphis.
Forty-eight alleged members of the Gangster Disciples, a Chicago-based gang operating in at least 24 states, were charged with racketeering offenses including murder, extortion, drug trafficking and credit card fraud, according to John Horn, the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia.
"The Gangster Disciples are a highly organized and ruthless gang that recognizes no geographical boundaries," said Britt Johnson, head of the FBI's Atlanta field office. "Its members have for too long indiscriminately preyed upon and infected the good people of our communities like a cancer."
Johnson said gang members legitimized themselves in their communities by organizing ostensibly altruistic endeavors such as food drives to feed the homeless, and, in a sinister twist, "stop the violence" rallies.
The gang is administered with such merciless order that Johnson said one recruit was killed when he failed to show for a neighborhood cleanup event organized by the Disciples.

MEMPHIS, Tenn. — A criminal and internal investigation is underway at Kellogg's after a video surfaced online that appears to show a man filming himself urinating on products on an assembly line.
An internal investigation found it was recorded in 2014 at a facility in Memphis, Tennessee, the company said.
It potentially affected Rice Krispies Treats, Rice Krispies Treats cereal and puffed rice cake products — though all would be past their expiration date at this point.
The video was uploaded Friday to the site World Star Hip Hop.
Kris Charles, a Kellogg's spokesman, said the company is “outraged by this completely unacceptable situation.”
“We were shocked and deeply disappointed by this video that we just learned of yesterday,” Charles said in a statement Saturday. “We immediately alerted law enforcement authorities and regulators.”
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has started a criminal investigation, according to CNN affiliate WREG. The station said the video may have been shot during a labor dispute between Kellogg's and employees who were locked out.
(CNN) No quintessential New York argument was ever ended so conclusively as in 1950, when a public debate took place on whether or not the Soviet Union then constituted a "socialist community." Max Shachtman, a witty and charismatic American Trotskyist, was of the opinion that any state which kept its workers in penury and servitude and paranoically devoured its own political class could qualify as no such thing.
To demonstrate his point, he recited a litany of names of loyalist Eastern European Communist leaders who had recently been purged and condemned to death by Stalin. Directly addressing his debate opponent, Earl Browder -- then only recently dismissed as general secretary of the Communist Party USA, but still an apparatchik of the regime that had disavowed him -- Shachtman declared: "There but for an accident of geography stands a corpse!"
I'm not quite sure what it is about the American-born Browder family that has made its fate for nearly a century quite so dependent on the dark machinations of the Kremlin.
But by odd coincidence, Earl Browder's grandson Bill, a Red diaper baby turned capitalist, addressed a US congressional committee Thursday on a wholly different question about Russia: how, in Browder's view , Vladimir Putin and his cronies stole billions in order to enrich themselves, with the regime allegedly engaging in crimes including money laundering and assassination to get away with it. All accusations the Russian president vehemently denies, of course.
You'll have noticed that this is plainly now America's problem, too, because of the international reach of Russian racketeering and the unending Page 1 controversy of whether or not Donald Trump's campaign may have been susceptible to it on his unlikely march into the White House.
But back when the Donald was barking at Gene Simmons on "Celebrity Apprentice," Browder was experiencing the depravities of Putin's mafia state at first hand -- becoming, like his grandfather, a victim of the very dictatorship he once defended.
Short-lived alliance
As the CEO of the hedge fund Hermitage Capital, once the largest foreign investment vehicle in Russia, Browder spent the early 2000s as minority shareholder activist and avowed admirer of an inscrutable KGB case officer who'd unexpectedly risen to the Russian presidency in the wake of a severe economic crisis, promising to put an end to the corruption and the boyar governance of the Yeltsin period.
As he noted in his testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Browder's enemies in Russia -- the oligarchs defrauding their shareholders and the Russian taxpayer -- were for a time Putin's enemies, too. But alliances of convenience have a relatively short life in this part of the world.
As he tells it, in 2005, for reasons of "national security," Browder was deported from Moscow. Eighteen months later, he said, Hermitage Capital, along with the offices of its law firm Firestone Duncan, were raided by officers of the Russian Interior Ministry. He said they confiscated corporate documents tied to various Hermitage subsidiaries on a spurious tax evasion pretext .
Now domiciled in London (he gave up his American citizenship and became a Brit in 1998), Browder hired a 35-year-old tax attorney back in Moscow, Sergei Magnitsky, to investigate why he and his holdings were being targeted. What Magnitsky uncovered was what the US government has alleged was a shockingly vast criminal conspiracy to defraud not Browder and Hermitage, but the Russian public, of $230 million using the purloined Hermitage corporate documents.
It was an elaborate but common scheme -- and one whose ramifications are still coming to light almost a decade later. It involved re-registering those Hermitage subsidiaries under new ownership, the dummying-up of civil litigation against the subsidiaries by outside parties which were also, not coincidentally, controlled by the same people who stole the subsidiaries. Russian courts then levied massive damages against the subsidiaries, which were now eligible for equally massive tax refunds.
Even more remarkable than the nine-figure haul was the Tolstoyan cast of characters behind it: the same Interior Ministry policemen who organized the raids on the hedge fund and law firm; an officer of the Federal Security Service (FSB), the successor organ of the Soviet KGB; and tax ministry officials. All moonlighted as payrolled gangsters of a "dangerous transnational criminal organization," as Sen. John McCain has described it , known as the Klyuev Group. Airline records, whose authenticity was confirmed by a US government source, would later show that the cops and robbers even vacationed together before and after the Hermitage heist, and purchased, either in their own names or the names of their immediate relatives, properties and cars that enormously exceeded their declared annual incomes.
More recently, the leaked personal emails of the Klyuev Group's alleged consigliere make a persuasive case that he colluded with an ex-official from the Interior Ministry to retroactively tamper with evidence in the case. That lawyer, by the way, confirmed the authenticity of the emails, but says their contents only prove "that a lawyer and an investigator do know each other and discuss criminal cases," but there was no wrongdoing.
Magnitsky tried to bring documentary proof of the conspiracy to the attention of Russian law enforcement, believing that compromised public servants were the exception rather than the rule in a new Russia avowedly dedicated to the "dictatorship of the law." He was wrong.
Not only was his forensic sleuthing dismissed, he himself was accused by the very perpetrators he exposed of being a tax cheat -- projection being the only real ideology to which Putinists subscribe. Magnitsky was thrown into Butyrka, one of the most notorious prisons in Moscow, kept in gulag-like squalor, denied urgent medical care and -- if Browder, multiple arms of the US government and Russia's own presidential human rights council are to be believed -- tortured and left to die in 2009. Russia says he died of "heart failure."
The Magnitsky Act
Like a good number of Soviet dissidents, Magnitsky documented his own politicized travails: he kept a diary in real time of his ordeal behind bars and his vain attempts to overturn his scapegoating, or at least get medical treatment for gallstones and acute pancreatitis. After his demise, his government put him on trial for tax crimes posthumously in an imaginative perversion of justice that not even Stalin contrived for Old Bolsheviks in the Great Terror.
All of this might have made for a tragic but minor footnote in the annals of contemporary Russian history but for what Browder has done over the past seven and a half years to tend to Magnitsky's flame -- and how furious he has made Russian officialdom in the process.
In 2012, the financier got a landmark US human rights law named in his slain lawyer's honor, sanctioning an ever-lengthening list of the Russian conspirators behind the $230 million theft and cover-up and Russian human rights abusers. Parallel laws have since been passed in Estonia and the United Kingdom , and one is set to pass in Canada.
Since state-indulged mobsters cannot be brought to book credibly in Russia, this legislation at least strips them of the ability to spend their ill-gotten gains in the West, which is arguably a harsher punishment.
As such, it has prompted a raft of hysterical countermeasures from the Kremlin, and obstreperous commentary from everyone from Russia's Prosecutor General to the spokesman of the President. Possibly this owes to the fact that one of Putin's closest confidants may have profited personally from the Magnitsky affair, as disclosures in the Panama Papers suggest. Putin, naturally, denies having profited from his presidency; he once famously described his role in government as that of a "galley slave."
The cruelest of countermeasures is a ban on Americans seeking to adopt Russian orphans -- a number of them stricken with HIV or Spina Bifida who might otherwise find loving families in America and are now destined to languish in substandard institutions as wards of the Russian state. This is the price society's most vulnerable must pay so that the elite can steal with impunity.
Nor have Putin and his surrogates been especially subtle in their extortionate attempts to use this gratuitous proscription as leverage for dismantling of the Magnitsky Act. A good rule of thumb: whenever you read that "adoption" has been discussed in any US-Russian bilateral meeting, what you're actually reading is a cynical quid pro quo on offer from Moscow for ending US sanctions on criminals.
Browder a tireless activist
I've known Bill Browder for about six years. We met when I was living and working in London and he was beginning what would become a tireless activist campaign to exonerate and vindicate Magnitsky, for whose death he feels a personal responsibility. He has been monomaniacal in this regard. Never have I had an interview subject in journalism so immune to pleasantries and so reluctant to discuss anything outside of the news item of the day on which he was discoursing.
Does Browder have an agenda? Of course he does, as he'll be the first to admit. But the facts, I've come to believe in the last half decade, are solidly on his side. I have been reporting on these events for six years, examining court records and Russian government documents and interviewing people investigating the Magnitsky affair, including and especially Browder himself.
What impresses me the most about him is that he does not ask you to take him on faith. Rare for those of us who toil in international affairs, hoping to shine a light on the occluded parts of the unfree world, Browder substantiates almost all his allegations with documentation, much of it produced by the Russian government itself or by whistleblowers involved in the $230 million expropriation.
One of the latter, Alexander Perepilichnyy, another exile in Britain, who identified himself as the former money launderer for the Klyuev Group before becoming a whistleblower, was almost certainly also the victim of foul play in an as-yet unsolved death, mostly likely by poison. As documents obtained by CNN show, money from one of Perepilichnyy's offshore companies was transferred to a company owned by an agent for the Syrian chemical weapons program.
While Russian authorities may not like what Browder has to say and show, Western governments have found him reliable. In the past few months alone, I have spoken to several officials in different parts of the US executive branch who have consulted him over the years, receiving evidence he and his team have compiled. When asked if Browder has ever steered them wrong with respect to the merits of the Klyuev Group or the Magnitsky affair, they have not hesitated to answer with a resounding "no."
The proof is in the frozen funds. About $40 million of the stolen $230 million has been located and seized in multiple countries since 2009, according to Browder. In May, the US Justice Department settled a case in New York in which it alleged that Prevezon Holdings, Ltd., a Cyprus-registered company, had laundered several million from the tax fraud into Manhattan real estate. Prevezon paid nearly $6 million but admitted no wrongdoing.
The lawyer for that company was Natalia Veselnitskaya , the "Russian government lawyer" who met with Donald Trump, Jr., Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner in June 2016, ostensibly to peddle dirt on Hillary Clinton. According to Don Jr., her stuff on the Democratic nominee was thin gruel, and Veselnitskaya instead spent the bulk of the meeting haranguing Team Trump "about the adoption of Russian children," in what former CIA director Michael Hayden has described to the New Yorker as a "soft approach" by Russian intelligence. Veselnitskaya has denied acting on behalf of the Russian government. But she and a Washington, DC-based former Soviet military officer, Rinat Akhmetshin, engaged in a lobbying campaign to refute the substance of Magnitsky and Browder's accusations -- the better to stop any US asset forfeiture of money that might have been laundered therefrom. They've failed.
Needless to say, because he has helped democracies go after a kleptocracy's money, Browder has been labeled an enemy of the Russian state, which has resorted to a number of crude propaganda campaigns to portray him as a British or American spy-- or, at the very least, a fugitive financial criminal with a unique power of persuasion in western parliaments. He has been found guilty in absentia in Russia for tax fraud, and sued (unsuccessfully) in British civil court for defamation by one of the Interior Ministry cops allegedly behind the Magnitsky affair. In spite of earning a state salary of no more than $1,000 per month, the cop managed to retain the counsel of a white-shoe UK law-firm for these purposes.

Browder has been the subject of a series of Kremlin-issued "red notices" orders -- extradition orders -- which have been struck down by Interpol at great personal cost to himself. He has had innumerable death threats leveled against him, and the former placeholder President of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev said to journalists at Davos, "It's a shame that Sergei Magnitsky died and Bill Browder is still running free and alive," according to what Browder said he was told by people who were there.
Yet he shows no sign of wavering or abandoning his cause.
There but for an accident of geography stands another corpse. Unlike his grandfather, Browder needs no instruction on what Russia has become.
Russia has officially provided military hardware for Afghan forces, but simultaneously propped up the Taliban with arms, official and insurgent sources say (AFP Photo/NOORULLAH SHIRZADA)
Allegations over Russia and Iran's deepening ties with the Taliban have ignited concerns of a renewed "Great Game" of proxy warfare in Afghanistan that could undermine US-backed troops and push the country deeper into turmoil.
Moscow and Tehran insist their contact with insurgents is aimed at promoting regional security, but local and US officials who are already frustrated with Pakistan's perceived double-dealing in Afghanistan have expressed bitter scepticism.
Washington's long-time nemesis Iran is accused of covertly aiding the Taliban, and Russia is back to what observers call Cold War shenanigans to derail US gains at a time when uncertainty reigns over President-elect Donald Trump's Afghanistan policy.
"(Russia's) narrative goes something like this: that the Taliban are the ones fighting Islamic State," top US commander in Afghanistan John Nicholson said recently, denouncing the "malign influence" of external powers.
"This public legitimacy that Russia lends to the Taliban is not based on fact, but it is used as a way to essentially undermine the Afghan government and the NATO effort and bolster the belligerents.
"Shifting to Iran, you have a similar situation. There have been linkages between the Iranians and the Taliban."
Russia has officially provided military helicopters for Afghan forces, but simultaneously propped up the Taliban with arms, official and insurgent sources say.
"We are particularly concerned about loads of Russian-made weapons recently seized from areas on the border with Tajikistan," a senior Afghan security official told AFP.
"Cross-border support for the Taliban will further complicate the security situation in Afghanistan's north."
A Taliban commander told AFP the Russian support had helped the insurgents overrun the northern city of Kunduz in October for the second time in a year.
Taliban representatives in recent months have also held several meetings with Russian officials in Tajikistan and Moscow, sources say.
"No country should be in touch with destructive groups who are the enemies of Afghanistan. These shows disrespect towards the victims of war," interior ministry spokesman Sediq Siddiqi told AFP.
"We ask Russia and Iran to work with Afghans to defeat terrorism."
- 'Great fear' -
Western diplomats in Kabul have privately voiced alarm that Russia is quietly filling its embassy ranks with Soviet era "old-timers" well versed in Cold War tactics, as relations with Washington turn sour over the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine.
And this week Kabul vented fury over a summit between Russia, China and Pakistan in Moscow which agreed on a "flexible approach" to remove certain Taliban figures from sanctions lists.
Alexander Mantytskiy, Russia's ambassador to Kabul, insists engagement with the insurgents is benign.
"We have ties with the Taliban to ensure the security of our political offices, consulates and the security of central Asia," he told reporters this month.
Lashing out at NATO, he added the allegations against Russia were an effort to distract attention from the worsening conflict and "put the blame for their failures on our shoulders".
Some observers agree that Russian and Iranian concerns over Islamic State jihadists cannot be dismissed lightly.
"Islamic State may not have a deep presence in Afghanistan, but it has developed a profile there and its overall brand inspires great fear," Michael Kugelman, an analyst at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, told AFP.
"We can't rule out the possibility that Russia and Iran are trying to hedge against the future possibility of a stronger Islamic State in Afghanistan by expanding their ties to the Taliban."
- Playground for superpowers -
Afghanistan has long been used as a chessboard for proxy battles -- from the 19th century "Great Game" of rivalry between Britain and Russia to the US funnelling weapons through Pakistan to Afghan rebels fighting Soviet forces in the 1980s.
It has also served as a proxy war playground for nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan, which is also accused of playing a "double game" by endorsing Washington's war on terrorism while providing sanctuary to the Taliban.
Superpowers jockeying for supremacy in Afghanistan could sow further chaos amid the unpredictability of Trump's foreign policy, analysts say.
Chemically treating Christchurch's water to make it extra safe for drinking would cost ratepayers more than $100 million, city council officials believe.
A damning Government report in the wake of last year's Havelock North disease outbreak condemned water regulation across New Zealand and called for the universal treatment of drinking water.
But medical experts believe Christchurch, which has long-resisted suggestions its drinking water should be treated, is a "special case" because its water quality is so good.
GEORGE HEARD/STUFF Canterbury medical officer of health Dr Alistair Humphrey believes Christchurch shouldn't have to treat its drinking water.
Council bosses said introducing chlorination would be a "major undertaking" and would cost millions to install treatment systems in the 50 or so boreholes across the city.

* More than 750,000 Kiwis exposed to potentially unsafe drinking water
* Drinking water inquiry: Here's what you need to know
* Christchurch's pure drinking water could be contaminated due to farming
David Adamson, council city services manager, said: "To treat against things like protozoa we would need something like ultraviolet treatment or fine filtration, and to treat against ongoing E coli would need some residual treatment like chlorination.
SUPPLIED Residents in some parts of North Canterbury have had issues with discoloured and "crunchy" water.
"You're looking at a bill of probably $100 million plus, and my engineers have estimated an operating cost of possibly $5m a year to run it."
Adamson welcomed the report for stimulating "interesting conversation" but said the council had "very good measures" in place over risk, including secure deep boreheads and a stringent water quality monitoring regime, and it should be up to the community to decide whether those measures were sufficient.
"I think Christchurch City Council has got some very good practices, both in the construction and depth of their wells and in their monitoring regimes that produce barriers to minimise that risk."
JOHN KIRK-ANDERSON/STUFF Much of Christchurch's drinking water is drawn from deep aquifers, fed mainly by the Waimakariri River.
Recommendations such as re-examining legislation were "long overdue", he conceded.
But he called for consideration to be given to what safety precautions individual water suppliers had in place before any mandatory treatment was imposed.
"I believe that we are doing a very, very good job where we are."
Most of Christchurch's drinking water is drawn from deep aquifers beneath the city, fed primarily by the Waimakariri River.
The untreated water is of an exceptionally high quality and has long been a source of pride for the city.
Canterbury medical officer of health Dr Alistair Humphrey accepted that "in principle" chlorination would improve safety – but warned it could lead to complacency around protecting sources of drinking water.
123RF.COM The Government's report has called for the universal treatment of drinking water.
But the "multiple barriers" the city council already had in place and its investment to protect the supply network were as good as chlorination and should allow it to be exempt from treatment, he said.
"I think the case that Christchurch City Council have made for not chlorinating is a rare but significant exception to the general rule that chlorinating is what you need to do to keep your drinking water safe.
"I accept Christchurch City Council's rationale for not chlorinating – they have invested heavily in monitoring and maintenance of the system and that, in effect, amounts to an extra barrier in protecting the drinking water which is at least the equivalent of chlorination.
"I do not think the council have ever been complacent about their water supply, even though they don't chlorinate it."
The Government's inquiry uncovered a deeply troubling picture of New Zealand's drinking water, with at least 750,000 people using supplies that were "not demonstrably safe".
Mayors and district health boards have been asked to check water meets current standards after the report found quality in 20 per cent of supplies was inadequate.
As well as urging universal treatment, the investigation recommended a new independent drinking water regulator, tightening of legislation and regulation and having larger water suppliers to improve accountability.
The inquiry was triggered by a bacterial contamination in Havelock North last year that left three people dead and thousands ill. The inquiry was advised on October 24 by the Hawke's Bay DHB that it had identified a fourth death that was likely to have been linked to the August 2016 outbreak.
Minister for Health David Clark is expected to update the Cabinet before Christmas of any necessary urgent action.
File photo shows transgender people rallying for the inclusion of a separate gender column on identity cards before the Supreme Court ordered the government to have the community registered as voters.—AFP (File Photo)
KARACHI: A member of Pakistan's transgender community is to contest upcoming general elections on a ticket of equal rights, saying the community has more to offer than begging or dancing at weddings.
The elections, due by mid-May, will mark the first democratic transition of power after an elected government's full term in Pakistan's 65-year history.
It will also be the first time Pakistan's estimated 500,000 “eunuchs” are eligible to seek office, after the Supreme Court in 2011 ordered the government to issue them with identity cards and to register them as voters.
In Pakistan, the word “eunuch” is also used to refer to hermaphrodites, transsexuals, transvestites and homosexuals in addition to castrated men.
Those classified as eunuchs are traditionally paid to help celebrate the birth of a son, or to dance at weddings.
“It is not our destiny to merely dance for others and hold begging bowls. We have a life to live,” Sanam Fakir, 32, told AFP by telephone from the town of Sukkur in Sindh.
The elections will be for the national parliament and provincial assemblies.
Seats in Pakistan are often won on a patronage basis, giving wealthy landlords and entrenched political parties a huge advantage.
Running as an independent in Sukkur, which is traditionally dominated by the main ruling Pakistan People's Party and which has a tiny transgender community, Fakir's chances are slim of winning a seat in the Sindh provincial assembly.
“We are not corrupt. We have no need to be corrupt. We have no families and our own needs are limited. We are contented people,” Fakir told AFP.
“I know it is very difficult to defeat them, but everyone should contribute for the betterment of society,” she added.
But in a conservative Muslim country where sexual relations outside marriage are taboo and homosexuality is illegal, “eunuchs” are treated as sex objects and often become the victims of assault, ending up as beggars and prostitutes.
Fakir completed 10th grade in school and now runs a charity, which includes a computer centre for members of her community.
“We are getting educated now. People used to make fun of us, but now they have started to respect us,” she said.

Two parliamentary by-elections, two weeks away.
Is Labour a sitting duck in its own heartland territory?
A quick road-trip to the West Midlands and the Lake District was enough to conclude that Labour can look forward to a sweaty, and quite possibly a painful night on 23 February.
Both seats would normally be considered "safe" for Labour.
But "normal" now seems a long time ago. Stoke voted 70% to 30% to leave the EU. In Copeland the margin was 60% to 40%. That would be enough to give Remain-supporting Labour sleepless nights.
Copeland by-election candidates
Stoke-on-Trent Central by-election candidates
But add to that the fact that, in 2015, UKIP came second in Stoke - 5,000 odd votes behind Labour.
Throw in Labour's long term deficit in the polls, which suggests former Labour voters have turned away from Jeremy Corbyn.
Then, chat to people in Hanley town centre - in the Stoke-on-Trent Central constituency - before travelling north and doing the same in Whitehaven, the large coastal town in the sprawling, and beautiful, Copeland constituency in the Lake District.
If you don't hear enough cause for Labour to fear losing one or both of these seats, you're not listening.
Dismal rating
In Copeland, the biggest employer by far is the Sellafield nuclear power plant.
In Whitehaven, where Sellafield has a large office block, Jeremy Corbyn's past opposition to nuclear power - which has since softened - comes up in almost every conversation.
The local grocer - whose family have run Kinsella's since the turn of the last century - told me customer after customer was switching allegiance away from Labour for that reason.

That, and the doubts about Mr Corbyn's fitness to lead which have handed him a quite dismal personal rating of minus 40.
That's 46 points behind Theresa May who was the only national leader with a positive rating in the survey conducted by Yougov last week.
Strong identity
In Stoke, the UK Independence Party's new leader, Paul Nuttall, is standing as a candidate. UKIP has a great deal invested in this fight.
It's not clear whether the perception of an outsider parachuting into the seat - a charismatic Scouser seizing his chance in an area with a strong identity of its own - will count against Mr Nuttall and his party.
If UKIP fails it will hurt, and suggests the party lost its way when it lost Nigel Farage as leader.
So Labour will throw everything into both campaigns. Jeremy Corbyn's visited both, and will visit again.
Victory in both seats will buy time and space to try to regain ground, to try to recover from the visible splits which opened up so glaringly during debate and voting on the bill to begin Brexit.
But if Labour loses in either or both seats - each of which has been held by the party since 1935 - it means talk of existential crisis for the party.
“Frankly, I can never be far enough from Hollywood,” wrote lantern-jawed Bruce Campbell in his 2001 memoir “If Chins Could Kill.”
(Thomas Dunne Books)
Now, in this variety pack of “further confessions” titled “Hail to the Chin,” the self-styled “B movie actor” recounts trading smog-clogged L.A. for a lavender-carpeted hillside in southern Oregon, then shooting films and TV series in Bulgaria, Colombia, New Zealand and his native Michigan.
“I've been called a ham actor,” Campbell says with felony-level understatement. He loves to wink at the camera, and in the course of playing characters as diverse as Elvis, Reagan and Santa Claus, he has chewed up more scenery than Godzilla and Rodan combined. (Sometimes literally: His character in the “Evil Dead” horror franchise, which made Campbell a cult icon in the 1980s, sports a chain saw as a prosthetic hand.)
After decades of playing lovable rogues and vampire hunters, Campbell got his chance to direct an indie feature — the low-budget “Man With the Screaming Brain” — in 2005. Panned by Variety as “an amiable goof that looks like it was cobbled together in a hurry,” the film nonetheless qualified Campbell to conduct a master class in schlock:
“Directors of these movies (referred to variously as genre, low-budget or schlock) are usually inexperienced, callow and unrealistic, but they are also enthusiastic, daring and indefatigable. The writers, typically working on their first screenplay, have something to prove, and . . . you'll occasionally find a spark of genius,” he writes. “Fellow actors in these second-tier films are often very green with careers on the rise and it's fun to watch them deliver every line of dialogue like it's their last.”
Even if “Hail to the Chin” doesn't make Bruceniks of us all, die-hard fans will embrace it as canon. Here the faithful will learn that English-born actress Gabrielle Anwar — Campbell's tough and fearless co-star on the seven-season “Burn Notice” — was “never one to hide her raw emotions” from an overcautious director. Fans will also discover that headliner Jeffrey Donovan, 10 years Campbell's junior, “became like a younger brother to me.” And they will savor the news that big bad Bruce turns the wild lavender on his Oregon property into sweet-smelling soaps and sachets — ideal gifts for the fragrant Teamsters on the Miami-based set.
Ultimately, our hero's journey leads to the Big Show, where he lands roles in the three “Spider-Man” movies directed by childhood pal Sam Raimi. Encountering Campbell on the set of “Spider-Man 3” in 2007, star Tobey Maguire blurts out: “Of course he's back. We can't make a Spider-Man movie without Bruce Campbell!”
The swashchuckler has his comeback ready: “You're starting to understand how Hollywood works, Tobey.”

Courtney Barnett: Five Essential Bob Dylan Songs

[July 2018 update: Since Courtney Barnett first offered up her "Five Essential Bob Dylan Songs" two years ago, she's released a second solo album, Tell Me How You Really Feel, as well as a collaboration with Kurt Vile, 2017's Lotta Sea Lice. Barnett also backed her wife, Jen Cloher, on her self-titled, fourth album of last year, and has maintained a rigorous touring schedule with Cloher, Vile and on her own. Barnett is living out of a suitcase for much of the summer and headed for Prospect Park for a benefit concert for the BRIC Celebrate Brooklyn! Festival this Wednesday, July 25, at 8:45 p.m., EDT, broadcast live on WFUV 90.7FM and streaming live.]
When Courtney Barnett first visited WFUV in early 2014, she spoke about her deep admiration for Bob Dylan, especially his lyrical acuity. Last year, Barnett even had the chance to strum the same guitar he played at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965 when he shocked fans by going electric.
Like her beloved Minnesotan, this young Australian songwriter skillfully writes winding, detailed, character-driven narratives, like her poignant "Depreston," and resonant, more straightforward tunes too, like "Small Poppies," both found on her striking 2015 debut album, Sometimes I Sit and Think, and Sometimes I Just Sit.
Barnett, who recently played the Season 41 finale of "Saturday Night Live" (and rocked out a blistering "Pedestrian At Best" and "Nobody Really Cares If You Don't Go To The Party"), kindly found time to write about her Five Essential Bob Dylan Songs for FUV. Her selections stretch from 1964 to 1970 and they each shed light on Barnett's own marvelous songwriting process and perspective:
Courtney Barnett's Five Essential Bob Dylan Songs:
"With God On Our Side," The Times They Are A-Changin'
I used to play in this band, Immigrant Union, with my friend Rob. We'd all been rehearsing and drinking one night, and when everyone else went home, we went on a Dylan binge. He was showing me all this stuff I'd never heard of. We were doin' that 'n' playing guitars until about 6 a.m. and we only stopped 'cos I had to leave for this office job I had at the time. He said, “Do you know Joan Baez?” And I said “no, who's that." And he searched around for this live video of Dylan and Baez singing "With God On Our Side" (Newport Folk Fest maybe?) We learned it straight away and then we started performing it together. It was around that night that I kind of figured out how to sing harmonies with someone else. Then, of course, I fell in love with Joan Baez.
"Subterranean Homesick Blues," Bringing It All Back Home
I was always just fascinated how he said all those words so quickly. And how those words all melted together so imperfectly yet perfectly . Of course the great video too (my friend told me “the first music video ever made") and all the later imitations that it inspired (my favourite being INXS's "Mediate.") It's a goal of mine to learn that song, but it's so hard to remember it all.
"If Not For You," New Morning
I bought New Morning at a secondhand record store (it was $10; I had only $10) and it didn't leave my record player for a long time. I would lay in my bed all day every Sunday and be so sad about something or other and listen to this. This was my favourite song. You know the next week, I'd been watching "No Direction Home," and I walked into that same record store next to the bar I worked at, and there was an Odetta record sitting there for $5 so i got that too: Live at Carnegie Hall.
"Rainy Day Women #12 & 35," Blonde on Blonde
One of my favourite movies "High Fidelity" has a scene where Jack Black says, “Oh God, don't tell anyone you don't own Blonde On Blonde.” I didn't own it and hadn't ever listened to it, so I went and got on top of that. This is the first track on the album and I thought it was the greatest thing I'd ever heard. The brass all woozy and lazy, and the casualness of it all, laughter 'n' background noise. It kinda felt to me like I was secretly listening in on a wild party of musicians dancing around jamming in some seedy after-hours joint.
"The Times They Are A-Changin'," The Times They Are A-Changin'
Some days I think I've written a great song but it's just this one. So I have to start all over again. Probably one of the greatest and most timeless songs ever written, with the those damn genius lyrics: “Don't criticise what you can't understand."

Regulators in the United States and Europe are conducting sweeping inquiries of Google, the dominant Internet search and advertising company. Google rose by technological innovation and business acumen; in the United States, it has 67 percent of the search market and collects 75 percent of search ad dollars. Being big is no crime, but if a powerful company uses market muscle to stifle competition, that is an antitrust violation.
So the government is focusing on life in Google's world for the sprawling economic ecosystem of Web sites that depend on their ranking in search results. What is it like to live this way, in a giant's shadow? The experience of its inhabitants is nuanced and complex, a blend of admiration and fear.
The relationship between Google and Web sites, publishers and advertisers often seems lopsided, if not unfair. Yet Google has also provided and nurtured a landscape of opportunity. Its ecosystem generates $80 billion a year in revenue for 1.8 million businesses, Web sites and nonprofit organizations in the United States alone, it estimates.
The government's scrutiny of Google is the most exhaustive investigation of a major corporation since the pursuit of Microsoft in the late 1990s.
The staff of the Federal Trade Commission has recommended preparing an antitrust suit against Google, according to people briefed on the inquiry, who spoke on the condition they not be identified. But the commissioners must vote to proceed. Even if they do, the government and Google could settle.
Google has drawn the attention of antitrust officials as it has moved aggressively beyond its dominant product — search and search advertising — into fields like online commerce and local reviews. The antitrust issue is whether Google uses its search engine to favor its offerings like Google Shopping and Google Plus Local over rivals.
For policymakers, Google is a tough call.
“What to do with an attractive monopolist, like Google, is a really challenging issue for antitrust,” says Tim Wu, a professor at Columbia Law School and a former senior adviser to the F.T.C. “The goal is to encourage them to stay in power by continuing to innovate instead of excluding competitors.”

SPEAKING at a Google Zeitgeist conference in Arizona last month, Larry Page, the company's co-founder and chief executive, said he understood the government scrutiny of his company, given Google's size and reach. “There are very many decisions we make that really impact a lot of people,” he acknowledged.
The main reason is that Google is continually adjusting its search algorithm — the smart software that determines the relevance, ranking and presentation of search results, typically links to other Web sites.

Google says it makes the changes to improve its service, and has long maintained that its algorithm weeds out low-quality sites and shows the most useful results, whether or not they link to Google products.
“Our first and highest goal has to be to get the user the information they want as quickly and easily as possible,” says Matt Cutts, leader of the Web spam team at Google.
But Google's algorithm is secret, and changes can leave Web sites scrambling.
Consider Vote-USA.org, a nonprofit group started in 2003. It provides online information for voters to avoid the frustration of arriving at a polling booth and barely recognizing half the names on the ballot. The site posts free sample ballots for federal, state and local elections with candidates' pictures, biographies and views on issues.
In the 2004 and 2006 elections, users created tens of thousands of sample ballots. By 2008, traffic had fallen sharply, says Ron Kahlow, who runs Vote-USA.org, because “we dropped off the face of the map on Google.”
As founder of a search-engine optimization company and a recipient of grants that Google gives nonprofits to advertise free, Mr. Kahlow knows a thing or two about how to operate in Google's world. He pored over Google's guidelines for Web sites, made changes and e-mailed Google. Yet he received no response.
“I lost all donations to support the operation,” he said. “It was very, very painful.”
A breakthrough came through a personal connection. A friend of Mr. Kahlow knew Ed Black, chief executive of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, whose members include Google. Mr. Black made an inquiry on Mr. Kahlow's behalf, and a Google engineer investigated.

The problem, Mr. Kahlow learned, was that the site's state Web pages also had information for national candidates — reasonable to a person seeking voting information at one digital location. But to Google's algorithm, duplicate content on a site suggests a shady shortcut to try to make a site look bigger than it is.
Mr. Kahlow fixed that, so that someone on a state page must go to another page to see the ballot and information about national candidates. Vote-USA.org quickly moved off Google's black list, and during this election season people have been viewing 333,000 pages a day.
Last year, Mr. Kahlow said, F.T.C. investigators asked him if he thought his site was a target of discrimination. No, he replied. But since then, he has watched Google promote its tools for finding where to vote and sample ballots, just like his site offers.

“At that time, I didn't believe it was intentional, but I'm having second thoughts,” he says. “I'm sure they're aware of the amount of money that's being spent in politics and I'm sure they'd like to get their fingers in the pie.”
Google will not comment on its relations with specific Web sites. But a person briefed on its interactions with Vote-USA.org said Google had found additional duplication, like Michigan candidates showing up on the Iowa Web site. The person also said that hardly any other Web sites linked to Vote-USA.org, one of the most important elements in the algorithm.
EARLY last year, operators of small local news sites nationwide found that their number of readers had plummeted. Why? Their Web sites had disappeared from Google News, which in many cases was their No. 1 source of traffic.
Their owners wrote e-mail messages to Google and scoured online forums, to no avail.
“There was no explanation why or place you could go for more information,” says Hal Goodtree, editor and publisher of CaryCitizen, a local news site in Cary, N.C.
Google News, he says, brings traffic and credibility. “You're legit if you're on Google News,” he explains, “so it was painful.”
Lance Knobel, co-founder of Berkeleyside, a local news site in Berkeley, Calif., complained about the problem on Twitter, and a Berkeleyside reader who was a Google engineer eventually saw it. He promised Mr. Knobel he would look into it, unofficially.

Twelve hours later, Berkeleyside reappeared in Google News. Google said dropping the site was an error.

In North Carolina, Mr. Goodtree heard nothing for months about what had happened. In June, he received an e-mail from Google saying it was “unable to provide specifics” about why the site had been dropped.
Then, in August, Google wrote, “We recently reviewed your site again and have decided to add it to Google News once more.” No further explanation was given. Traffic to CaryCitizen jumped 24 percent. Mr. Knobel, in California, says of Google: “It's a totally opaque corporation.”
Mr. Cutts of Google says it is impossible for the company to respond individually to every Web site owner with a question, because of sheer scale; there are 240 million domain names and people search Google more than 3.3 billion times a day.
Yet Google is trying to do more, he says. Last year, it started hosting video chats for Web site owners to ask questions. It has also started publishing blog posts about changes in the algorithm and broadcast eight minutes of a top-secret meeting about it.
“We try very hard to make sure we communicate with Webmasters,” Mr. Cutts says. For instance, he says, he reassured Gawker Media that it would remain in search results after Hurricane Sandy caused it to crash.
Google does not compete with sites like CaryCitizen and Berkeleyside in the labor-intensive chore of reporting and writing local news. But local news sites, notes Mr. Knobel of Berkeleyside, do compete in their way with Google for local advertising.
As the company builds up Google Plus Local, its local business listing and review service, Mr. Knobel says Google's search engine could give the Internet giant “a tremendous advantage.” That would result, he says, if a person seeking information about a local business is steered to Google Plus Local rather than to small sites like Berkeleyside or sizable services like Yelp.

At the Arizona conference, Mr. Page was asked about Google's competition with other Web businesses. “That's always a hard question,” he replied, but not a new one. He pointed to Google Maps, which was introduced in 2005. “If you think back then,” he said, “we had the same kind of criticisms, like ‘Oh, there's already MapQuest.' Anybody heard of them? No one uses them anymore.”
Today, MapQuest has half the number of monthly visitors as Google Maps, according to comScore.
GOOGLE'S overriding goal, Mr. Page suggests, is continual improvement of its product, which, he says, means adding more services that collect and parse data. Some competitors may suffer. But, he adds, “our job is to serve users.”
Google has argued that forcefully to regulators because in antitrust, consumer benefit weighs heavily. But this is an evasion to competitors like Mr. Katz of Nextag, who has been questioned by regulators. He says Google increasingly presents itself as a commerce site as much as a search engine, pointing to changes that occurred mainly in the last year or two.
Today, if you Google a phrase like “patio furniture,” the results are not just a list of blue links to other Web sites. Instead, you will find a few ads, shaded in beige to identify them. On the right side of the page are product pictures and links to merchants, part of Google Shopping. Below Google Shopping is a Google map with locations of local stores. Then, sprawled down the page, are the blue links.
The effect, Mr. Katz says, is that Google commerce services get more of the prime real estate near the top of the screen. That means that even if Nextag ranks high in the organic search results, which costs him nothing, a user is less likely to see the link. He and his team also say changes in Google's algorithm in recent months have hurt Nextag.
His Google traffic now costs more. Two years ago, 60 percent of Nextag's traffic from Google was from free search and 40 percent paid — people clicking on ads Nextag bought. Today, it is 30 percent free and 70 percent paid.
But his company has also shifted its strategy to become less vulnerable to Google's charge into commerce. It has invested heavily in its underlying technology to help Web sites attract visitors, especially ones most likely to buy their goods.
Wize Commerce, the Nextag owner, is based in San Mateo, Calif.; it is profitable and employs 450 people. The revised plan, Mr. Katz says, “gives us a shot at being a very healthy company,” less dependent on Google.
