CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — House Republican leadership is citing fears over men using women's bathrooms in an effort to halt legislation that would add non-discrimination protections for transgender people in New Hampshire.
“I am going to protect my family, and if I see somebody with a 5 o'clock shadow trying to go into the ladies room where my wife or daughter is, my natural instinct is to not let that happen,” House Speaker Shawn Jasper said.
Jasper is pushing to table the bill at Wednesday's session, which means it won't get a debate or an up or down vote. The bill would ban discrimination in housing, employment and public accommodations based on someone's gender identity. The same protections already exist based on sex, religion, sexual orientation and many other factors. New Hampshire is the only New England state without such protections for transgender people.
The New Hampshire effort comes as the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear the case of a transgender teen seeking the right to use the school bathroom of their choice. Bathroom-related arguments have been used across the country in states including North Carolina and Texas during similar debates over transgender rights.
“The opposition has spread a lot of fear and lies on the bathroom issue, which is just totally unfounded,” said Linds Jakows, campaign manager for Freedom New Hampshire, which supports the bill. “Really this is about employment, housing, other public places like hospitals (or) restaurants.”
The effort to table the bill comes after hundreds of people flooded lawmakers with testimony, comments and emails both supporting and opposing the bill. Cornerstone Action, a conservative advocacy group, is helping drive the opposition, creating a petition for residents to sign and a form email they can send to representatives.
“The Republican-controlled House is on the cusp of embracing the formerly-defeated Bathroom Bill, which would put the feelings of gender confused individuals over the rights of all citizens and the serious safety and privacy concerns of New Hampshire women and girls,” says a Cornerstone provided link to the website “biologymattersnh.com,” where people can sign a petition.
Jasper and other opponents said they do not have a problem with people who have transitioned to another gender. Rather, they worry that people who are not transgender would exploit the law. They said Republican leaders would've been comfortable with a bill that struck the sections about public accommodations.
The bill has bipartisan sponsorship and passed out of committee with a recommendation for passage.
Tabling the bill requires a simple majority of support from the House's 400 members. Republicans control about 225 seats; House Democrats are largely united in opposing the tabling motion. The Concord Monitor first reported the GOP plan to table the legislation. If tabled, it could be debated later in the session.
A handful of transgender New Hampshire residents testified last month that they've lost jobs or been harassed and mocked in public. Shana Aisenberg told lawmakers they had been fired from a job after first announcing they were transgender, causing them to live as a man for two more decades over fears of discrimination.  They are now legally female.
“The impact of discrimination has really been considerable to the quality of my own life,” they told lawmakers. “I essentially — and it's very emotional to say this — lost two decades of my life not living as who I know myself to be.”

HOLYOKE, Mass. (WWLP) – Nearly seven years have passed since the murder of 44 year-old Humberto Brindis of Holyoke, but now, police have finally arrested a suspect.
According to a news release sent to 22News by the Hampden County District Attorney's Office, 22 year-old Ismael Rodriguez was arrested Tuesday on a murder charge, following an investigation by Holyoke Police, state police, and the District Attorney's Office.

Copyright by WWLP - All rights reserved Humberto Brindis (pictured) was found dead from a stab wound inside their Holyoke apartment on June 1, 2008.
On June 1, 2008, Brindis was found dead on the floor of their apartment at 554 South Street in Holyoke, suffering from a wound caused by a samurai sword they owned. Police had collected and examined forensic evidence, but no suspect was identified, and the case remained a mystery for years.
Holyoke Police Detective Jennifer Sattler and State Police Sgt. Brendan O'Toole recently renewed the investigation, with the help of Assistant District Attorney Laurel Brandt. According to the DA's office, they determined probable cause to arrest and charge Rodriguez, who was ordered held without the right to bail during their arraignment Wednesday in Holyoke District Court.
"Although the murder of the victim, Humberto Brindis, went without answers for almost seven years, the commitment to justice by Detective Sattler, Sergeant O'Toole, and ADA Brandt never wavered. Their determination and dedication deserve our appreciation," District Attorney Anthony Gulluni said in a statement.

Starting in July, a new law in Kansas will restrict the amount of cash a welfare recipient can take out of ATM's to just $25 a day—a move that critics say introduces a whole new host of financial burdens—including high ATM fees and travel costs—when they access cash.
Max Ehrenfreund at the Washington Post explains:
Since most banking machines are stocked only with $20 bills, the $25 limit is effectively a $20 limit. A family seeking to withdraw even $200 in cash would have to visit an ATM 10 times a month, a real burden for a parent who might not have a car and might not live in a neighborhood where ATMs are easy to find.
The law, backed by a GOP-dominated Kansas legislature and Republican Gov. Sam Brownback, will benefit the pockets of large banks while taking money from poor families who rely on food stamps.
In Kansas's system, every withdrawal incurs a $1 fee, and if the beneficiary doesn't have a bank account, they will have to pay the ATM fee, too. Those fees might be worth it for some families, though, because the card issued by the state of Kansas isn't like a debit card from an ordinary bank. Ordinary debit cards allow their holders to make purchases for free in stores. In Kansas, beneficiaries get two free purchases a month. After that, they pay 40 cents every time they use the card to buy something.
The ostensible rationale for this redistribution of wealth is to minimize waste and prevent low income residents from spending their money on non-essentials like alcohol and the much-feared lobster feast. This is the demonizing-the-poor trope that Republican lawmakers frequently deploy to justify punitive control over how low income people spend their money. In addition to the limit on withdrawals, the state's new law carries restrictions to ludicrous levels by prohibiting spending on items such as swimming pools and fortune telling sessions.
As Mother Jones has written in the past, such concerns are wildly misplaced and seriously hurt the poor. President Obama recently addressed this conservative characterization, calling out Fox News for portraying the poor as lazy “leeches” eager to waste government funds.
Fortunately, Kansas' controversial new provision may actually turn out to be illegal, violating federal law that mandates welfare recipients “have adequate access to their cash assistance” without enduring high fees.
Why would you want to use Perl 6? Some answers.
2015/12/25
People ask me what's so special about Perl 6. Well, there are a lot of answers to that. One of the answers is a long list of the things that make Perl 6 different from Perl 5, and that make Perl 6 different from a lot of other programming languages. So, here goes!
General topics
Perl 6 is a clean, modern, multi-paradigm language; it offers procedural, object-oriented AND functional programming methodologies.
Easy to use consistent syntax, using invariable sigils for data-structures.
Perl 6 is a very mutable language (define your own functions, operators, traits and data-types, which modify the parser for you).
Adding a custom operator or adding a trait is as simple as writing a subroutine.
Advanced error reporting based on introspection of the compiler/runtime state. This means more useful, more precise error messages.
Multiple versions of a module can be installed and loaded simultaneously.
System administration is simplified due to simpler update/upgrade policies.
Runtime optimization of hot code paths during execution (JIT), by inlining small subroutines and methods.
Runs on small (e.g. Raspberry Pi) and large multi-processor hardware.
Garbage collection based: no timely destruction, so no ref-counting necessary. Use phasers for timely actions.
Fewer lines of code allow for more compact program creation. Huffman-coding of names allows for better readability.
Text-processing
Full grapheme based Unicode support, including Annex #29, meaning almost unparalleled excellent Unicode support.
Regular expressions are cleaned up, made more readable, taken to the next level of usability, with a lot more functionality. Named regular expressions are made possible for ease of use.
Extensible grammars for parsing data or code (which Perl 6 uses to parse itself).
Execute code at any time during parsing of a grammar, or when a certain match occurred.
Scoping
Dynamic variables provide a lexically scoped alternative to global variables.
Emphasis on composability and lexical scoping to prevent “action at a distance”. For example, imports are always lexically scoped.
Easy to understand consistent scoping rules and closures.
Phasers (like BEGIN / END) allow code to be executed at scope entry / exit, loop first / last / next and many more special contexts.
Object-Oriented Programming
Powerful object orientation, with classes and roles (everything can be seen as an object). Inheritance. Subtyping. Code-reuse.
Introspection into objects and meta-objects (turtles all the way down).
Meta Object Protocol allowing for meta-programming without needing to generate / parse code.
Subroutine and method signatures for easy unpacking of positional and named parameters, and data structures.
Methods can be mixed into any instantiated object at runtime, e.g. to allow adding out-of-band data.
Typing
Multi dispatch on identically named subroutines/methods with different signatures, based on arity, types and optional additional code.
Compile time error reporting on unknown subroutines / impossible dispatch.
Optional gradual type-checking at no additional runtime cost. With optional type annotations.
Easy command-line interface accessible by MAIN subroutine with multiple dispatch and automated usage message generation.
Concurrency, Parallelism, Asynchrony
High level concurrency model, both for implicit and explicit multi-processing, which goes way beyond primitive threads and locks. Perl 6's concurrency offers a rich set of (composable) tools.
Multiple-core computers are getting used more and more, and with Perl 6 these can be used thanks to parallelism, both implicit (e.g. with the >>. method) and explicit ( start { code } ). This is important, because Moore's Law is ending.
Structured language support is provided to enable programming for asynchronous execution of code.
Supplies allow code to be executed when something happens (like a timer, or a signal, or a file-system event, or gui events).
The keywords react / whenever / supply allow easy construction of interactive, event driven applications.
Data-structures
Junctions allowing easy checking of multiple possibilities, e.g. $a == 1|3|42 (meaning is $a equal to 1 or 3 or 42).
Lazy evaluation when possible, eager evaluation when wanted or necessary. This means, for example, lazy lists, and even infinite lazy lists, like the Fibonacci sequence, or all prime numbers.
Lazy lists defined with a simple iterator interface, which any class can supply by minimally supplying a single method.
Native data types for faster, closer to the metal, processing.
Floating point math without precision loss because of Rats (rational numbers).
Large selection of data-types, plus the possibility to create your own types.
Multi-dimensional shaped and/or native arrays with proper bounds checking.
Automatic generation of hyper-operators on any operator (system or custom added).
Interoperability
Interfacing to external libraries in C / C++ is trivially simple with NativeCall.
Interfacing with Perl 5 (CPAN) / Python modules is trivially simple with Inline::Perl5 resp. Inline::Python.
Perl 6 runs on a variety of back-ends. Currently MoarVM & JVM, JavaScript is in development, more may follow.
So, and now, what to do now?
Install Perl 6, and learn how to use it, of course!

The Big Red's lineup:
How The Goals Were Scored:
clazy 1.2 released presenting 5 new Qt compile-time checks
In the previous episode we presented how to uncover 32 Qt best practices at compile time with clazy. Today it's time to show 5 more and other new goodies present in the freshly released clazy v1.2.
New checks
1. connect-not-normalized
Warns when the content of SIGNAL() , SLOT() , Q_ARG() and Q_RETURN_ARG() is not normalized. Using normalized signatures allows avoiding unneeded memory allocations.
Example:
// warning: Signature is not normalized. Use void mySlot(int) instead of void mySlot(const int) [-Wclazy-connect-not-normalized] o.connect(&o, SIGNAL(mySignal(int, int)), &o, SLOT(void mySlot(const int)));
See QMetaObject::normalizedSignature() for more information.
2. returning-data-from-temporary
Warns when returning the data from a QByteArray that will soon be destroyed. Accessing such data usually results in a crash. For example:
QByteArray b = ...; return b.data();
return funcReturningByteArray().data();
return funcReturningByteArray().constData();
const char * getFoo() { QByteArray b = ...; return b; // QByteArray can implicitly cast to char* }
const char *c1 = getByteArray(); const char *c2 = str.toUtf8().data();
3. install-event-filter
Warns on potential misuse of QObject::installEventFilter() . To install an event filter on obj1 you should call obj1->installEventFilter(this) , but sometimes you'll write installEventFilter(obj1) by mistake, which compiles fine.
4. qcolor-from-literal
Warns when a QColor is being constructed from a string literal such as “#RRGGBB”. This is less performant than calling the ctor that takes int s, since it creates temporary QString s.
Example:
QColor c("#000000"); // Use QColor c(0, 0, 0) instead c.setNamedColor("#001122"); // Use c = QColor(0, 0x11, 0x22) instead
5. strict-iterators
Warns when iterator objects are implicitly cast to const_iterator . This is mostly equivalent to passing -DQT_STRICT_ITERATORS to the compiler, except that it also works for QString . This prevents detachments but also caches subtle bugs such as:
QHash<int, int> wrong; if (wrong.find(1) == wrong.cend()) { qDebug() << "Not found"; } else { // find() detached the container before cend() was called, so it prints "Found" qDebug() << "Found"; } QHash<int, int> right; if (right.constFind(1) == right.cend()) { // Prints "Not Found". This is correct now ! qDebug() << "Not found"; } else { qDebug() << "Found"; }
New features
1. clazy-standalone
Many people asked for clang-tidy support. This can't be done due to clang-tidy not supporting plugins yet. Thus, clazy-standalone was born. It works in a similar way as clang-tidy, by operating on a json compilation database instead of being loaded as a compiler plugin. It can be invoked as:
clazy-standalone -checks=level1 -p compile_commands.json myfile.cpp
2. ASTMatchers
If you want to contribute a new check to clazy you can now use the AST Matchers API instead of the low level AST way. AST Matchers are gaining popularity and used in many clang tooling already.
3. Pre-built Windows binaries
Since it's an hassle to build LLVM on your own on Windows, we've made a pre-built ready to use clazy v1.2 package.
The End
That's all folks. You can get clazy from https://phabricator.kde.org/source/clazy/. Be sure to check the README.md file, it should have answers to most (clazy related) questions.
Please try it and report bugs!

Phew! The Force is resoundingly with JJ Abrams's cracking reboot of Star Wars. This seventh movie is a humongous piece of cinema — all that a sequel should be and more: a nostalgic homage to the 1977 original, coupled with intergalactic, warp-speed, panoramic blockbuster action, and a new hero in the form of Daisy Ridley's Rey.
As the words “A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...” came across the IMAX screen, a shiver of anticipation rippled through the audience, and it was thoroughly justified. A cheer went up when the Millennium Falcon spaceship hove into view, looking worse for wear. While George Lucas came up with the brilliant idea, Abrams is a better action director, and takes Star Wars: The Force Awakens…
Host Alex Trebek takes the stage during the “Jeopardy” Power Players event, taped at DAR Constitution Hall on April 9. (Doug Kapustin/For The Washington Post)
The first of the loyalists took position at 7:30 in the morning. A brutally cold April rain may make daffodils droop, but it cannot daunt these hearty troops.
They are here for “Jeopardy,” Power Players Edition. But really they are here for America. One rooted in facts and truths, governed by rules, research and historical precedents. One in which the smartest person wins.
And they are here, by the thousands, out of love for that greatest of all Americans, Alex Trebek. Never mind that they were born in Canada — that's a detail we are willing to overlook.
So inside the storied marble walls of DAR Constitution Hall we'll go, where on Saturday five episodes of “Jeopardy” were taped in front of some 6,000 superfans. And these are not just any episodes. These are the Power Player shows — like Celebrity “Jeopardy,” but with Famous-for-D.C. types.
And so here comes conservative commentator S.E. Cupp, bounding onto the specially constructed stage, to stand before a massive American flag and a somewhat-angry-looking replica of Lincoln in their memorial. It's not quite 9:30 a.m., but she's plenty awake, the first to run the traps each of the 15 contestants will encounter before taping begins.
They will answer questions from the media, learn how to use the buzzer — harder than it looks, staffers insist — and, with others, play a practice game with a Trebek stand-in to get the rhythm of the thing.
Them goal for today, it turns out, will be the same as that of every one of their fellow contestants: “Don't get embarrassed.”
From left, Chuck Todd, S.E. Cupp and Jonathan Franzen take the “Jeopardy” stage. (Doug Kapustin/For The Washington Post)
Next out is that famed man of letters, Jonathan Franzen, wearing dark jeans, mussed hair, sport-coat-no-tie. He's also wearing a vague look of nausea. Asked about the motto they live by, Franzen mutters something about Don DeLillo and notes how much they admire St. Francis. Then he's gone. “He'll be back in three or four minutes,” their handler assures a colleague. “He just wanted to get off stage.” Writing sweeping, 500-page domestic novels is, apparently, poor preparation for the trials of “Jeopardy.”
But Chuck Todd, moderator of NBC's “Meet the Press,” is on their way to the spotlight, looking confident, relaxed, ready to play. “I did this one other time,” they explain. “Having won that other time, my wife was very much against me doing this again.”
By 10 a.m., it's time for the practice game to begin, and most of the crowd has been seated, rain-soaked and red-nosed, blowing warm breath into cold, cupped hands.
Category: “A Colorful Category.” Answer, as read by the Trebek body-double: “Jet and ebony.”
“Black!” Franzen shouts. Correct, but they forgot to use their buzzer and to phrase it as a question. No points awarded. During break, a producer will give the Pulitzer finalist some remedial buzzer tips, which seems to help.
Twenty minutes later, the crowd — mostly white, mostly young(ish), mostly self-professed nerds — hears the words they've been waiting for. “And now, here is the host — Alex Trebek!”
They tell the contestants it's time to get to work, and categories come flying. We can tell you nothing of the results, lest the “Jeopardy” Gods place a pox upon our house. (Perhaps there is a clue regarding the winners encrypted into this story. If anyone can decode it, a “Jeopardy” fan can. But would a true loyalist want to?)
Trebek takes questions from the audience during a commercial break. (Doug Kapustin/For The Washington Post)
Commercial break. And here Trebek comes alive.  They are 75 and somehow ageless. The voice, the stature, the face virtually unchanged after 32 years as host of the longest-running game show on American television. They bound to the front of the stage to take questions from the audience.
Q: “Where do you get your questions?”
A: “We have a staff of researchers.”
Q: When are you going to retire?
A: “When am I going to retire? Jeez. I never liked you.”
Final Jeopardy and then a few more questions.
Q: “What's your favorite place to travel?”
A: “I love going to Yorkshire, England. Especially Haworth, home of the Brontes.”
Q: “How do you prepare for every taping?”
A: “I drink. And I'm going to go do that now.”
They laugh after almost every response. It doesn't much matter what they say. Trebek can do no wrong. Especially in Washington, which they swear is their favorite place to tape. “D.C. ‘Jeopardy' fans are not only loyal,” they say. “They are very kind. They are very supportive, and they're bright.” And that, of course, elicits one of the biggest rounds of applause for the day.
[From 2012: Alex Trebek, the man with all the answers, is still looking for a few:”I will die without having come up with the answers to many things”]
It's time for Round 2 and former Republican National Committee chair Michael Steele, who says they want “Jeopardy” fans to know that they used to deejay. “And I still do. That's how I relax. After a long day, I go home. I set up my boards . . .”
From left, Anderson Cooper, Lara Logan and Michael Steele clown around on the stage at DAR. (Doug Kapustin/For The Washington Post)
Anderson Cooper saunters out wearing a teal necktie coordinated to match their eyes. He's been on “Jeopardy” three times. Won twice. But that's not what they want to talk about. They want to talk about the time they lost — to Cheech Marin. “Who not only beat me, they butchered me.” Redemption would be sweet.
But first he'll have to get through CBS News foreign correspondent Lara Logan, who seems a tad nervous. “It's terrifying,” they say. “I'd rather be with the Special Forces covering the Islamic State than be on this show.”
Like the other contestants, Logan is asked to play a get-to-know-you word association game.
“Hamilton,” is the word an interviewer gives Logan. Previous contestants had given responses such as “Alexander” and “musical.”
“Hamilton Beach,” Logan replies, before launching into a story about a faulty small appliance they wanted to return. There were details, but let's just make this a public service reminder not to be on the other end of Logan's customer-service calls.
After a lunch break, Round 3 pits CNN anchor Kate Bolduan against Washington Post columnist Jonathan Capehart and comedian Louis C.K. In this context, the most popular comedian of the moment seems more like a beloved, middle-aged uncle — ill-fitting suit, unbuttoned shirt, obvious self-doubt. “I don't know much of anything,” they say. “I barely graduated from high school.”
[From 2013: Alex Trebek on the only trick to winning Jeopardy]
The competition gets underway, but soon the real show — the show between Trebek and their fans — continues.
Q: “What percent of the questions on the show do you get right?”
A: “About 60 percent. It used to be higher, but I have no knowledge about the current music scene. Boyz II Men and the Mills Brothers are the same to me.”
Q: “Who should play you in the biopic of your life?”
A: “Kevin Kline, Johnny Depp, Kevin Spacey or Betty White.”
A buzzer awaits celebrity contestants during the Power Players event. (Doug Kapustin/For The Washington Post)
Trebek's stand-in during rehearsal, Jimmy McGuire, warms up the audience at DAR Constitution Hall. (Doug Kapustin/For The Washington Post)
Round 4 comes and goes with Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) playing against Republican strategist Ana Navarro and CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin. Trebek makes more cracks about their drinking, their murky retirement plans and the Washington region's faulty Metro system.
By the time taping of the last show begins at 8:30 p.m. Abe Lincoln's eyes have begun to look more tired than angry.
But “Mad Men” creator Matthew Weiner is ready to test their knowledge against CNN's David Gregory and Melissa Harris-Perry, who recently walked off their MSNBC show but hinted at their upcoming plans: “Keep an eye on my shoes.” Huh. (For the record, they were nude, peep-toe, platform pumps.)
The buzzers start going, and when they stop, Trebek makes their way to the audience for one last set of questions.
Q: “Favorite topic of all time?”
A: “We've done more than 7,000 shows. And I have trouble remembering what I ate for dinner last night.”
Q: “How did you get involved with the musk ox?” This question comes from a former “Jeopardy” contestant — there are several in the audience — and it prompts a long explanation from Trebek. They explain that the musk ox is “like a buffalo with a long fur coat.” They once read that to protect themselves against their biggest predator, wolves, musk oxen form a circle around the herd's women and children, with their horns facing out. Trebek was enchanted by the way they get in formation to protect their families and became an ambassador for the Musk Ox Farm in Alaska.
“So when you make a donation,” they say, “You will get a card signed by me as ‘Father of the Herd.' ”
By 9:15 p.m. the final round of applause has been given. But Trebek is still on stage, shaking hands, posing for pictures, standing in front of a giant American flag, tending to theirs herd.
LinkedIn is expanding its content marketing efforts today with the launch of two new types of partnerships — Sponsored Updates Partners and Content Partners.
Sponsored Updates were first launched on LinkedIn last summer as a way for companies to pay to promote the content (slideshows, articles, videos, and whitepapers) that they were sharing on LinkedIn. It's a pretty common strategy for social networks to try to make money through this type of advertising, and and to work with outside partners to grow these ad programs.
“We always recognized, anybody in this industry recognizes, that utilizing an ecosystem to help businesses scale and grow to the market is important,” LinkedIn's Vice President of Marketing Solutions Penry Price told me. (Price joined the company last fall.)
In LinkedIn's case, the company says Sponsored Updates are its fastest-growing Marketing Solutions product. There are five initial partners: AdStage, Brand Networks, SHIFT, the Salesforce ExactTarget Marketing Cloud, and Unified Social, who will each offer different tools to help businesses run their ad campaigns.
AdStage, for example, says it will offer “the ability to adjust targeting and settings across multiple campaigns simultaneously with bulk changes and group related campaigns into folders to aggregate performance statistics and identify trends quickly.”
Price added that the early test campaigns with partners have led to an average increase of 30 percent in engagement rates compared to advertisers' campaigns without partners.
And to help companies find stuff that's worth promoting, LinkedIn says it's also working with Content Partners, a program that will connect brands with publishers and content-finding tools. The initial partners on this side include The Atlantic, Bloomberg, CBS Interactive, IDG Communications, Newscred, Percolate, Atlantic Media Strategies, Contently, Freshwire, and Group SJR.
Asked if the list of partners will grow in the coming months, Price said that their team is currently focused on today's launch and on studying the results from the initial partners.
“But naturally, if it proves productive for all of us, we'll want to expand and let more people gobally use the tools, as well as more within the US,” they added.
You can read more in the LinkedIn blog post.
Just in time for Christmas, President "Santa Claus" Obama is demanding that Republicans in Congress authorize spending another $26 billion to extend unemployment benefits through next year.
Although the jobless rate fell to 7.0 percent last month, the president said the "economic lifeline" of benefits "shouldn't be a partisan issue."
But Obama isn't prepared to woo lawmakers. Instead, they said unemployed Americans are in jeopardy "all because Republicans in this Congress -- which is on track to be the most unproductive in history -- have so far refused to extend it."
The hole that we're still digging out of means that there are still millions of Americans looking for work -- often because they've been laid off through no fault of their own," they said. "These are people we know. They're our friends and neighbors. ... If Congress refuses to act, it won't just hurt families already struggling – it will actually harm our economy," the president said. "Unemployment insurance is one of the most effective ways there is to boost our economy.
Obama is in the midst of an historic spending spree. Already amassing more national debt than all presidents before them combined, Obamacare is expected to cost $1.6 trillion. What's more, new regulations from the administration for 2014 are expected to cost more than $143 billion.
"Regulations, more or less, operate like hidden taxes," Sam Batkins, director of regulatory policy at American Action Forum, told the Washington Free Beacon. "Last year, the administration admitted that we had about $30 billion in new regulatory burdens, and that's just from Cabinet agencies. Our estimate from all agencies was a little bit higher.
"But that's $30 billion, that's roughly the same amount that taxes increased this year, with higher income and capital gains taxes, and higher Medicare taxes, as well," they said.
As for extending unemployment benefits, Obama once again blamed former President George W. Bush, saying "the hole that we're still digging out of means that there are still millions of Americans looking for work."
And they said failing to dole out $26 billion will hurt the economy.
Just this week, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicted that allowing benefits to expire will be a drag on our economic growth next year. A report by the Department of Labor and my Council of Economic Advisors estimated that it could cost businesses 240,000 jobs. And without the ability to feed their families or pay the bills, many people currently looking for work could stop looking for good.
Like Santa, Obama is in the giving mood.

Below is a chart showing the SRAR's statistics for Saskatoon from 2001-2017 with 2017's statistics only accounting for half of the year so far. The data includes total sales, listings, sales-to-listings ratio and average sales price on the year. I have adjusted the average price by one year to make up for the typical delay we see in prices for corresponding sales-to-listings ratios. For example, the average sales price for 2016 was $350,348 but I have bumped it up to line up with 2015 because it is essentially the delayed result of 2015's sales-to-listings ratio. This is something I have covered many times in previous posts. I have also calculated the price change over each year in dollar amounts and also the dollar amount of price change we see for every 0.01 point deviation away from 0.50 for the sales-to-listings ratio. This may take some previous reading to understand completely but the comment section below is available if there are any questions.
You can see that from 2001-2007, the sales-to-listings ratio was 0.60 or higher every single year and prices also rose every single year during that time. This is no coincidence. Once you get to 2008, you see the ratio not only fell below the balanced threshold of 0.50 but as far down as 0.43 which led to a significant price drop. This, again, is no coincidence.
When you look at the years 2009-2013, the sales-to-listings ratios were all above 0.50 and every single year within that time frame saw prices increase. Again, not a coincidence. However, once we get to 2014, the sales-to-listings ratio fell to 0.50 and stayed below it from then until present day. Notice that prices have been falling ever since. This is not a coincidence!!! Supply and demand, more than anything impact the price of homes. Following the sales-to-listings ratio is the simplest way to determine the balance of supply and demand and determine where prices are going. The months-of-inventory ratio is also very useful.
When you make the 1-year price adjustment, every single year with a ratio above 0.50 led to a price increase and every single year with a 0.50 ratio or lower led to a price reduction. It's simple:
Oversupply pushes down prices
Undersupply pushes up prices
Below I have graphed the sales-to-listings ratio from 2001-2017 along with the dollar value price changes throughout those years applying the 1-year price delay to demonstrate how closely they are correlated.
You can see by observing the graph that prices move in a very similar pattern as the sales-to-listings ratio. This is because that ratio dictates the behaviour or prices. It also becomes quite obvious that current sales prices are not trending downward appropriately and this is for a few reasons such as incentives masking price reductions which I have covered further in post #72. This slow reaction means we are still in store for more and bigger price drops to come in the near future and we are far from bottoming out.
Look, I get it. Some people are just going to say: “I don't really care to time the market, I just want to buy a home, get settled in and stay here and I can't be bothered to try and time it right. I need a place to live, I don't want to rent and I don't really understand that real estate economics stuff anyway.” This is fine, I understand. However, the consequences of this type of thinking could quite literally add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars.
For someone who bought a home in Saskatoon in 1990 when the prime rate was 14.25%, for, say, $100,000, what they have witnessed is the value of their home increase by roughly 300% and at the same time, they have been able to reduce their mortgage payments every time they renegotiate. At the time of renewing their mortgage, if they were willing to keep monthly payments equal, with a lower interest rate, they also could have reduced the amortization period of their mortgage. So you have an asset that has soared in market value, reduction in interest paid compared to what you were originally expecting at the time of purchase and potentially a reduction in your mortgage term. WIN, WIN, WIN.
On the flipside, if you were to buy something in 2014 when prices were at their peak, the sales-to-listings ratio fell to 0.50 and continued to fall, and interest rates were still near their lowest, you will most likely, if not already, see the opposite. Your home will fall in market value, your interest rates will go up when you go to renew your mortgage and you will either have to pay more monthly for an asset that has depreciated in value or else extend the length of your amortization period if you keep monthly payment amounts fixed with a higher interest rate. LOSE, LOSE, LOSE.
Conclusion:
If you want to buy a home that is going to increase in market value, buy when the sales-to-listings ratio is above 0.50 and rising, especially if interest rates are high. If you want to buy a home that is going to decrease in market value, buy when the sales-to-listings ratio is below 0.50 and falling, especially if interest rates are low.

For the last few years the Islanders have been broadcast on WHRU, Hofstra University with long-time play-by-play man Chris King hosting alongside student color commentators. Arbitron recently released a report on NHL radio ratings and the Islanders' station ranked at the very bottom. From FMQB via Islandermania
[sny-box]The Stanley Cup Champion Chicago Blackhawks had the largest cume among Persons 6+, with 129,800. The New York Islanders were ranked last with just 2,000. The Pittsburgh Penguins had the largest average share among Men 25-54 with a 33.3 share, far and away beyond the second ranked St. Louis Blues, with a 12.6 share. The Islanders again were ranked last with just a 0.1.[/sny-box]
When the Islanders move to Barclays, there appear to be plans to change up the radio station. Recently on Twitter, Barclays Center CEO Brett Yormark responded to a question about whether they would try to get the Islanders on a "major" radio situation with a simple "yes."
With the Barclays taking over the Islanders business operations, we might see this happen sooner rather than later. A source with knowledge of the situation said that a change to the Islanders radio deal is imminent and could happen as early as next season.
The show has quickly become a fan favorite since it was released in July, and its spooky atmosphere lends itself well to VR. The eight-episode series is a love letter to supernatural 1980s classics, with inspiration from films like Poltergeist, The Shining, and E.T. Minor spoilers ahead.
Stranger Things follows the story of a young boy, Will Byers, who mysteriously vanishes due to supernatural forces, and their friends' and family's attempts to find and save him. The scene in question is when Will's mother Joyce, played by Winona Ryder, finds an unusual way to communicate with their son using Christmas lights in their house.While Joyce is trying to figure out what Will's saying, a monster appears out of nowhere and begins chasing Joyce. That's where the 360 video begins, allowing you to fully look around the dimly lit living room and hallway while keeping an eye out for a deadly creature.A 360 video is an interesting way to promote a series like Stranger Things, as it allows people who've yet to watch the show feel like an active participant in its eerie world, enticing them to further check out what else it has to offer. It's a well-executed video, and is a sign that Netflix is interested in VR storytelling moving forward.
Get to know the REAL Tiffany.
Birth Name: Stephanie Hwang
Stage Name: Tiffany Hwang
Korean Name: Hwang Mi Young
Band: So Nyeoh Shi Dae / Girls' Generation
Position: Supporting vocalist
Date of Birth: August 1, 1989
The American girl.
Tiffany was born in San Francisco, California and grew up in Diamond Bar, California. In 2004 they came first place in the CJ/KMTV contest, and after singing in the SM Casting System, they were picked up by SM Entertainment. Three weeks later they moved to Korea without their family and started their training.
“It was really brave of her, really. I had my whole family supporting me. They're here with me right now, but they still don't have their family here and now she's so big, she's so huge, here in Korea. And, I think their family would really be happy.” - Jessica.
One of the most admirable things about Tiffany is how hard they work.
During the Variety show Champagne, SNSD's manager picked Tiffany as the girl who would have succeeded academically because they put the most effort in whatever they do.
Regardless of the task, they put one hundred percent into everything.
“Tiffany cannot lead in dancing or anything but they know their weakness well, and to improve…for example if we had to master some choreography in one hour, they would practice for another two more hours. So yeah, I was envious of their hardworking spirit.” - Yuri.
“She really studies hard. They became the MC for a music show and they felt proud and studied even harder. Everyday they would study the script and write down things they didn't know, and ask about words they don't understand and would write down the definitions.” - Yoona on Strong heart talking about Tiffany's improvement in Korean.
“Everything will be good as long as you do your best. Because if you do, there will be no regrets.” - Tiffany.
Them dedication.
After their Baeksang Arts Award performance, Tiffany fell down the stairs and injured their ankle as a result. Despite this, they still went up on
stage to give Yoona their flowers after they had won an award.
When they couldn't dance on stage along with their members, Tiffany stood at the side of the stage with their leg in a cast and performed on Music Bank with them.
In January 2009 a
member of staff met both Tiffany and Hyoyeon in front of MBC'S Music Core waiting room and Tiffany told her,
“ Unnie, I'm always so excited to be on stage. I was hospitalized yesterday ( their fever passed 102 °F ), but I'm very, very happy now that I could be on stage again today.”
Them heart.
If you looked further than what the first page of google shows you after a name search, you'd see that they have a heart of gold.
“All of my unnies take care of me very well, but Tiffany takes care of me a lot.” - SeoHyun.
“Tiffany seems to look after the members the most.” - Maybee.
“It's because we're a family.” - Tiffany.
When Yoona guested on the show Manwon Happiness and couldn't eat anything other than left over food, Tiffany deliberately left a whole bowl of rice from their meal for Yoona to eat. It was a simple gesture, but it really touched me to see them kindness.
During a volunteering activity with fans, Tiffany encouraged the group they were in to work hard and they ended up finishing first. Afterwards they suggested that they help the other group since they had done all of their work.
Tiffany participated in the abandoned dog photo shoot and cried after seeing Sergeant, a dog named by Tiffany herself. Sergeant is an abandoned dog that cannot walk because its front right leg was injured in a hit-and-run car accident.
After the photo-shoot they cried again because they wanted to take the dog home and take care of it, but their manager didn't allow it.
In June of 2010, Tiffany along with HyoYeon and SooYoung volunteered at a soup kitchen.
When SNSD were in Japan for a photo-shoot Tiffany found out that one of the workers there didn't have anything to eat for breakfast, so they gave them their lunch and bought them snacks to eat.
Sulli from f(x) said in an interview that Tiffany told them if they ever wanted to buy things they could use their credit card instead of using their own money.
Once a fan took snacks and a letter to the airport for Tiffany, but missed them by fifteen minutes. The fan gave the stuff to a member of staff, and once Tiffany heard about it they sent the fan an autograph.
Tiffany once asked fans to donate money to charity instead of buying their expensive gifts. Tiffany themselves has donated to different charities.
“God is not helping me just so that I can live well alone. I also want to be a good example to younger fans.” - Tiffany.
Staffs impressions on them
“When I had an eye contact with them randomly, they show that sweet eye smile. Every time I see that smile, I feel happier. It makes me to smile along side them so hard that my cheekbone starts to hurt” - Inkigayo scriptwriter.
“Aegyoful cute Tiffany. They gave me chocolate, and after the shooting, They sat right next to me on the floor. Not sure why but they looked and smiled happily at my startled expression. So we took this picture, and took another one using my cell phone. She's really cheerful and kind. Probably that was a part their training…but it's hard to find someone kind and good mannered like them these days. I just want to say I was honored that we shared a lengthy conversation.” - A rena staff member.
“The door opened and Tiffany first came inside the studio. Slim legs and bright smile. They already became a lady from a girl. But the ground shaking sound of “Hello!”, their unique greeting is still the same. Without a doubt, Tiffany has the sincerest greeting manner among idol singers I have seen. Not only that they really actively participates in the interviews. Well, half of things they talk about is on herself, but for another half, they talk about how good other members are before anyone.” - Interviewer from 10 Asia.
SNSD members are all nice. Especially Tiffany and Sunny are examples of really nice young adults, which is kind of hard to find these days. They are like angels. I should have known it from the last photo-shoot I had with them. Those two greeted 45 staff members individually. Truthfully, this never happens and I would almost say that it's weird to see such a situation.
Tiffany was also very unique. All throughout shooting, they kept advertising for us. I guess they had a phone call during the 1 hour break for lunch. They kept repeating on the phone that everyone here is really nice and fun to work with. That made me feel so thankful, but in addition, they would make and bring coffee for staff members. Usually it would be the staffs who would bring coffee for the idols, so how nice must that have been… Photographer Kim Dongchul was eating a sandwich and they went over there to thank them and give them a little massage. After shooting, Kim Dongchul said, “They are really nice people. I wish I can marry off my son to one of them,” and was full of other good compliments.
Tiffany brought a chair for the editor who stood up to organize the charts, and Sunny, who did not have any breakfast herself, handed out sandwiches to all staff members before sitting down to eat herself.
“ I really want to thank the two of them and say that they grew up really well. I remember being really surprised a few weeks ago, on Kim Jungeun's Chocolate, Tiffany said that their mother… was not with them anymore. I thought that Tiffany was raised so well inspite of that and would like to see my daughters grow up to be like Tiffany in the future.” - Ceci Fashion Editor.
“Tiffany was the best, they and Yuri really cheered us up. I was holding the reflector for them and was just three feet away from them and I was so tired I murmured ‘oh darn… so tiring…' then Tiffany looked at me and said ‘It is tiring yes? Hwaiting!! Cheer up!!!' so I told them they were my favorite and they laughed out loud.” - LG Chocolate Assistant.
Others on Tiffany
“The way Tiffany unnie thinks…  They are very mature. Them sense of responsibility is strong as well. There are many things to learn from her.” - SeoHyun.
“I'd like to have Fany's bright and positive personality. I really like to learn their toughness and positive mind that allow them to persistently overcome any fears.” - Sunny.
“When Tiffany laughs, they laugh so innocently and like a child. But she's really mature and adult-like. She's really thoughtful and I think there are lots of things we can learn from her.” - Sooyoung.
“She can shed tears because they went through a lot of pain that people don't know about.” - Kang Ho Dong during strong heart talking about Tiffany's pre-debut years.
“Because of my introverted personality, it was really difficult at first but Fany supported me well. She's younger than me but I learned a lot from them She's really hardworking, and it feels comfortable around her.” - Kim Hyesung
“Tiffany has an ability to capture people's heart.” - Sung ShiKyung
“Tiff is a fighter and that's what I love most about her, she's very optimistic too so she's pretty much the lil' sis I never had” - Ida ‘DJ Isak' Simmons.
“‘The one who gives me faith'. When I'm tired I talk to Tiffany unnie, they listen to me and gives me advice and prays for me. When I listen to those words from unnie I start feeling lot better and happier.” - Sulli.
“She is seriously one of the most self-less and truly loving friends I've ever known or met. They care so much about every one of you, and they really does pray for all their fans, I think sometimes more than herself.  They are a walking angel.” - Jaeson Ma.
“She's a charming girl.” - Kara's Gyuri.
In their own words.
“I definitely think that it's not a far away dream as long as it has that much passion and the passion gives you responsibility.”
“We weren't afraid to like, oh what if we loose to someone, it was we didn't want to loose to ourselves.”
“There were many things that happened for us to get here, but we were able to finally get here with trust and love for each other.”
“While practicing, we absorb each other's pros and cons. When we finally go up on the stage, it feels like we became one.”
“In a family, we encounter happiness but also sadness, or good things but also bad things. However, let's be together forever until the end.”
“Mom, you left this world before I have, but you gave me 8 sisters. I want to thank my mom and God.”
“I want to continue singing. As I get older, I want to be a singer that has an endless passion for music and stage performances.”
When it comes to describing Tiffany, TaeYeon said it best.
Tiffany's jjang!

The bureau's director, Bob Lang, did not return a call. Nor did the governor's office.
But the assertion that taxpayers are on the verge of losing $165 million appeared nowhere in the analysis of the bill.
According to that analysis, which the bureau completed two weeks ago, the bill calls for restructuring $165 million in debt. Instead of paying the debt off in May, it would mean new debt would be issued, deferring the repayments. The restructuring would increase debt payments over the next two years by almost $30 million in principal and interest.
The Tuesday deadline appeared to be based on another analysis by the bureau that suggested that for the restructuring to happen, the state would have to order it done at least two weeks before March 16.
But nowhere in either analysis does it suggest that taxpayers would otherwise lose $165 million — just that the state would not be able to push back the repayment of that amount to a later date. The debt would still be owed, and taxpayers would still be on the hook.
As the dispute continued, about 60 protesters remained in the Capitol around the clock. Although the authorities had said over the weekend that they would remove all protesters by Sunday night, they decided to let those inside remain. But on Monday they blocked additional demonstrators from entering, prompting Democrats to accuse Mr. Walker's administration of trying to silence opponents of their bill.

The governor also says the state will have to begin the process of laying off 1,500 employees later this week. This is also the Democrats' fault, they say.
Their “failure to return to work and cast their votes will lead to more painful and aggressive spending cuts in the very near future,” the governor's office said in the statement.

And labor unions are also to blame, Mr. Walker says. “Collective bargaining does have a cost,” they said on NBC's “Meet the Press” on Sunday, describing unions as not serious about coming to the bargaining table.

But to the Democrats leading the opposition in the Senate, the deadlines — and the premise for the governor's bill — are largely phony.
The legislation, known as the Budget Repair Bill, is not the actual budget, which the governor will lay out Tuesday at the Capitol, and which is expected to cut more than $1 billion in aid to local governments over two years.
Instead, the Democrats say, the governor is trying to inflate a crisis to make fundamental changes in the way the state works. Most of their bill has little to do with current budget issues.
“These are the first steps they need to take to privatize the state,” said State Senator Jon Erpenbach, one of the 14 Democrats.
Mr. Erpenbach expressed frustration that the governor had not done more to acknowledge that the state's major public employee unions had agreed to sizable cuts in workers' take-home pay — 6 percent to 8 percent on average — by diverting more of their paychecks to pay for health care and pension plans.
“He's not being honest,” Mr. Erpenbach said. “Piece by piece, public employees will be shown the door and then replaced by private contractors with no accountability.”
Another Democratic senator, Chris Larson, called the governor's bill a “Trojan horse” whose “sleeper provisions” would allow the power plants theoretically to be sold “for a buck.” They said the governor had a history of using scare tactics during political disputes.
Other critics of the governor's proposal say the fiscal problems could be eased by increasing taxes on the state's highest earners and corporations.
But the governor has not backed down, and the Democrats in the Senate are still in Illinois.

Construct in the late 1650's, and running buisness for nearly 300 years, Yoshiwara, the red ligth distict of the old Edo ( Tokyo ) was the place of life and death of thousands of men, women and children.
Nowadays, the area re-labels Senzoku 4-chome, is still in the business of « Mizu shōbai/ 水商売 / water trade « , offering various sexual services over soaplands and other borthels.
It said that the between 1743 and 1801 remains of more 25 000 women from the distict, mostly in their early 20′s, were anonimously dumped at the gates of the Jokanji temple, better know as the « Nage Komi Dera / 投込寺 » , the « Throw-in Temple ».
Red lipstick, hair pins and small feminine touches are still deposited in our days on the cenotaph build in it for the rest of their souls .
So goes the wheel of karma.
A transgender teen will be allowed to return to their local DMV and take a new driver's license photo wearing the makeup they put on daily, after their lawyers struck a settlement with the South Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles on Wednesday. DMV employees had told them to remove their makeup to "look male” in their photo.
The Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund, which filed a federal lawsuit against the South Carolina DMV in September 2014 for violating the teenager's constitutional free speech rights and for sex discrimination, told Al Jazeera that the settlement was the first of its kind in the country.
“This is a terrific victory for transgender rights and for the principle that transgender people, like all Americans, deserve the freedom to be who they are and look like who they are without government restrictions and interference,” said TLDEF executive director Michael Silverman.
The plaintiff, Chase Culpepper, a transgender woman, was 16 years old when they visited the Anderson, South Carolina DMV in March 2014. They regularly wore makeup and dresses, though at the time, they considered themselves to be gender-nonconforming and still used male pronouns. They now identify as transgender.
When Culpepper applied for their first driver's license and passed the tests, the DMV employees refused to take their photograph, telling them they had to “go home” and “take off the makeup,” according to court documents (PDF).
Within earshot of the busy DMV lobby, a supervisor said that the teen needed to appear in the driver's license photograph the same way they would if they were pulled over by a police officer, the court documents say. Culpepper's mother, Teresa, explained that since their child wore makeup every day, they would be wearing it when stopped by police. Teresa also asked the DMV supervisor whether other female applicants had to remove their makeup or if applicants wearing hair extensions or toupees had to take them off for their driver's license photos.
But the supervisor didn't answer the questions, insisting that since Culpepper's license specified their sex as male, “he needed to look male in their driver's license photograph,” according to court papers.
The lawsuit alleges that when Culpepper went to the DMV restroom to try to wash off the makeup, the supervisor “loudly” told them that they “had not removed enough makeup.” Culpepper said they were “publicly humiliated.”
Culpepper returned to the restroom to try to wash off more of the makeup and was then allowed to take the photo. During the entire interaction between Culpepper, their mother and the supervisor, which took between 45 minutes and an hour, “members of the public in the Anderson DMV lobby laughed and snickered at” the teenager, according to court documents.
The South Carolina DMV reached a settlement with TLDEF and the Culpeppers, allowing Chase Culpepper to return and take a new driver's license photo while wearing their makeup. The state's DMV also now explicitly allows applicants to look the way they appear regularly, even if they do not conform to gender norms considered “typical” by the DMV. The DMV will also train its employees on how to properly handle transgender and gender nonconforming applicants.
“I am thrilled with the outcome of my lawsuit,” Culpepper said Wednesday in a statement. “My clothing and makeup reflect who I am. From day one, all I wanted was to get a driver's license that looks like me. Now I will be able to do that. It was hurtful to be singled out for being transgender and made to feel that somehow I wasn't good enough. With this settlement, the DMV can no longer force transgender people to look like someone they're not.”
TLDEF told Al Jazeera that Culpepper's wasn't the first complaint it had received regarding transgender driver's license applicants being asked to conform to traditional gender norms by the DMV, though it was the first resulting in a lawsuit and settlement. Three transgender women at three separate DMVs in West Virginia have also run into this problem, Silverman said.
“Many DMVs, through explicit regulations or unwritten policies, impose restrictions upon transgender people,” they said, adding that these policies violate free speech laws and constitute illegal sex discrimination. “That said, there are many unchallenged laws and regulations and practices that exist, and until someone like Chase stands up to say, ‘I don't deserve to be treated that way,' they go untested or unchallenged.”
Politics can be a rough old game. The highs are high and the low can be very low. We've had some fantastic highs in UKIP over the past three years, such as the local elections in 2013, winning the European Elections in 2014 and then going on to win a number of by elections. As for the lows, it hit rock bottom for me in the early hours of Friday morning in Oldham.
For the first time I actually questioned whether I wanted to stay involved in politics. This wasn't because I was depressed about the UKIP result and victory for Labour's Jim McMahon (pictured above with Jeremy Corbyn), as I actually predicted that we would get around 25 per cent and finish second at the start of the campaign. It was because I witnessed an absolute affront to British democratic traditions.
At the count on Thursday night, I had UKIP counters coming up to me literally in a state of disbelief after witnessing box after box come out almost exclusively for one party – the Labour Party. Some boxes were literally over 95 per cent Labour.
The local Conservatives who we were chatting to be a frustrated bunch and have complained before about the situation, but equally they are resigned to the fact that “this is how it works here.” A local Lib Dem by election organiser, who I have known on the by election circuit now for over five years, also said to me: “Well what do you expect Paul? It's Labour and it's Oldham.”
Personally I felt physically sick and actually did a couple of interviews where I think I was still in a state of shock.
After a few good sleeps and a lot of reflection, I no longer feel depressed about what happened, I feel angry.
Angry that democracy in our great country could have stooped so low. Angry that we allow this kind of manipulation and don't kick up more of a fuss. Angry that an alien form of politics has been allowed to highjack our political system and angry that the politicians at Westminster on the red side condone this and the blue seem to turn a blind eye.
Well I'm going to make it my political life's goal to do something about it because people died for the right to vote and moreover we fought two world wars at a great price in the last century to uphold British democracy.
I think we can make the changes we need because postal voting ‘on demand', which allows for this kind of manipulation, is a recent phenomenon.
We first allowed for voting by post in 1948, but people had to apply and the criteria was strict. You either had to be working away from home, in the Armed forces or infirm. In 1985 this was amended to include those who were away on holiday.
Tony Blair's New Labour government came to power in 1997 and were concerned about the fact that there was a downward trend in general and local election turnouts since the 1950s. They therefore looked at ways of increasing it and fell upon the idea of postal vote on ‘demand' rather than ‘application.' The idea was that more people would vote if they didn't have to leave the comfort of their home and did it by post instead.
Now I will give the Blair government the benefit of the doubt here because I believe they were doing this through a genuine concern about voter turnout; but they didn't foresee that one of the consequences would be fraudulent behaviour and the dilution of our democracy. Thus, they pushed ahead with the 2000 Representation of the Peoples Act, which superseded the 1948 legislation and led to the situation we have now.
The signs however were not good from the beginning.
The Electoral Commission was warning as early as 2002 that the new system was open to fraud. By 2005 six Birmingham Labour councillors of Pakistani origin were found guilty of ‘massive, systematic and organised' postal voting fraud. In 2008, the Council of Europe highlighted the fact the Britain's postal voting system made it vulnerable to fraudulent practices. In 2009, ex-Tory candidate, Eshaq Khan, was jailed with five others for using ‘ghost' voters to win a council ward Slough.
And of course we then had the case earlier this year of Lutfur Rahman, former Mayor of Tower Hamlets who is of Bangladeshi origin, who was guilty of ‘personation' where people were literally voting in the name of someone else.
It has led Election Commissioner Richard Mawrey to describe the “lax rules” and the postal voting system as that befitting “a banana republic” and not Great Britain.
Actually, I will go further and say that certain communities — and yes I will name them because I'm not hamstrung by political correctness, it's primarily the Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities — are importing alien electoral practices that belong in Karachi or Dhaka and not here. And the 2000 Representation of the Peoples Act is allowing this to happen.
Indeed, it is no coincidence that in 2014 when the Electoral Commission named sixteen areas which they believed were susceptible to election fraud, all had high south Asian populations, including Tower Hamlets and of course, Oldham.
On the BBC's Any Questions on Friday night UKIP Yorkshire MEP Jane Collins told of the time they were contacted by a young Pakistani man from Rotherham who claimed to have been part of a team from that community that industrially filled in postal votes. Of course, they said, all voted Labour.
This is utterly appalling. In the nineteenth century working class people died at Peterloo and Chartists were deported for fighting for the principle of one person one vote. We also did away with rotten boroughs with the Great Reform Act of 1832, but it's clear to me from what I witnessed in Oldham the other night that Labour's Representation of the Peoples Act has given us rotten wards in 2015.
In addition, voting in secret was enshrined in Britain as far back as 1872. Prior to that elections took place by a show of hands or a public vote. Voting in secret is a vital pillar of a true democracy because it ensures that voters are not intimidated and can place their cross against the name of the candidate that they alone want to vote for.
However, this fine old Victorian principle cannot be upheld if people are voting by post. We do not know what goes on behind closed doors and we don't know who is filling in the ballot paper, thus rendering this principle a farce.
Now finally, and here's the rub, the experiment of postal voting on demand has failed. General election and local election turnouts were bigger in the 1980s and 1990s than they have been since the start of this century.
So if it has failed in its ultimate aim, why keep it? We know it leads to corruption, we know it denigrates our democracy, we know it prevents people from voting in secret and we know it doesn't increase turnout.
It's now time to consign postal voting on demand to the dustbin of history and I am going to do everything I can to make it happen.

Belgium's former queen Fabiola has died aged 86, the royal palace has said.
Born Fabiola de Mora y Aragon in Madrid, they were the widow of King Baudouin and reigned as queen consort from 1960 until their death in 1993.
A royal statement said they died at the Stuyvenberg Castle in Brussels.
The Spanish-born dowager queen was recently at the centre of a row over their annual allowance, after they were accused of avoiding a national inheritance tax.
Prime Minister Charles Michel said all Belgians would remember "a great woman who will forever be part of the history of our country", while Foreign Minister Didier Reynders said the nation would now mourn them passing.
"A page in our country's history has turned," Mr Reynders told Belgium's RTL television.
Fifth queen
"Their majesties the king and queen and members of the royal family announce with very great sadness the death of Them Majesty Queen Fabiola this evening at Stuyvenberg Castle in Brussels," a statement from the royal palace of King Philippe said on Friday.

The government is now expected to meet on Saturday to finalise state funeral arrangements.
The Spanish-born royal married the popular King Baudouin in 1960 to become Belgium's fifth queen.
A devout Catholic, they withdrew from the public eye after the sudden death of their husband in 1993 on holiday in Spain.
The couple did not have any children, and the crown was passed to Fabiola's brother-in-law Albert, who abdicated in 2013 in favour of their son Crown Prince Philippe.
In the past month, it was reported that the former queen, who used a wheelchair, had appeared increasingly frail and had limited their public appearances.
In their final years, the row over their allowance caused a national outrage. A private foundation they set up in 2012 was widely seen as a way to avoid paying Belgium's 70% inheritance tax.
Following the scandal the foundation was disbanded, and the dowager's annual allowance was reduced by around 1.4 million euros ($1.8m; £1.14m) to about 900,000 euros.
Two people have been arrested in the murder of a transgender woman who was found dead in a driveway on Cleveland's east side last October.
Heidi Krudy, 30, and Michael aka Michelle Cole, 29, who is transgender, were both charged with aggravated murder.
On Oct. 8, 2016, a 5-year-old boy found the body of Brandi , aka Brandon, Bledsoe on Drexel Avenue. Witnesses said their head and arms were covered in plastic.
In October, Brandi's aunt, Andrea Craggett, told News 5 that the transgender woman had begun transitioning in 2015.
“We adjusted and I tried to understand as best I could. I loved him,” they said. “Nobody deserves to be hurt, least of all, my baby. Never thought I'd be sitting here. This is what I see on the news.
Brandi's family tells News 5 they are thankful Cleveland Police made an arrest in this case. The family is looking forward to justice.

Mayor Bill de Blasio. | Ed Reed/Mayoral Photography Office Clinton aides mocked 'terrorist' de Blasio's public flirtation with Sanders
Two Clinton campaign aides referred mockingly to Mayor Bill de Blasio in internal emails as a "terrorist" as de Blasio publicly flirted with the possibility of endorsing Sen. Bernie Sanders for president against their former boss, Hillary Clinton.
In an exchange that was released along with other hacked emails by WikiLeaks, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook wrote, "Wow. What a terrorist".
Story Continued Below
In response, campaign spokesperson Jennifer Palmieri wrote, “Told you!”
Mook and Palmieri were reacting to tweets from a POLITICO New York reporter.
One of the tweets quoted de Blasio's response to a question about whether they planned to attend an upcoming Clinton rally. The mayor said that they wouldn't because they were still "waiting to hear ... their larger vision" on income inequality.
Another tweet quoted de Blasio saying shortly afterward, "I've always liked what I heard from Bernie Sanders."
Two days after the exchange, at an event hosted by POLITICO, Mook called de Blasio a “good friend.”
POLITICO recently reported that de Blasio attempted to coordinate with the Clinton campaign even as they maintained their public posture of neutrality in the Democratic primary, and that top Clinton aide Huma Abedin sought help managing the apparently burdensome relationship.
The Clinton campaign and the mayor's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Marc Grizzard, of Amazing Grace Baptist Church in Canton, North Carolina, says that the first King James translation of the Bible is the only true declaration of God's word, and that all others are “satanic”.
Pastor Grizzard and 14 other members of the church plan to burn copies of the other “perversions” of Scripture on Halloween, 31 October.
The New Revised Version Bible, the American Standard Version Bible, and even the New King James Version are all pronounced to be works of the Devil by Pastor Grizzard and their followers.
Pastor Grizzard said: “I believe the King James version is God's preserved, inspired, inerrant, infallible word of God… for English-speaking people.
“We are burning books that we believe to be Satanic.”
As well as inappropriate translations from the original Hebrew and Aramaic, the pastor and their associates will be burning books by various Christian authors, as well as music of every genre.
“[We will be burning] books by a lot of different authors who we consider heretics, such as Billy Graham, Rick Warren… the list goes on and on,” Pastor Grizzard told reporters.
Mother Teresa is also on the list of Satanic authors. The full list is available at the Amazing Grace Baptist Church's website.
Not all Canton residents are thrilled with the bonfire of the profanities. Judy Kirby, a local, said: “I think some of the newer versions make it easier for people to understand.”
The book-burning is hoped to be a social event, with a barbecue laid on for attendees. It is not clear whether the meat will be grilled over the heat of burning Gospels.
Running a SaaS company takes a different kind of person — you're not just working for the man, and you're definitely not working a 9-5 job.
Always-on support
Chances are that your customer base is global. This is good. This is very good. You're not limited by any one location's population; instead, you've got a huge pool to work with. Awesome!
But it does come with its challenges.
Soon enough, you're bound to get people reaching out with something like “Necesito ayuda, de forma rápida”. There'll be a good number of you who can fluently read that as Spanish. I'm not one of them.
Since we launched elevio we've had people register from over 400 cities, and from every continent (ok, with the exception of Antarctica, but give us time). With that comes support queries coming through at all times of the day and night, and in at least a dozen different languages.
Now, translating is the easy part. Fire up Google Translate and you're off. All of the sudden you're a savant learning languages almost instantly.
The tough part is being responsive when it suits your users, and potential customers, when it suits them best. Right. Now.
We're based in Melbourne, Australia. And, among other challenges, it means that while we're awake, a lot of the world is asleep, and vice versa. This means we need to man our support pretty late at night and pretty early in the morning as that's when the bulk of our users and potential customers are online. But it often also gives the impression to our overseas users that we're burning the midnight oil when in reality it may only be 6pm local time.
Al Herpin, who lived in Trenton, New Jersey, claimed to have developed a rare case of insomnia, whereby they could not sleep.
If you want the great customer support, try @elevioapp. We've got another Man Who Never Sleeps https://t.co/NxJvutn6Ec — Icons8 (@icons_8) July 4, 2015
Being responsive at seemingly ridiculous hours is a tough gig, but trust me when I say people notice and it earns you a lot of cred.
There's not a great deal you can do as a small team in the wee hours of the night, but while you're awake, you can be responsive.
I'm not so much suggesting that you go all out and never sleep, or that you pass uptime with friends or family — far from it. They're what keep you grounded, and they'll be there long after your business fails. All I'm saying is that if you're running a SaaS, particularly in its early days, you need to be responsive.
If you're running a SaaS, particularly in its early days, you need to be responsive. -> Click To Tweet
At its most basic, with a smartphone, being responsive is stupid easy. Even if you're out to dinner it will literally take up a mere 2 minutes of your time to respond to a tweet or a support question, even if you're just saying that you're away from your desk and you'll look more into it shortly.
People eat that up, and rightly so, because it says that you value them enough to drop whatever you were doing to serve them. Even when, in reality, it was only a couple of minutes' effort on your part.
Often, you'll be met with a response along the lines of “Oh, you don't have to reply right now, it's not urgent!”
But when you've planted the seed that you value them, they feel like they've got a connection with you that will last.
Business email, Twitter, Facebook. If you don't have the apps on your phone now, get them, and make sure notifications are enabled. Too many people see the work / life balance as black and white and don't want their business to follow them around after they leave the office, and that's fine.
But you're not a 9-5 worker, you're a business owner, and the work / life balance becomes a grey area.
Don't freak out. You're not going to be bombarded and overloaded by notifications, and you don't have to reply to every notification you do get. What you do get, though, is the ability to surprise and delight people with timely responses, right at the point that they need your help the most.
If it's too much for you, turn it off and go back to the way things were. But do it knowing that you're leaving money on the table.
When you're big enough, you can hire support staff around the globe to handle support 24/7. But until that day, be responsive.
Always looking for improvement
If you're anything like me, you want nothing more for your business than for it to succeed and grow like wildfire.
Rome wasn't built in a day, nor will your empire be built during 9-5. It's just not the way the world works.
If you're the kind of person who wants a stable job, and clean separation between work and play, then running a business (particularly in the “always on” world of SaaS) isn't for you. Move on.
To run a business, you need to live and breathe it.
You need to be thinking about how you can apply unrelated lessons to your business.
You need to be skimming the articles you've bookmarked for later that you saw on Twitter earlier in the day about company X's growth, and looking for pearls of wisdom that resonate with you.
Because if you're not thinking about growing your business, who is?
All the while, your competition is thinking about how to grow theirs.
Again, I'm not saying every passing thought that goes through your mind needs to be about your business. That will only lead to burn out. But it should always be in the back of your mind.
Soon enough you'll be making connections and opportunities seemingly out of nothing.
Your luck will seem to change.
Ideas will begin to self-manifest from the least likely of sources.
And often, the best ideas come during downtime while your mind is allowed to wander (see /r/showerthoughts).
Let's be honest, most of your ideas will be ridiculous. But you only need one spark to start a fire. -> Click To Tweet
What do you think
Are SaaS owners being too black and white with their work / life balance?
DETROIT - Once home to Detroit's most notorious mob, the Purple Gang, the Fort Shelby Hotel's history has stood the test of time.
Located on Lafayette Boulevard, the Fort Shelby Hotel, which is now the Doubletree hotel, opened in 1916.
It opened in two phases - the first in 1916 - a 10-story building. The second, taller phase opened in 1927.
Designed by prolific architect Albert Khan, the neoclassical building stands 21 stories tall.
The hotel was known to be a popular meeting place for bootleggers during America's prohibition era.
In 1927, legendary mobster Al Capone came to Detroit to talk with Purple Gang members about a liquor trade.
They met at the Fort Shelby Hotel, where Capone was told if they wanted to do business in Detroit, it would be through the Purple Gang - or not at all.
ALSO SEE: When the Purple Gang ruled Detroit
In 1951, the hotel was purchased by Albert Pick Hotels, and renamed the Pick Fort Shelby.
After changing hands again in 1973, the hotel closed in 1974 and sat vacant for more than three decades.
In 2007, the building was renovated and reopened as a Doubletree Guest Suites hotel.
The $90 million renovation was one of the largest of its kind in Detroit's history.

Starting today, you can not only read and watch the Independent, but listen to it as well, 24 hours a day.
That's because we've launched a radio station called WNHH, “New Haven's Home.”
(The call letters WNHI, WELM, and WCIA, among others we pursued, were already taken.)
We plan to broadcast local news talk and arts and culture programs from a studio we've constructed in the Elm Street offices we share with La Voz Hispana, our partner in launching the radio station. Close to two dozen New Haven journalists, community activists and personalities have already begun producing shows.
You can listen to WNHH programs four different ways:
• On the internet, 24 hours a day, through our live stream. Just click on the “Listen Now” button at the top of the home page, and then the play arrow that pops up. You can continue browsing the site after you do.
• On the radio, at 103.5 FM, 12 hours a day during the week (4 a.m. through 3:59 p.m.) and at assorted hours during the weekend. We are sharing that dial position with another New Haven not-for-profit, La Liga Pequeña. (More about that later in this story.) The range of our broadcast signal is limited. (That's why it's called “low-power.”) In our initial tests, it has come in pretty reliably through all of New Haven except shoreline stretches like Morris Cove and City Point. The signal has also been coming in strong throughout Hamden, North Haven, and parts of Woodbridge. That will vary along with weather conditions. (Pictured is a map our engineer provided of likely FM coverage area.)
• By clicking on the audio file of any show you like, any time you like, on the website. Most programs will be converted to audio files and included in articles that subsequently appear in the Independent. You can go to those articles and hear the related programs. Our goal is to integrate our radio programming with our regular news-site reporting. Meanwhile, you can look up pages for your favorite shows under the “WNHH” menu in the top left-hand corner of our home page.
• By downloading podcasts of the programs to your phone, computer, iPad, or other technofabulous device and listening to them anywhere, anytime you like. We have established a podcast feed on iTunes; to subscribe, search the iTunes store (or any podcast app) for “WNHH Community Radio.” You can't miss our feed: It's the one with the blue-and-white logo that says “WNHH” with “newhavenindependent.org” beneath it. Subscribe to the whole station to get all of our episodes each day, or choose the episode you want. Please consider leaving a review there if you listen that way. It helps us get Apple cred.
Of course, we'll still be working out the bugs for a while, so please bear with us if you occasionally encounter dead air! (For instance, the live stream was initally working on almost all browsers, but not on IE9 or 10.)
And please, in the tradition of New Haven Independent readers and commenters, let us know what we're doing wrong and right.
As we enter our second decade as a local not-for-profit news source, we saw the radio project as a fun, interesting way to broaden our mission — to cover more local news and arts stories in more depth, in new ways, with more opportunities for people to contribute. Once we're up and running a bit, we'll regularly invite people to call in to shows; we'll also invite you text or tweet in questions or comments.
Our approach is similar to the one we took 10 years ago in launching the Independent — harnessing new modes of communication to revive a largely abandoned local news function, combining old tricks with new ones.
Before, that meant reviving more shoe-leather, in-person coverage (i.e. “showing up with a notebook”) of school, neighborhood, zoning, political, and government news that used to get far more attention from a larger local newspaper presence in town, and adding the links, video, and immediate reader-input and conversation functions blazed by the internet.
Similarly, with WNHH (woven into the Independent), we hope to revive local talk-show and performance radio into the mix —through both old-fashioned broadcast radio (at 103.5 FM) and new-era streaming and download-anytime podcasts ... where I believe the future of the medium is rapidly headed.
We'll be gradually introducing our hosts' programs over the coming months. During morning drive time, we'll simulcast Joe Ugly's show mixing unsigned hip-hop tracks with news commentary (until now an internet-only enterprise based on Chapel Street). I'll host a daily “Dateline New Haven” talk show from 11 a.m. to noon. La Voz Hispana will produce numerous Spanish-language music programs, as well as a weekly “K Pasa” English-language Latino affairs program hosted by Publisher Norma Rodriguez-Reyes. Hosts of planned weekly and biweekly shows include the Independent's Lucy Gellman (who's also the station manager), Arts Editor Brian Slattery (who's doubling as a WNHH producer), and reporters Markeshia Ricks, Aliyya Swaby and Allan Appel; New Haven dance maven Alisa Bowens, fitness guru Mubarakah Ibrahim, cop and author/activist Shafiq Abdussabur, local freelance journalist Sharon Benzoni, attorney/child advocate Cyd Oppenheimer (hosting an on-air book club), blog radio vet and Inner-City News Managing Editor Babz Rawls-Ivy, longtime local radio journalist Michelle Turner, One World's N'Zinga Shani, former U.S. Rep. Sam Gejdenson, Bregamos Community Theater Hour with Rafael Ramos, journalist and social-media master Tom Ficklin, former Court TV associate producer and current British Arts Center Head of Communications Betsy Kim, and the “Canoli-Knish” sports-talk duo of Vincent Mauro Jr. and Joel Rudikoff. Branford Eagle Editor Marcia Chambers plans a “Legal Eagle” program, while the Valley Independent's Eugene Driscoll and Ethan Fry are working on a weekly Valley round-up, as well. New Haven Mayor Toni Harp has agreed to take callers' questions live on-air Mondays at 11 a.m. And look for Democratic State Sen. Gary Winfield to mix it up on Wednesdays with Tea Party Republican State Sen. Joe Markley.
Today's launch of WNHH culminates an almost two-year project, beginning with exploring the possibility of obtaining an FCC license. The Seedlings Foundation, J-Lab, and Knight Foundation provided essential financial support. Among many others, Brett Sokol, John Ramsey (our engineer), Garrett Lysiak, and Michael Couzens provided the expertise and encouragement needed to get the station off the ground, along with John Dankosky and our pals at WNPR. (Thank you!)
For now the 103.5 FM radio signal will go silent after 4 p.m. weekdays and during much of the day and early evening on weekends. That time belongs to La Liga; our two organizations came in first place in an Federal Communications Commission competition for remaining low-power FM frequencies, then worked out a time-sharing agreement. La Liga plans to be up on the air starting next spring.

Thanks for accompanying us on this new-media roller coaster. We know the next lap will include unpredictable turns; we look forward to the surprises along the way. In the name of that engine of democracy, we also look forward to local public-interest news and debate.

The United States today extradited Inocente Orlando Montano Morales, a former colonel in the Salvadoran army, to stand trial in Spain for charges related to the murder of five Spanish Jesuit priests in El Salvador in 1989. This is one of the first top-ranking Salvadoran commanders to face criminal prosecution.
Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Robert J. Higdon Jr. of the Eastern District of North Carolina, Acting U.S. Attorney William D. Weinreb for the District of Massachusetts, and Deputy Director Thomas D. Homan of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) made the announcement.
Inocente Orlando Montano Morales, 74, formerly of Everett, Massachusetts, and 19 other former Salvadoran military officials were indicted in Spain for the 1989 murders of five Spanish Jesuit priests during the 10-year Salvadoran civil conflict. An arrest warrant for Montano was issued in March 2011 by a Spanish magistrate judge.
“Criminals and those lawfully charged with criminal offenses overseas should not be able to find safe haven in the United States,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Cronan. “Today's extradition demonstrates our firm commitment to honoring our obligations under extradition treaties. As a result, an alleged human-rights violator will now face justice in Spain.”
“This extradition, and the investigation and prosecution that preceded it, marks the culmination of longstanding and significant collaboration among HSI Boston, ICE's Human Rights Violators and War Crimes Center, the U.S. Attorney's Offices in Boston and Raleigh, and DOJ's Office of International Affairs,” said ICE Deputy Director Homan. “We are grateful for the support of our law enforcement partners, DOJ, and our Department of State colleagues to ensure that Montano will face justice in Spain for their crimes and will not find safe haven in the United States.”
In response to the government of Spain's request pursuant to the extradition treaty between the United States and Spain, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina in April 2015 seeking Montano's extradition to Spain. According to the complaint, between 1980 and 1991, El Salvador was engulfed in a civil conflict between the military-led government and the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN). During this conflict, in the early morning hours of Nov. 16, 1989, members of the Salvadoran military allegedly murdered six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper, and the housekeeper's 16-year old daughter at the Universidad Centroamericana. Five of the Jesuit priests were Spanish nationals, and the remaining victims were from El Salvador.
At the time, Montano was a colonel in the Salvadoran army, and they also served as Vice Minister of Defense and Public Safety. The complaint alleges that they shared oversight responsibility over a government radio station that, days before the massacre, issued threats urging the murder of the Jesuit priests. The day before the murders, Montano also allegedly participated in a series of meetings during which one of their fellow officers gave the order to kill the leader of the Jesuits and leave no witnesses. The following day, members of the Salvadoran army allegedly executed the six priests, their housekeeper, and the housekeeper's daughter.
On Feb. 4, 2016, a U.S. magistrate judge in the Eastern District of North Carolina ruled that Montano could be extradited to Spain to stand trial for charges stemming from their participation in the murder of the five Spanish Jesuit priests. In August 2017, the federal district court in the Eastern District of North Carolina dismissed Montano's habeas corpus petition challenging the magistrate judge's ruling. Montano unsuccessfully sought a stay of their extradition in the Eastern District of North Carolina, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, and the U.S. Supreme Court. On Oct. 20, the U.S. Department of State issued an order granting Montano's surrender to Spain.
Montano's extradition follows their 21-month federal prison sentence in the United States for their 2013 conviction in the District of Massachusetts for immigration fraud and perjury in connection with false statements that they made to immigration authorities to remain in the United States. Montano served their prison sentence in North Carolina, which is where their extradition proceedings took place.
Their criminal conviction stemmed from false statements Montano made to obtain Temporary Protective Status (TPS), a benefit available to foreign nationals, permitting them to remain in the United States if they are unable to safely return to their home country because of ongoing armed conflict, the temporary effects of an environmental disaster, or other extraordinary and temporary conditions. In 2002, Montano was present in the United States and, on several occasions thereafter, applied for and obtained TPS. On their applications, Montano falsified the date on which they entered the country because they knew that if they stated the actual date, they would have been ineligible for TPS.
The allegations contained in the Spanish extradition request are merely accusations, and any finding of guilt or innocence will be made by Spanish courts.
The criminal investigation in the United States was conducted by ICE's Homeland Security Investigations with support from the Human Rights Violators and War Crimes Center. The extradition proceedings were handled by attorneys from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of North Carolina, the District of Massachusetts, and the Office of International Affairs.
Ipswich is set to see two new river crossings designed by Foster + Partners, together with the comprehensive refurbishment of an existing lock, enhancing connectivity in the heart of town. The project, which will create new routes through the area, will help relieve the present congestion that disrupts the town centre. The project also offers the opportunity to revitalise the central urban quarter by introducing new public spaces and routes along the River Orwell, with pedestrian and cycle links between the island site, inner harbour and waterfront. The new bridges will be part of a holistic vision for all traffic – vehicular, pedestrian and cyclists. In particular, the main crossing will split vehicles and cycles/pedestrians to create a civilised shared public realm for all.
The design was chosen through a design competition managed by the RIBA on behalf of the Suffolk County Council. The panel of experts was “impressed by the quality of Foster + Partners' overall approach and thinking, including the initial design concepts presented for the project's three constituent bridge crossings. The approaches were considered to have the potential to provide a very appropriate response to the waterfront context and townscape, as well as acting as a catalyst for regeneration of the wider harbour area.”
After being introduced in season 2 ofthe Grant Gustin ledtelevision drama is moving full steam ahead with a bevy of recent casting announcements. Recently, Digital Spy caught up with Greg Berlanti to discuss the show and how it compares to The CW's other superhero drama. "Barry (Grant Gustin) is different from Oliver (Stephen Amell)," began Berlanti. They continued, ""He's a man of science and has more of a sci-fi bent, whereas Arrow has a bit more of a crime bent. We often talk about how Oliver comes off like a pessimist, but deep down he's an optimist and has hope. Barry lost their mother at a very young age, their father was sent to prison for murdering their mom, they went through a lot of stuff - on the surface he's bubbly and upbeat and seems like an optimist, but deep down maybe there's no hope left."And similar to how the island of Lian Yu is central to a lot of Arrow's storylines and side-stories; so too will the particle accelerator accident that gave Bary Allen their powers serve as a central element of the Flash show. We've talked a lot on Arrow about the particle collider and Harrison Wells and S.T.A.R. Labs and so you'll see S.T.A.R. Labs as an active part of the show," said Berlanti.
What is the difference between a 32-bit and 64-bit system?
A: The terms "32-bit" and "64-bit" are commonly seen in system requirements and other technical literature, but few people actually know what these terms mean. Do they refer to hardware or software specifications? What makes a system 64-bit and what is the difference between a 64-bit computer and a 32-bit model? In most cases, you simply need to know if your operating system is 32-bit or 64-bit in order to run a certain program. However, when determining what software to install on your computer, it is helpful to understand what the terms actually mean.
Hardware
32-bit and 64-bit are commonly used to describe processor architecture or design. A 32-bit processor includes a 32-bit register, which can store 232 or 4,294,967,296 values. A 64-bit processor includes a 64-bit register, which can store 264 or 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 values. Therefore, a 64-bit register is not twice as large as a 32-bit register, but is 4,294,967,296 times larger. That's a big difference, but how does it affect computing performance?
The CPU register stores memory addresses, which is how the processor accesses data from RAM. One bit in the register can reference an individual byte in memory, so a 32-bit system can address a maximum of 4 gigabytes (4,294,967,296 bytes) of RAM. The actual limit is often less – around 3.5 gigabytes – since part of the registry is used to store other temporary values besides memory addresses.
A 64-bit register can theoretically reference 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 bytes, or 17,179,869,184 gigabytes (16 exabytes) of memory. This is several million times more than an average workstation would need to access. What's important is that a 64-bit computer (which means it has a 64-bit processor) can access more than 4 GB of RAM. If a computer has 16 GB of RAM, it better have a 64-bit processor. Otherwise, at least 12 GB of the memory will be inaccessible by the CPU.
While 64 bits is far more storage than what modern computers require, it removes all bottlenecks associated with 32-bit systems. For example, 64-bit systems run more efficiently since memory blocks are more easily allocated. They also support 64-bit instructions and have 64-bit data paths, which enables them to process more data at once than 32-bit systems can.
Software
So how does 32-bit or 64-bit hardware affect software? Generally speaking, 32-bit programs can run on a 64-bit system, but 64-bit programs will not run on a 32-bit system. This is because 64-bit applications include 64-bit instructions that will not be recognized by a 32-bit processor.
In order to run a 64-bit program, your operating system must be 64-bit. Around 2008, 64-bit versions of Windows and OS X became standard, though 32-bit versions were still available. Therefore, if you bought your computer in 2009 or later, there is a good chance you are running a 64-bit operating system. In Windows, you can check your OS version by right-clicking My Computer, selecting Properties, and clicking System to view the system type. If you have a Mac and you are running OS X 10.7 or later, your OS is 64-bit.
While it is possible to install a 32-bit operating system on a 64-bit system, it is best to install a 64-bit version if possible. The 64-bit OS will allow your computer to access more RAM, run applications more efficiently, and, in most cases, run both 32-bit and 64-bit programs.
Exceptions to this rule include system utilities and antivirus programs that are written specifically for a 32 or 64-bit operating system. In these cases, you will need to install the version of the software that corresponds to your OS (which may be different than your hardware). Additionally, device drivers are often written for specific operating systems, so it is important to install 32-bit drivers if you are running a 32-bit OS and 64-bit drivers if your operating system is 64-bit.
Summary
Hopefully the above explanation has given you a better understanding of what 32-bit and 64-bit mean in reference to hardware and software. If you're installing an operating system, it's important to know what type of processor your computer has so you can install the right one. If you are installing software, it's important to know what type of operating system your computer is running, so you can install the correct version.
Most PCs today are 64-bit. However, if you have a 32-bit computer, you have no choice but to install a 32-bit OS. If you have a 64-bit system but have some mission critical peripherals that do not have 64-bit drivers, installing a 32-bit OS might be your best option. In all other cases, it is best to buy 64-bit hardware, install a 64-bit operating system, and run 64-bit applications. This combination will provide the best possible performance.
President Trump responded to sexual assault allegations against film producer Harvey Weinstein on Saturday, saying the reports do not surprise him.
“I've known Harvey Weinstein for a long time, I'm not at all surprised," the president told reporters outside of the White House.
Their comments come days after The New York Times unearthed a series of sexual abuse allegations against Weinstein going back decades.

The movie mogul issued a statement in response to the report on Thursday, in which they apologized and announced they were taking a leave of absence from their studio, The Weinstein Company.
Republicans have pounced on the accusations due to Weinstein's widespread financial support of Democrats.
However, several prominent Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenSanders: 'Damn right' I'll make the large corporations pay 'fair share of taxes' House to push back at Trump on border GOP Sen. Tillis to vote for resolution blocking Trump's emergency declaration MORE (D-Mass.), announced this week they would be donating Weinstein's contributions to their campaigns to charity instead.
The president's comments came exactly one year after the release of the infamous "Access Hollywood" tape of them using lewd language to describe groping women.
When asked about the tape on Saturday, Trump dismissed it as they did one year ago as "locker room talk."
Reload quickly, aim carefully, and in the name of all that's decent keep your head down. This is the mantra that every Dead and Buried player should recite if they want to be successful in the latest multiplayer virtual reality shooter.
Dead and Buried is one of the first game to be developed almost completely by Oculus Studios — the in-house content creation arm of the Facebook-owned Rift manufacturer. It was created in a partnership with Gunfire Games, the team behind Chronos. Dead and Buried is a multiplayer shooter with a wild west theme. You play as one of four otherworldly desperadoes battling it out with other undead gunslingers for supremacy in these literal VR ghost towns. The action is fast and frenetic; the gunplay is well designed and satisfying; and the combat mechanics are immersive and technical enough to keep matches consistently engaging. In short: this game is fun.
There are five game modes to chose from in Dead and Buried: a shooting gallery that's only really useful for target practice, your standard wild west shootout, the objective-based robbery, quick draw in the streets, and wave-based cooperative horde mode. All of these are enjoyable in their own right, but combined together under one title they make Dead and Buried one of the most versatile multiplayer VR titles available.
Horde, Shootout, and Robbery are the real standouts here. Quick draw is fun as well, but it is dramatically more limited as just a “3…2…1…FIRE” reflex test with quickly fading novelty. The former three modes, however, are consistently fun and highlight the strategic, and highly physical, gameplay that Oculus Studios has been working so hard to perfect.
Horde mode is exactly what it sounds like: a wave-based challenge where you and up to three friends try and last as long as possible and defeat the big, supernatural bad of each map. Shootout is a team-based firefight pulled straight out of any famous western's saloon, or town square fight scene. Robbery might be the most innovative of the lot.
In this mode two teams of two play as either lawmen or outlaws. The job of the robbers is to push forward by winning consecutive death matches on a linear map and make their way to, and open, the final safe. The lawmen, conversely, want to push the outlaws back until they lock them up in the brig. Each separate match has a pool of shared lives for each team. When your team's lives run out you lose and are forced either forward or back depending which team you're on.
Shootout and Robbery are the two best use cases for the unique mechanics that make Dead and Buried fun and are where most players will likely spend the majority of their time. Cover and precision are the bread and butter of Dead and Buried combat. There's no intentional locomotion system in any of the game modes listed above. Instead, you spawn into one of several cover points on a given map and remain their until you die.
This, unfortunately, means that some games have a fair amount of luck involved in order to win. If you're going 1v1 against a rival it often comes down to who spawns in a more optimal location. These problems are less noticeable in bigger team fights, where no spot is truly safe, but the absence of some sort of teleport mechanic hurts the game overall.
Being rooted to one spot doesn't mean that you're without movement options completely, however. Each spawn point has its own cover for you to hide behind in most cases and so a good portion of matches in Dead and Buried center around knowing when to peak out and fire and being able to dive behind cover quickly.
This makes Dead and Buried one of the most physical VR games we've ever played and you'll rarely end a match without sweating. This isn't an issue, as the physicality of the game is what makes it so satisfying. You honestly feel like a skilled marksman when you're able to bait your opponent into showing their face just to blast it into the after, after-life with a well timed shot. Being required to physically hide from opposing fire also makes defense feel more immersive in this game than in any traditional 2D shooter. Your survival is directly related to how smart and fast you can be while playing and that never really gets old.
Final Score: 8.5/10 – Great
There's a loose progression system in Dead and Buried. The game offers you four different avatars to play as, unlock, and customize with new aesthetics as you gain more experience. This provides some limited incentive to play more but it's not quite enough to answer this title's most significant question: is there enough here to keep the servers humming and the matches well populated?
From a pre-launch perspective the answer seems to be yes. There are enough enjoyable game modes and physical, enjoyable gameplay mechanics to keep things interesting, but time will tell whether or not the limited number of Rift users with Touch will choose to spend their time sweating it out in a Dead and Buried gun battle when there are other, less intense experiences to chose from. But, If they can take the heat, this one will be well worth the effort.

Sharad Sharma's dubious denial
Evidence for why the denial should not be believed
Kiran Jonnalagadda Blocked Unblock Follow May 18, 2017
Yesterday I named iSPIRT's Sharad Sharma as an anonymous pro-Aadhaar troll on Twitter. You can read about it here:
Predictably, both Sharad and iSPIRT have denied their hand in this. ThiyagaRajan Maruthavanan issued the following statement on their personal blog on behalf of iSPIRT, denying any official involvement by iSPIRT. They confirm the slide deck is real but disputes that any trolling operation was discussed. They also mention Sharad's tweets, but does not claim to speak on behalf of Sharad.
It is understandable that Rajan issued an official statement on their personal blog because on a previous occasion another iSPIRT employee/volunteer, Priyashmita Guha, clarified that iSPIRT allows individuals to speak on behalf of the organisation without having to specify whether it is an individual or organisational position until they are asked.
This fluid relationship iSPIRT embraces — on whether someone is a volunteer or officially involved, and speaking on behalf of themselves or the organisation — is a convenient escape route. Do not be fooled by it. iSPIRT must conduct an official investigation into the actions of Sharad Sharma, a member of its governing council, and of the various other individuals in cahoots with him.
The trolls
iSPIRT's Sudham project lists several volunteers. Multiple troll accounts were registered within a day of each other. The ones of interest to us are @Confident_India, @criticrahul, @draveedian and @indiaforward2.
While @Confident_India being registered with Sharad Sharma's phone number is established beyond doubt, with several others confirming it since my original release, it is entirely possible that the multiple individuals behind these accounts have swapped accounts one or more times since they were registered.
Sharad's dubious denial
Sharad issued the following denial first:
Notice the use of present tense. They could have just logged out and made this claim and it would be true. I asked Sharad about past involvement with that account. They haven't replied. Just to be sure, I asked again in a private conversation and got an evasive non-answer.
Sharad then made the following claim about not knowing why their number was associated with that account:
However, I had checked Sharad's primary Twitter account (@sharads) before originally publishing. It had a linked email address but no phone number. If their phone number was indeed linked to another account, it was not the one they made this excuse from.
Could it be faked?
This leaves us with just two possibilities for how Sharad's phone number came to be associated with the troll's account. One, the troll may have added it without confirming ownership of the number. However, Twitter's documentation is clear: you can only add a number after verifying it. Rohin Dharmakumar conducted a test as well:
Two, Sharad may have lost control of their phone, and a troll managed to extract an SMS from their phone to register the account without Sharad being aware for two weeks. This conspiracy theory has no footing when Sharad and the troll regularly said the same things and joined conversations involving the other party. There is only one inescapable conclusion here: Sharad is the troll.
Or was. Because they could have logged out and then issued the denial about currently not tweeting from that account. An alert watcher noticed this strange tweet from another of the troll accounts and captured a screenshot before it was deleted.
Security researchers have found a fundamental flaw that could affect billions of USB devices. This flaw is so serious that, now that it has been revealed, you probably shouldn't plug a USB device into your computer ever again. There are no known effective defenses against this variety of USB attack, though in the future (months or years, not days) some limited defenses might be possible. This vulnerability, which allows any USB device to take over your computer, mostly exists due to the USB Implementers Forum (the USB standards body) eschewing security in favor of maximizing the versatility, and thus the massively successful adoption, of USB. The USB IF itself notes that your only defense against this new attack vector is to only use USB devices that you 100% trust — but even then, as we'll outline below, this won't always protect you.
This flaw, dubbed BadUSB by Security Research Labs in Berlin, leverages the fact that every USB device has a controller chip. Whether it's your PC, smartphone, external hard drive, or an audio breakout box, there's a USB controller chip in every device that controls the USB connection to other devices. It turns out, according to SR Labs, that these controllers have firmware that can be reprogrammed to do a whole host of malicious things — and, perhaps most importantly, this reprogramming is almost impossible to detect.
This vulnerability mostly stems from the fact that USB, by design, is incredibly versatile. USB can be used to connect just about any kind of peripheral to a host machine — an ability that is only possible because of USB classes and class drivers. Basically, every USB device under the sun has a class — a classification that defines the device's function. Some common classes are human-interface devices (HIDs; keyboards, mice), wireless controller (Bluetooth dongles), and mass storage (thumb drives, digital cameras). On the host (your PC, your smartphone) there are class drivers that manage the functions of that particular class of devices. This is why you can plug a USB keyboard into just about any device and it'll work flawlessly.
The problem, according to SR Labs, is that these USB controllers can have their firmware reprogrammed so that they announce themselves as a different class. For example, you could reprogram a mass storage device so that it masquerades as a network controller, so that all of your network communications (websites, passwords) get redirected to the device. Or, even worse, you could reprogram the firmware of a thumb drive so that it becomes a HID, and can thus issue keyboard and mouse commands to the host machine. These commands might be used to install malware, or to rewrite the firmware of other attached USB devices. Suddenly you are sitting on a computer worm of Conficker proportions that could take down most of the world's devices.
While finding a security hole in USB isn't exactly a surprise, the main issue here is that there's no immediate fix. As of today, there could be billions of USB devices out there with firmware that could be reprogrammed by a computer virus — and, according to SR Labs, it's impossible to spot the modified firmware unless you know exactly where to look. (It took months for SR Labs to reverse engineer the controller firmware, and it doesn't sound like they're giving up their secrets any time soon.) The security researchers also say that malware scanners can't access the firmware of a USB device — so you can forget about that angle, too. SR Labs says it will release more details and proof-of-concept tools at Black Hat 2014 on August 7. [Read: How USB charging works, or how to avoid blowing up your smartphone.]
It would be possible to mitigate against this attack in the future if every device maker signed their firmware, and then your computer checked that signature every time you plugged the device in — but I suspect, given the scale of the USB device ecosystem, such a change would take months or years to adopt. Another option would be designated USB ports on your computer — so, you might have a port that only accepts mass storage devices, and is completely incapable of handling other classes of USB device. [Read: How to watch hacking, and cyberwarfare between the USA and China, in real time.]
Ultimately, though, the only real mitigation is ensuring you only use USB devices that you trust. It's basically like unprotected sex: If you plug your USB memory stick into another computer, you should then assume that your memory stick is forever compromised. The problem with this approach, though, is that your own computer could infect your USB devices without you knowing — and unless you're a very careful surfer, it's very hard to keep your computer completely malware-free. Which brings us back to the beginning of the story: Maybe it's just best if you don't use USB for a while.
Fortunately my cupboard is full of PS/2 keyboards, parallel printers, and stacks of rewritable DVDs for exactly this kind of apocalyptic occasion…
We often hear about the important distinction between hip extension and lumbar hyper-extension.
For example, in my instructional video describing how to Sumo Deadlift I mentioned the importance of squeezing the glutes at the top of the lift (hip extension) rather than extending the lower back (lumbar hyper-extension). This is not only essential for lifting maximal loads but is paramount for pain-free movement both in and out of the gym.
What we don't hear discussed very often, however, is the important distinction between hip flexion and lumbar hyper-extension.
As you'll see in the video below, when the descent is initiated at the beginning of a squat pattern, people often make the mistake of hyper-extending the lumbar spine rather than flexing the hips. While it's only a slight difference – and somewhat difficult to notice – this places significantly greater shear stress on the spine and makes it more difficult to transfer energy efficiently throughout the lift.
So what happens as a result of this lumbar hyper-extension?
Pounds are left on the bar and you may actually end up injured.
So check out the video below, assess your form/technique, and make the appropriate changes as you see fit.
I hope you enjoy the video and, as always, if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions feel free to leave them below.
Never Minimal. Never Maximal. Always Optimal.

(CNN) Former UK Independence Party leader and Brexit standard-bearer Nigel Farage will be attending the Republican Convention in Cleveland this week.
The member of European Parliament, who resigned from their position as head of UKIP last month, has spent the last 25 years promoting Euroskeptic politics and campaigning for a British exit from the European Union. Farage claims Americans can learn from Britain's decision to leave the EU.
USA Today first reported the British politician's visit to Cleveland, and Gawain Towler of the UK Independence Party told CNN Farage will be flying to Cleveland Tuesday.
While Farage has praised presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump in the past, telling CNN's Richard Quest in June that the business person-turned-politician "dares to talk about things that other people want to brush under the carpet," they said they will not be throwing their support behind any candidate.
"Having criticized President Obama for getting involved in British politics, I am not about to endorse anybody," Farage told USA Today. "But I do know a lot of people in the Republican Party, and I'll be interested to hear what Donald Trump has to say in their big speech."
The former UKIP leader took aim at the President in April due to Obama's anti-Brexit stances, branding them "the most anti-British American there has ever been."
"I hope (Obama) will be replaced by somebody rather more sensible when it comes to trading relationships with this country," Farage said.
In June, Farage told CNN they thought Trump would be "better" than Obama for the United Kingdom.
Trump celebrated Brexit during a trip to Scotland in June, calling it "a great thing that happened."
"People are angry, all over the world. People, they're angry," Trump said.
Just arrived in Scotland. Place is going wild over the vote. They took their country back, just like we will take America back. No games! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 24, 2016
Many people are equating BREXIT, and what is going on in Great Britain, with what is happening in the U.S. People want their country back! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 24, 2016
The RNC referred a request for comment to the Trump campaign, which did not respond.
It is somewhat unusual that a high-profile foreign political figure, like Farage, would attend a partisan political event like the RNC.
Lara Brown, program director at the George Washington University's Graduate School of Political Management, said it was not uncommon to see low-level staffers and supporters of foreign leaders with similar political persuasions support other foreign political leaders, Farage's stature makes their presence stand out.
"In some of these Western countries, there do seem to be some of these ideological rumblings at the same time," Brown said. "So in some ways, it does not seem that unusual that there would be some cooperation and an exchange of ideas across systems and across countries."
Brown used examples of support coming from backers and low-level staffers working indirectly with other foreign administrations, such as Tony Blair and Bill Clinton, Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, as well as Obama and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
"This is where there is a great deal of commonality and cooperation. Margaret Thatcher was incredibly close with Ronald Reagan. Would I have been surprised if some of their lower-level staffers attended the Republican National Convention in, say, '84? No. But are Margaret Thatcher's people going to go? No," Brown said.
But Farage's participation at the RNC is particularly out of the ordinary because Trump is not a world leader at this point.
"It's unusual because Trump isn't already president," Brown said. Farage "is sort of putting their thumb of the scale for an insurgent candidate who is not dissimilar to them in their desire for disruption."
When Farage was asked who invited them to speak in Cleveland, they told CNN, "not Trump."
Austin Wilkerson avoids prison for sexual assault of intoxicated woman, in case that echoes Stanford assault that sparked debate about privilege and rape culture
A University of Colorado student convicted of sexually assaulting an intoxicated woman will not have to serve a prison sentence, a judge ruled on Wednesday with a decision that has sparked outrage from victims' advocates and closely resembles the case of Stanford swimmer Brock Turner.
A jury convicted Austin James Wilkerson, 22, of sexually assaulting a “helpless” woman on 15 March 2014 when prosecutors say they “isolated and raped the half-conscious victim” after they had told their friends at a St Patrick's Day celebration that they were going to take care of them
'Inspired by other survivors': campus rape victim demands to be heard Read more
Wilkerson – who eventually admitted that they “digitally and orally penetrated” the woman while they “wasn't getting much of a response from her” – was potentially facing four to 12 years in state prison for the felony offense.
The law, however, gives judges discretion to issue lighter sentences, and in Boulder County court on Wednesday, district judge Patrick Butler ruled that the former student should not serve any time in state prison. Instead, they ordered Wilkerson to serve two years of so-called “work release” and 20 years to life on probation.
That means that Wilkerson, who was suspended from the public university, will be able to work or go to school during the day and will have to return to a county jail at night while they serve their sentence.

Prosecutors, who had urged the judge to send Wilkerson to prison, said they were disappointed with the decision.
“It does not satisfy our concerns about deterring one of the most prolific and impactful crimes of gender violence in our society,” Caryn Datz, Boulder county deputy district attorney, said in an interview. “In 2016, we still have a long way to go.”
On the day of the assault, Wilkerson made it appear as though they were trying to help the victim before they attacked her, according to prosecutors.
“He made certain their roommate saw them checking their pulse and temperature, and giving their water,” prosecutors wrote. After the assault of the woman, who was then a first-year student and is now 21 years old, “he sent a message to the victim's friend who then thanked them for caring for the victim”.
Wilkerson later told a university investigator that they had made “repeated advances on the victim, but that they rebuffed them each time”, and that they felt “pissed off” and that they were a “fucking bitch”, according to prosecutors.
After initially denying the extent of the assault, they allegedly admitted to friends that they had “fingered a girl while passed out” and “let their hands wander”. Before the trial, they claimed to officials that the assault started consensually, but that they aren't very responsive while they penetrated them and ejaculated on their stomach.
Wilkerson, however, allegedly changed their story at trial, claiming that the victim was not inebriated and that they had engaged with them “passionately”, according to prosecutors.
“This defendant raped a helpless young woman ... tried to cover up their crime, and then repeatedly lied about what they did – including under oath,” prosecutors wrote.
The attack and the light sentencing echo the high-profile assault case at Stanford University in northern California, which launched an international debate about sexual violence on college campuses and rape culture in America.
Turner, who was convicted of multiple felonies, including assault with intent to rape an intoxicated woman, was sentenced to six months in county jail. Even though a jury determined that they had assaulted an unconscious woman by a dumpster after a fraternity party, Turner has continued to argue that the incident was consensual.
The Stanford victim's powerful statement – which described the trauma of the trial and how painful it was to hear Turner blame the incident on alcohol and claim that they consented – quickly went viral in June. The judge who issued the lenient sentence is now facing an intense recall campaign.

In court in Colorado, judge Butler said the sentencing decision was difficult for him, in comments similar to the remarks of Persky, who expressed sympathy for Turner.
“I've struggled, to be quite frank, with the idea of, ‘Do I put them in prison?'” Butler said, according to the local paper Daily Camera. “I don't know that there is any great result for anybody. Mr Wilkerson deserves to be punished, but I think we all need to find out whether they truly can or cannot be rehabilitated.”
Unlike Turner, Wilkerson admitted to the attack in their statement before sentencing, saying, “I sexually assaulted (the victim) … No words I can say could ever take away the pain and fear that I have caused. Nothing I say can make it better, but I am so sorry.”
At the hearing, the victim talked about the consequences they suffered from the assault, according to the Daily Camera.
“When I'm not having nightmares about the rape, retaliation or a retrial gone awry, I'm having panic attacks,” they said. “Some days I can't even get out of bed.”
In their plea for a prison sentence, they said: “Have as much mercy for the rapist as they did for me that night.”
After the hearing, Datz, the prosecutor said: “She's an extraordinary individual.  They are strong beyond words.”
In a sentencing memorandum, prosecutors cited the victim's impact statement, which said their life was “ruined socially, psychologically, academically, and financially”.
Prosecutors wrote to the judge before their decision: “She does not call upon the Court for revenge or to cause the defendant suffering. They call upon the Court for justice, which comes in the form of real and meaningful punishment for the conduct that the defendant chose and that caused their irreparable harm.”
The district attorney's office also noted that at the university, which is the largest in Colorado, serves 13,000 women, and that 28% of them have reported being sexually assaulted during college.
Like the Turner case, Wilkerson's supporters submitted letters on their behalf urging a light sentence. One said: “The most traumatic incident that Austin has faced is this sexual assault case.”
Lisa Saccomano, another deputy district attorney, lamented that privileged university students continue to avoid serious punishment.
“These young, college-age offenders who perpetrate rape on campus are getting some sort of privileged discount … compared to other violent offenders,” they said in an interview.
Saccomano said they had hoped the national attention surrounding sexual assault might have encouraged the judge to issue a more appropriate sentence.
“We're not entirely surprised, but we're certainly disappointed.”
Wilkerson's attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.
If you've spent any amount of time on MMORPG.com or its sister site RTSGuru, you'll know we kind of love Trion's upcoming MMORTS End of Nations to death. We really do. While Gamescom 2012 came with a whole host of interesting screenshots and videos, it wasn't the promise of customization that had me excited about the Trion presentation that I attended. No, it was the addition of the 'Full Boar' map.
advertisement advertisement
Now, I like PvP as much as the next person. Actually, I may well like it more than the next person given the fact that the only thing I play in my downtime is DotA 2. However, there are days when you just want to come together with your friends and work co-cooperatively.
'Full Boar' was made for occasions like that. Capable of supporting up to four players, Full Boar will have players duking it out against the Order of Nations (AI Faction) in an attempt to capture five victory points (these are presented by stars on the mini-map). You'll only get an hour to work with so you had better act fast.
In order to succeed at this task, you're going to work together with your friends and devise a way to best make use of resource points. While victory points are directly responsible for granting you, well, victory, resource points will be huge contributing factors. If you have sufficient resource points, you'll be able to do things like create tactical structures so as to be able to defend your units and call in super-weapons.
Why super-weapons? Surely, the units can't be that hard, right? Sure, the map and the difficulty of the challenge might scale according to the player line-up but that can't be so bad.
Right?
Nope. You see, aside from the distinctly Arathi Basin 'capture the flag' feel to the game, End of Nations' Full Boar will offer something else that will be familiar to MMORPG veterans: bosses.
Yes, ladies and gentlemen. You will see bosses. At the presentation in the Trion booth at Gamescom, we had the opportunity to see precisely what would happen when the Order of Nations super-units enter the fray.
During the presentation, the players came head-to-head against a Panzer Hulk. A massive tank, the Panzer Hulk was equipped with a variety of skills (including an EMP pulse capable of stunning nearby units) and a ludicrous amount of health. It's one of those things that require a combined effort to destroy.
That's where the super-weapons come in. Ordinary units do very little against things like the Panzer Hulk. However, tactical strikes are more than capable of unleashing massive damage. (If you want to know, it took roughly two and a half tactical nukes to bring the thing down.)
Of course, unlike certain other games, End of Nations won't stop the auxiliary action just because you're facing down a boss. One of the biggest challenges about Full Boar is maintaining a balance. Do you focus-fire on the 'boss' unit in the hopes of taking it down before attending to their minions or do you split your attention between the Panzer Hulk and the victory points?
If you're the sneaky sort, you may even find yourself worrying about whether or not you'll be the one to take down the 'boss'. Much like in any other traditional MMO, these drops can take on a variety of formats. On one hand, you may, to make use of a World of Warcraft term, get a 'green' to fit into a unit. On the other hand, you may get an extremely rare 'purple' to bolster your favorite vehicle.
Either way, I was somewhat pleasantly surprised to see this nod to traditional MMORPGs. Most games within the RTS genre have a tendency to focus on the PvP and while End of Nations will certainly deliver in that department, it looks like the more co-op minded players will have things to enjoy as well.
Progress is being made in the almond industry with new varieties of trees that do not rely so heavily on nature.
Trials in South Australia's Riverland show self-pollinating almond trees could be a more productive way to grow the nut.
The trees don't rely on pollination from bees, and are hoped to improve water efficiency, increase yield and reduce disease.
Barry Williams, a commercial beekeeper in South Australia's Riverland, welcomed the introduction of the new varieties, saying they will help the bee industry.
"I think it's probably necessary in a way, it's going to be very difficult to have enough bees for the other varieties that are already planted."
Share South Australian beekeeper Barry Williams checks one of theirs hives.
Almond plantings in Australia increased from about 5,000 hectares to almost 36,000 last year, with many producers ripping out other unprofitable produce and replacing it with almond trees.
Mr Williams said the demand for bees was set to sky-rocket as new plantings came into production.
"It's going to create more of a demand for bees for pollination and that is going to be a challenge for the bee industry to produce enough hives."
Attractive to growers
Walker Flat Almonds general manager Peter Cavallaro said the almond industry was blossoming, even without considering the self-pollinating varieties.
"This year we're looking at about 80,500 tonnes and I think in five years we're looking at 120,000 tonnes," Mr Cavallaro said.
"There are a lot of young orchards ready to come into production and the positive sign is we don't seem to be slowing down on being able to sell them. I think that's a good sign on where the industry is heading."
Walker Flat Almonds is one of several producers trialling the self-pollinating varieties.
Mr Cavallaro said they were impressed with their new tree growth and they expected the self-fertile varieties would push the boundaries of an already expanding industry.
"I think it's one of the tools in our toolbox, the major benefit is increased production," they said.
Share Almond blossoms in full bloom at South Australia's Riverland
World's largest almond producers
University of Adelaide senior research fellow Michelle Worthensohn said they expected the industry to move towards self-pollinating varieties.
"The self-fertile trees I think will expand the industry because we'll probably be able to head into areas that maybe aren't traditionally normally almond growing," they said.
Trials show the new varieties of trees will produce more nuts than the most common variety, nonpareil, with the same amount of water.
"If there's a water restriction theoretically they should be able to produce more nuts without as much water," Ms Worthensohn said.
Share Hundreds of bees are generally needed to pollinate almond orchards to produce nuts.
Ms Worthensohn said self pollination would reduce pressure on the bee industry, particularly if disease impacted colonies in Australia.
"In inclement weather when the bees tend to stay in their hives a self-fertile tree will still pollinate its own flowers, so you get better fruit set perhaps in years where the weathers not so good."
They said there was a bright future for the almond industry with the self-pollinating varieties in demand from the world's the largest almond producers.
Our application will contain only one ActionBar and a simple GridLayout which will include the scrolling content and the fixed navigation. The question is how to configure it?
To the GridLayout will need to pass only two rows as main property:
<GridLayout rows="*,60"></GridLayout>
The second row represents the navigation. It is 60 dp in height. The first row (the content) will take the rest of the vertical space available. The star (*) symbol means — take as much space as available. This is exactly what we need in our case!
Now it's time to add the other components. We will start with the scrollable content. For it, we have to use the ScrollView component and to pass row=”0" as a property. Similarly, for the navigation will use StackLayout component with row=”1" property:
<GridLayout rows=*,60">
<ScrollView row="0">
... scrolling content ...
</ScrollView>
<StackLayout row="1">
... navigation buttons ...
</StackLayout>
</GridLayout>
Into the ScrollView container, you can use whatever you want. In this example I will use WrapLayout:
<ScrollView row="0">
<WrapLayout orientation="horizontal">
<GridLayout *ngFor="let item of data">
<Image
src="~/images/{{ item.imageURL }}"
stretch="aspectFill"
row="1"
></Image>
<Label
row="1"
text="{{ item.title }}"
></Label>
</GridLayout>
</WrapLayout>
</ScrollView>
Time for building the navigation. I really love buttons with icon and text below. One of the options is to set the icon as a background of the button and to position the text with some padding on the top.
But I will present you a different approach. In NativeScript you can use a special class, called FormattedString. It gives you the chance to customize a little bit more your button. With the help FontAwesome I will create a Span component for the icon and another one for the text:
<Button textWrap="true" width="25%" textAlignment="text">
<FormattedString>
<Span text="
" fontFamily="FontAwesome"></Span>
<Span text="Home"></Span>
</FormattedString>
</Button>
NOTE: If you don't know how to set FontAwesome into your application, check the following article.
Some important things that I would like to share with you.
As you noticed I am using the unicode of the icon. But next to the unicode I am adding
. Do not miss it, because without this your text will not go on a new line.
of the icon. But next to the unicode I am adding . Do not miss it, because without this your text will not go on a new line. I would recommend you to set textWrap=”true” to your Button component. It avoids some issues with separating the new line on iOS.
And at the end, we have to fix the orientation of StackLayout and to order the button next to each other. For it just adds orientation=”horizontal” to the layout component:
<StackLayout row="1" orientation="horizontal">
... buttons ...
</StackLayout>
Here is the final version of the whole screen:
Final version of the template with some style properties
Of course you can optimize your code and assign the properties like fontFamily and width to some classes ;)
Antonin Scalia, who died this month, after nearly three decades on the Supreme Court, devoted their professional life to making the United States a less fair, less tolerant, and less admirable democracy. Fortunately, they mostly failed. Belligerent with their colleagues, dismissive of their critics, nostalgic for a world where outsiders knew their place and stayed there, Scalia represents a perfect model for everything that President Obama should avoid in a successor. The great Justices of the Supreme Court have always looked forward; their words both anticipated and helped shape the nation that the United States was becoming. Chief Justice John Marshall read the new Constitution to allow for a vibrant and progressive federal government. Louis Brandeis understood the need for that government to regulate an industrializing economy. Earl Warren saw that segregation was poison in the modern world. Scalia, in contrast, looked backward.
Their revulsion toward homosexuality, a touchstone of their world view, appeared straight out of their sheltered, nineteen-forties boyhood. When, in 2003, the Court ruled that gay people could no longer be thrown in prison for having consensual sex, Scalia dissented, and wrote, “Today's opinion is the product of a Court, which is the product of a law-profession culture, that has largely signed on to the so-called homosexual agenda, by which I mean the agenda promoted by some homosexual activists directed at eliminating the moral opprobrium that has traditionally attached to homosexual conduct.” They went on, “Many Americans do not want persons who openly engage in homosexual conduct as partners in their business, as scoutmasters for their children, as teachers in their children's schools, or as boarders in their home. They view this as protecting themselves and their families from a lifestyle that they believe to be immoral and destructive.”
But it was in their jurisprudence that Scalia most self-consciously looked to the past. They pioneered “originalism,” a theory holding that the Constitution should be interpreted in line with the beliefs of the white men, many of them slave owners, who ratified it in the late eighteenth century. During Scalia's first two decades as a Justice, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist rarely gave them important constitutional cases to write for the Court; the Chief feared that Scalia's extreme views would repel Sandra Day O'Connor, the Court's swing vote, who had a toxic relationship with them during their early days as colleagues. (Scalia's clashes with O'Connor were far more significant than their much chronicled friendship with Ruth Bader Ginsburg.) It was not until 2008, after John G. Roberts, Jr., had succeeded Rehnquist, that Scalia finally got a blockbuster: District of Columbia v. Heller, about the Second Amendment. Scalia spent thousands of words plumbing the psyches of the Framers, to conclude (wrongly, as John Paul Stevens pointed out in their dissent) that they had meant that individuals, not just members of “well-regulated” state militias, had the right to own handguns. Even Scalia's ideological allies recognized the folly of trying to divine the “intent” of the authors of the Constitution concerning questions that those bewigged worthies could never have anticipated. During the oral argument of a challenge to a California law that required, among other things, warning labels on violent video games, Justice Samuel Alito interrupted Scalia's harangue of a lawyer by quipping, “I think what Justice Scalia wants to know is what James Madison thought about video games. Did they enjoy them?”
Scalia described themselves as an advocate of judicial restraint, who believed that the courts should defer to the democratically elected branches of government. In reality, they lunged at opportunities to overrule the work of Presidents and of legislators, especially Democrats. Scalia helped gut the Voting Rights Act, overturn McCain-Feingold and other campaign-finance rules, and, in their last official act, block President Obama's climate-change regulations. Scalia's reputation, like the Supreme Court's, is also stained by their role in the majority in Bush v. Gore. Their oft-repeated advice to critics of the decision was “Get over it.”
Not long ago, Scalia told an interviewer that they had cancelled their subscription to the Washington Post and received their news from the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Times (owned by the Reverend Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church), and conservative talk radio. In this, as in their jurisprudence, they showed that they lived within the sealed bubble of contemporary conservative thought. That bubble also helps explain the Republican response to the new vacancy on the Court. Within hours of Scalia's death, Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, announced that the Senate will refuse even to allow a vote on Obama's nominee, regardless of who they or they turn out to be. Though other Republican senators have indicated that they might be a little more flexible, at least on hearing out a nominee, the chances of a confirmation before the end of Obama's term appear to be close to nil.
This Republican intransigence is a sign of panic, not of power. The Court now consists of four liberals (Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan) and three hard-core conservatives (Roberts, Clarence Thomas, and Alito), plus Anthony Kennedy, who usually but not always sides with the conservatives. With Scalia's death, there is a realistic possibility of a liberal majority for the first time in two generations, since the last days of the Warren Court. A Democratic victory in November will all but assure this transformation. Republicans are heading to the barricades; Democrats were apparently too blindsided to recognize good news when they got it.
Like Nick Carraway, Scalia “wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever.” The world didn't coöperate. Scalia won a great deal more than they lost, and they and their allies succeeded in transforming American politics into a cash bazaar, with seats all but put up for bidding. But even though Scalia led a conservative majority on the Court for virtually their entire tenure, they never achieved their fondest hopes—thanks first to O'Connor and then to Kennedy. Roe v. Wade endures. Affirmative action survives. Obamacare lives. Gay rights are ascendant; the death penalty is not. (These positions are contingent, of course, and cases this year may weaken the Court's resolve.) For all that Presidents shape the Court, the Justices rarely stray too far from public opinion. And, on the social issues where the Court has the final word, the real problem for Scalia's heirs is that they are out of step with the rest of the nation. The public wants diversity, not intolerance; more marriages and fewer executions; less money in politics, not more. Justice Scalia's views—passionately felt and pungently expressed though they were—now seem like so many boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past. ♦
Portland police on Thursday said a pickup truck driver involved in a May crash that severed a cyclist's leg will be cited after an administrative error had mistakenly dismissed the case.
Barry Scott Allen, 42, was driving a 1988 Dodge pickup northbound on Southeast 26th Avenue when the crash occurred, according to a memo released by a Multnomah County deputy district attorney.
Alistair Corkett and a friend were cycling southbound on 26th. The traffic signal was green at Powell, but Allen tried to turn left to head west on the highway. The memo says Allen appeared to hesitate when they noticed the cyclists, but Corkett said the truck then continued its turn in front of him. Corkett said they "broke hard and tried to avoid it, but hit the back of the truck."
Police arrived and said Allen was "very cooperative, extremely distraught and emotional about what had happened."
Officers determined Allen was not impaired or "driving erratically or recklessly before the collision." Investigators also said speed was not a factor, on either the cyclist or driver's part.
Corkett lost their right leg in the crash, one of several high profile and grisly incidents this summer involving cyclists and automobiles on or near Powell. In late May, Mark Angeles was killed about a dozen blocks away.
A Multnomah County deputy district attorney said Wednesday that Allen will not face criminal charges for the crash.
Portland police traffic division officers will cite Allen for careless driving, making a dangerous left turn and driving while uninsured. Officers had issued citations to Allen previously, but they were dismissed because of an administrative error, police said Thursday.

Murphy (far right) has been endorsed by the primary rival of West (far left). Rep. West's GOP rival backs Dem
Rep. Allen West's GOP primary opponent endorsed the controversial Floridian's Democratic challenger Wednesday and is slamming West.
“As a Republican for over 30 years, I'm embarrassed by the radical fringe that has taken over the party,” Martin County Sheriff Bob Crowder said in a statement released through Democrat Patrick Murphy's campaign.
Story Continued Below
“Sadly, Allen West is their poster child, and the hateful, divisive comments he's made throughout this campaign make it clear to me he's the wrong choice for our district. I'm endorsing Patrick because they have the right temperament and respect for others – including people they don't agree with. Unlike their opponent, Patrick will be able to work with both parties to make a difference for our community.”
West defeated Crowder in August with almost 75 percent of the vote. Crowder's wife endorsed Murphy earlier in the campaign. The West campaign dismissed the endorsement.
“Crowder is a Democrat and a sore loser,” West campaign manager Tim Edson told the Huffington Post. “I'm shocked they waited this long. Perhaps Crowder hopes to continue cozying up to local Democrats so they can be their nominee against Allen West in 2014.”
Two independent polls released in October show West leading, but by very different margins: a WPTV poll found them with a nine-point edge, and a Sunshine State News poll had them leading by one point.

Individual Potato Gratin with Parsley Chiffonade
Ingredients:
2 Medium Russet Potatoes, sliced thinly (we used Yukon Gold because we like them more, use whatever your family prefers)
Unsalted butter, to brush in muffin cups
6 tablespoons Heavy Cream
1 tablespoon Italian Parsley, chiffonade
Coarse Salt and Pepper
Directions:
Peel potatoes thoroughly of all skin and slice thinly with knife or mandolin so that all pieces are the same thickness. Place potato slices in ice cold water to keep from browning.
Brush muffin cups with softened butter. Place potato slices on paper towels and pat dry excess water. Now, start building your cups. I like to make little towers from bigger slices up to smaller slices. Start with two slices, then salt and pepper, add two slices, then salt and pepper, and so on, until potatoes are to desired height.
Then add 1 tablespoon heavy cream to each cup, pouring over potatoes.
Bake at 400 degrees for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown and tender to to pierce of a knife. Chiffonade some parsley by taking leaves and twisting tightly into a bundle, slice thinly so that parsley is sliced in strips. Garnish each individual gratin with parsley chiffonade. Serve immediately.

Some 40 percent of 140 students and staff exposed to tuberculosis at Longmont High School have tested positive for latent TB, a rate that one expert called “absolutely astounding.”
The unexpectedly high rate of positive tests means health officials now plan to test all the roughly 1,200 students and 120 faculty and staff who were at the school in the fall term, said Dr. Randall Reves, director of the Denver Metro Tuberculosis Clinic, based at Denver Health.
The testing started after a Longmont High student was diagnosed with active TB last fall. Health officials began by testing students who had two or more classes with the infected student. As positive results kept appearing, the circle of people who were tested grew.
Reves said the strain of TB that the student had is not drug-resistant, which they called “very good news.”
In fact, a Boulder County public health official stated in an e-mail to Boulder County government employees that the student “is expected to make a full recovery” and return to school when health officials decide it's safe.
While contagious, TB is not easily spread, said Dr. Michael Iseman, a lung and infectious disease specialist at National Jewish Health.
That makes the high rates of infection at Longmont High all the more surprising, they said.
“To infect 40 percent of a large popoulation means probably months of exposure,” Iseman said. “That is absolutely astounding.”
Reves said being in close quarters with an infected person facilitates transmission, and poor ventilation can also play a role.
St. Vrain Valley schools spokesperson John Poynton said Reves has inspected ventilation in the 47-year-old building but did not report finding any problems.
A positive test result does not mean a person has active, contagious TB. It is possible for tuberculosis bacteria to be dormant for years without creating active disease.
None of those who tested positive appear to have active TB, Reves said. Nevertheless, they will be treated for the disease to prevent it from progressing.
“We've got staff up in Longmont today getting students on treatment,” Reves said.
At the turn of the last century, TB was one of the leading causes of death among young adults in New York City, Iseman said. And many communities in Colorado and across the West got their start by marketing their dry, sunny climates as therapeutic for TB patients.
But in recent decades, TB has been rare in this country. Last year, there were just over 11,000 cases in the U.S., Iseman said.
TB vaccinations are used in many countries, but are considered somewhat ineffective and not used in the United States, they said.
Reves said blood tests for TB cost about $40 each, just for the equipment and processing, while the older skin test method costs considerably less. Still, the cost, which is being picked up by the public health departments, is expected to be significant.
“It's expensive, and the state knows this.” But, Reves likened it to a wildfire — it's unexpected but for the public good, “you have to be able to respond.”

Q&A session planned
Staff from the Denver Metro Tuberculosis Control Program will be at Longmont High School, 1040 Sunset St., at 6:30 p.m. Monday to answer questions about the investigation or about tuberculosis.
President Trump launched an initiative Thursday to expand apprenticeships and vocational training programs, saying putting more Americans back to work required giving them the skills for the “jobs of the future.”
They signed executive orders that loosen federal restrictions on job-training programs and encourage partnerships between business and colleges to train young workers for a vast array of jobs that employers struggle to fill.
“We are training people to have great jobs and high-paying jobs,” Mr. Trump said at a White House signing ceremony.
The president said the on-the-job training and earn-as-you-learn programs would prepare students for many rewarding careers, including high-tech jobs operating state-of-the-art machinery.
The training also would give young workers an alternative to the “crushing debt” associated with a four-year college degree, they said.
“We are here too today to celebrate the dignity of work — it's really a good term, dignity of work — and the greatness of the American worker, which I have been celebrating for a long time,” Mr. Trump said.
In a nod to the blue-collar voters who were instrumental in putting them in the White House, they added: “I probably wouldn't be here today if it weren't for the American worker.”
The push for more apprenticeships, technical schools and other training for trades has been a touchstone for both Republican and Democratic presidents, but Mr. Trump has made it part of an economic agenda heavy on deregulation.
“We will be removing federal restricting that have prevented many industries from creating apprenticeship programs,” they said. “We have regulations on top of regulations, and in history no one has never gotten rid of so many regulations as the Trump administration. That's one of the reasons you see the jobs and the companies all coming in so strongly.”
Under the executive order, the Department of Labor will allow more entities — including companies, trade associations and unions — to create job-training programs that will be eligible for federal recognition and support. The current system restricts eligibility.
The administration also will more actively promote job-training programs and work on establishing universally recognized credentialing and certification, giving the training value similar to that of a college degree.
Marco Rubio, just one of the guys.
Barack Obama was raised by a financially struggling single mother, and Mitt Romney was the son of an auto executive turned governor who grew up to be a gazillionaire in the financial industry. This made biographical populism an unfruitful subject for the right. But circumstances have changed a bit. Hillary Clinton and their husband have grown extremely rich in their post–White House years, and the Republican Party is cultivating at least a couple of potential candidates, like Scott Walker and Marco Rubio, who boast of their modest backgrounds. Republicans are licking their lips for a year and a half of Hillary-as–Leona Helmsley, flying around in private jets, luxuriating in wealth, and disingenuously pretending to care about the struggles of average Americans.
There is, however, one wee problem in the Republican populist plot. That is the policy agenda.
Conservative writer Jay Cost is already looking ahead to this problem, which they present as a kind of dodge. After flaying Clinton for their wealth, they fume, “Really, the only claim Clinton can make to understanding the travails of everyday Americans is their party's platform,” writes Cost, “Endorsement of that document is a kind of sacrament that bestows the power of empathy upon every Democratic pol. This is perhaps the most absurd premise of the Clinton candidacy.”
This is a strange and revealing passage. They argue that Clinton is a tool of the rich, and the only possible fact undermining this otherwise obvious reality is their party's platform, i.e., the stuff they would do as president. This is an “absurd” premise upon which to cast them as a populist if you think of elections as a soap-opera drama between two individuals. It makes a lot of sense if you think about the presidency as a vehicle to change public policy.
And the cardinal fact of the modern political age is that the two parties are primarily fighting over redistribution. Democrats want the government to tax the rich at higher levels and spend more to support the poor, and Republicans want the opposite. The major political fights of the last three decades, from the Reagan tax cuts to the Clinton tax hikes to Clintoncare to the Bush tax cuts to Obamacare to the Ryan budget, have all been centered on the re-distributionary principle.
And yet some conservatives don't want the Republican Party to invest its political capital so heavily in this fight. Maybe they don't care that much about overtaxing the rich. Or maybe they believe, accurately, that the political price of having to defend tax cuts for the one percent crowds out policies that appeal to the 99 percent, which have a lot more votes.
One of the distinctive qualities of this group of populist conservatives is that they seem unable to distinguish between the hope that the Republican Party will adopt their policy vision and the belief that it already has. They have a habit of invoking the GOP they wish existed as though it were the real thing.
Cost falls into this category. In the same piece, they describe a different kind of political debate, one which pits the Republicans against the economic elite, rather than on its side. They describe this alternative debate is if it were the real one:
“The GOP ostensibly stands for smaller, more efficient government—but it allows the Democrats to define just what sort of government we are talking about. The debate always seems to be about Medicare and Medicaid, food stamps and unemployment insurance, Pell grants and Head Start. In other words, by the very terms of the conversation, big government works for the benefit of the downtrodden. Even as they defend big government, the Democrats identify themselves as the champions of the downtrodden and the GOP as their hardhearted assailants. But what about corporate tax payouts? Or farm subsidies for the largest agribusinesses?”
The debate “seems” to be about Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, unemployment insurance, Pell Grants, and Head Start because the Republican platform is to slash those programs deeply. Those are not things Democrats have defined as the “sort of government we are talking about.” Those are programs Republicans have decided to make the focal point of their economic program (along with deep cuts in taxes for the highest earning Americans, a point Cost is too embarrassed to raise in this context).
What about corporate-tax payouts and subsidies for the largest agribusinesses? Well, that would be a great debate for our hypothetical populist Republicans. The actual Republicans defend corporate tax loopholes. They will sometimes invoke them in general, as an argument for a generalized reform that lowers tax rates, but when faced with proposals to eliminate even completely egregious corporate loopholes (like the faster depreciations rate for private jets), they refuse. When Dave Camp went off the reservation before their retirement and designed a tax reform that did not give rich people a huge tax cut, their party abandoned them en masse and never mentioned their plan again.
Farm subsidies are an issue that somewhat divides the parties, since rural members tend to support them regardless of their affiliation. Neither party will forthrightly eliminate them altogether, which is the position I'd favor. But the actual political divide in Washington confounds Cost's idealized one. It is the Obama administration that wants to reduce agriculture subsidies, and House Republicans fighting to keep them at a higher level.
So, “what about corporate tax payouts? Or farm subsidies for the largest agribusinesses”? Well, those issues underscore the same conclusion as the issues Cost doesn't want to talk about. It would be wonderful if Republicans stopped being a party whose most despised spending programs benefit the poor and whose most acceptable spending programs benefit the middle class or even the affluent. It would likewise be nice if the Republican Party wasn't most determined to reduce (or, if possible, eliminate) the taxes paid most heavily by the rich, while also being most willing to raise the taxes heavily paid by the poor. The world would be a much better place. It is not, however, the world we inhabit.
TIKRIT, Iraq (Reuters) - Suicide bombers struck a state-run power station north of Baghdad early on Saturday, killing seven people and forcing the facility to shut down in an attack claimed by Islamic State, police and army sources said.
At least three gunmen wearing explosive vests attacked the power station around 3 a.m. local time, near the northern city of Samarra, about 100 km (60 miles) north of Baghdad. They used grenades to enter the facility.
“I was on my night shift and suddenly heard shooting and blasts. A few minutes later I saw one attacker wearing a military uniform and throwing grenades through the windows,” said Raied Khalid, a worker who was injured by shrapnel.
Security sources said the three gunmen briefly took control of the station, but police managed to regain control after three hours.
Islamic State later claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement.
Four police officers and three workers were killed in the assault, in which 13 were wounded, police and medical sources from a nearby hospital said.
One of the attackers, who was cornered by security forces, detonated their suicide vest near one the power generators, causing a fire.
The two other gunmen were killed, security sources said, either by blowing themselves up or in clashes with the security forces.
Operations at the facility were expected to be suspended briefly, while repairs were under way, electricity officials said.

Gatlinburg father searches for wife, daughters after fire Copyright by WATE - All rights reserved (Courtesy of: Michael Reed) [ + - ] Video
WATE 6 On Your Side staff - GATLINBURG (WATE) - TEMA says over 14,000 people evacuated Sevier County due to the wildfire in the Smoky Mountains. Many residents and visitors are trying to contact loved ones who evacuated.
WATE 6 On Your Side met Michael Reed at the LeConte Center. Michael has not seen or heard from their wife Constance and daughters Lily and Chloe, since a phone call Monday. Lily is 9-years-old and Chloe is 12-years-old.
"We are just hoping for a miracle," said Reed.
After hearing about the fires, Reed and their son tried to drive to Gatlinburg. However, the two got stuck in traffic and were not able to turn around.
The last time they heard from them, they told their wife to call 911 for help after they said they saw flames across the street from the home. Michael and their son were able to get into Gatlinburg to visit shelters, but have not found them.
"When we finally made our way back into Gatlinburg, to try to get to them all of Wiley Oakley was gone," said Reed. "It was completely on fire." There house was completely engulfed in flames.
Michael and their son were able to visit their Gatlinburg home which was destroyed. They say there are signs that their family escaped.
Apple has made a small but notable change to the web page for its upcoming wearable device. The page previously featured the tagline “Available 4.24.15,” but that notice has now been replaced with “The Watch is coming.”
The change likely stems from the fact that many users have discovered they will be unable to actually get their devices on launch day due to shipping delays, low stock, or the inability to buy them at an Apple Retail Store on launch day.
There's no reason whatsoever to believe that the launch date has been moved. Instead it can be seen as an acknowledgement by Apple that most shoppers will not be able to get their devices on day one. Users have taken to Twitter to point out how few people will actually be able to get their hands on the device on the 24th.
Earlier tonight KGI published a research note estimating that Apple had sold pre-orders for 2.3 million Apple Watch units, while CEO Tim Cook has said that sales were “great.” Rumors indicated that the Apple Watch was expected to hit speedbumps in production that led to reduced supply, which seemed to manifest during the first night of pre-orders as many models sold out quickly.
When NVIDIA started talking to us about the new GeForce GTX 750 Ti graphics card, one of the key points they emphasized was the potential use for this first-generation Maxwell GPU to be used in the upgrade process of smaller form factor or OEM PCs. Without the need for an external power connector, the GTX 750 Ti provided a clear performance delta from integrated graphics with minimal cost and minimal power consumption, so the story went.
Eager to put this theory to the test, we decided to put together a project looking at the upgrade potential of off the shelf OEM computers purchased locally. A quick trip down the road to Best Buy revealed a PC sales section that was dominated by laptops and all-in-ones, but with quite a few "tower" style desktop computers available as well. We purchased three different machines, each at a different price point, and with different primary processor configurations.
The lucky winners included a Gateway DX4885, an ASUS M11BB, and a Lenovo H520.
Continue reading An Upgrade Story: Can the GTX 750 Ti Convert OEMs PCs to Gaming PCs?
Gateway DX4885 ASUS M11BB Lenovo H520 Processor Core i5-4440 A10-6700 Pentium G2030 Cores / Threads 4 / 4 4 / 4 2 / 2 Graphics Intel HD Graphics 4600 AMD Radeon HD 8670D Intel HD Graphics System Memory 8GB DDR3-1600 8GB DDR3-1600 4GB DDR3-1333 Hard Drive 1TB 1TB 1TB Power Supply 300 watt 350 watt 250 watt Operating System Windows 8 Windows 8 Windows 8 Price $570 $440 $340
With prices ranging from $570 down to $340, our desktop selections cover a wide range of available user options. The Gateway system has the fastest primary processor with the Haswell-based Core i5-4440 (HD 4600 graphics) at its core. However, the ASUS PC has the best out-of-the-box gaming performance with the inclusion of an A10-6700 APU (though not by as large a performance margin as one might expect). The low man on the totem pole is definitely the Pentium G2030 based machine with a dual-core (no HyperThreading) processor and unlabeled integrated HD graphics. A 12 FPS average frame rate on Bioshock Infinite at the "Very Low" preset is clearly nothing to get excited about.
CPU-Z Data on the Core i5-4440, A10-6700, and Pentium G2030
Another aspect worth noting on these systems is the power supply provided in each chassis. The ASUS system included a 350 watt power supply that left only one unused 4-pin Molex power connector. Both the Lenovo (250 watt) and the Gateway (300 watt) systems had power supplies without any additional power connectors at all. That makes upgrading the graphics on such a system nearly impossible as cards like the Radeon R7 260X and the GeForce GTX 650 Ti require a 6-pin PCIE power connection to run.
As it just so happens though, the new GeForce GTX 750 Ti does not.
Based on the new Maxwell architecture from NVIDIA, the GeForce GTX 750 Ti is easily the most power efficient GPU was had tested to date and the performance at resolutions like 1920x1080 is nothing short of impressive as well. You can see in our initial review of the reference card that it was able to demonstrate a clear performance advantage over the Radeon R7 260X while using 35 watts less power and eschewing the need for an external power.
Rather that get into a complicated debate about different graphics card comparisons for this purpose, like including cards like the Radeon R7 250 or the GeForce GTX 650, we decided to solely demonstrate to our readers what kind of performance gains you can get by upgrading from integrated graphics to the latest in mainstream discrete graphics solutions.
For each of the three test systems mentioned above we installed and ran five different popular PC games at 1920x1080 and rather low image quality settings. I wanted to get a feel for what kind of experience the end user would get by just downloading Steam and installing Skyrim, for example. The truth is the actually quite disheartening and it's easy to see why some people would quickly become disenchanted with the PC as a gaming platform. Games were running in the single digit frame rates. For example, the 6 FPS average for Metro: Last Light and 10 FPS average for Skyrim are experiences that would drive people away from our hobby, not bring them into it.
Each of the five games (Bioshock Infinite, Crysis 3, GRID 2, Metro: Last Light, and Skyrim) were tested at unique image quality settings on each individual system, but all were run at 1920x1080 resolution. Integrated game presets were used and are mentioned on each graph on the following page.
The upgrade process could not have been much easier for all three of the OEM systems we picked up. Side doors were quickly removed, spare full-length PCI Express slots were located, and cards were easily locked into place. Without the need to locate an external power connection, that is really all there was to it. All three PCs booted into Windows 8 without complaint when the display connection was moved from the integrated graphics output to the discrete card's output and installing the NVIDIA 334.69 drivers went off without a hiccup.
Even if you have no experience building a computer, anyone that is capable of using a screw driver should be able to add a graphics card upgrade to their PC.
With the test process determined, we ran 5 different games on each of the 3 systems; once with integrated graphics only and once more with the GeForce GTX 750 Ti installed. The differences, as you will see, are stunning.
Republican voters mostly back President Donald Trump's decision, with 62 percent saying they were right to fire James Comey. | Getty Poll: Voters divided on Comey firing About one-third of voters said Trump was wrong to fire the FBI director and another third said they were right.
Voters are split on President Donald Trump's firing of former FBI Director James Comey, a controversy that has roiled Washington but is yet to dent the nation's partisan divide, a new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll shows.
Just over a third of voters, 35 percent, say Trump was right to remove Comey as FBI director this week, the poll shows. But roughly the same share, 33 percent, say Trump should have allowed Comey to continue as FBI director. Another 32 percent said they didn't know or had no opinion.
Story Continued Below
Republican voters mostly back Trump's decision: 62 percent say they were right to fire Comey, while only 10 percent think Comey should have stayed on.
Democrats, by contrast, largely oppose Trump's decision. The majority, 58 percent, say Trump should have let Comey stay on, but 16 percent think Trump was right to remove Comey. The Justice Department has cited Comey's treatment of 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton as part of the rationale behind Comey's dismissal.
Independents are evenly divided: 30 percent think Trump made the right decision, 28 percent say Comey should have stayed and 42 percent are undecided.
The POLITICO/Morning Consult poll suggests voters are only slightly moved by the suggestion that Trump should not have fired Comey while the bureau is investigating connections between Trump's presidential campaign and Russia's attempts to influence the results of the election.
Overall, 37 percent of voters describe Trump's decision to remove Comey as “appropriate,” and 34 percent describe it as “inappropriate.” (The difference between these two figures is not statistically significant.) Nearly three-in-10 voters, 29 percent, have no opinion.
Asked whether Trump's decision was appropriate in light of the investigation into their campaign, however, the percentage who say it was appropriate does not change measurably, ticking down a single point to 36 percent. But the percentage who say it was inappropriate rises 7 percentage points, to 41 percent.
The poll does find greater support for dismissing Comey in light of the former FBI director's comments at a Senate committee hearing last week that overstated former Clinton aide Huma Abedin's practice of forwarding Clinton's emails to their husband, disgraced former Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.). Told that Comey “misstated several details” about the Clinton investigation, 47 percent say Trump's decision was appropriate, including 29 percent of Democrats. Just 28 percent say it is inappropriate in light of those misstatements.

Voters are divided on who should lead the investigation into Trump's campaign and its connections to Russian actors, but there is general support for removing the probe from the political process. Just 22 percent say the new FBI director “should continue the investigation.” But 36 percent of voters want a special prosecutor to be appointed, and another 24 percent think “a bipartisan, independent commission created by Congress should handle the investigation.”
The White House and congressional GOP leadership have thus far deflected calls from Democrats and a few stray Republicans for an independent counsel or special, select congressional committee.
The poll surveyed 1,731 registered voters, beginning late Tuesday after the White House announced Comey's firing and concluding on Thursday. The margin of error is plus or minus 2 percentage points.
The only other publicly available survey after Comey's dismissal — an NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll released later Thursday — diverged significantly from the POLITICO/Morning Consult finding. That poll found a majority of Americans, 54 percent, thought Comey's firing was "not appropriate," compared with 38 percent who said it was appropriate.
The NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll went into the field on Wednesday — a day after the POLITICO/Morning Consult poll — and surveyed all adults, instead of only registered voters.
Morning Consult is a nonpartisan media and technology company that provides data-driven research and insights on politics, policy and business strategy.

An Indian social worker says they were denied a job at an orphanage based in the Indian capital of New Delhi because their recruiter felt that their hijab made them look "like a Muslim lady".
"Everything was going smooth, we exchanged many emails," Nedal Zoya, a graduate from Tata Institute of Social Sciences in Mumbai, told Al Jazeera.
"But a few days ago, I got an email stating that 'I am sorry to inform you that even [from] a distance of one kilometer you look like a Muslim lady due to your external Muslim gears'." This comment was referring to their hijab, a headscarf worn by many Muslim women who feel it is part of their religion.
{articleGUID}
After being short-listed by the Delhi Orphanage for Girls in October for the post of social worker, Zoya was asked, by Harish Varma, the president and CEO of the orphanage, to give an online test and send a picture of themselves to.
Varma suggested Zoya remove their hijab as one of the pre-conditions to proceed with the recruitment process.
Muslim girl with 'modern thoughts'
After Zoya refused to do as they were asked, Varma sent them an email expressing that they were "shocked" to know that "conservative Islam was their priority, not humanity", and that all their "higher education has gone down drain".
In the email exchange between Varma and Zoya, obtained by Al Jazeera, Varma expressed that they would not allow any kind of religious activities inside the orphanage.
Zoya was later informed that another Muslim girl with "modern thoughts" and a "religion free mindset" was hired for the same post.
"I don't take it as a rejection. I don't consider myself a victim," the 27-year-old said.
"My motive was to create [an] awareness as I am not the only one who has faced such discrimination. People at least need to discuss this matter so that such discrimination on the basis of religion and appearance can be questioned," they said.
Local media reported that Saurabh Bharadwaj, Member of the Delhi Legislative Assembly from the ruling Aam Aadmi Party said that their government will take action against Varma if Zoya will officially lodge a complaint, adding that the Indian constitution did not allow anyone to discriminate on the basis of someone's faith.
'Secular' appearance
Varma told Al Jazeera that the decision was taken based on their eligibility for the job and that the candidate they were looking for should be "secular".
"We are a secular country, we are not giving preference to people based on their religion, which is why I want my orphanage to be religion-free," Varma told Al Jazeera.
"My religion is humanity and yes I don't want any influence of any religion in my organisation."

India's constitution guarantees right to freely profess, practice, and propagate one's religion.
[My] scarf adds to my boldness and confidence. And it's completely my choice to cover my head Nedal Zoya
Zoya believes it was an example of how Islamophobia in India is growing and how it can affect the future of India's Muslim population, some 14 percent of the country's 1.3 billion people.
"[My] scarf adds to my boldness and confidence. And it's completely my choice to cover my head," they said.
In 2015, a 22-year-old Masters in Business Administration graduate was denied a job in Mumbai as the company said it only hired "non-Muslim candidates".
'Growing trend of Islamophobia'
Right groups and many studies say Muslims, along with Dalits and other marginalised groups, face discrimination in jobs and the housing sector. Sachar Committee instituted by the previous UPA government submitted its report in 2006, which painted a negative picture of Muslims' economic and educational status.
Since Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in 2014, there has been an increase in attacks on Muslims by Hindu far-right groups. More than a dozen Muslims have been killed by cow vigilantes since then.
In April, Amnesty International released a report urging authorities to ensure that there was no impunity for those responsible for public lynchings and other hate crimes against Muslims in several states.
"This growing trend of Islamophobia needs to be stopped in its tracks. State police departments must ensure that those responsible are brought to justice," the report said.
Zoya feels Islamophobia needs to be tackled at its roots.
"I believe that Islamophobia can be significantly reduced if not totally eradicated if the parents/guardians/families shape their children's idea about religion, peace, love and harmony in a way that they are not influenced by what they see or hear but rather by their own logical reasoning and non-judgemental approach.
"For any kind of change to take place, the mindsets must change."
Bihar was the only big outlier. In a sea of saffron from Jammu and Kashmir to Maharashtra, Gujarat to Jharkhand, Bihar was the only state to resist the spread of the Bharatiya Janata Party. It even managed to deliver a crushing defeat to the BJP, at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Party President Amit Shah were pulling off resounding victories or canny takeovers across the land. That is now in the past. Nitish Kumar's decision on Wednesday to join hands with the BJP to return as Bihar chief minister, less than 15 hours after stepping down from the same post and ending an anti-BJP alliance, means the saffron party now controls almost the entirety of India's heartland.
In some ways, this should not be surprising. The BJP's massive Lok Sabha victory in 2014 suggested the party could expand far beyond its traditional strongholds, on the back of Narendra Modi's popularity. In the state elections that followed in 2014, it has methodically gone about this task, winning outright in many cases and ensuring it would be in the driver's seat even without a majority.
The following year, 2015, seemed to halt this expansion, with the BJP being routed by the Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi and defeated by a coalition of Opposition parties in Bihar. But the saffron party did not just pick up the pieces and move on, it continued to work on unsettling the governments in those states where it had lost. In Delhi, that meant making it difficult for the AAP government to function. In Bihar, it focused on attacking the weakest links in the Rashtriya Janata Dal-Janata Dal (United) alliance.
Hook or crook
In 2016, the BJP got a breather, since it was not a major player in most of the state elections, although it did manage significant vote-share gains in Kerala and West Bengal. In Assam it managed its very first victory, opening up the North East.
Meanwhile, the party was also hard at work on coming to power without elections. It first tried this gambit in Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh, building up support and allegedly using money to attract lawmakers over to the BJP camp. Though both efforts initially seemed successful, they ended up being overturned following Supreme Court scrutiny. But that did not stop the BJP from pushing further. By December 2016, Arunachal had turned saffron and elections in Uttarakhand a few months later led to the same result.
Early elections in 2017 saw the same two-pronged approach. In Uttar Pradesh, the BJP managed a resounding victory, giving it a huge national boost and confirming its position as the pole of Indian politics. But in Goa and Manipur, despite finishing with fewer seats than the Congress, the BJP still cobbled together enough support to form the government in both states.
In Bihar, as with those two states, the government is now primarily run by two parties, neither of which won the most seats in the 2015 election.
This is now the3rd time that BJP has formed a state government after losing an election. Goa, Manipur&Bihar show our democracy in poor light — Shashi Tharoor (@ShashiTharoor) July 27, 2017
Congress leaders attempted to pass this off as a “failure” of Indian democracy, but whatever the moral dimensions of the move may have been, the BJP's successful efforts only confirm the impression that it is dominant. All other political parties are forced to react.
Up next
Now that the Hindi heartland has nearly been conquered – a resounding BJP victory in municipal polls in Delhi suggests even AAP is under the gun – the saffron party is looking further afield. It has already pushed its way into several North Eastern states and is continuing to throw its weight, and central funds, around there. North Eastern states have traditionally backed the government at the Centre, so this may not be surprising. The party will spend some of the next few years hoping to ensure it is re-elected, in states like Gujarat, or winning overstates like Himachal Pradesh where it seems ready to take over.
The real challenge lies in the south and east
In the crosshairs:
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister of the Republic of Korea, Mr. Chung Hongwon, is scheduled to visit Pakistan from Sunday, April 13, on a four-day official visit to the country.
This will be the first visit to Pakistan by a prime minister of the Republic of Korea since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1983, foreign office spokesperson Tasneem Aslam told Dawn.com.
During the visit, Mr. Chung Hongwon will call on the president and prime minister of Pakistan on Monday.
The South Korean leader will speak on Monday at the Korea-Pakistan Investment Cooperation Forum in Islamabad jointly organised by the Pakistani Board of Investment and Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA) where they would highlight the potential of trade between the two countries.
Relations between Pakistan and the Republic of Korea have broadened in various fields over the years.
The foreign office spokesperson said the bilateral trade figure of US $1.341 billion shows the growth of economic and trade ties between the two countries.
They said both Pakistan and Korea enjoy excellent trade and commercial ties and several Korean companies are investing in Pakistan in the areas of chemical industry, hydel and thermal power and infrastructure projects.
There is also a significant Pakistani labor class working in various cities of South Korea.
“This visit offers opportunities to both countries to exchange views on wide ranging bilateral, regional and international matters of mutual interest.
“The two sides will also discuss ways and means for further strengthening cooperation in diverse areas, particularly in expanding bilateral trade and enhancing investment in Pakistan,” the spokesperson added.
Bangor councilman calls on Merlo to resign over Pius X sex charges
Councilman Dave Houser said they had misgivings two months ago about council's appointment of Merlo to fill a vacancy, and the criminal charges have convinced them that they should step aside.
Stephanie Merlo, the Bangor councilwoman charged last week with having a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl, should resign from Borough Council, a fellow council member said Friday.
"I was not happy with this selection, how this came about," Houser said. "We had three excellent candidates, and then all of a sudden we had somebody we knew nothing about.
"I'm sure nobody knew what was going to happen, but it didn't feel right from the beginning, and I feel kind of justified for feeling the way I did."
They said they will call for Merlo to quit at council's Jan. 6 reorganization meeting.
"It will be my suggestion to council, when we meet, that they should be asked to resign," Houser said. "She is not an elected official. That was only an appointment. Under the circumstances, I feel that they should resign."
Merlo, 29, a volunteer coach for the Pius X High School girls volleyball team, was accused Dec. 19 of having sex with one of their volleyball players.
 They are charged with institutional sexual assault and corruption of a minor.
After Councilman Marino Severi resigned, Merlo was appointed to council in a 2-2 vote, with Mayor John Brown breaking the tie in their favor.
Council already had applications from Bangor Fire Chief Robert Engle, Civil Service Commission member Angel Carrero and Zoning Hearing Board member Jane Gorman when Merlo's name was submitted, Houser said.
"She was the fourth and last entrant," they said. "Her application came in the day of the deadline or the day before. I really don't know why they picked her."
Houser, a Democrat, said they do not know Merlo's political party. They said they understand they registered to vote days before they applied for the council seat.
A Northampton County voter database doesn't include them name.
Houser voted for Gorman, who won a council seat in the November general election.
Other Bangor officials have yet to comment on Merlo's status in light of their legal trouble. Houser said the others probably aren't sure what to do, and the situation also is complicated by the death Thursday of Borough Manager John Kasten.
Several attempts to reach council President Catherine Allen and solicitor David Ceraul have been unsuccessful.
"I'm not surprised at their non-response," Houser said. "Our solicitor has to look out for the best interests of the borough, and I understand that. But I don't know what they're thinking."
Police have arrested a pastor in eastern India accused of raping two women on the pretext of driving out evil spirits, an official said on Wednesday.
Chandrama Raj, the pastor with the Indian Mission Church in Bihar state, was arrested after one of the victims filed a complaint in September.
“We conducted a preliminary inquiry and have arrested the priest. They have been sent to judicial custody,” Manu Maharaj, the senior police superintendent of the state capital Patna, told AFP.
The women accused the pastor of inviting them to their home where they promised to drive away their evil spirits through prayer. It was there that they raped them, police said.
India has a grim record of sexual assaults, with 34,651 cases reported in 2015, according to government data.
It strengthened laws against sexual violence after the fatal gang-rape of a Delhi student in 2012 caused global outrage, but attacks are still widespread.
It is not the first time the church in India has faced accusations of sexual abuse.
Two high-profile exposes by former Catholic nuns have in recent years revealed the scale of sexual exploitation by priests and the prevalence of same-sex relations in Indian convents.
Last year an Indian priest was sentenced to 40 years in prison for raping a 12-year-old girl in 2014.
Apple shares fell as much as 5.4 per cent this morning after a report on CNN's "citizen journalist" web site said Steve Jobs had suffered a major heart attack.
According to Bloomberg, the computer maker/cult denied the report, and shares promptly rebounded. At last check, they sat at $104.51, up 4.4 per cent in trading on the NASDAQ exchange.
Sometime this morning, an anonymous poster unloaded the following paragraph on iReport, a CNN-owned site dedicated to citizen journalism unfounded rumor:
Steve Jobs was rushed to the ER just a few hours ago after suffering a major heart attack. I have an insider who tells me that paramedics were called after Steve claimed to be suffering from severe chest pains and shortness of breath. My source has opted to remain anonymous, but they are quite reliable. I haven't seen anything about this anywhere else yet, and as of right now, I have no further information, so I thought this would be a good place to start. If anyone else has more information, please share it.
At about 10am Eastern time, Silicon Alley Insider posted a denial from Apple. "It is not true," said Katie Cotton, Apple vp of worldwide communications. According to Silicon Alley, the iReport post remained online for another twenty minutes before being removed.
At one point this morning, Apple's share price hit a 17-month low of $94.65.
Over the past year, the company's stock has dropped 49 per cent, due at least in part to questions over the health of its cult leader. Four years ago, Jobs had surgery to treat pancreatic cancer, and when they turned up at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference in July to unveil the 3Jesus Phone, they were noticeable thinner than usual.
Twelve days after their WWDC appearance, The New York Times reported that Jobs had "assured several people" that they were cancer free.
A month after that, Bloomberg published a 17-page Jobs obituary. But it would appear they are very much alive. Unfortunately, so is online citizen journalism.
Silicon Alley Insider Henry Blodget predicts that iReport post will lead to an SEC investigation. And they know a thing or two about the SEC investigating alleged Wall Street fraud. In 2003, the SEC banned them from the financial industry for life. ®
Data Apple collects about users from its vaunted iPhone is so valuable that the company must build a special search engine just to keep Google from gleaning insight from that data, analysts say.
Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said there is a 70 percent chance Apple will roll out a mobile search engine tailored for its iPhone within the next five years.
Google is currently the default search engine on the iPhone, which has tens of millions of users. Pairing the leading search engine-65 percent in the United States, more share abroad-with one of the most popular smartphones on the planet made good business sense.
However, Google has increasingly encroached on Apple's mobile turf, offering the Android operating system and several mobile applications.
Google's Nexus One resembles the iPhone so much that Apple sued Nexus One maker HTC for patent infringement. Google took the battle up a notch last November by wooing AdMob, whose in-application ads proved successful on the iPhone, with a $750 million purchase bid.
While that deal has yet to receive regulatory approval, industry experts said it would give Google unprecedented access to the works of Apple's App Store, which Google could use to buoy the Nexus One and future Android devices.
As the search provider for the iPhone, Google also sees what iPhone users are searching for, which can help it tailor software and services for its own mobile smartphones. This competitive advantage has not gone unnoticed by Apple.
Building its own iPhone-centric search engine would help Apple shield Google from its App Store data, Munster said in a March 30 research note.
"We believe Apple could utilize data unavailable to Google, data generated by the company's App Store, to create a mobile centric search engine, which would be a unique offering to Google's search engine," Munster wrote.
Apple lacks the experience and engineering wherewithal to build a large, scalable search engine. There are alternatives to Google such as Microsoft Bing, which was rumored to replace Google on the iPhone. With Google the default search service on Apple's newly released iPad, it seems unlikely that Apple will in fact replace Google with Bing or anything else on the iPhone.
But Munster said Apple could buy a search startup with a Web index, such as Cuil, using its index as the seed for its own search engine. Mobile search startup Taptu would also be a good possibility for Apple because it focuses its index on touch-enabled Websites.
Apple would then have to stimulate enough advertiser interest to make a viable search product work for it.
While Apple excels at marketing new products, it is not a digital advertising provider. The company did buy AdMob rival Quattro Wireless, but the company has yet to reveal what its intentions are for those assets.
Still, Munster said protecting valuable consumer data and not profit would be the point for Apple's mobile search engine.
"The data generated on the iPhone OS platform must become an increasing priority for Apple and we believe the company has the resources to develop its own products in both maps and search in the next five years," Munster said.
They added that Apple could entice enough major advertisers and local resellers like ReachLocal to use the Apple search platform to make a meaningful marketplace and potentially operate a search product at break even.
IDC analyst Hadley Reynolds added that local search is the initial killer app for mobile, noting that the Quattro ad platform could make for an attractive environment for advertisers, particularly when paired with Taptu's touch-screen approach to search.
Meanwhile, iPhone apps from Google and Bing are still delivering long lists of links, which are hard to deal with in small screen real estate. Moreover, these apps do not have access to the data that Apple has piling up in its iTunes Store and on its devices, Reynolds told eWEEK.
"The next-generation services will be much more touch-enabled than what Google and Bing are offering, and they will take users to sites that offer the most attractive info consumption models to their audiences," Reynolds added.
"Apple is in an inside position to tap into the current pent-up demand for better mobile search, and add a new competitive differentiation from other search providers and device makers."

The teen boy lay wedged between rocks on a Rhode Island hillside, injured and bleeding, as search parties scoured the woods around him. Police knew they were nearby, but after 24 hours without success they'd grown frustrated, and the boy's parents had grown more worried, knowing time could be drawing short.
Then a big furry family dog, a 130-pound Swiss Alpine named Hannibal, came bounding over the ridge, and an arm shot out of the crack in the rocks to hug the dog.
“[The boy] put their arm around the dog's neck,” recalled Matt Zarrella, Hannibal's owner and trainer. “I climbed up and over and looked down, and they were in between the rocks.”
Hannibal had made their first rescue, and Zarrella had embarked on a storied two-decade career as a trainer of search and rescue dogs. After turning their own beloved pet Hannibal into Rhode Island's first k-9 officer, Zarrella became the Rhode Island State Police's own dog whisperer. Sgt. Zarrella trains dogs for their own force, but has also lent their animals and their expertise to the DEA, the Defense Department and the FBI.
Zarrella's colleagues say the former Marine and lifelong dog lover has a supernatural connection with their animals, but Zarrella said they also feel a bond to the missing humans he's trying to find, and to the families who are waiting for rescue or closure.
“It's a connection you have with someone you don't even know,” explained Zarrella. “Yet you're both human beings, you both deserve respect, you deserve that opportunity to be found.”
Zarrella gets their K-9 helpers from shelters and pounds, saving some of them from euthanasia. Almost 10 years ago, they took Maximus, a German Shepherd rescued from the pound at six months old, and another dog to Vietnam to search for the body of a U.S. pilot shot down in 1965. The dogs didn't disappoint, solving a 40-year-old mystery.
“Bone fragments the size of your fingernail,” marveled Zarrella. “Just an amazing accomplishment by the dogs.”
Zarrella's dogs have also helped find a mass grave in Colombia for the DEA and, incredibly, locate a downed plane in 100 feet of water off of Block Island.
One of Zarrella's newest recruits is a K-9 officer named Ruby. Ruby, a two-and-half-year-old Australian Shepherd/Border Collie mix, was hours from being put down when Zarrella found them
“I wanted to take a dog that didn't have a shot, that I know physiologically can do the work. It's just a matter of motivation,” said Zarella.
Zarrella has now caught the eye of a documentary filmmaker, whose 90-minute profile, titled “Reliance,” is in its final stages of production.
“I feel like it's the ultimate second-chance story,” said filmmaker Mary Healey Jamiel. “Here are these dogs that are discarded, and now they can save people.”

Newly-promoted Dundee have cleared more room in their squad after releasing another four players, the club has announced.
Manager Paul Hartley has confirmed Sean Bonnett-Johnson, Declan Gallagher, Stephen Hughes and Matt Lockwood have all left Dens Park following the end of their current contracts.
Hartley has already allowed eight other players to leave the Championship title winners this summer having brought in new club captain Kevin Thomson, James McPake, Scott Bain, Philip Roberts, Greg Stewart and Simon Ferry.
Former Clyde defender Gallagher was an ever present for Hartley's side as they won their return to the Scottish Premiership by winning the second-tier title, playing in every minute of every game.
Englishman Lockwood has been allowed to leave after four years on Tayside, while Bonnett-Johnson and Hughes only signed on in January.
Hughes - who used to play for Rangers - featured just once before they were allowed to return to old club East Fife on loan, while Bonnett-Johnson failed to make it off the bench.
A Dundee spokesperson said: "The club would like to thank all four players for their efforts whilst in the dark blue of Dundee and wish them all the best for the future."
On May 19 Breitbart News reported that banks were cutting ties with firearm and ammunition manufacturers and retailers because of pressure being brought to bear on financial institutions by the Department of Justice (DOJ) via “Operation Choke Point.”
Since then, we reported that this DOJ operation has turned into a search and destroy mission by which the Obama administration goes after banks working with businesses the administration does not like: firearms/ammunition manufacturers and retailers among them.
On May 29 Representative Blaine Luetkemeyer (R-MO-3) offered an amendment to the Commerce, Justice, Science spending bill to be sure no funds in it are appropriated to support “Operation Choke Point.” The amendment passed on a voice vote.
Breitbart News spoke with Rep. Luetkemeyer on May 30 about where things go from here, and they responded:
Number one, we support DOJ efforts to find fraud, abuse, and root that out. But it appears the DOJ is not interested in simply going after the bad guys but the entire banking industry. So we want a safe harbor to be given to banks that meet certain criteria, so they can feel free to conduct business–including business with the firearms/ammunition manufacturer and sales industry. We are working to put a safe harbor in place, and if the DOJ and FDIC don't do it then the Congress will do it via legislation.
Luetkemeyer said there have been numerous types of documentation on how banks working with “the non-deposit lending industry and firearms/ammunition manufacturer and sales industry” have been targeted in “Operation Choke Point.” They said the House is working on a bill that “would protect banks while they are working with legally performing entities.”
The Congressman added: “Operation Choke Point goes beyond looking for fraudulence and seeks instead to do away with an entire industry.”

Sorry if I sound like a broken record when it comes to criticizing Cory, but they surely have been a disappointment so far on the Challenge. It does not help that Cory was an awesome guy in the Real World house. They seemed like the guy who you meet a party and they give you a beer. A chill dude who was a college football player and personal trainer seemed like they would devour the Challenge. MTV has pushed them down our throat, and like a fish out of water, he's flopped around.
Let's look back at some famous Challenge competitors who didn't quite fulfill the potential we thought possible after their Real World season.
Zach Nichols: Real World San Diego 2
College Wide Receiver who ran a 40 of 4.75 while being 6'4 and the size of Thor. If you watched the Challenge and had to build the “stereotype” of someone to dominate the show, Zach is what you would build. Hilariously, Zach has taught us over the years that being big can hurt you in this competition. Being too big for high altitudes, not having enough gas for endurance competitions, as well as being too big to fit into the small holes an doing the skill competitions. Zach won their first season of the Challenge, but had a stacked team in a game full of rookies, newbies, and flops. Since then he's made 1 finals in 4 seasons, an embarrassing far 3rd place finish, and gone 1–3 in eliminations. I think they have the potential to finish strong again one day, but right now Zach has looked very disappointing as an athlete, not even mentioning their personality.
CJ Koegel and Scott Herman (RW Cancun and RW Brooklyn)
It may surprise you to see these two on these lists, as CJ has done quite well on the 2 Challenges they were on, while Scott's never done a Challenge. My problem withe each of these two is that exact reason, they literally haven't showed up to compete. CJ was great on Battle of the Seasons and is talked about every season when casting starts, but they never comes on despite working as a model, which seems like the perfect job if you want to do a Challenge. Scott Herman has become a workout beast, and it frustrates fans of the show to watch Jay and Nate compete instead of someone like Scott.
Theo King (RW Bad Blood)
My expectations were very low for Theo going into Invasion. I did not like their demeanor or personality on Bad Blood, but a good amount of people were hyped for them after the hype they created for themselves on Real World. Still, I expected a guy like Theo who had some top level speed and agility stats in College and High School to come in and tear the game up a little. However, Theo is a quitter who is afraid of heights and blames others for their problems.
Danny Jamieson (RW Austin)
Real World Austin was a good amount before my time, so when I watched it for the first time, I went back to see online reviews and forums to see how people felt about the season. I was jarred by the reactions people had of the season. Nehemiah, who I thought was the chillest dude, was abhorred due to their views on the Iraq War. Danny was loved for their good looks and relationship with Melinda, people thought they would become a star on the Challenge. Now they are looked at as one of the worst competitors in Challenge history with an 0–5 elimination record.
Brooke LaBarbera (RW Denver)
They were a mess on Real World Denver, the mess that you cannot stop watching. A girl whose emotions are all over the place, versatile enough to hookup with both sexes, and has good size usually ends being a challenge must have, but Brooke was such a bad competitor they couldn't even stay long enough to be the hot girl.
Katelynn Cusanelli (RW Brookyln)
My expectations were very low for her, but they would always brag about their cat like reflexes and ninja skills. Then she'd be up there doing worse than all the other female competitors.
Ty Ruff (RW DC)
Even though they made the Exes 1 final and has an elimination record of 4–3, Ty was a disappointment considering their size, stature, and that they looked like they were sculpted.
Tony Raines (RW Skeletons)
Looked like a star on Real World, still has not made it to the halfway point in a Challenge after 3 attempts.
Nicole Zanatta (RW Skeletons)
Not that disappointing, but while they made the final in their rookie season, they finished in 3rd place despite being the worst athlete of the group. I really underrated how dumb they are, as they struggled with simple multiplication. That's gonna keep you from winning a final definitely.
The first rubber balloons were made for use in the laboratory, but it wasn't long till people began having fun with them

Schoolchildren in Augusta, Ga. released a balloon rosary into the air Monday, in a celebration of the feast day of Our Lady of Guadalupe. On New Year's Eve thousands of balloons will be dropped from ceilings across the country, and on Thanksgiving balloons filled the skies as part of the Macy's Day Parade. Why do we celebrate things with balloons?
Because they're cheap and colorful, and people like watching things fly away. Balloons in their various forms were invented for use in military communications, scientific experiments, and transportation, but it wasn't long before people began to have fun with them. The first rubber balloons were made by Michael Faraday in 1824, for use in the laboratory. Faraday laid two sheets of rubber on top of each other, put flour in the middle to prevent them from joining all the way through, and then sealed the edges together. Faraday noted that when they filled the balloons with hydrogen they had “considerable ascending power,” though they were disappointed to find that the hydrogen kept escaping. British inventor and rubber manufacturer Thomas Hancock began distributing balloon-making kits in the following year, and by 1847, London entrepreneurs were selling the first balloons made of vulcanized rubber, allowing for a stronger, more elastic balloon. It wasn't long before the idea had been exploited for use at parties: According to an 1873 New York Times article on the balloon's potential industrial applications, it “may be made of vast use” for meteorologists and military men “and will always be an interesting addition to the amusements of popular gatherings.”
Rubber balloons weren't manufactured in the United States until 1907, but their popularity appears to have increased throughout most of the 20th century. The first commercial sausage balloons were produced in 1912, and Americans began twisting balloons to make animals in the late-1930s or early-1940s. Another boom in recreational balloon use occurred with the introduction of foil balloons in the 1970s. Foil balloons hold their shape better than rubber balloons, and so they were better for conveying messages like “Happy birthday!” or “It's a boy!”
Rubber and foil balloons aren't the only kinds used for celebrations. In East Asia, sky lanterns—a form of hot-air balloon made by lighting a small flame inside a paper lantern—have been popular for many centuries. They were initially used for military signaling, but now are launched by the hundreds as a form of celebration at many festivals. (They're also a known fire hazard, and have been banned in some countries.) For other skyward spectacles, people have shot off fireworks and released birds.
Fears of damaging the environment have cut into balloon sales in recent years. The Balloon Council says that a properly functioning latex balloon freezes when it reaches an altitude of about five miles, breaks into slivers that look like spaghetti, and breaks down in the soil like a leaf. Indeed, natural latex is biodegradable, but most rubber balloons are made of chemical-treated latex and may last for months. Balloons can be dangerous to sea animals including porpoises, turtles, dolphins, and whales, as they can become lodged in the animal's digestive tract (which could lead to starvation). However, the Balloon Council says that no balloon has ever been shown to be the cause of death for a sea mammal. As an alternative to releasing helium balloons, environmentalists have suggested dropping non-helium balloons from a tall building, blowing bubbles, or planting a tree.

Samsung's latest flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S6 Edge, is the most costly yet to build and assemble, according to a teardown analysis of the device by the research firm IHS.
According to a report due out later today, the 64 gigabyte version of the phone built for use on Verizon Wireless' network cost about $290 to build, including parts and assembly. That's about $34 per unit higher than the costs of the Galaxy S5 released last year, and even higher than the most costly versions of Apple's iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. IHS estimated the top end of the materials cost on those phones at $247 and $263. The 64GB version of the phone sells for $699 without a contract and some versions cost more.
The cost of components, known in electronics industry lingo as a bill of materials, has been steadily climbing in recent years, says Andrew Rassweiler, an analyst who heads up IHS' teardown research efforts.
“Samsung is clearly studying Apple's playbook by using things like metal enclosures and other design choices that are similar to Apple's,” they said. “The bottom line is that this phone costs less than an iPhone to buy, but it costs Samsung more to build.”
The most costly component in the S6 is the curved touchscreen display which wraps around the left and right sides of the phone. The curved portion of the screen acts as a secondary display for notifications and can be used to launch applications with one hand. The combined display and touchscreen elements add $85 to Samsung's costs, Rassweiler says.
The second-most expensive part is the Samsung-made Exynos 7 applications chip, which costs an estimated $29.50. The phone is the first to sport a chip built on 14-nanometer manufacturing technology, which allows for the packing of more computing power in a smaller space than with prior chip generations. The only other 14-nanometer chip on the market right now comes from Intel. Apple is expected to use a 14-nanometer chip in a future iPhone.
The new high-end chip also required expensive new high-end memory chips to accompany it. The phone has three gigabytes worth of Samsung-made DDR4 memory, which added $27 to the component cost. It was the first time that DDR4 memory has been spotted in a smartphone, Rassweiler said. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus both use DDR3 memory. The teardown also estimated the cost of the 64GB of flash memory used for data storage at $25, also Samsung-made.
Rassweiler said the teardown revealed a $15 Qualcomm-made baseband chip for connecting to cellular networks in the version of the Galaxy S6 Edge sold through Verizon. A separate analysis is being done on a version of the phone being sold through AT&T, which may reveal a Samsung-made chip.
Here's an “exploded view” of the phone as photographed by IHS.
NYT, Not Trump, Is Wrong About China's Currency
A headline of a NYT business section piece confidently told its readers that "China manipulates its currency, but not in the way Trump claims." The gist of the argument is that China has recently sold off some of its foreign exchange reserves in order to raise the value of its currency. It goes on to assert that because the inflow of foreign investment into China has slowed, its currency should fall if left to market forces.
Actually, China still holds well over $4 trillion in foreign reserves counting the money in its sovereign wealth fund. Given standard rules of thumb, a country with China's level of imports would be expected to hold between $500 billion and $1 trillion in foreign reserves. These additional holds of reserves have the effect of keeping down the value of China's currency, just as Donald Trump claims. (I will not vouch for the fact that this is what Trump is thinking when they complain about currency management.)
It is also worth noting that even though China's economy has slowed, it is still growing far faster than the economies in Europe, Japan, and the United States. This would be expected to lead to an inflow of capital to China, which would correspond to China running a trade deficit. Instead, China is continuing to run a trade surplus of between 2–3 percent of GDP.
In short, Trump is much closer to the mark on this one than the NYT.
tl;dr: PSR-7 aims to model HTTP messages, whereas the RFC aims to make some non-OO PHP functionality more OO-ish.
I had thought the distinction between the purpose of PSR-7, and the purpose of the server-side request/response object RFC, was obvious from their descriptions. But that is apparently not the case.
I would prefer to discuss the RFC entirely on its own merits, and not dwell on the various strengths and weaknesses of PSR-7. However, to reduce confusion on this topic, I am happy to take some time to expound on the differences.
To understand those differences more clearly, we need to start with a history of PSR-7.
Purpose of PSR-7
PSR-7 was born to answer the question, “How can we model HTTP messages in PHP for sending a request, and getting back a response?” That is, how can we standardize the model of an HTTP request message for sending, and the model of the returned the HTTP response, when using PHP as an HTTP client?
The entrance vote passed in Jan 2014 after about a year of pre-work, with Michael “Guzzle” Dowling as lead: https://groups.google.com/d/topic/php-fig/H1Lr7FYxj94/discussion. You can see the original draft at https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/pull/244/files.
What you'll find in the draft is one pair of request/response interfaces, descended from a message interface, with stream as message body, and no URI specification. These were designed primarily as client interfaces; all the referenced projects in the draft were client-side. (As a side note, they were mutable. Dowling said, “Having mutable and immutable messages would add a significant amount of complexity to a HTTP message PSR and would not reflect what is currently being used by a majority of PHP projects.”)
After 8 months, Dowling stepped down in August 2014, citing a lack of time and motivation. They also said: “I don't think there's one way to represent HTTP messages, clients, or servers in PHP.” https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/php-fig/XwFcqSmqzGk
Shortly thereafter, in September 2014, with encouragement from many (including myself), MWOP of Zend Framework takes over PSR-7. We learn that they have “Sencha Connect” and middleware on the brain:
The reason I wanted to port Connect is this: an application consists of middleware. Each middleware is a callback that accepts a request, response, and a callback called “next” (which is optional, actually): function (request, response, next) … I know from Michael Dowling that the original intent for PSR-7 was to define HTTP messages that could then be used in HTTP clients. I am here to argue that they are even more important when considering server-side applications.
At this point, we see that PSR-7 has been expanded to answer a second question: “How can we model HTTP messages for receiving a request, and sending back a response?” This is in addition to the original goal, but idea is the same: building a standard model of HTTP messages.
(For full disclosure, note that I became a sponsor on PSR-7 in December 2014, along with Beau Simensen as the coordinator.)
It is during MWOP's tenure, before the successful acceptance vote in May 2015, that we see the PSR-7 interfaces expand in number, and become “immutable” (with one intentional exception, and other unintentional exceptions).
So we can see that the purpose of PSR-7 is to model 2 sets of HTTP messages using 7 interfaces: one set for when PHP sends a request and receives a response, and an addition set for when PHP receives a request and sends a response.
The Purpose of the Server(Request|Response) RFC
The proposed RFC starts out by asking a different question. It is not concerned with modeling HTTP messages, whether when sending or receiving them. Instead, it asks: “How can we take the request-related superglobals in PHP, and the various response-related global functions in PHP, and encapsulate them in objects, to make them at least a little more object-oriented?” Becuase the RFC begins with a different question, it leads to a different answer.
You end up with a ServerRequest object that exposes almost only properties, mimicking PHP's superglobals. The properties are read-only, since they represent user input that should be copied out, not changed-in-place. As a convenience, a lot of common $_SERVER['HTTP_*'] values are parsed into more usable representations. Conceding the needs of application development, there are properties and methods for truly immutable values relating to application-specific parameters, parsed content input, and so on.
You also end up wih a ServerResponse object that exposes only methods, mimicking some of PHP's global functions. Instead of emitting headers and cookies on each call to the related methods, it buffers and retains the header and cookie values until you decide to send them. As a collection point for those values, and for content, you can inspect the state of the object prior to sending, and modify it as needed. It has some convenience methods, not least of which includes sending content as a download, or as JSON, with the appropriate headers.
Conclusion
I hope this helps to clear up any confusion as to the purpose of the RFC, vs. the purpose of PSR-7. They start with different questions, and have different goals. I think it would be better to see them as orthogonal to each other at worst, and complementary at best.
A gender fluid child who at 10-years-old decided they did not identify as a girl or a boy says their identity can change throughout the day causing a lot of 'doubt' in their mind.
Annie, now 12, was browsing the internet after growing up as a girl feeling something was amiss and came across a website on non-binary children.
The Australian school student instantly realised they were gender fluid, but often questions the choice after waking up some mornings feeling more masculine or feminine.
'If you constantly say "you're a girl" and you put me into that box I will feel very, very hurt because I do identify as gender fluid, meaning some days I do feel very, very masculine, I feel like I'm a boy, there is nothing you can do about it,' Annie told ABC's Lateline on Wednesday night.

Annie's mother Marita told the program clothes shopping can often be a struggle as it is dependent on how the child feels each day.
'She's still just Annie, it just means that some days Annie is a girl, some days Annie is a boy and some days she's both,' Marita said.
When the pair went shopping for Annie's graduation outfit, they purchased both a dress and suit as they were unsure which gender the child would align with for the evening.

Annie believes gender is more of a mental trait rather than physical.
According to Lateline, a third of children who identify as non-binary find gender specific school uniforms inappropriate and 55 per cent are not comfortable with the toilet facilities.
CORRECT TERMINOLOGY WHEN REFERRING TO TRANSGENDER PEOPLE Transgender: Transgender is a person is someone who does not exclusively identify with the gender they were assigned at birth Transgender is an adjective, and should be written as 'transgender person' or 'trans person' 'Transgendered' 'transgenderism, and 'a transgender' Transgender is an umbrella term for a variety of gender identities and alignments, not a medical diagnosis 'Diagnosed as transgender', or 'suffers from transgender identity' are also inaccurate and offensive, as they treat our identities as medical, rather than personal Non-binary/ Gender Fluid: A non-binary person is someone who does not identify as exclusively male or exclusively female- their gender falls somewhere outside the typical binary of 'man' or 'woman' Non-binary people can fall under the umbrella of 'transgender', but not all non-binary people label themselves that way Pronouns and names: Always ask people which pronouns they prefer Unless the individual specifically requests otherwise, use the pronouns the person currently prefers even when talking about them before they came out Similarly, use the person's preferred name to refer to them even when talking about them before they were publicly using said name

View image on Twitter RIP Manuel Marín.
Former Spanish Commissioner, father of Erasmus programme. Our thoughts are with their family and loved ones.
Manuel Marín, ‘father of Erasmus' dies at the age of 68, ‘father' of the popular EU study exchange programme Erasmus, has died at the age of 68.Fundacion Iberdrola Spain, the charitable vertical of Spain's largest power company, which they chaired since 2008, said in a statement Marin passed away ‘after a long illness'.Marín played a key role in Spain's integration into the European Community and later the European Union in 1986. They then went on to occupy senior posts within the European Commission, including vice-president and commissioner in charge of education.
But Marín is most well-known for implementing the Erasmus student exchange programme, which helps students study abroad in other EU countries.
The President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, expressed their condolences in Spanish: “Very sad about the death of my friend Manuel Marín, former Spanish Commissioner and father of the Erasmus programme.”
Jean-Claude Juncker ✔@JunckerEU Muy triste por la muerte de mi amigo Manuel Marín, ex comisario español y padre del programa Erasmus. Un referente de la vocación europea de España. Un honor para mi haber compartido con él el honoris causa de la universidad de Salamanca. Mi más sentido pésame a su familia.
Spanish Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis hailed Marín as a “great Europeanist”. Dastis also thanked Marín for working to make Spain “better”.
Millennial Desperation: A Tale Told in Memes
Matthew Barad Blocked Unblock Follow Oct 24, 2017
Revelation
For better or worse, my generation will be remembered for our memes. More than our achievements, or contributions to the civic dialogue, it is the birth of viral internet content which has both shaped our development and defined our legacy.
Google Trends results for the term “meme”
As google trends confirms, the term “meme” came to age just as we did. And as we have grown, entered college, and started careers, those memes have themselves matured. With age, they have trended away from the light hearted, and towards the intimately miserable. As one of my peers aptly wrote, “my generation is going to be known for wanting to die and memes.”
With respect to their intentions, however, I don't view these two traits as exclusive. Our memes don't merely parallel our desperation — they reflect it. In a world where suicide rates are climbing, where debt is unavoidable, and where the future is brutally uncertain, sanity demands trivialization. We have no choice but to laugh at our misery, to alienate ourselves from uncomfortable truths. We have no choice but to seek the solidarity of utter desperation.
Max Ernst (1891–1976) — ‘Murdering Airplane' 1920 (photomontage)
We aren't the first to face such a fate, nor the first to respond with absurd humor. In the aftermaths of world wars one and two, Dadaism, or the art of the absurd, grew in direct proportion to misery. Veterans who had seen men torn apart without explanation, whose friends had died for no discernible cause, wrote poetry without meaning and painted portraits without substance. If men can die for nothing, if countries can be torn apart without cause, then why shouldn't planes have arms?
In a world where so many suffered for so little reason, the absurd brought sense to the senseless.
Now, it would be unfair to suggest that I have faced anywhere near the horrors of war, but the lives of my generation have been far from easy. I grew up being told of inequity and of coming climate disaster, only to watch both accelerate as I grew. I was told that our society was progressing only to watch my friends kicked out of their homes for being trans, and to hear tales of my peers being poisoned in mines and factories overseas. I was told my parents would solve the climate crisis, only to watch my home city burn. I was told our future would be bright, only to face the suicide of one friend, and the murder of another.
We who were promised justice are mocked for defending it, and have all but surrendered to senseless, pervasive desperation.
Last year, 8 million tons of plastic were dumped in the oceans. Last year, 80 tons of dead fish coated the shores of Ha Tinh, Vietnam. Last year, one in four children were underfed in the wealthiest nation in the history of the world. Last year Student Loan debt passed 1.4 trillion dollars. Last year a company was founded selling our blood as an anti aging treatment. Last year, half of millennials admitted they would trade the right to vote for loan forgiveness. Last year, more than 10,000 young people in the United States took their own lives.
In response to this senseless suffering, our memes have themselves become senseless. Alongside absurd “trebuchet” and “garlic bread” memes, whose popularity stems from their baseless nature, online communities like 2meirl4meirl consist entirely of half-satirical pleas for death. Even still, suicide memes do have a point. Their answer, while horrific, is still an answer. The most radically absurd memes, the memes which tell us the most about ourselves, are those of complete meaninglessness. Not unlike their Dadaist roots, these memes don't mock reality as such; they mock the idea that any consistent and just reality exists. The appeal of personalities like Spooderman or Mr. Skeltal offer no insights on the human condition, nor do they have concrete origins. They simply exist for the sake of existing. And in their meaninglessness, they reflect a reality without meaning.
Mr. Skeltal in the flesh
A “meme” is often defined as any viral, or pervasive idea. More than a picture or clever caption, memes speak to something deeper about the world we inhabit. As such, Dadaist memes, or memes which treat suicide as a joke, are more than senseless or unfortunate artifacts of our time — they speak directly to the core of my generation's identity. More than our technology or our beliefs, more than our tastes in fashion or in music, more than our culture or our communities, we are defined by senseless, pervasive, and self-aware desperation.
Our journey of survival in this world of malevolent apathy will not be told through articles or poems. No Orwell or Dickens could articulate the raw dread which we share. If future generations tell our story, they will not look beyond reddit, tumblr, or facebook. No, the story of this generation, of death, of crisis, of degradation, of filicide, of hopelessness, of absurdity — our story, will be told through memes.

Moroccans protest over public job cuts

Thousands of Moroccan trainee teachers and their families took to the streets of the capital Rabat on Jan. 24 to protest against government plans to cut education jobs, defying an official ban on demonstrations.Waving banners and chanting “Repression won't scare me,” several thousand protesters marched past hundreds of riot police who watched nearby with water canon trucks, just weeks after police were accused of violently repressing an earlier protest.Large-scale protests remain rare in Morocco, where the king holds sway. When pro-democracy unrest toppled leaders in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya in 2011, the palace calmed similar protests with limited reforms, spending and tougher security.The teacher trainee protests are one of several rallies that have taken place in the last few months against government plans to cut spending and reduce public sector hiring as part of reforms meant to revive state finances.The government said on Jan. 21, that it would not allow any unauthorized protests.
Add “May the Ferb be with you” to the list of relevant “Star Wars” puns, as Disney announced a crossover between the famed movie franchise and their popular cartoon, “Phineas and Ferb.”
Show creators and “Star Wars” fans Dan Povenmire and Jeff “Swampy” Marsh made the announcement today at San Diego's Comic Con. The hour-long special episode will place the wacky main characters of the kids show in the same timeline and place as “Star Wars.”
“Phineas and Ferb,” which centers on two stepbrothers who take on grand projects during summer vacation, has done well in ratings since beginning six years ago, being the #1 animated series for kids 6-11 in primetime. In the special “Star Wars” episode, their carefree existence on “Star Wars” planet Tatooine will be disturbed when plans to destroy the Death Star unwittingly fall into their hands.
Disney has been having fun with their $4 billion purchase of LucasFilm, acquired last year. Along with producing “Star Wars 7,” they have released other “Star Wars” crossovers of existing properties. They've unveiled pins combing characters from their “Cars” universe with “Star Wars” characters, and figurines of “The Muppets” doing the same thing.
Fans of the popular Square Enix “Kingdom Hearts” video game series, which features Disney worlds and characters, have speculated a “Star Wars” addition to the upcoming third game, and game designer Tetsuya Nomura has expressed interest in the idea.
The “Star Wars” episode will air next year on the Disney Channel and Disney XD.
The sky above Ramoso Pholo's fields is a glossy, postcard blue, drenching light over their neatly planted rows of corn, beans, and sunflowers. From a distance, it looks bucolic, but up close it is anything but.
For the past six months, Mr. Pholo has been waiting for clouds to blot this shimmering horizon and rains to soften their bone-dry fields. Instead, their neat rows of sunflowers have withered, and their corn stalks – normally as tall as they – are frozen waist-high.
“I have been farming my entire life and this is the worst season I have ever seen,” they say, cradling the head of a slumping sunflower. “About 99 percent of my crops are damaged – this year will be a total failure.”
The drought may be the worst Pholo has ever seen, but if forecasters are right, it may not be the worst they ever lives through. For climate scientists, the massive drought sweeping southern and eastern Africa since last year is an ominous signal of how climate change is driving extreme weather, threatening already vulnerable communities where climate and livelihood are closely intertwined.
The current dry weather, parched rivers, and crop failures here, the likes of which have not been seen in at least three decades, are linked to El Niño – a periodic warming of the Pacific Ocean – whose current iteration is one of the strongest ever recorded. El Niño is a natural phenomenon, occurring on average every three to five years and flip-flopping weather patterns in much of the world. But scientists say that rising greenhouse gas emissions are ratcheting up the incidence of super-charged El Niño years like this one. By the end of this century they'll likely occur every 16 years instead of every 28 – and Africa, the world's poorest and most ecologically fragile continent, will bear much of the brunt.
That urgency is compelling both innovative and pragmatic thinking on the continent. Kenya, Rwanda, and Ethiopia have developed so-called “green economy” strategies meant to couple emissions cuts with industrialization and development. Low-resource shifts like promoting drought-resistant maize, developing early warning systems that transmit weather information to farmers via cellphone, and boosting agricultural insurance plans are gaining popularity.
But in an ironic twist, that progress may be decreasing the global support that many nations still need – and demanded most recently at the COP21 conference in Paris from the developed countries they hold responsible for many of the damaging effects of climate change.
“There really are some climate justice issues involved,” says Bruce Campbell, director of research on climate change, agriculture, and food security with the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research. “[Adaptation] is going to cost a large amount of money and it's not really the fault of developing countries.”
Maize as an early alert
Across southern and eastern Africa, the drought drew attention first to the fragility of the agricultural economy – which employs a greater proportion of the population than farming does anywhere else on earth. In South Africa, for instance, the failure of commercial farms shifted the country from a grain exporter to a grain importer, inching the regional powerhouse ever closer to recession. And as farmers toppled, so did the economies built around them.
Pholo, for instance, typically employs 50 local people to help harvest their crops; this year he'll be lucky if it is half that. They also lease their farmland from villagers, who in turn receive monthly bags of maize meal and an annual cash payment. In December, for the first time, they aren't able to pay out. And in this economically choked corner of the country's rural northwest, such agreements are many people's only buffer against destitution.
“I'm very worried because if it doesn't rain there will be no food and no work,” says Tumelo Kgotle, a farmhand who supports seven dependents.
They say they know the drought is severe in part because people have begun to eat yellow maize – a crop typically reserved for livestock and long a bellwether of food shortages here. In Malawi, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe, maize prices are up by more than 50 percent over last year.
To a large extent, the international community already knows what it needs to do to reduce the level of devastation to African agriculture in future extreme weather events, Mr. Campbell says. Countries and regions need to invest in better early warning systems, sturdier insurance for farmers, and more drought resistant crop varieties.
But while “there are many successes on the continent … they're always just pieces of the full solution,” they say.
The effects have trailed out far beyond the continent's farming communities. In Zimbabwe and Zambia, for instance, the dangerously low levels of the Kariba hydroelectric dam prompted massive electricity shortfall. (In October, Zambian President Edgar Lungu went so far as to call for a national day of prayer to arrest their currency's precipitous backslide – triggered in part by the power scarcity.)
And in tiny Lesotho, one-third of whose population struggles with malnourishment and HIV, drought began compelling some of the hungry to stop vital medications that must be taken with food.
Then there is Ethiopia. The country has made massive strides in its own drought relief capabilities since a 1980s drought and famine that killed nearly a million people. But some 10 million Ethiopians still require “urgent humanitarian assistance” as a result of the current drought, according to the World Food Programme, and less than half of the $1.4 billion in needed international assistance has been funded to date.
Political implications
But Ethiopia's drought threatens the economy in far less obvious ways, according to Berouk Mesfin, a senior researcher with the Institute for Security Studies in Addis Ababa. For instance, it is straining rickety rural health systems and, as in Zimbabwe, sources of hydroelectric power.
“There could also be significant political implications,” they say. “The current government has staked its legacy … on attracting significant foreign investment.”
Drought relief may also become a pawn in national politics, says Ngonidzashe Munemo, a political scientist at Williams College in Massachusetts. In Zimbabwe, for instance, doling out food aid to supporters may be among the most effective tools President Robert Mugabe can leverage to hold onto power.
“That's your most powerful resource in times of drought,” Mr. Munemo says. “Because it doesn't have any standing drought relief programs, Zimbabwe is very open to political manipulation around aid distribution.”
Greater resilience
Africa's recent drought has generated relatively little global attention – for reasons that may not be entirely negative, according to Victor Chinyama, chief of communication at UNICEF Zimbabwe. In the 1980s and ‘90s, they point out, African droughts engendered a vast, paternalistic sympathy based on the assumption – not entirely incorrect – that the countries in crisis could not help themselves.
Now, they say, “so much has gone into building the capacities of our health systems that we rarely get to [extreme stages] of malnutrition. In a sense it is a positive story because the level of aid needed isn't as great as 30 years ago.”
That increased resilience comes in many forms – from better drought monitoring to more highly functional aid distribution. But it can be a double-edged sword: UNICEF recently warned that only 15 percent of its requested $155 million for drought relief in southern Africa had been funded.

African countries attempting to green their economies have faced similar difficulties. Ethiopia, for instance, has laid out an ambitious plan to ramp up hydroelectricity, energy efficiency, reforestation, and sustainable agriculture. But it is struggling to find the $150 billion in outside investments it needs.
Back in South Africa, Pholo says they remain cautiously hopeful – for either government intervention or good rains, whichever comes first. “It will take me three years to recover, at least,” Pholo says, surveying one of the weed-choked fields they didn't even bother to plant this year. “That's if the rains start tomorrow.”
We've all been there. At some point over the past few months we've all had one person (or perhaps several) ask "What's the difference between the Wii U and the Wii, and why on earth should I get one?" Many seem to think it's associated with the original Wii, instead of an entirely new console altogether.
The GamePad was the focus in the majority of the Wii U's marketing campaigns, so it was easy for people to think they could simply pick up this GamePad and use it with their Wii.
Nintendo seems to have taken on-board this issue and the fact that it has possibly confused some people, as this recent flyer found at PAX East — posted by Geoff Keighley on Twitter — outlines the core reasons as to why both consoles are totally different.
What are your thoughts on this new effort from Nintendo to advertise the Wii U? Do you think it's misguided, or is this kind of basic education a requirement to give the machine the boost it needs at retail? Post a comment to let us know.

King County voters will soon receive their ballots for an April 22 special election in which they will be asked to approve or reject Proposition 1, a $130 million hike in local car tabs and sales tax. At stake is an additional $50 million a year desperately needed to maintain county and city roads, along with the $80 million a year Metro needs to stave off a devastatingly regressive 17 percent cut in bus service. So of course the Seattle Times chooses to kick off its coverage of this very important issue with a front page article featuring the views of the one organization opposing Prop 1!
An early face-to-face over King County's proposed car-tab-and-sales-tax measure to fund transit and roads took place in front of one of the few organizations opposing the measure, the pro-highway Eastside Transportation Association (ETA). … [ETA member Dick] Paylor and audience members complained about how Metro King County Transit is managed, voiced concerns about seeing some virtually empty buses on some routes and suggested having bus passengers themselves pick up a larger share of the service's costs. “The problem isn't on the revenue side, it's on the expense-control side,” said Paylor, arguing that Metro is operating under a “broken financial model.”
Jesus. ETA is just a who's-who of old, pro-roads white guys (like the bitterly anti-transit Jim Horn), while the Yes side is a coalition of business, labor, transportation, environmental, and social service groups that enjoys endorsements from 19 mayors. So this is the equivalent of kicking off your climate change coverage by talking to the owners of a coal-fired power plant!
And of course, Paylor is totally wrong. The remaining problem is almost entirely on the revenue side of the equation. Through 2014, Metro will collect $1.2 billion less in sales tax revenue than previously projected, thanks to the Great Recession. Meanwhile, through a series of cuts, efficiencies, and fare hikes, Metro has lowered expenses or increased revenue by $148 million a year—$798 million from 2009 to 2013 alone. The only way for Metro to balance its budget without raising additional tax revenue would be to cut service and raise fares. Which, let's be honest, is exactly what ETA advocates.
But wait… the stoopid doesn't stop there. For the Seattle Times insists on citing Paylor citing the Washington Policy Center, a right-wing “think” tank best known for climate-change denial and its close ties to the stand-your-ground promoting ALEC:
Citing data from the conservative Washington Policy Center, Paylor said that from 2000 to 2012, Metro's operating costs increased 83 percent, while the inflation rate over that span was 33 percent.
Uh-huh. And you know what else has increased over the past decade? Everything!
King County's population has grown by 16 percent since 2000, while Metro's service hours have grown 4 percent since 2008 alone, despite a 2 percent reduction in service from its least efficient routes. Costs for providing Metro's paratransit services—federally mandated under the Americans with Disabilities Act—have grown by 25 percent since 2008, while security costs have grown by 80 percent, due to fare enforcement, increased policing, and enhanced tunnel security. To offset its revenue shortfall Metro shifted capital funds to operations, delaying the purchase of new buses that would have been less expensive to operate and maintain. Meanwhile, pension contributions—at a rate set by the state legislature—have increased by more the 40 percent.
And on and on and on. I won't even bother fact checking the Washington Policy Center, because only an idiot or a liar would pit the CPI against Metro's operating costs over a 12-year span and presume that there was any meaningful contextual relationship between the two numbers.
And yet there it is, totally unchallenged, in black and white on the front page of the Seattle Times. Next stop no doubt: a credulous citation on the paper's anti-tax editorial page.
“As bus ridership rises, battle over funding measure heats up,” the Seattle Times headline reads in the teach-the-controversy tradition of climate deniers and Intelligent Design bamboozlers. Except there is no battle. It's every other transportation stake-holder in the county versus the anti-transit ETA. And, I suppose, the Seattle Times.
Democrats, for very practical reasons, are cautious about embracing Occupy Wall Street. After all, the vast majority of Democratic political fundraising, from President Obama on down, comes from the top 1 percent. Without such money, Democrats would have to rely on the 99 percent for their fundraising. Lets face it: the 99 percent are broke. However, those reasons have a significant downside: many of those folks in the top 1 percent oppose the sorts of policies that improve the lives everyone else. I find it very difficult to believe those folks are willing to finance their political opponents.
A recent piece in The Atlantic noted:
"They're taking a wait-and-see approach with Occupy Wall Street," said Lanae Erickson, deputy director of the Social Policy and Politics Program at the left-of-center group Third Way. "I think there's a danger. It's very difficult for a president to turn an angry populist movement into something positive for a campaign."
FYI: Third Way is the reanimated corpse of the defunct Democratic Leadership Council, also known as the Republican wing of the Democratic Party.
While Occupy Wall Street is changing the national zeitgeist into something more favorable to Democratic politics, there isn't much changing going on in the Democratic Party itself. While President Obama has embraced a more populist rhetoric and pushed it aggressively, many other Democrats aren't even taking that step. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, for example, is scuttling New York's Millionaire Tax while demanding ever greater concessions from the middle class. On the local lever, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emmanuel is proposing a budget that cut public libraries, raise fees on middle class services, and simultaneously cuts business taxes. There are other examples going on around the country in states where Democrats are in charge, all of them representing the "Third Way" brand of Democratic politics. We are reaching a critical point where the rank and file of the Democratic Party finds itself increasingly alienated from its leadership class. Occupy Wall Street is expressing how the common people view money and power in America: it is a game that is rigged in favor of the 1 percent. Democrats are reaching the point, probably sooner than later, when they will have to make some key decisions about what sort of party they want to be: Occupy Wall Street or Third Way?
Perhaps there shouldn't be a stark, rather strident change in the character of the Democratic Party's leadership. As the party stands, I am of the opinion that if the Democrats were to fully embrace the Occupy movement, they would destroy it. Partly because many of them don't understand what it is all about, but mainly because Democrats are more often than not politically incompetent. Never underestimate the ability of Democrats to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. In other words, the best way Democrats should handle Occupy Wall Street is by not handling it at all. They seem to be doing just find without the Democrats, thank you very much. However, there is one area where Democrats could begin making a move in the right direction by learning something from Occupy Wall Street: Put the kibosh on Third Way Democrats.
Take Senator Ben Nelson. (Please)
Ben Nelson can be counted on to be against anything that is beneficial to the middle class and costly to Wall Street and Big Business. That is a given. Even the rather modest, milquetoast jobs bills being pushed through the Senate. They won't even vote for those. They have been a thorn in the side of Democrats for years, doing everything within their power to see to it that the policies that have shafted the middle class for decades remain in place so that their corporate benefactors keep them in place. One shouldn't expect that Democrats would even think of asking someone like them to embrace a modest jobs bill, much less Occupy Wall Street. Even if almost the entire Democratic Congressional Caucus is behind it. Nelson is the toast of the Washington Third Way establishment for doing these things.
Considering all that, does this make any sense at all?
The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is investing precious resources to bolster Sen. Ben Nelson, even though the Nebraskan has yet to commit to running for re-election in 2012. Since September, the Nebraska Democratic Party appears to have accessed DSCC transfers to fund about $800,000 worth of statewide television and radio ads on Nelson's behalf, according to GOP sources who track media purchases.
The guy opposes almost everything of economic importance the Democratic Majority proposes. The guy has watered down even the most minimal legislative efforts to bring the tiniest of crumbs to the middle class. The guy is cheering FOR Herman Cain, a man who says if you aren't rich it's your fault. Does a guy who consistently opposes everything Democrats attempt to do for regular folks deserve a million bucks in precious campaign resources? Especially when they all but certain to get defeated?
This is the sort of thing that Democrats in Washington can put a stop to. While they may not be able, due to the realities of our political system, to embrace the growing Occupy Wall Street movement, they can put a stop to Third Way Democrats running amok and then cashing in. Simply put, Democrats should adopt a position of cutting off financial and political support for anybody professing to be a "New Democrat" or a "Third Way Democrat." While it may not change much in the actual character of the party leadership in the short term, it should be obvious that the first step to building a strong, people centered party is not to endorse the people who are against it. It certainly doesn't make sense to spend precious fundraising dollars on someone who is supporting Republicans.
Let Democrats who choose the Third Way get their benefactors to pay for their campaigns while protecting and developing the more familiar brand of Hollywood/Trial Lawyers/Silicon Valley-backed Democrats. It won't bring us the "Occupy Democrats" we hope for or the union Democrats of old. Only major campaign finance reform will bring that about. But it would certainly mean a better party than we have now.
Castro a No-Show at Cuban Celebration
Fidel Castro fails to appear at a major military parade held in their honor. Many believe Castro's recent illness is terminal and that their reign in Havana is all but over.
DEBBIE ELLIOTT, host:
Cuba held a military parade today to honor Fidel Castro's 80th birthday, but the guest of honor didn't show, and analysts are saying that Castro's 47-year reign as Cuba's leader is over. Castro remained a steadfast communist long after the doctrine faded in the rest of the world, but they were brought down this summer by illness and old age.
NPR's Lourdes Garcia Navarro joins us now from Mexico City to talk about today's developments. What does it mean that Castro didn't appear today?
LOURDES GARCIA NAVARRO: Well, Debbie, I don't think he's coming back. The transition seems to have taken place, and this seems to be a new era in Cuba. Castro has not appeared in public since their illness was announced over the summer. The images we've seen of them show a sick, old man.
This was a very important occasion. You can't sort of overestimate it. A birthday celebration for Fidel that had been postponed, it was meant to bolster the image of what Cuba represents, what Castro represents, and it seems to me it was more like a kind of wake, even though it was marking the 50th anniversary of the revolution. Their brother Raul was at the helm today. They made a speech that made no direct reference to their brother Fidel or their condition.
I think if Fidel was in any condition to appear, they would have, and we can only infer by their absence that they were unable to.
Now, what does that mean? What is Fidel's real condition? Those are the questions. What we've seen after occasions like this is that they've released pictures of Fidel meeting with foreign dignitaries. It will be interesting to see if they give a kind of proof of life as they have in the past, but it's almost becoming a moot point, I think. Cuba is somehow signaling that it's moving on.
ELLIOTT: Now, Raul had a speech at this military parade today, and in it they made some comments that included what sounded like an overture to the U.S. Can you tell us about that?
GARCIA-NAVARRO: I think it was a really interesting thing that they said. I'm going to quote here. Raul said, This is an opportunity to once again declare our disposition to resolve on the negotiating table the longstanding conflict between the United States and Cuba.
Raul has never said anything like this before, where the eyes of the world through the international press were on them. And I think it can be interpreted as an overture to the United States. And I think the fact that Raul said it signals that Fidel, again, is not coming back. I don't think Fidel would have allowed a statement like that to be made, especially on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the revolution. I think it's significant. Although I don't think it will change the U.S. stance on Cuba anytime soon.
ELLIOTT: Have things changed in Cuba, as Fidel Castro is ailing and Raul Castro has been at the helm?
GARCIA-NAVARRO: What they've been trying to do, I think, up until now is give this idea of continuity. They've been trying to show that Fidel's legacy lives on. All the public statements by senior officials have said Fidel will be recovering, the revolution continues. And Raul publicly has made those same kinds of statements. Nothing has changed yet, but it may.
Where Cubans, though, really want change is on the economic front. There's a lot of hardship in Cuba. People want the economy to open up, from what they've told me when I visited there several times. So far there have been no signs of that. But I think all we can do for now is wait and see what happens next.
ELLIOTT: You know, one of the other things that Raul Castro seemed to stress in their speech today was this sense of unity. Was there some sort of message there? Is there any concern that when the people of Cuba realize that Castro is not coming back, that there could be some sort of reaction?
GARCIA-NAVARRO: I think that that is one of the main concerns of not only the Cuban government but also Cubans on the street. They are very worried and concerned about what happens next. Change has often meant in Cuba, if you look at its history before the revolution, change has often meant periods of violence, periods of uncertainty. And I think that Cubans are looking very closely, as is the international community, to see what is going to happen. Can the communist government remain in place?
ELLIOTT: NPR's Lourdes Garcia-Navarro, thank you.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: You're welcome.

Shipwreck funerals spur calls for orphan's release
Updated
A Muslim leader has called for the release from detention of an eight-year-old boy whose father died in the Christmas Island shipwreck tragedy and was buried today.
The burial was one of eight in Sydney two months after the wooden Indonesian fishing boat the asylum seekers were on crashed into rocks and sank, killing at least 30 people.
Eight-year-old Sinan Khaliq from Iran, one of 22 detainees flown from Christmas Island for the funerals, bowed their head as the body of their father Farhad was lowered into the ground.
Sinan's mother was never found.
Youness el Mouzafar was the Imam for the burials. Speaking through an interpreter they begged for Sinan to be released from detention.
"It was very dreadful... only imagining the kids drowning and other kids who were killed but the most... thing for me was there are children here and they died en route to Australia," they said.
They said Australia should give special consideration to the boy and should release them because they are an unaccompanied minor and they lost their whole family.
Mr el Mouzafar said Australia should follow through on its general idea of a fair go and release the boy.
Grief and anger
Despite agreeing with the Immigration Department that they would not speak to the media, two of the detainees allowed to attend the funerals wanted to tell their story.
Madain el Ibrahimy's eight-month-old daughter Zahra was buried today. The body of their wife and other child were never found.
"I lost my kids and my wife. I lost everything. I have nobody left. Only I have my brother here and I want to stay here, what's happening here?" they said.
For some of the families, grief was coupled with anger.
They claim they were not properly consulted about the funeral arrangements and they are unhappy with the way the asylum process has been handled.
Hussain Al Hussainy survived the crash, but their three-month-old son Sam did not.
"The residents of Christmas Island that rescued them and helped them is not the Australian Government or the Australian official people," they said.
"They are thanking the Australian people on Christmas Island for helping them while the Australian Government did nothing."
At the end of the funeral services the detainees were placed on a bus to head back to Christmas Island and Perth.
Their relatives in Sydney are unsure when they will see them next.
The decision to fly the detainees to Sydney has created political divisions.
Opposition immigration spokesperson Scott Morrison said the funerals should have been held on Christmas Island, and on Melbourne radio Opposition Leader Tony Abbott questioned the cost.
But their treasury spokesperson Joe Hockey said allowing the families to attend the funerals shows Australia's compassion.
Immigration Minister Chris Bowen said today was not a day for political debate on the issue but they defended the Government's decision to fly the detainees to Sydney.

British producer Kevin Nixon claims they just 'passed through'
Jack White and Eminem have been singled out by a British producer for not doing enough to celebrate the music of Detroit.
Kevin Nixon, who managed Kula Shaker and the late Kirsty MacColl, made the accusations during an interview with The Times. "The music industry more than any other has neglected Detroit," they explained. "So many musicians have left here to start careers somewhere else. The record company executives from New York or LA just fly right over."
Eminem and White Stripes drew particular comment from Nixon for their perceived lack of long-term support for the city in which they first made their names. "They just passed through" they told the paper. "They didn't build a movement. That's why I decided to bring the music industry here."
Nixon and their wife Sarah Clayperson moved to Detroit a year ago to found the Detroit Institute of Music Education. The first two Detroit signees to the record label Original 1265 Recordings are MPV and Charity, as well as British export Wildflowers.
In Gigwise's view, although it's fair to say that White has little interest in revisiting their time in Detroit any time soon (his fight with the Von Bondies' Jason Stollsteimer put paid to that), it seems particularly harsh to blame two performers for the entire city's lack of support for musical output.
Both White and Eminem ensured more column inches about the city in the music press than anyone else at the turn of the millennium - what happened next just proves how difficult it is to build the next Motown.
There was a law passed post-Rodney King to allow the Federal Government to take over police forces that are behaving badly on civil rights. (King's civil rights weren't violated, according to me and many conservative analysts, but the first Bush Administration got convictions on some of the cops involved.)
You can read about it in Heather Mac Donald's The War On Cops. (The law is called Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act (VCCLEA).)
While Ferguson was burning, due to a false media narrative, Eric Holder was attacking the Ferguson Police department.
While Baltimore burned over an accidental death, Obama sent an aide—a black aide—to the funeral of a drug dealer, while their "Civil Rights" enforcers were attacking the Baltimore PD>
During the Clinton Administration, and while Hillary was running for Senator from New York, the same tactics were used against Rudy Giuliani's New York. The (Bill) Clinton Justice Department investigated the cops who'd been exonerated in the Amadou Diallo shooting, on behalf of (Hillary) Clinton senatorial campaign.
And most recently, Obama's outgoing Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, issued a report on the Chicago PD saying they had been trying too hard to stop crime.
Well, you know, it doesn't look as if they're trying too hard. Some days it doesn't look as if they're trying at all. (See In 2016 Chicago, Only 4% of Attempted Murderers Have Been Arrested.)
Now Trump is suggesting that instead of the Justice Department backing the criminals, they should do something about crime in Chicago.
If Chicago doesn't fix the horrible "carnage" going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017
What a difference an election makes.
Copycat: Oona Chaplin pulls an Angelina Jolie style pose to launch Game of Thrones DVD
It has been less than a week since Angelina Jolie and their unruly right leg stole the show at the Oscars.
Actress Oona Chaplin put their best foot forward last night and did their very best impression of the Mr and Mrs Smith star, while at a DVD launch for Game of Thrones.
The 25-year-old, who is the granddaughter of silent screen legend Charlie Chaplin, arrived at The Old Vic Tunnels in Waterloo, London, in a style not that dissimilar to Jolie's.
Copycat: Oona Chaplin attends the DVD launch of Game of Thrones and poses like Angelina Jolie
Oona wore a black lace dress coat which was partially buttoned up but still revealed the stars underwear.
With their hair up, they posed in almost the identical way that Angelina did, by throwing their right leg out to the side in a slightly awkward fashion.
As the star smiled and continued making their legs the centre of attention, they were apparently unaware of the resemblance they had to the partner of Brad Pitt.
Inspiration: Oona and Angelina Jolie cut similar shapes with unruly legs
Fun time: Oona and Gwendoline Christie Brienne were larking around at the party
They tweeted after the event: 'Whoa. Lovely party. Just saw Angelina's dress at the Oscars...whoops. I guess legs are out.....'
Oona also admitted to having borrowed an interesting clothing item from their 67-year-old mother Geraldine Chaplin.
They said: 'I was wearing Gathering Goddess and my mom's knickers. No joke. My mom is the best.'
Glamour girls: Emilia Clarke and Sophie Turner both dressed up for the occasion
Chaplin had borrowed their outfit from vintage store Gathering Goddess and teamed the outfit with a pair of black heels.
They were joined at the DVD launch by many of their female cast members including Gwendoline Christie Brienne who plays Brienne of Tarth.
Gwendoline wore a black jumper with a matching skirt and the blonde was spotted larking around with Oona.
All black: Actor Michelle Fairley deciede not to wear a dress and arrived in a pair of trousers and a fur gilet
Emilia Clarke, 24, who plays Daenerys Targaryen, made huge effort and looked great in a cadet blue ruffle dress.
Michelle Fairley and Sophie Turner both arrived in black outfits with Michelle opting for trousers and the younger Sophie choosing a short dress that was part sheer.
Scottish actor Rose Leslie, who plays the minor role of Ygritte in Game of Thrones, wore a floor-length green skirt with a black T-shirt.
If you run a business, chances are your employees will incur job-related expenses. Some employers offer reimbursement to their employees for these expenses. If reimbursed, the Internal Revenue Code says for tax purposes, neither the expense nor the reimbursement is claimed on the employee's tax return. Further, the reimbursement is not reported as income on the employee's Form W-2.
Thing is, the business expenses need be legitimate and substantiated by adequate records. While that makes perfect sense, it doesn't mean everyone follows the rules.
Mr. Rasey of Powell, Ohio was the owner of Macloud Financial, Inc., a mortgage-brokerage firm. Mr. Rasey set up an “employee reimbursement account” for their employees. They were encouraged by Mr. Rasey to claim up to 80 percent of their compensation as reimbursement for business expenses, effectively subjecting only 20 percent of their compensation to withholding, and re-characterizing the reimbursement amounts as expenses for the firm. When employees questioned their boss about this arrangement, they told them they had an expert verify its legality.
The flags: Excessively high company business expenses, and excessively low compensation. So the IRS investigated.
The expenses were obviously illegitimate, resulting in the underpayment of employment taxes of $341,849 for the tax years 2002, 2003, and 2004. Mr. Rasey pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the IRS, and will serve 21 months of time.
If your employer encourages you, the employee, to claim for reimbursement of business expenses that you know don't exist, find another job yesterday.

Powerful adviser Al Haymon has signed yet another significant piece of talent in 2014. BoxingScene.com has confirmed that former multi-division champion Robert "The Ghost" Guerrero (31-2-1, 18KOs) has signed an agreement with Haymon.
Since the start of the year, Haymon has signed WBC 175-pound champion Adonis Stevenson, IBF 140-pound champion Lamont Peterson, Anthony Peterson, Luis Collazo, Rances Barthelemy, and several others. Haymon also works with Floyd Mayweather Jr., Adrien Broner, Marcos Maidana, Shawn Porter, Peter Quillin, Keith Thurman, Leo Santa Cruz, Danny Garcia, Deontay Wilder, and an army of other top names.
"We are very exited to bring Al Haymon to the team. We believe Al is the best adviser in the business. Robert is ready to fight. Al has three welterweight champions in their stable and nearly every big name at 147-pounds, and Robert is ready to get right back in the mix with the biggest names. Robert is hungry for big fights and more world titles," said Luis DeCubas Jr., who co-manages Guerrero with Bob Santos.
Earlier in the year, Guerrero had a contract dispute with Golden Boy Promotions. Taking into considering that most of Haymon fighters are being handled by Golden Boy, Guerrero's promotional issues are likely resolved.
Guerrero's last appearance in the ring was in May 2013, when they lost a twelve round unanimous decision to Mayweather. It was Guerrero first loss since 2005, when they were competing as a featherweight - a split decision loss that they avenged the following year with a sixth round knockout of Gamaliel Diaz.

A year ago I published my first book. I was excited, but also very frightened. The less confident part of my nature taunted me with visions of a complete disaster. Would anyone buy a book by an unknown author? Fortunately, though, things went better than expected: the book was well received. I got many positive comments, some friendly pats on the back, new twitter followers, invitations to training sessions and conference talks, and the virtual badge of "unit testing expert". It also turned out that some people are willing to pay for the work of a relative newcomer.
All of this has encouraged me to try the same thing once again and rewrite the original book so that it presents the JUnit testing framework (instead of TestNG, which was the hero of the first book). Circumstances have been on my side. Firstly, after spending several years involved in TestNG projects, I joined a new one using JUnit. Secondly, the JUnit framework, after a long period of stagnation, has regained its vigour and is, once again, being actively developed. Thirdly, I was not a novice anymore. I had already written one book, so I knew exactly what kind of task I was taking on.
As with the first book, there are also many people who have helped me to write it. The comments received after publishing the former version have, moreover, enabled me to improve the content. A typo fixed here, a better formatted code there, a slightly updated code example - all in all, this book is definitely better than its predecessor! Thanks to Konrad Szydlo, Will McQueen and many others who shared their comments and spotted mistakes.
Today the book is ready. I hope you enjoy it!

Two people were shot dead and three others seriously wounded in Toronto after a fight broke out at a party hosted by rapper Drake.
Police were called to the Muzik nightclub on Tuesday morning after shots were fired inside the bar and fighting spilled out into the street.
It was unclear whether, Drake who performed at OVO Fest on Monday, was at the club at the time of the shooting.
Last year, a man was shot near the same nightclub after the same festival.
"We are very lucky that this is not a larger body count, quite frankly," Toronto Deputy Police Chief Peter Sloly said at a new conference on Tuesday.
Police said the victims were a man and a woman in their 20s and 30s.
Officials believe there may be more injured victims who have not yet contacted the police.
It was not immediately clear what started the violence, or if police are seeking more than one suspect.
No arrests have yet been made.
FireUI Multi-Device Designer and working with Views
In RAD Studio XE7, we introduced the FireUI Multi-Device Designer. FireUI makes it easy to create user interfaces across multiple devices using a master form to share all user interface code, and then optimize inherited views for each target platform and device.
Delphi, C++Builder and RAD Studio XE7 provide a set of predefined views, including Windows Desktop, Surface Pro Tablet, Mac Desktop, iPhone, iPad, and several Android Phones, Tablet and Google Glass optimized views.
Views are a mechanism that allows you to define a different layout and components for the forms of your application depending on the device where your application is running.
New forms contain a single view: the Master view. The Master view is the view that your application loads if your application does not contain any other view fit for the device where your application is running. You can add more views to your application if you want to provide a different view on a specific kind of device. These additional views are customized versions of the Master view for a given device or a type of device that inherit all the components and modifications from the Master view.
In many cases, you will define most of your code on the master view. However, you may want to change an existing event for a specific platform or device. In that case, you can access the existing event handler and change the name of the event.
unit Unit20; interface uses System.SysUtils, System.Types, System.UITypes, System.Classes, System.Variants, FMX.Types, FMX.Controls, FMX.Forms, FMX.Graphics, FMX.Dialogs, FMX.StdCtrls; type TForm20 = class(TForm) Button1: TButton; procedure Button1Click(Sender: TObject); procedure Button1Click_iOS(Sender: TObject); private { Private declarations } public { Public declarations } end; var Form20: TForm20; implementation {$R *.fmx} {$R *.iPhone4in.fmx IOS} procedure TForm20.Button1Click(Sender: TObject); begin ShowMessage('Button clicked'); // event defined in master view end; procedure TForm20.Button1Click_iOS(Sender: TObject); begin ShowMessage('iOS Button clicked'); //event redefined in iPhone view end; end.
You can also create and add new views to the View Selector in the Form Designer if the available views do not cover the specifications of your target device. Usually, that is not necessary, but if you want to fine-tune the layout for a specific device (i.e. your company has standardized on Nexus 5), creating a custom view will allow you to further customize your UI. This is also a great way to add views for new wearable form factors such as various watches that you may want to target, like the Moto 360, which Jim McKeeth recently covered.
In this blog post, I am going to cover the steps to add a Nexus 5 specific view with the associated design time and runtime support. You can also find detailed instructions on how to add a custom view by clicking here.
Step 1: Create a new package
Select File > New > Package - Delphi or C++Builder.
In the Project Manager, right-click the <project_name.bpl>.
Select Add New > Unit.
Add the following code to the unit:
unit MyNexus5; interface implementation uses system.Devices, system.Types, system.SysUtils; const ViewName = 'MyNexus5CustomView'; // The name of the view. initialization TDeviceinfo.AddDevice(TDeviceinfo.TDeviceClass.Phone, ViewName, TSize.Create(1920, 1080), TSize.Create(1920 div 2, 1080 div 2), // MinPhysicalSize(max, min), MinLogicalSize(max, min) TSize.Create(1920, 1080), TSize.Create(1920 div 2, 1080 div 2), // MaxPhysicalSize(max,min), MaxLogicalSize(max,min) TOSVersion.TPlatform.pfAndroid, 445);
// Select the platform and the pixel density. If you are targeting a specific form factor only, you can use
//matching numbers for the min and max physical size instead of providing a range
finalization TDeviceinfo.RemoveDevice(ViewName); // To unregister the view after unistalling the package.
end.
Measurements taken in landscape format
To get the resolution and pixel density for the Nexus 5, I just did a quick Google search online.
Step 2: Install the new package
Before installing the package close any open project on the Designer.
In the Project Manager, right-click the <project_name.bpl>
Click Install
An Information message appears informing you that the package has been installed.
Step 3: Update the MobileDevices.xml to add a custom device skin
You can find the MobileDevices.xml file by going to Go to C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Embarcadero\BDS\15.0.
I created two Nexus 5 device skins. One for portrait orientation and one for landscape orientation. Both of the pngs get referenced in my custom mobile device definition below.

'Crazy ants' that feast on electronics and are invading the U.S.CANNOT be killed with normal insecticide
Since it was first spotted in Houston in 2002, it's spread to some 21 counties in Texas, 20 counties in Florida and a few locations in Mississippi and Louisiana
The omnivorous ant attacks and kills other species as well as monopolizing food sources to the detriment of the entire ecosystem
It also attacks electrical wiring, causing millions of dollars worth of damage
A new and annoying species of ant is terrorizing the U.S. and chemicals that kill off other types of the insect are proving ineffective against it.
The 'crazy' ant, named for the erratic trail it leaves as it makes its way across the country, originated in Argentina and Brazil.
But since it was first spotted in Houston in 2002, it has spread to some 21 counties in Texas, 20 counties in Florida and a few locations in Mississippi and Louisiana.
Scroll down for video
The biggest factor to the spread of 'crazy' ants has been transportation via humans
Courtesy: University of Texas College of Natural Sciences
University of Texas researcher and co-author of a study on the creatures Ed LeBrun said the omnivorous ants attack and kill other species as well as monopolizing food sources to the detriment of the entire ecosystem.
They said everything from cattle to songbirds are at risk of the tiny ants, despite them being at the bottom of the food chain.
According to ABC News , the chemicals that kill the more common red ant aren't effective on crazy ants so residents should call pest control if they find an infestation in their home.
And hopefully they'll get there before the critters attack their computer.
The insects, bizarrely, are attracted to electrical wiring and components and in one year alone caused $146.5 million in damages in Texas, ABC reported.
The devastation occurs when one ant discovers the transformer then gets electrocuted when it touches it, and 'waves its abdomen in the air' omitting a certain scent.
The scent lures for ants to the scene and they too are electrocuted, again sending the scent into the air to attract their friends.
Eventually, there are so many dead ants that the electric switches get stuck or the insulation fries and the system shuts down.
Terrors: University of Texas researcher Ed LeBrun said the omnivorous ant, pictured, attacks and kills other species as well as monopolising food sources to the detriment of the entire ecosystem
But LeBrun said the biggest problem of the ant's invasion is that it has completely eliminated the red ant, or fire ant. And no one knows why.
'Perhaps the biggest deal is the displacement of the fire ant,' LeBrun said, according to ABC. 'The whole ecosystem has changed around fire ants. Things that can't tolerate fire ants are gone. Many that can have flourished.
'New things have come in. Now we are going to go through and whack the fire ants and put something in its place that has a very different biology. There are going to be a lot of changes that come from that.'
The crazy ants are most commonly found in coastal areas with warmer temperatures. K nown scientifically as 'Nylanderia fulva,' they are also referred to as 'rasberry' after the exterminator Tom Rasberry who discovered them in Houston in 2002.
The 'crazy' ants do not have such a painful sting as their insect counterparts, but they are still a nuisance for homeowners.
'Crazy' ants have been identified all the way from Texas to Mississippi. Researchers believe that the ants cannot survive in regions that are dry or cold.
Unlike fire ants, crazy ants also do not spread as quickly. They can only advance approximately 200 meters per year on their own.
The biggest factor in their spread along the Southeast has been human transportation.
Pinkbike headquarters move to Squamish
It's official, Pinkbike, the most popular mountain bike website in the world, has made Squamish its new home. Following several months of working with the District of Squamish Economic Development Department, Pinkbike has opened an office and its owners have purchased a home in downtown Squamish. Pinkbike employs 20 full time people, and over 100 part-time contractors in various roles. The company's website receives over 73 million page views in a month and is an icon in the mountain bike industry.
"We are so excited to have Pinkbike HQ, owners and staff relocating to Squamish," says Mayor Patricia Heintzman. "They are a perfect fit for our mountain bike-crazed community and I know they will be embraced enthusiastically by our citizens and business community. The relocation of this type of venture, and the fact they see Squamish as a place they can grow and promote their business into the future, further reinforces Squamish's positioning as a community hardwired for adventure, and one that is fostering an exciting supportive business culture for this type of global enterprise."
The District of Squamish, the Squamish Off Road Cycling Association, trail builders, and major event producers like the Test of Metal have been applying increasing resources to support the growth of mountain biking in Squamish. Amongst growing media accolades about mountain biking in Squamish, in January of this year Pedal Magazine named Squamish as the best place to ride in Canada.
“The welcome has been awesome and the local bike community here is tight,” says Karl Burkat, Chief Executive Officer of Pinkbike. “We can't wait to ramp things up here”.
“We are looking to hire local people right away, particularly on the software development side and also on the GIS side for the new www.trailforks.com project we are working on,” says Radek Burkat, Chief Technology Officer and Founder of Pinkbike. Anyone interested in working for Pinkbike can get in touch via e-mail at jobs@pinkbike.com.
Squamish is home to a number of recreation technology (rec tech) businesses in the areas of product design and testing, advanced materials, performance measurement, training and recreation management, and web and multimedia marketing support for the recreation sector.
“Pinkbike is a big deal for the development of the rec tech industry cluster in Squamish,” says Dan McRae, Economic Development Officer for the District of Squamish. “The owners and staff of this company are very well connected to the key players in the industry. I have no doubt that they will serve as an influential role in attracting additional further investment and employment from other rec tech brands to Squamish.”
Gold medalist Bill Johnson, slowed by disease, still craves the speed of downhill racing
Before there was Bode, there was Bill. As in “Wild Bill” Johnson, the first American downhiller to win a gold medal. And they didn't do it quietly.
Despite the fact that they had just joined the World Cup tour in 1983 and only won a single downhill, Johnson brashly predicted that they would win gold in the 1984 Sarajevo Olympics. Not surprisingly, that didn't sit well with the rest of the skiing world. But Johnson backed up their boast with a Gold Medal performance.
Just as fast as they rose, though, Johnson's mercurial ways — many suggest that their partying made Bode Miller's recent behavior look like a choirboy — brought them back down. They were left off the 1988 Olympic team and injuries forced them off the tour in 1990.
In 2001 at age 40 they tried the unthinkable: a comeback in downhill at age 40. A severe crash left them in a coma, from which they miraculously recovered.
But a series of strokes in recent years have left them in perilous health. Sports Illustrated recently caught up with Johnson to retell their story and connect with the skier, now confined to a wheelchair. Read the compelling story.

Anze Kopitar #11 of the Los Angeles Kings celebrates their overtime goal in front of Radim Vrbata #17 and Jacob Markstrom #25 of the Vancouver Canucks 25 for a 2-1 win at Staples Center on December 1, 2015 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Harry How/Getty Images)
LOS ANGELES – Anze Kopitar scored the game-winning goal in overtime and the Los Angeles Kings handed the Vancouver Canucks their 8th overtime loss of the season 2-1 on Tuesday night at Staples Center.
HOW IT HAPPENED
Daniel Sedin put the Canucks up one on the power play thanks to their brother Henrick whose pass fell perfectly to Daniel's stick on the right side of the net. Sedin blasted a wrist shot through the five-hole of Jonathan Quick and Vancouver had the lead.
Drew Doughty brought the Kings level in the third period on the power play after their slapshot got past Canucks backup goalie Jacob Markstrom. The goal put Doughty 4th on the King's all-time franchise list for points amongst defensemen.
Marian Gaborik was credited with the assist, giving them four goals and six points in their last eight games.
With just over a minute remaining in regulation, Radim Vrbata was called for hooking, put the Kings on the power play for the final 90 seconds. Los Angeles was not able to capitalize, but had a 4-on-3 advantage for the first 30 seconds of overtime.
The Kings didn't score on the PP in OT, but Anze Kopitar finally connected on the game-winner 2:02 into the extra period when they got a great one-timer from Jeff Carter. The Kings outshot the Canucks 40-16 for the game.
TURNING POINT
Doughty's goal. The Kings were dead in the water before the defenseman tied things up at 1-1.
MVP OF THE GAME
The third period. The Kings outshot the Canucks 15-1 in the final period as they came-from-behind for the second straight game.
STAT OF THE NIGHT
Drew Doughty's third period goal gave them 280 points for their career, passing Lubomir Visnovsky for fourth all-time among defensemen in LA Kings franchise history.
TWEET OF THE NIGHT
A Charlie Brown Christmas steals my heart every time…but seriously, stay out of the box.
PHOTO OF THE NIGHT
When going between the legs for the score is not a good thing.
QUOTE OF THE NIGHT
"I don't know. I wasn't in their dressing room before the third period." – LA Kings head coach Darryl Sutter when asked if the Canucks were tired for the final frame.
NOTES
Kings defenseman Matt Greene will undergo shoulder surgery on Thursday and is expected to miss the remainder of the season.
The Canucks were without left winger Chris Higgins and right winger Jake Vlirtanen as both skaters were injured on Monday in the team's 4-0 loss to the Anaheim Ducks.
The Canucks loss is their eighth overtime loss this season (most in the NHL).
RECORD
Vancouver Canucks (9-9-8, 26 points) 4th place in Pacific Division
Los Angeles Kings (15-8-1, 31 points) 1st place in Pacific Division
WHAT'S NEXT?
The Canucks will be happy to exit California as they travel back to Vancouver where they will host the red-hot Dallas Stars on Thursday at 7:30PM PST at Rogers Arena.
The Kings host the Pittsburgh Penguins on Saturday afternoon at 1:00PM PST at Staples Center.
When someone asks you a question such as "Why do you love WildStar?" it deserves a proper response. Here is mine.

That's the question my brother asked me over the weekend. He's not into massively multiplayer games though they have been known to dabble in them from time to time. I have to admit the question caught me off guard and while it didn't help that they were well and truly annihilating me at Twisted Metal (it's a classic!), I thought it best that I put my answer in writing.
Telegraphs
Combat in massively multiplayer games is usually a dull affair. You click on a target and then proceed to use your skills while the game aims for you (as long as you look in the enemies general direction). While efforts in recent years have been made to increase the “action” feel of fighting through systems such as dodging, very little has changed. WildStar mixes things up much more than its competition by having every skill in the game become a “telegraph”. For the uninitiated, this basically means every skill has an area of effect. You aim in the direction of your foe or ally, use your skill and if they're in your telegraph they'll receive damage or health. It's super simple, highly confusing at first and makes an enormous difference to PvE and PvP. Skills no longer act like homing missiles and aiming accuracy is super important. What makes telegraphs even more fun is the fact they come in all different shapes and sizes, placing even further emphasis on accuracy.
Humour
The recent WildStar flick demonstrating Warplots serves as a perfect reminder that WildStar is funny and it doesn't take itself too seriously: “Warplots are like your favourite food, wrapped in a six pack of beer, wrapped in another six pack of beer!”. The humor of WildStar creeps into the game in bucket loads, with one of the early quests seeing you avenge a Chua who's being cooked alive. Even when you ask to rescue them he's more than happy to burn. It's been a long time since I've genuinely laughed in a massively multiplayer game and if people actually take the time to read the quests, they're filled with dialogue that will make you laugh.

style="border: 0px solid ; width: 620px; height: 349px;" /> href="http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/256794"
title="">
Art and Aesthetics over Graphics
WildStar might not rival Crysis in terms of visuals but it does look exceptional. I've heard plenty of people moan about the fact it looks worse than this game or that game and I actually find that quite frustrating. WildStar has a playful, colorful appearance that will not only age well but allows it to be identified easily. The oddly proportioned characters and wonderful game world bring life to Nexus. The art direction might not appeal to everyone but I'd much rather see something as original as this than the generic approach taken by the likes of Black Desert Online or Elder Scrolls Online.
Work Hard, Play Hard
Most modern MMOG's seem to want to make everything easily accessible for absolutely everyone. From a business perspective this is sensible (it widens your audience) but from a personal perspective, it's not something I'm looking for in a game. I want to know that my time invested in my character makes me better than someone who plays very little. I want to be able to control the Auction House by getting off my backside and farming materials and I want to be able to min/max my character through super tough raids and dungeons. Games are too easy and the fact that WildStar is going a little bit old-school has massive appeal.
Providing The Basics
Far too many MMOGs launch with skeletal features and if they do launch with things we now expect as a minimum, they're often buggy or fail to function as they should (see Guild Wars 2's Trading Post). What I love about WildStar is the fact that it's launching with so much and what it's launching with works so well: an auction house, dye system, battlegrounds, Arenas, Warplots, dungeons, raids, currencies for item exchanges, housing and much more. Everything might not yet be perfect and I'm sure Carbine will continue to improve on these cornerstones well after launch, but to have them from day one is a huge bonus.

title="">
Raids
On paper the idea of raids sounds terrible. I've tried explaining them to my brother many times and they just doesn't understand what the attraction of them is. Sadly for them he's never experienced the sheer joy at overcoming a ridiculously difficult boss with 40 friends and it's a feeling you just can't explain. The fact WildStar has raids is awesome but the fact they're super difficult makes them even more appealing. Bring on the challenge.
Open World PvP
Lord I've missed open world PvP. I know it's not for everyone and some people enjoy questing without fear of interruption but for me, there's nothing better than the constant fear of being “jumped”. Playing on a PvP server provides a totally different experience to that on a PvE variant and while it might be frustrating to be ganked every now and again, the positives far outweigh the negatives. Chance encounters or running for your life as a group of opposing players chase after you is a buzz like nothing else. I've very fond memories of PvP servers and it's so refreshing to see a developer willing to do them from launch.
Polish
WildStar isn't perfect (yet) and there are a few bugs here or there but for the most part it's incredibly polished. From the wonderful emote animations to the nuances of each class, it all just feels right. It might be a game that's much more traditional in nature than Guild Wars 2 or Elder Scrolls Online but if that means it isn't a buggy mess and simply works, I'll settle for that everyday of the week and will happily pay a subscription fee for the pleasure.
Limited Action Set and Customisation
I love Limited Action Sets and while they're tricky to balance to ensure all skills have their place, they offer a tactical approach to combat and your play. If that wasn't good enough, we get to play with Tiers to customise skills further and AMP's to personalise our class' focus. On top of that we also get path skills, gadgets and potions. For new players I'm sure it's a little bit overwhelming but in the long run, it's well worth it.
Housing
Last but not least is housing. It's not quite on the scale of Landmark but it's a brilliant middle ground. Perfect for wasting hours upon hours as you customize the inside and outside of your plot, it's a highly accomplished addition to the game. What I love so much about housing is the fact it serves a purpose for you and your guild, allows for a variety of activities and is genuinely addictive. I know for a fact I'll spend far too many hours customizing my house and I dread to think at the amount of gold I'll waste.
So that's my response to my brothers question (even though I could list much more!) now the most important question: What do YOU love about WildStar?

A driver wearing FLIP-FLOPS has been jailed for leaving two of their friends badly hurt in a 90mph M6 smash.
Simone Cunningham was on their way home from a party in Leicester when they swerved across the motorway, crashed into the central reservation and ricocheted down the northbound carriageway.
One of their passengers was thrown from the vehicle, prompting fellow travellers to rush to help and warn other drivers.

The impact was so big that the hired Vauxhall Corsa's engine was ripped from the car and smashed into another vehicle.
Cunningham had no insurance and could not remember the accident, Birmingham Crown Court heard.
The 24-year-old, of Hednesford Road, Cannock, was jailed for 16 months after admitting two charges of causing injury by dangerous driving.
They were also banned from driving for two years and eight months.
Passing sentence, Judge Avik Mukherjee told her: “You had driven to and from Leicester knowing you were not insured.
“You should not have been on the road.
“Whatever speed you were travelling, it was way too fast.
“You were an inexperienced driver, particularly at that speed.”
The crash happened between junctions five and six, Castle Bromwich to Spaghetti Junction, just before 7.50am on March 15 last year.
Passenger Shanae Hall, 19, who was thrown from the car, suffered damage to their liver and kidneys as well as bleeding to the brain and an injury to their neck.
They were released from hospital on April 5.
Shannune Hylton, aged 22, needed surgery for a perforated bowel, was in hospital for ten days and had to have five weeks off work.
Another driver also suffered whiplash type injuries.
Patrick Sullivan, prosecuting, said Cunningham undertook two cars before the crash.
One of those drivers put their speed at about 90mph.
Mr Sullivan said: “The Corsa swerved violently across the carriageway into the outside lane and collided with the barrier.
“Cunningham lost control of the vehicle owing to the speed it was travelling at and the violent change in direction.
“It was a violent collision which lead to the car veering to the left, across the carriageway and hitting the barrier on the hard shoulder and then ricocheting down the carriageway.
“It was a hired car and they were wearing flip flops while driving.
“Her passengers were asleep.”
Cunningham gave a positive breath test but was not over the drink-drive limit, the court heard.
Tom Walkling, defending, said: “She is deeply saddened to the point of depression and has had suicidal thoughts as a result of what they have done.
“The two principle victims in this case were their friends and one of them remains a close friend.”
9.05AM: Investigators are still unsure what started a fire at the private marina at Palazzo Versace early this morning, destroying three yachts and damaging a fourth.
Water police Senior Sergeant Lucas Young said they had to get all the boats up before they could determine what happened.
"Until we can raise them and have a good look, we've got nothing at this stage," they said.
"We'll see if we can get to the bottom of it."

Boaties thanked the southerly for blowing the wind in the right direction and not on to other boats.
A clean up from the Gold Coast Waterways Authority is now on scene collecting debris.
8.45AM: Emergency services say the wind helped to save some vessels moored at the Palazzo Versace private marina from a fire this morning.
Three yachts were destroyed and a fourth was damaged in the blaze. Two have sunk and a third is expected to sink.

Firefighters were called to the scene about 2.30am and found the yachts "well involved" in fire.
Two of the yachts have sunk and a third is also likely to go under.
A fourth yacht was relocated and saved from the fire.
News_Image_File: Fire crews remain at the scene after three yachts were destroyed by fire and a fourth was damaged at Palazzo Versace on Wednesday morning. Firefighters conducted a search of the yachts and found nobody on board.
A bund wall has been set up to contain a spill, believed to be fueled from one of the yachts and environmental officers have been called.
News_Image_File: Three 40ft yachts were destroyed in a fire at Palazzo Versace early Wednesday morning. Six fire crews and a fire investigator are on the scene with police.
It took more than three hours to put the fire out and crews said it was fortunate they were able to contain the fire to just a handful of boats.
It is unknown if the fire is suspicious at this point.

Berkeley Professor Robert Reich And Ann Coulter Agree On First Amendment
Conservative author Ann Coulter discusses the state of the First Amendment with Berkeley Professor Robert Reich.
JONATHAN KARL, ABC NEWS: Joining me now, Ann Coulter and Berkeley professor and former Clinton Labor Secretary Robert Reich.
Professor Reich, let me start with you, you and Ann Coulter agree on basically nothing. But you said that Berkeley made a, quote, grave mistake by canceling their speech. Why do you believe that?
ROBERT REICH, FMR. LABOR SECRETARY: Jonathan, as you said, I don't ever remember agreeing with Ann Coulter on anything. Maybe there is something Ann and I have agreed on, but I do believe in the first amendment, and I will fight for their right to say what they want to say. The first amendment is, and freedom of speech, is the cornerstone of our democracy. And, whether it's college
campuses or somebody burning a flag or it's the -- newspapers having a right to say whatever they want, we cannot toy around with the first amendment. It is absolutely critical.
KARL: Ann?
ANN COULTER, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR: Well, thank you, professor, for allowing me and my constitutional rights.
But, I mean, I must say, I think this debate has – I mean, first of all, has divided leftists in the country from those who believe in the constitution and those who don't. I think we have seen this thuggish violence at university after university. Mario Savio (ph), the one who stood up in the '60s and yelled free speech at Berkeley. That was free speech for lefties. But like they say about democracy in the third world, one man, one vote, one time. As soon as lefties took over the the university, that's it free speech is shut down.
But any way, I think that hill, when we have Obama, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Bill
Maher, among others, all saying of course you should let Ann Coulter speak and not let violent thugs shut it done, OK, we're done with that hill.
Now, let's move on to the hill where it's considered – I mean, some of these people, not you,
professor, keep saying, well, of course, it's hateful. But hateful speech is allowed to exist. No, I'm sorry, I'm engaging in a public policy debate. That is not a hateful speech. I think those are the lefties we need to discuss with next. These are important issues of public policy.
KARL: But, Ann -- the reaction of students at a place like Berkeley can't surprise you given some of the things you have said.
COULTER: Oh, please.
KARL: Well, let's take a look. You have said that getting rid of women's right to vote is a personal fantasy. You said of one group of 9/11 widows and I quote, I've never seen people enjoying their husbands' deaths so much.
And then there was the tweet that you put out just the day before the election, saying, "If only people with at least four grandparents born in America were voting, Trump would win in a 50-state landslide."
I mean, on that one, by the way, neither Donald Trump nor Mike Pence would be able to vote.
COULTER: I -- OK. Let's just take that one. We can go through all the greatest hits of much of my commentary. I watch roughly 24 hours a day, the Hispanic vote, the Hispanic vote, the Hispanic vote, how the -- how the, you know, the browning of America and how are African Americans voting. How are women voting.
I describe one demographic and say how it would come out.
And that's hate speech?
Why doesn't it hate speech to keep telling me how Hispanics are going to vote?
What you're talking about are rhetorical flourishes. And I don't know, maybe you guys think you are smarter than the Founding Fathers. But they did not put an asterisk on the First Amendment.
(CROSSTALK)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think we all agree --
COULTER: The Founding Fathers just forgot about that, that -- and no rhetorical flourishes. No jokes.
REICH: Well, we finally found something, after all these years, where I agree with Ann Coulter, that is there is no hate speech exemption for the First Amendment.
KARL: So I want to ask you about the similar controversy that we saw at Middlebury over Charles Murray's attempted speech which caused violent protests. They ultimately are unable to speak. And then a student at Middlebury explained the situation to "The New York Times" this way.
"For too long, a flawed notion of free speech has allowed individuals in positions of power to spread racist pseudoscience in academic institutions, dehumanizing and subjugating people of color and gender minorities."
So you're there. You're a professor at Berkeley. You spent a lot of time with very smart Millennials.
Are you concerned that there is a growing view among young activists that freedom of speech simply does not apply to offensive speech, that there is that asterisk?
REICH: Jonathan, to the extent that there is that view at Berkeley or anyplace else, I am concerned because one of the purposes of a university education is to be provoked, to examine what the evidence is.
And if somebody says something that is offensive, well, that is not per se, you know, a violation of any kind of university norm; in fact, quite the opposite. I tell my students all the time, the best way to learn something is to talk to people who disagree with you because that forces -- that forces you to sharpen your views and test your views.
And you might even, might even come out in a different place. A university of all places is the -- is the locus where we want to have provocative views. We want to have views that some people find to be offensive.
KARL: Ann, can we find another place where the two of you might agree?
I want to ask you, and I talked to Reince Priebus about it here just a short while ago, about what the president has said about opening up the libel laws. And we heard Priebus that this is something they're still looking into. In other words, giving the president the ability to sue "The New York Times" or other news organizations for coverage that they do not like.
Can we agree that that is not a good idea?
COULTER: I can answer that very quickly, no, I have always thought there should be a pure truth falsity standard and a limit on damages. But I do want to agree with the professor on universities ought to be places where I'm not the only conservative most students will hear in four years of college.
And what this shows, this whole incident shows, again, it shows this radical, insulated Left on the college campus. And the entire left wing, including President Obama and Bill Maher on the other side and what useless institutions our universities are. The prices have gone up 3,000 percent since the '70s.
Is the education better?
No. It's worse. The lefties are on the side of the thugs. They've taken over the universities. I don't think anyone learns anything at college anymore. It's a four-year vacation. And I think that's what people ought to be looking at because the taxpayers are supporting these universities, not just University of California but with federal grants every university in America.
REICH: If I can just get to your question, Jonathan, the libel laws should not be widened. I mean, we really do need a free press. One thing that concerns me about the present administration is the willingness of the administration to not only talk about widening the libel laws and also criminalize flag-burning but even the President of the United States last night, using an opportunity in Harrisburg to summon their supporters and to criticize the press once again.
This is dangerous. I mean, if we believe in the First Amendment, we believe in a free and independent press.
KARL: All right, Professor Robert Reich and Ann Coulter, a debate that you couldn't have seen at Berkeley, thank you for joining us on THIS WEEK.
Bodybuilding is a sport in which competitors are judged on muscular appearance. This case study tracked a drug-free male bodybuilder (age 26-27 y) for the 6 mo before and after a competition.
PURPOSE:
The aim of this study was to provide the most comprehensive physiological profile of bodybuilding competition preparation and recovery ever compiled.
METHODS:
Cardiovascular parameters, body composition, strength, aerobic capacity, critical power, mood state, resting energy expenditure, and hormonal and other blood parameters were evaluated.
RESULTS:
Heart rate decreased from 53 to 27 beats/min during preparation and increased to 46 beats/min within 1 mo after competition. Brachial blood pressure dropped from 132/69 to 104/56 mmHg during preparation and returned to 116/64 mmHg at 6 mo after competition. Percent body fat declined from 14.8% to 4.5% during preparation and returned to 14.6% during recovery. Strength decreased during preparation and did not fully recover during 6 months of recovery. Testosterone declined from 9.22 to 2.27 ng/mL during preparation and returned back to the baseline level, 9.91 ng/mL, after competition. Total mood disturbance increased from 6 to 43 units during preparation and recovered to 4 units 6 mo after competition.
CONCLUSIONS:
This case study provides a thorough documentation of the physiological changes that occurred during natural bodybuilding competition and recovery.
Reading 1 2 Mc 6:18-31
Eleazar, one of the foremost scribes,
a man of advanced age and noble appearance,
was being forced to open their mouth to eat pork.
But preferring a glorious death to a life of defilement,
they spat out the meat,
and went forward of their own accord to the instrument of torture,
as people ought to do who have the courage to reject the food
which it is unlawful to taste even for love of life.
Those in charge of that unlawful ritual meal took the man aside privately,
because of their long acquaintance with him,
and urged them to bring meat of their own providing,
such as they could legitimately eat,
and to pretend to be eating some of the meat of the sacrifice
prescribed by the king;
in this way they would escape the death penalty,
and be treated kindly because of their old friendship with him.
But Eleazar made up their mind in a noble manner,
worthy of their years, the dignity of their advanced age,
the merited distinction of their gray hair,
and of the admirable life they had lived from childhood;
and so they declared that above all
they would be loyal to the holy laws given by God.
They told them to send them at once
to the abode of the dead, explaining:
"At our age it would be unbecoming to make such a pretense;
many young people would think the ninety-year-old Eleazar
had gone over to an alien religion.
Should I thus pretend for the sake of a brief moment of life,
they would be led astray by me,
while I would bring shame and dishonor on my old age.
Even if, for the time being, I avoid the punishment of men,
I shall never, whether alive or dead,
escape the hands of the Almighty.
Therefore, by manfully giving up my life now,
I will prove myself worthy of my old age,
and I will leave to the young a noble example
of how to die willingly and generously
for the revered and holy laws."
Eleazar spoke thus,
and went immediately to the instrument of torture.
Those who shortly before had been kindly disposed,
now became hostile toward them because what they had said
seemed to them utter madness.
When they were about to die under the blows,
they groaned and said:
"The Lord in their holy knowledge knows full well that,
although I could have escaped death,
I am not only enduring terrible pain in my body from this scourging,
but also suffering it with joy in my soul
because of my devotion to him."
This is how they died,
leaving in their death a model of courage
and an unforgettable example of virtue
not only for the young but for the whole nation.
This article is part of the Guardian's Euro 2012 Experts' Network, a co-operation between 16 of the best media organisations from the countries who have qualified for the finals in Poland and Ukraine. guardian.co.uk is running previews from two countries each day in the runup to the tournament kicking off on 8 June.
Slaven Bilic has proved to be flexible when it comes to formations. The Croatia manager can switch from 4‑1‑3‑2 to 4‑2‑3‑1, 4‑3‑3 or 4‑4‑2 – but usually in some sort of modified, unorthodox fashion. They do not think formations play a crucial role and is far more likely to rely on individual instructions as one of the few international managers who are prepared to employ five or six attack-minded players. It could be argued, however, that in Croatia's case this is done out of necessity rather than any determination to play attacking football.
The retirement of the Kovac brothers, the centre-back Robert and defensive midfielder Niko, has been a huge setback for Bilic. Following the break up of the Euro 2008 squad, the national coach has been left with plenty of options up front, but few at the back. This has been exacerbated by their willingness to employ two attacking full-backs, which can often leave their centre-backs exposed, especially without a player like Niko Kovac to protect them.
Because of this, Bilic usually employs a deeper defensive line and when Croatia play against teams with congested midfields, the attackers also have to drop deep to win the ball. It is a very demanding plan, both tactically and physically, and it is very hard to get it right without adequate preparation, a luxury this squad – which is scattered across the continent and only together for a few days before matches – have not had during their qualifying campaign. But this is also what gives them hope. Bilic and the players have expressed the belief that everything will fall into place at Euro 2012 because of the extra time they will have together.
The highly dynamic and attacking 4-4-2 formation that Croatia employed in their 3-0 play-off win against Turkey in Istanbul is an option for the match against Italy on 14 June, but it is unlikely that the manager will choose a similar approach in the Group C opener against Ireland on 10 June. Bilic could well add Eduardo da Silva or Nikica Jelavic to the forward line for the game against Giovanni Trapattoni's side. However, the Croat is a man who analyses tactical trends and it is entirely possible they will come up with something completely new for the tournament.
Against Ireland and Italy, injury permitting, Bilic is almost certain to start with Stipe Pletikosa in goal, Tomislav Dujmovic or Ognjen Vukojevic as the defensive midfielder, Darijo Srna as a right-sided midfielder, full-back or wing-back, Tottenham Hotspur's Luka Modric in the centre of the midfield, and, following the late withdrawal of Ivica Olic through injury, Nikica Jelavic and Mario Mandzukic up front.
Vedran Corluka is also likely to start these games, though it is not clear in which position they will play. The Bayer Leverkusen man feels most comfortable at right-back but could be asked to fill in on the left, in the centre, or even in midfield.
While Bilic has plenty of options in midfield (Ivan Rakitic, Niko Kranjcar, Ivan Perisic), and in attack (Eduardo and Nikola Kalinic), defence is a real problem. Lyon's Dejan Lovren has left the squad with an achilles injury and depending on where the manager chooses to play Corluka, Joe Simunic of Dinamo Zagreb and Eintracht Frankfurt's Gordon Schildenfeld are candidates for the central roles while Domagoj Vida should begin at right-back with either Ivan Strinic or Danijel Pranjic on the left.
Bilic is more unpredictable than any former Croatia manager. In fact, they are probably more unpredictable than most national coaches. While it can be argued that their tinkering is simply down to a lack of vision, it is probably closer to the truth to be saying that they are trying to get the most out of a limited pool of players.
Who is the player who is going to surprise everyone at the Euros?
Nikica Jelavic only made three starts in qualifying and managed a total of 315 minutes on the pitch for a return of no goals, but with the late withdrawal of the veteran Ivica Olic and the 26-year-old's immediate impact in the Premier League last season, they are likely to get more of a run in Poland and Ukraine.
It had all looked promising for Jelavic after scoring on their Croatia debut – a 3-2 friendly win against Qatar in 2009 – but they have only added one more international goal in 18 games – although only a handful were starts – with Olic, Eduardo and Mario Mandzukic usually in front of him.
Jelavic's greatest strength is their ability to finish, with either foot and usually first time, but at 6ft 1in they are also decent in the air and they can hold the ball up playing as a lone frontman, although it is in front of goal where they give best value.
They managed 11 goals in 16 games after their £5.5m move to Everton to finish as their top scorer having knocked in 17 for Rangers in the first half of the campaign, and finished as their top scorer too. The previous season they got 19 and also bagged goal of the season for good measure with an overhead kick against Aberdeen.
Jelavic has finally proved that they can do it in a big league so expect to see Slaven Bilic, who understands the pressure of playing for the Goodison club after four fallow years of their own on their payroll, using them a lot more often.
Who is the player who is going to disappoint the most?
Luka Modric. If things go downhill for Croatia, they will be most likely to blame. After being instrumental to Spurs' success for most of the season, the playmaker had a major slump in form towards the end of it, and the leading pundit Igor Stimac (the former Croatia and Derby County defender) says he's been "used up". Modric is one of the few guaranteed starters in the squad, but if they fail to produce, a disaster could be just around the corner …
What is the realistic aim for your team at the Euros and why?
Get past the group stage. It's impossible to predict our chances at this point, because the squad lacks depth and if some of the key players get injured we could be doomed. But if we stay clear of injuries, we can do it. The first game against Ireland will shape everything – a win would boost the squad's confidence and give them a great psychological advantage … We have a very good record against the Italians (two wins and one draw in competitive matches) and know how to play against them, and Spain could have qualified for the last eight by the time we meet them. If we manage to go through, just about anything is possible.

​The behavior of the New York Police Department officer who placed Staten Island man Eric Garner in a fatal chokehold is under the microscope once again, this time for allegedly crashing a car into and injuring another man.
In a lawsuit filed in Queens Supreme Court, Leonardo Aguirre claims that NYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo crashed a police vehicle into their car while speeding on June 20, the New York Daily News reported. As a result of the crash, Aguirre says they suffered from “severe and permanent” injuries to their neck, left shoulder and knees, the lawsuit claims.
An unnamed source within the police department told the Daily News, however, that Pantaleo was the one who was hit by another car. Additionally, the source added that Pantaleo was flashing their police vehicle's emergency lights and responding to a call at the time.
Cop who killed Eric Garner being sued for car crash that resulted in ‘severe' injuries http://t.co/kuvzvCEMEKpic.twitter.com/VPgjjdYPeF — N.O.T.O.R.I.O.U.S.™ (@MrMilitantNegro) March 30, 2015
According to the lawsuit, the accident on June 20 occurred less than a month before Pantaleo became involved in the attempted arrest of Eric Garner, a, African-American father of six who was approached by officers on Staten Island for selling loose cigarettes. On July 17, Pantaleo placed Garner in a chokehold as several other officers helped to subdue him. Garner died as a result of the chokehold.
A grand jury declined to indict Pantaleo on criminal charges, despite the fact that the entire incident was caught on tape, sparking massive protests against the NYPD across the city. The officer is still under review by the NYPD, which is looking into the Garner incident internally.

Notably, this isn't the first time Pantaleo has been targeted in a lawsuit. Two men won $30,000 after the city settled a 2012 lawsuit claiming that Pantaelo strip-searched two men and slapped their testicles.
Pantaleo was also among several officers named in separate 2012 lawsuits regarding the same incident, a drug raid during which two men said they were arrested because Pantaleo claimed they were in possession of marijuana. Both men also said they had their private parts and genitals searched.
The new Ferrari team principal Maurizio Arrivabene has called added their voice to the calls for F1 to take "radical" steps to make itself more spectacular and appealing, saying "We need an F1 that makes you stand up and take notice."
They also argued that F1 should reach out more to the communities in which it races, by hosting the Thursday drivers' press conference in a public forum in a city, rather than at the circuit.
Speaking yesterday Arrivabene echoed the words of Mercedes chairperson Niki Lauda in calling for a return to what made the turbo cars of the late 1980s so appealing, 1,000 hp engines, wide tyres and aggressive body styling,
"I share their view on the need to 'spectacularize' F1, "said the 57 year old former tobacco executive. "I think that the risks they highlighted about losing fans is already a reality.
"From 2017 onwards I would also like to see single seaters that win over the fans, are closer to the fans, aesthetically more beautiful but loud enough to make the hairs stand up on your neck like a heavy metal band.
"For this, however, I think we need a revolution, not an evolution. we need significant and radical change.
"I'm talking about more power faster cars, not necessarily with bigger fuel tanks but certainly run on a reduced cost in areas which aren't so interesting to the public."
Arrivabene clarified what they meant by taking the sport closer to the fans, did not mean seats closer to the circuit, but taking the sport out to meet the fans,
"For example with the FIA press conferences and the presentation of the teams and drivers on Thursday before the Grand Prix, holding that in a public place, not the race track.
"The city hosting the race could become the backdrop for the presentations, creating an event."
Arrivabene wants to open up and push on content that F1 provides, "content offered by the network, including video games themes. I would also like to see a survey on the web and through the users of television that would give us an idea of what people want."
Would you like to see a more "spectacular" F1, along the lines described here?
This is a cocktail that I stumbled upon creating sometime last summer. Having bought a fancy cocktail book for a friend's birthday and subsequently thumbing through it, I happened upon a recipe for a cocktail featuring gin, St Germain (an expensive but delicious elderflower liqueur), and grapefruit zest. We made it, and the cocktail was incredible. But ooh-wee, it is a potent assembly, and while the flavors scream for summer, the sippability of it combined with its predilection to warm up quickly on a hot summer day drove me to adjust, tweak, and tone down/amp up this cocktail to a more accessible format. I have found that in most recipes calling for St Germain, other types of elderflower syrups can be used. I have gotten a fancy Italian one at the food importer downtown Seattle, and then happened upon elderflower syrup at none other than Ikea. And it was only $4.99 instead of $35 plus the relevant local taxes. So for all purposes, I stick with elderflower syrup instead of elderflower liqueur. But this cocktail is also incredible with the St Germain, so by all means if that's your jam (also easier to find at any liquor store vs a trip to Ikea or a fancy food importer), go with the St Germain. Also, this cocktail is pretty easy to mix up and prep ahead of time and then just assemble as people ask for them.

After pranksters used Google mapmaker to draw an Android peeing on an Apple Logo and engage in other acts of spammy vandalism, Google has announced that it will temporarily shut down its online map editor while it rethinks its approval process.
The statement, which was first spotted by Search Engine Land, makes it clear that the service isn't going away forever, just shutting down while a new moderation system is under construction. "Given the current state of the [moderation] system, we have come to the conclusion that it is not fair to any of our users to let them continue to spend time editing. Every edit you make is essentially going to a backlog that is growing very fast," Google rep Pavithra Kanakarajan wrote. "We believe that it is more fair to only say that if we do not have the capacity to review edits at roughly the rate they come in, we have to take a pause. We have hence decided to temporarily disable editing across all countries starting Tuesday, May 12, 2015, till we have our moderation system back in action."
Google mapmaker is a browser-based online map editor that allows users to add to and edit Google Maps. There are tools for roads, railways, buildings, walking trails, bike paths, parks, lakes, and complex road geometry.
mapmaker doesn't get a lot of press, but it's an important tool for cartography. When Google launched the easy-to-use, crowdsourced map editor in 2008, it basically turned Google Maps into the Wikipedia of maps. The people who know an area best are the locals, the thinking goes, so Google created a tool to allow them to map their area. If a road or building is wrong, you can fix it; if something is missing completely, you can add it. The fact that Google Maps is crowdsourced gives it a leg up on Apple Maps. Google's other big competitor, Nokia, launched its own online map editor in response in 2012.
mapmaker isn't just about putting the newest Starbucks on the map for Google to sell ads against—it has also been used to map previously unmapped areas all over the world. The mapmaker community compiled public information to turn North Korea from a blank white sheet to a detailed map with the location of landmarks, roads, and even gulags. Not all governments in the world provide detailed, public-domain maps, and mapmaker has allowed the locals—mostly in developing countries—to fill in the blanks.
But how did prank images get onto the real Google Maps? Doesn't Google have some kind of approval process? It does, but that process relies on trust. mapmaker edits are done in a sandbox, which users can use to test and save map drafts. When a new user saves an edit, it goes into a queue for manual approval. Once approved, an edit shows up on the public Google Maps and can be seen by everyone.
After a certain amount of approvals, though, active users become "trusted" and their map edits get auto-approved and fast-tracked to Google Maps. In the official statement, Google says that the user who created the "most recent incident" was "a strong user in our community," indicating that the person most likely had auto-approval privileges and suddenly went rogue. One of the recent changes carved "Google review policy is crap" into the map, suggesting the user wanted to make some kind of statement.
mapmaker had more of a filter than Wikipedia, which has no approval process at all and relies on other users to revert malicious edits and ban users.
Google's apology says that Google has been "analyzing the problem and [has] made several changes" but that "fixing some of this is actually going to take longer than a few days."
While "hire lots of people to approve edits" is one solution, it's not a very "Googley" solution, and we bet the company is investigating a better automated approval system.
Saguaros and palo verde trees flourish in the Sonoran Desert northwest of Phoenix along the road to Hieroglyphic Mountains Recharge, one of the Central Arizona Project's groundwater banking sites. The shallow ponds, fed at one end by a burbling fountain, may look static, but the water is percolating down through the soil at a rate of about 3 feet a day, replenishing underground aquifers.
The 38-acre Hieroglyphic site is part of a statewide water-banking effort in Arizona that has stored around 9 million acre-feet of water underground as a hedge against population growth and possible cutbacks due to low Colorado River flows. It's an impressive stash, the result of initiatives that are looking increasingly appealing to neighboring California, now suffering from a severe drought that idled more than 400,000 acres of farm fields last year and has led to the imposition of statewide water restrictions.
California has earmarked $2.7 billion for water storage projects, including groundwater recharge.
Groundwater — a key water source in California, supplying about 40 percent of human-used water in wet years and 60 percent in dry years — is disappearing rapidly in major California agricultural regions, such as the San Joaquin Valley, as farmers steadily drain underground aquifers. This is threatening the state's huge agricultural sector and is causing the land to sink in some areas, harming critical infrastructure such as irrigation canals, roads, and bridges.
In the face of this grim reality, policy advocates and California officials are increasingly calling for initiatives such as large-scale groundwater banking, similar to Arizona's, as a critical element of California's water future. Last November, Californians approved a $7.54 billion water bond initiative, known as Proposition 1, that earmarks $2.7 billion for water storage projects, including improved groundwater storage and recharge.

But widespread groundwater banking in California still faces many legal, economic, and psychological obstacles. The barriers revolve around one core concern: Farmers and municipalities need reassurances that if they conserve water and store some of their allocation, they will be able to reclaim it later, either for their own use or for sale. Arizona has been able to overcome these obstacles with careful accounting that tallies how much water is stored underground and how much is withdrawn.
Around 22 basins in California — mostly urban — are already storing and banking groundwater. But dramatically expanding the practice to the other nearly 500 basins would help the state weather both long droughts and the climate change-induced melting of the state's snowpack in the Sierra Nevada mountains, according to Lester Snow, executive director of the California Water Foundation, a non-profit seeking to address the state's long-term water problems. Sierra Nevada snowpack has provided one-third to one-half of the state's water storage. Yet this year's snowpack was just five percent of the historic average, according to the state Department of Water Resources.
Losing the snowpack is a frightening shift for California. However, most climate models forecast that the state is likely to receive the same quantity of precipitation that it has historically; it will just arrive more erratically via bigger floods, accompanied by more frequent and more severe droughts. The climate shift requires water managers to change strategies and embrace techniques such as groundwater banking, experts say. “The goal is to capture higher flood flows when they occur and get them into groundwater basins so we have them for droughts,” said Snow.
Many people assume that water storage means more reservoirs. But in fact, most rivers in California are already dammed, said State Water Resources Control Board Chair Felicia Marcus. Yet underground aquifers contain at least three times the storage capacity of the state's 1,400 existing reservoirs, according to Ellen Hanak, a water economist and director of the Public Policy Institute of California's Water Policy Center. And underground storage is superior to surface storage because the water doesn't evaporate, doesn't have to be released preemptively to make room for floods, and is out-of-sight, out-of-mind, reducing pressure to allocate it.
One rural area has several groundwater banks because the sandy soil is perfect for conveying water underground.
It's also cheaper, typically less than half the cost of reservoir expansion.
To convey water underground, some infrastructure is needed, such as Arizona's percolation ponds. They can be built near existing reservoirs or alongside rivers in gravel beds originally constructed for stormwater flood control. Farmed floodplains can also be used after the growing season to sock away groundwater by removing constrictive riverside levees and replacing them with setback levees, which allow rivers to move into the floodplain when water is high. An experiment in the Sacramento Valley near Lodi enabled floodwaters to percolate in fallow farm fields and was deemed a success when a brief storm added 100 to 300 acre-feet of water to groundwater stores.
Irrigation runoff can also recharge groundwater, and some groundwater banking projects inject water underground, which is faster but more energy intensive.
The urban basins, such as Orange and Santa Clara counties, that are already banking water are maintaining relatively stable water levels. Cities tend to bank treated wastewater and stormwater runoff rather than excess fresh water from rivers. The success of water banking in some urban or suburban areas is typically the result of earlier water conflicts that led to courts deciding percentages of water rights for various parties and appointing “water masters” to oversee allocations and resolve future disputes. In these so-called “adjudicated basins,” groundwater rights are no longer based on property rights — which allow you to pump what you need from your land — but rather are limited to your percentage of the “safe yield,” which is the annual amount of water that would naturally percolate into the ground. These basins revisit the safe yield figure regularly and adjust it based on existing conditions.

One rural area, Kern County in the southern San Joaquin Valley, has several groundwater banks, in part because the sandy soil is perfect for conveying water underground through percolation ponds. Ted Page, a farmer and president of the Kern County Water Agency, said that they started saving water in their local water banks because they understood that stanching groundwater overdraft was necessary to continue farming in the area.
“Without it, a lot of us would be gone already,” they said. In 2010, a good rain year, people in Kern County collectively deposited more than 1 million acre-feet of water over just a few months into Kern County groundwater banks. During the drought years since 2011, people have reclaimed that water, pumping out 250,000 to 274,000 acre-feet a year, they said. They still have water, though: County banks retain natural groundwater and deposits from earlier years.
However, water rights in the Kern County water basin have not been settled in court. As a result, people — particularly those with no surface water rights — continue to pump groundwater from their property, and that pumping isn't regulated or even measured. Yet the water comes from the same aquifer that holds banked water.
That practice runs counter to the Public Policy Institute of California's vision for effective groundwater banking, which requires careful monitoring of deposits and withdrawals. Otherwise, it amounts to depositing money in a bank to which everyone has the key,” according to a 2012 report.
But Kern County will soon have to change its ways, along with other agricultural regions that don't manage their groundwater at all. That's because last fall California passed the Groundwater Management Act of 2014, becoming the last Western state to regulate groundwater. Arizona passed an equivalent law in 1980, laying the foundation for its groundwater-banking program. California's new law has come under criticism for its slow activation period, in which basins can delay full compliance for 25 years, but it will ultimately require communities that share groundwater basins to monitor their use and manage their shared resource sustainably.
Having a functional water market is an important incentive because users can profit from their conservation.
The measurement and management of both surface water and groundwater required by last year's law should help to reassure individuals that if they conserve and store water, they can reclaim it later. But further reform is still needed in the water market, the law, and people's attitudes, experts say.
Having a functional water market, in which people with excess water can sell it to those who need it, is an important incentive for getting people to store water because they can profit from their conservation. From the state's perspective, the market is an important tool to reallocate water to those who most need it now without harming anyone's long-term water rights.
But the current market is bureaucratic and opaque, meaning only large entities with the staff to manage the paperwork can participate. There is no online database tracking the buying and selling of water, a lack Snow deemed “crazy,” particularly in the state that spawned Silicon Valley's tech and information industry.
Another deterrent to encouraging people to conserve water has roots in California's “use it or lose it” provision, which says that if you don't use your full water right, the state can reallocate it to someone else. By law, water rights holders must put their water to “beneficial use” — activities such as agriculture and urban use. In recent years, California has expanded the definition to include conservation and water transfers. That means water saved cannot be construed as wasted or unnecessary and therefore cannot lead to loss of water rights, said Brian Gray, professor emeritus of water law at the University of California Hastings.
Yet despite these protections, many people remain reluctant to sell water. “It's a challenge of ego-system management,” said Marcus, “because people are more loss-averse than opportunity-motivated.”

On a practical level, there is another huge barrier to widespread groundwater recharge in California. Currently, people can petition the board to allow them to store water, but it's an arduous process. A bill now pending in the state assembly seeks to clarify approvals for underground storage.
The current drought is finally pushing Californians to get real about water reform, an opportunity that state policymakers have seized, exemplified by passage of last fall's Groundwater Management Act. Ultimately, the new policies could lead to more responsible — even sustainable — surface water and groundwater management.
“We've set up a framework that, when fully played out, will be revolutionary in its effectiveness,” said Marcus. “But the devil is in the details, and there's a long way to go.”
Appearing on Tuesday's New Day, liberal Daily Beast contributor and recurring CNN guest Dean Obeidallah went ballistic after a fellow guest and Donald Trump supporter recalled that Khizr Khan has a history of ties to the Clintons as the immigration expert was an employee of the law firm Hogan Lovells LLP, which not only has represented the Clinton Foundation but also worked on immigration cases involving the controversial EB-5 visa program.
After former South Carolina Lieutenant Governor Andre Bauer recalled Khan's connections to the Clintons, the two got into a heated debate as Obeidallah incredulously accused the Trump supporter of "smearing" Khan by merely introducing their links to the Clintons into the political conversation.
At 8:30 a.m. ET, Bauer brought up Khan's ties to the Clintons:
Mr. Khan worked for the Clintons. There is a direct connection. Nobody wants to engage in that because of the loss of a child, which is a terrible thing, but again, they are continuing to push this, too.  They are making it political, and there is a bigger tie to the Clintons. He's worked for them. He's worked for the EB-5 program, which is controversial.
The South Carolina Republican added:
Senator Grassley even pointed out there are inconsistencies and really not checks and balances in a program that's let too many folks in that are questionable, individuals that probably should never have been allowed in our country.
When it was Obeidallah's turn to speak, they fumed:
Well, I mean, this is a continued smear of the Khan family, sir, and you should be better than that, frankly. I'm going to be blunt with you. You should be. The Khan family, Mr. Khan was talking about their son. Donald Trump egged this on. Donald Trump, the thin-skinned man who is narcissistic-
After Bauer injected, "Well, tell me what I did to smear him. What did I say that smeared him?" the Daily Beast contributor shot back: "You just went after their character."
The two then went back and forth for the next minute with Obeidallah insisting that recalling Khan's ties to the Clintons amounted to "smearing" their "character."
Below is a transcript of the relevant portion of the Tuesday, August 2, New Day on CNN:
My, it feels a long time ago since June 9th.
My first few days in Parliament have been hectic, exhilarating and at times utterly magical. The first time you sit on the Green Benches and you pinch yourself to check you're not dreaming. Accidentally on purpose getting lost in the warren of passages and have police officers refer to you as ma'am (being in my early 30s I find this very odd indeed). Your first engagement as the MP in the constituency and random people stopping you with huge smiles to say how happy they are that ‘we did it!'. Having a quick nap and waking up to find the Leader who got us there has decided to step down. Thud.
Like many of you, the changing of this particular guard was not something I remotely expected, nor indeed desired.
I was hoping for a period of stability. Not least for me and my fellow new MPs to have time to settle in and tackle such mundane tasks as: work out how the internet works (very well actually), where the ladies' loos are (clearly an afterthought in some areas) and where all the post has gone (in the hidden Post Office off Central Lobby, 3 bags worth).
I have a very sage member in my constituency who has a mantra: “the main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing”.
This is the approach that got OxWAb to the narrow win we achieved. It is what will drive us to hold on to it.
So, yes you guessed it, with all the turmoil and the change, the ‘main thing' for me right now is keeping my promises to the voters of Oxford West and Abingdon.
With a majority of 816 and a snap election on the cards at any time, it is not a task to be sniffed at.
Now, who leads us as Party is undoubtedly important to this ‘main thing', I utterly agree. So I will not be making up my mind about it just yet. It is too important to make any rash decision about and I see many positives in all candidates who have and may yet declare.
However, I do know one thing.
I am clear there must be a contest and that the membership should in the end have the final say.
In order to stand, an MP needs 10% of the Parliamentary Party to do so. This means 1.2 MPs, which needs to be rounded up to 2 lest it becomes even more painful than it already is. So, if any of my fellow MPs need me to ensure a race is had, I will be willing to nominate them. However, only once I have heard more arguments will I decide who I back, and, if it is of interest, I will let you know when I decide and why.
But for now, my plan is to keep the main thing the main thing.
I intend to use every lever at my disposal to make the case for why Brexit is damaging to our economy and our values, why more education funding is critical to ensure every child gets the best start in life, and why we need the southern slips at the A34 Lodge Hill Junction in Abingdon among other local issues.
For the voters of Oxford West and Abingdon, who put their faith in me a mere two weeks ago, these are the main things right now. So, I do hope you will forgive me in taking some time to consider everything else.
* Layla Moran is the Liberal Democrat MP for Oxford West and Abingdon
One of the key aims of the Klick It Out campaign is to raise awareness about the impact of football-related social media discrimination.
As part of a series running throughout our campaign, we've talked to fans, players and broadcasters, most of whom are united in both their love of football and their experience of discriminatory abuse on social media.
Bobby Gardiner, a journalist for the Fans For Diversity campaign, discusses the treatment of Raheem Sterling in the English press following the Three Lions's exit from the 2016 European Championships.
Disclaimer: The articles produced by the Fans For Diversity journalists are based on the writer's opinion and do not reflect those of Kick It Out or the Football Supporters' Federation.
Raheem Sterling is not a scapegoat.
If they were, recent treatment would feel new, like the unusual animosity towards Harry Kane after a lacklustre tournament. But this animosity towards Sterling, this stigmatising of arguably the brightest prospect in our domestic game, is not an example of finger pointing for the sake of it.
If it were, the treatment would not be so personal. David Beckham and Phil Neville have borne the frustrations of a nation on their backs before, but they were never called an ‘idiot'. Their commitment to the sport was never questioned, they were never described as ‘greedy', and, were it out at the time, it is very unlikely that their Snapchat stories would have been treated as front page news.
No, this is not an example of a simple media scapegoat. This is an agenda masquerading as one.
‘From troubled youth to £100k a week – the life of footie idiot Raheem Sterling' reads the Sun's headline, carelessly playing into racist stereotypes; ones that become increasingly obvious in comparison to the similar narratives of white players.
When Jamie Vardy made a similar journey, it was described by the same paper as a “rags-to-riches” story in a piece that conveniently ignored the tales of house arrest and a recent act of racism. Wayne Rooney was the worst player on the pitch against Iceland, and yet their similarly ‘obscene' salary seems to have been ignored in the angry coverage that followed.
Angry coverage that, truth be told, has focused predominantly on the non-white members of the England camp. After papers destroyed Sterling for flamboyantly showing off their house on Snapchat, it turned out that they had bought the house for their mother.
Along with Sterling, Dele Alli and Chris Smalling were lambasted, for having a girlfriend and going on holiday respectively. Think back to the Memphis Depay debacle earlier this year and tell me if you can remember any Caucasian player enduring similar treatment. It's hard, isn't it?
The elephant in the room is that there is widespread racism in the semantics of football coverage. Yaya Toure is one of the most technically gifted players to ever grace the Premier League, and yet they will rarely be described as more than a “beast.” Their compatriot and teammate, Wilfried Bony, is only described in physical terms by commentators who seem to miss their ‘flip flaps' and ‘elasticos'.
‘Sterling is pilloried because privileged older generations are uncomfortable at the sight of young, working-class men earning large sums of money,' wrote Jonathan Liew, insightfully, in the Telegraph last year, and yet this is observation is something of a cop-out.
The treatment of Sterling is not indicative of a uniform distrust of the working-class – we are extremely comfortable with the asupervisorstioned ‘rags-to-riches' narrative, it is one of our favourites – but of a selective distrust, one that manifests itself exclusively in relation to non-white players.
For Sterling should have listened to us, you see. They should have accepted less than they were worth in wages at Liverpool, and they should have sucked their concerns at being played out of position up and carried on. They should listen to our justified boos around the country, but turn a blind eye when no one warns John Stones of the same lessons while they are constantly linked with Chelsea and Manchester City.
In November, when they faced a continuation of a bombardment of racist abuse on Instagram after posting a picture of their daughter, they should have just got on with things instead of making a fuss.
The recently launched #KlickItOut campaign is an attempt to tackle the very sort of racism on social media that Sterling, and the majority of non-white or non-male people in football, have faced. This is not something that we can brush away, not something that we should pretend doesn't exist, and definitely not something that we should play into in the way mainstream outlets are.
That I write here, on this site, now, is indicative of the fact that I am not crying wolf – discrimination still exists in football, and we are perpetuating it with every day that we allow ourselves to be bystanders. If there has been one thing I've learned from my time with Kick It Out, it's how much more there is to be done.
As for Raheem Sterling, I hope they make every careless writer with a vendetta swallow their words. I hope they score against every team whose idiotic supporters boo him. I hope they buy a dozen more houses, and a car decorated in pure, uncut diamonds, and then posts MTV Cribs-style videos ostentatiously showing us their earnings.
But it shouldn't have to be like this. They shouldn't have to ironically hashtag #HatedOne on Instagram to make light of the awkward fact that they are unjustifiably crucified.
Eventually it won't be, but, at only 21, it may be already too late for us to make it up to Raheem Sterling.
“ So many chems, such varieties! Whenever I take Mentats, I can feel my entire chassis breeeeeathe like a big spherical lung.*coughs* ” Doctor Mobius
Chems (a truncation of "chemical") is both a pre- and post-War slang term for "drug". A chem is any chemical, medicine, etc. that is used to cause changes in a person's behavior or biological systems.
Contents show]
Background Edit
Chems were a pre-War term used to describe narcotic drugs and substances that caused numerous temporary side-effects, both positive and negative. Pre-War narcotics included Mentats, a pre-War "party-drug," originally developed by Med-Tek for medical purposes.[1] Buffout, a "sports-enhancement" drug popularized by athletes,[2] Psycho, a combat-enhancement drug developed per orders of General Chase,[3] and Med-X, a painkiller found in many pre-War hospitals. A large drug-trade existed within pre-War society. Skylanes Air Flight 1981 was one of several illegal smuggling operations that utilized jet airliners to smuggle goods across the country.[4]
Little is known about how chems entered the markets of post-nuclear America, but it is commonly accepted by most wastelanders that the Khans invented the chem trade. Their specialties were in creating Jet and Psycho. However, that the Great Khans did not know how to produce chemicals before the Followers of the Apocalypse taught them between 2278 and 2281.
Types of chems Edit
Various chems exist in the wasteland, some more beneficial than others. Each chem has an individual profile, allowing users to "stack" chems to provide a larger bonus than either does individually. Chems may have 4 or 5 simultaneous effects, usually, with some kind of balance—it might lower one stat while raising another. Abusing chems results in addiction. Addiction to a chem will cause withdrawal symptoms when the chem wears off, resulting in lowered stats unless the user continues to take the drug, or seeks a cure or treatments.
Chems are divided into two groups: addictive, and non-addictive.
Addictive chems Edit
Non-addictive chems Edit
Chems can be found lying about individually or inside containers. They can also be purchased from wasteland vendors. While nearly every vendor will have at least a few stimpaks for sale, some chems will need to be purchased from one of the vendors specializing in chems.
Resisting addiction Edit
There are several ways to resist addiction:
Don't take chems. It is never necessary to take chems, so prevent addiction by never taking them at all. Select the Chem Resistant perk or trait. This perk confers a 50% resistance to the addictive effect of individual chems. Chems which normally have a 10% addiction rate will be reduced to a 5% rate. If the trait is taken, however, chems will only last half as long. Take a chem antidote. Only the dangerous jet has an antidote, though. Fixer is also viable, although only temporary. Fallout: New Vegas has the Logan's Loophole trait which prevents addiction entirely at the cost of limiting the Courier to level 30. Certain perks in Fallout: New Vegas such as Chem Resistant, Brainless and Old World Gourmet reduce addiction chance.
Curing an addiction Edit
Once addicted to a chem, the user has to either continue taking the chem or suffer withdrawal effects specific to the addiction. It is eventually desirable (if not necessary) to cure the addiction. To cure an addiction, the individual has several choices:
Wait it out. Quitting cold turkey will eventually purge the addict's system of the chem. However, Jet addiction cannot be shaken this way, nor can tobacco. Seek out a wasteland doctor and pay them a fee to alleviate the addiction. Use My First Laboratory, after purchasing it for either a Megaton home or Tenpenny Tower suite. Likewise, a trip to the autodoc in The Sink will cure addiction. Addictol cures all addictions, but is scarce across the Commonwealth. It can be purchased from traders/doctors occasionally at a high cost.
Behind the scenes Edit
In the release of Fallout 3 in Australia, the game was banned for including references to real drugs. A report was released by the OFLC on why it banned the game. The following is a part of a report that was released:
"The game contains the option to take a variety of "chems" using a device which is connected to the character's arm. Upon selection of the device, a menu selection screen is displayed. Upon this screen is a list of "chems" that the player can take, by means of selection. These "chems" have positive effects and some negative effects (lowering of Intelligence, or the character may become addicted to the "chem"). The positive effects include an increase in Strength, stamina, resistance to damage, Agility and hit points.
Corresponding with the list of various "chems" are the small visual representation of the drugs, these include syringes, tablets, pill bottles, a crack-type pipe and blister packs. In the Board's view, these realistic visual representations of drugs and their delivery method bring the "science-fiction" drugs in line with "real-world" drugs."
One of the reasons for the ban was that the controlled drug, morphine, was one of the chems that would have been available in-game. As a result of the ban, Bethesda decided to have it renamed to Med-X. Evidence of this last minute change is the fact Med-X's editor ID is "Morphine" and Med-X addiction's editor ID is "WithdrawalMorphine".
When Ms. Kyser needed a routine gynecological exam, they called a handful of local doctors, all of whom were charging $200 or more. “There's no way we could pay that,” Ms. Kyser said. “I had to find another way.”
Having seen an ad for PriceDoc.com, a new Web site that lists doctors throughout the country who are willing to post their prices and negotiate with patients, they decided to try it. Ms. Kyser found a nearby clinic where doctors charged only $75 for the exam.
“I was a little nervous at first because the price was so cheap, but when I got there, it was wonderful,” Ms. Kyser said. “Everyone was so professional and helpful.”
The crucial part of shopping wisely for health care (or anything else for that matter) is comparing prices the way Ms. Kyser did.
But that is also where problems arise. Medical pricing is a quagmire, oozing with jargon and current procedural terminology codes. Just look, if you dare, at your latest “explanation of benefits” from your insurer.
What's more, rarely is there one standard price for a medical treatment. Prices vary based on geography and type of provider — whether hospital, stand-alone clinic or any alternative.
Then, doctors, hospitals and other providers may negotiate different rates with different insurers. It is not unusual for a provider to have 10 or more different prices for the same procedure, depending on who is paying. Providers often charge a completely different rate for people paying on their own, which is almost always much more expensive than the discounted rate that insurers pay.

“It's a challenge for consumers to sift through these different price structures,” said Ha T. Tu, senior health researcher at the Center for Studying Health System Change. And there is no one place to go for good information, they added.
Despite the challenges, here are several steps consumers can take to make health care shopping a bit more manageable:
CHECK WITH YOUR INSURER Many insurance companies have begun posting provider prices on their Web sites so enrollees can access cost information. These tools allow you to compare prices among network doctors (not all network doctors are paid the same) and check on the price of diagnostic tests and other treatments.
“This is especially helpful if you're in a high-deductible plan,” said Ms. Tu, “because you can see how much you'll pay out of pocket.”

USE THE INTERNET A few Web companies have tried to fill the price information gap online, all with varying approaches.
On PriceDoc.com, the site Ms. Kyser used, you plug in your ZIP code to find a list of providers in your area who have posted their prices. You can also plug in the price you're willing to pay. Providers will then respond if they are willing to accept that price.
HealthcareBlueBook.com compiles prices paid for specific treatments and procedures in ZIP codes throughout the country, then lists what the site determines is a range of fair prices. Consumers can then use these ranges as a jumping-off point for negotiating with their providers, said Dr. Jeffrey Rice, the chief executive of the concern.
Dr. Rice tells the story of a woman in northern Ohio who had been quoted a price at a local hospital of $2,500 for an M.R.I. of their knee. When they looked up the test on the site, they found the fair price in that area was more like $500.
They went back to the hospital where they had been quoted the high price and started asking questions. The clerk told them it would be much less expensive if they went to the clinic down the street instead of the hospital. The woman followed that advice and paid $300 for their M.R.I.
Another Web site, OutOfPocket.com, combines price information that users send in to determine a going rate for specific health care costs throughout the country.

None of these sites are comprehensive, although all of them are easy to use and are expanding their listings. It's worth taking a look to see if you can glean any useful information from them.
BROWSE STATE DATA If you're checking out hospitals, you will want to see what information your state government offers. At least 33 states mandate that hospitals make their prices public, Ms. Tu says.
But there are caveats. Often, only the most expensive, nondiscounted prices are listed.
Moreover, on most sites, costs are not bundled, so you may find the price of a general surgery, for example, but it would not include the surgeon's or anesthesiologist's fees.
Some states offer more information than others, points out Ms. Tu. Minnesota, for example, uses average prices for some procedures, and New Hampshire and Maine have some bundled prices. To see what information, if any, is available in your state, you can use the links on healthcarebluebook.com.
PICK UP THE PHONE “The most important thing to do if you're looking for price information is call your doctor,” said Jonathan Weiner, professor of health policy and management at Johns Hopkins University.
“This is still an awkward discussion for most doctors,” Professor Weiner said. “But if you sit down and talk about money, it almost always leads to discounts, particularly for self-paid people.”
If your doctor balks at having this conversation, ask to speak to the office worker in charge of billing, who will know the prices your doctor charges and can at least estimate what you will be paying. Then, when you do collect price information, you can return to that person to negotiate a better price.
The Colorado Springs Gazette this week came out with an editorial strongly opposing Arizona-style immigration reform.
Republicans may be off to a horrible start. At a meeting of the Colorado Republican Study Committee in Denver on Monday, Sen.-elect Kent Lambert, R-Colorado Springs, announced their plan to kick off the session in January with an immigration law like Arizona's SB1070. It's a proposal for big-government control. It would burden taxpayers while stifling production and trade. It is a bad idea on too many counts to enumerate.
Contrary to the Gazette's report, Lambert actually announced their plans to The Colorado Independent a week ago.
The Gazette continued:
Our economy needs help. That means we need more trade and production of goods, services and commodities — not less. We cannot fix the economy by impeding the creation of wealth. We do not magically wind up with more production of goods, services and commodities by policing the residential status of professionals and workers with brown skin and broken English who help provide goods, services, commodities and trade. We do not enable prosperity by paying to incarcerate workers, at huge taxpayer expense, for the noncriminal infraction of lacking permission to reside here. We do not facilitate production and trade by placing the mothers and fathers of children in jail because of a suspected civil dispute with the federal government. Sure, immigration is a mess. But the solution will be increased quotas, enhanced border control and other reasonable federal reforms that favor prosperity and order.
When reached by telephone today, Lambert laughed when asked what they thought of the editorial.
They pointed to what they called the “20 pages of comments” the editorial has inspired, and noted that the vast majority were in agreement with them and not with the newspaper's editorial. “I'll let the readers who commented speak for themselves,” they said. “The people overwhelming disagree with the Gazette.”
Contrary to the editorial, which argued that an Arizona-type bill would be disastrous for the state's economy, Lambert said reform is needed so that those businesses who refuse to hire undocumented workers have a level playing field.
“I also want to reduce taxes and help create a better business climate in Colorado,” Lambert said. “I don't think immigration enforcement is contrary to that.”
The editorial concludes:
The Arizona law is a legislated economic boondoggle. A study by Arizona-based Elliott D. Pollack & Co. found that Arizona has lost $141 million just from the meetings and conventions that went elsewhere, so far, to protest SB1070. During the next two to three years, canceled conventions may cost the state $253 million in economic output and will negatively affect 2,800 jobs. The report estimates the law will cost Arizona $86 million in lost wages over the next two to three years. That will put more workers on state aid, adding to the cost of the law. It is legislated poverty, all about creating expense while reducing production, consumption and trade. The tangible losses pertaining to meetings and conventions don't include the loss of leisure tourists, the costs of soured trade relations and the costs of enforcing the new law. Don't be surprised if Arizonans soon tire of paying for poverty politics and demand a repeal of SB1070. It's even worse to propose this law in Colorado. We aren't overwhelmed with immigration problems, and the voters have spoken. If immigration concerns were paramount, we would have elected Tancredo as governor. Reports from PBS and other left-leaning media organizations show credible direct links between the passage of SB1070 and private prison corporations. Benson, Ariz., City Manager Glenn Nichols told PBS that two men tried to sell them on hosting a private prison for illegal immigrants before SB1070 became news. How would they fill it? By getting the Legislature to pass a tough new immigration law. Activist media organizations are hard to trust, but the tie-in to private prisons makes sense. If true, the Arizona immigration law is a government redistribution scheme designed to take money from ordinary taxpayers and channel it to powerful special interests that fund politicians. Arizona's immigration mistake is costly and senseless. It's a ticket to poverty, at a time when politicians should obsess about allowing prosperity. It's the least conservative idea a Republican could pitch.
Lambert's final thoughts?
“I am undaunted,” they said.

A map of the world showing just how much Coca-Cola dominates the drinks industry has gone viral - all thanks to a bunch of proud Scots.
That's because Scotland is singled out as the only country in the world where the most popular drink is NOT made by the Coca-Cola company.
We're sure you can guess which soft drink tops the charts here in Scotland instead, but just in case …
Barr's Irn Bru shared the map, along with a single sassy emoji - and fans across the country are loving it.
The post has 21k likes and counting, with many of you sharing in a bid to big up the Bru.
Some, however, ask how accurate the map is - considering that Coca-Cola famously cannot be bought or sold (at least officially) in Cuba and North Korea, both under long-term US trade embargoes.
Still, if it allows us to be proud of our other national drink here in Scotland, we'll take Irn Bru's moment of Twitter glory …
After several hints that gut microbes may be key players in the obesity epidemic, a new study provides a mechanistic explanation of how the intestinal inhabitants directly induce hunger, insulin resistance, and ultimately obesity in rodents.
After mice and rats were fed a high-fat diet, their gut microbes produced more acetate, a short-chain fatty acid made during bacterial fermentation. That acetate spread throughout the rodents' bodies and into their brains where it activated the parasympathetic nervous system. This system, largely involving the vagus nerve, controls the body's unconscious actions, such as digestion, excretion, and sexual arousal. By activating the parasympathetic nervous system, the microbe-made acetate spurred the rodents to produce more insulin, a hormone made by pancreatic β-cells that promotes calorie storage, as well as ghrelin, a hormone involved in hunger. The result was that rodents started eating more, developed insulin resistance—a precursor to diabetes—and became obese, the researchers report in Nature.
“This generates a positive feedback loop,” the authors conclude—which makes sense for foraging animals, they add. If a foraging animal stumbles upon a calorie-dense food in the wild, it would be advantageous if their gut signaled their brain to keep eating and store some energy, stocking up to survive leaner times. “However, in the setting of chronic exposure to calorically dense, abundant food, this gut microbiota–brain–β-cell axis promotes obesity and its related sequelae of hyperlipidaemia [high levels of lipids in the blood], fatty liver disease and insulin resistance,” the authors write.
Further, the findings “highlight a previously unknown role for the gut,” and offer “a hint as to how the microbiota might provoke obesity,” according to diabetes researchers Mirko Trajkovski and Claes Wollheim of the University of Geneva, who were not involved with the study. If studies in humans support the findings, they could point to new obesity treatments focused on numbing the vagus nerve to acetate signals or thwarting the acetate-making microbes in the gut, such as with fecal transplants or bacterial transfers, the two researchers suggest.
For the study, led by Gerald Shulman at Yale University, researchers followed up on earlier reports that changes in short-chain fatty acids in the blood are linked to obesity, over-eating, and metabolic problems. They quickly homed in on one of those fatty acids, acetate, which they found increased in rats fed high-fat diets. When the researchers scraped out the rats' gut bacteria or gave them antibiotics, that boost in acetate disappeared, suggesting that the gut microbes were making the acid.
When the researchers infused acetate into the stomachs or brains of rats on a normal diet, the fatty acid spurred the animals to produce more insulin. This result vanished when the researchers snipped the rats' vagus nerves or used drugs to block the parasympathetic nervous system.
In follow-up experiments, the rats on acetate ate more—doubling their daily caloric intake—gained weight, had increased levels of ghrelin in their blood, and became insulin resistant.
In a final set of experiments, the researchers looked at germ-free mice and ex-germ-free mice that had gone through a fecal transplant from normal mice. The germ-free mice had negligible amounts of acetate compared to the re-germed mice. The researchers then took the ex-germ-free mice and fed them either a normal chow or a high-fat chow. The mice feasting on fat had double the amount of acetate than the normal chow-fed mice, plus elevated levels of ghrelin.
Together, Trajkovski and Wollheim conclude, “these data suggest a mechanistic link between the onset of obesity and the gut microbiota.”

Food-loving Surtis can never lag behind in savouring seasonal treats. With ponk season in full swing, we talk about the tender grain and creative ways to relish it.‘Gujaratis' and ‘food' are inseparable from each other and winter is that one season when we have ample seasonal delicacies to binge on. They are not only finger-licking good, but also help us stay warm and healthy. One such food item is ponk.You aren't a Surti if you haven't had ponk with limbu-mari ni sev, lasan ni sev, saadi sev and sakariya dana. Lasan ni chutney and chaas are other delightful accompainments. “Whenever I come to Surat during winters, I make sure I visit the ponk stalls at Ghod Dod Road. I am a huge ponk vada fan and piping hot ponk vadas with chai are just perfect for an early morning breakfast or an evening snack with friends,” says actor Gaurav Paswala.“Ponk is vani nu jowar or jowar that is not allowed to grow fully, and as a result, remains soft. It is roasted under smouldering ashes, husked and eaten raw and fresh,” says food blogger Rushina Munshaw Ghildiyal. Apart from having ponk in its raw form and making the usual ponk items like ponk patties and ponk vada, you can do a lot more with this mildly sweet lentil-like bean.It can not only be added in salads, pulao, and samosas but you can also make a whole variety of yummy items from ponk like ponk bhel, ponk no chino, ponk ni kheer etc. Homemaker and food enthusiast Swati Sheth, who runs a small catering service from home, says, “I love cooking and experimenting with food and winter is when I get a lot of new, interesting ingredients to play with. Ponk is one of my favourites. I specially order ponk in large quantities so that I can get it at a discounted price. I store it in those special vegetable net bags and stock it in the freezer to enjoy it for a couple of months.”

Mockingbird: S.H.I.E.L.D. 50th Anniversary Special Credit: Marvel Comics
Bobbi Morse is getting the solo spotlight in 2016 with a new Mockingbird ongoing series in 2016. Announced at the Diamond Retailer Summit in Baltimore, it is written by novelist Chelsea Cain. No details on an artist or story were available for the announcement.
There has been renewed popularity for the Mockingbird character due to being featured in the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. television series, and she's also appearing in the upcoming Amazing Spider-Man relaunch as one of Peter Parker's associates.
Cain previously wrote Mockingbird in a S.H.I.E.L.D. 50th Anniversary one-shot, which can now be seen as something of a preview of how they intend to handle Bobbi Morse.
"Bobbi is funny. Them rapport with Hawkeye (and Hunter on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. for that matter) has always been at the core of their chemistry," said Cain in an interview for that earlier book. "She knows their way around a one-liner. So it was important to me to show them being clever, witty, and thinking on their feet - while being menaced and kicking ass."
This will be Mockingbird's first ongoing solo series, though they did co-headline Hawkeye and Mockingbird in 2010. Cain previously said that part of what drew them to the character was their relative blank slate.
"Honestly, the cool thing about writing Mockingbird is that they have never had their own story before. They have only appeared in other people's books. So we have no idea who they are, really. We might have gotten the odd interior narration, but nothing that really informs any deep character development."
Mockingbird has also been the subject of a potential TV spin-off for ABC, with reports from August stating that the show may make it to air as early as April 2016. Mockingbird will also serve as one of Peter Parker's bodyguards in the relaunched Amazing Spider-Man.
No artist or specific release date has been announced for Mockingbird.
Rolf Harris trial: Entertainer accused of lying to jury after new evidence emerges
Updated
Australian entertainer Rolf Harris has been accused of deliberately lying to the jury after the emergence of new evidence at their trial in London on charges of indecent assault.
The jury was played a video on Monday, which had surfaced since the trial began, of Harris taking part as a team captain in a celebrity show, Star Games, in Cambridge in 1978.
One of the complainants in the case alleges Harris assaulted them in the city in the 1970s at a celebrity event, but the defendant previously told the court they first visited Cambridge only about four years ago.
Harris denies indecently assaulting four girls in the UK between 1968 and 1986.
Prosecutor Sasha Wass QC said the footage proved Harris was lying when they said they had not been to Cambridge until recently.
"That was a deliberate lie, wasn't it?" Ms Wass asked the artist and singer.
Harris replied: "No ... a lapse of memory."
The 84-year-old said they had no memory of the event until they saw the video and did not know they were in Cambridge at the time.
Ms Wass appeared incredulous, asking: "You didn't know where you were?"
Analysis: Barbara Miller at the trial This goes to the prosecution's case that Harris is tailoring their defence depending on what evidence they know the prosecution has.
So the prosecution makes the case that where there is photographic evidence, for example, or documentary evidence of Harris at the scene of an alleged assault, they say: 'I must've been there but I don't remember it'. Or where in this case with Cambridge, where that evidence did not exist until this point, they say: 'I simply wasn't there at all'.
So what we are seeing the prosecution doing now is going through all the other alleged assaults from the complainants in this case, as well as the bad-character witnesses, and saying: 'Oh really, is that a lie as well?'
Harris appeared quite irritated and at one point was cautioned by the judge, who told them it was not a verbal joust they were engaged in with the prosecutor and they should not ask them questions.
"I don't think any of us [in the show] did," Harris replied. "We all went on a bus to get there. We were deposited on the green. I was in Cambridge but I didn't know it was Cambridge."
But Ms Wass told Harris there was no way they could have forgotten participating in Star Games.
"You deliberately tried to mislead the jury," the prosecutor said.
The alleged victim initially said they had been groped by Harris at what they thought was a celebrity version of It's A Knockout in Cambridge in about 1975 when they were 13 or 14. They turned 16 in early 1978.
During their evidence in mid-May the woman told the court: "The incident is bright red in my mind and everything else is grey."
They said Harris groped them after they had been drawn to a crowd which was watching Harris on all fours barking at a dog.
Harris on Monday was asked whether they now accepted that Star Games was filmed at Cambridge.
"It was a suburb of Cambridge," they said.
Harris cautioned over 'verbal joust'
Ms Wass asked Harris whether they often did not know where they were when they worked.
Harris appeared irritated and replied that the prosecution did not understand show business. They said they would sign contracts assuming that their agent had organised everything.
Harris was later cautioned for engaging in what the judge called a verbal joust with the prosecutor.
"That's enough," Justice Nigel Sweeney warned Harris, adding they were not to ask questions of Ms Wass but rather answer them, "It's not a verbal joust."
Earlier in the trial the court heard police could turn up no evidence of Harris ever having been at such an event in Cambridge.
The police were doing their research with the BBC, but the video that was shown to the court came from Thames Television.
The prosecution says the celebrity event shown in the video is similar to the one the female complainant described, but has a different name.
Bindi Nicholls denies lying for father
Meanwhile, Harris's daughter, Bindi Nicholls, has denied lying about a childhood friend's relationship with their famous father to help them in the trial.
Ms Nicholls cried in court when speaking about their former best friend who claims Harris abused them from the age of 13.
Ms Nicholls backed their father's claim that the pair had a consensual "affair" which started after the family friend turned 18.
Ms Wass asked Ms Nicholls if they were telling the truth or helping them father.
"This isn't about helping my father; it's about me telling the truth," the 50-year-old replied.
The alleged victim claims Harris first indecently assaulted them when they joined the family on an overseas trip in 1978.
But Ms Nicholls said the two teenagers were inseparable and they never saw any inappropriate contact.
This isn't about helping my father; it's about me telling the truth Bindi Nicholls
They broke down when recalling how "devastated" they were when their family shifted to Bray, west of London, in 1980.
The exact timing of the move away from their friend in south London is in dispute.
Ms Wass asked Ms Nicholls why they had initially told police the family relocated "straight after" their mid-year exams, but then told the court it was December.
The prosecutor said Harris argued the later date because it was closer to the complainant's 16th birthday and meant there was less time for any underage assaults at Bray.
"I'm suggesting you and your father have colluded to give the same evidence," Ms Wass said.
But the entertainer's daughter insisted: "No, we hardly talk, my dad and I. It's not really something we sit down and talk about."
Oral sex claim 'laughable', Bindi says
Ms Nicholls said it was "ridiculous" and "laughable" for their childhood friend to claim Harris performed oral sex on them when they were 15 with Bindi asleep in the next bed.
Ms Wass also grilled Ms Nicholls on why they had had a solicitor - paid for by Harris - present when interviewed by police.
"You've seen the films, everyone always has a solicitor don't they?" Ms Nicholls said.
Ms Wass told their suspects usually did, but not witnesses.
The prosecutor went on to suggest Ms Nicholls was financially dependent on Harris. They admitted they provided a "monthly income".
Ms Wass read a mid-2012 email from Ms Nicholls to their father in which they asked if they were the sole inheritor of their $19.9 million estate.
They said if that was true they needed to help run the company.
Bindi and complainant discussed affair in the 1990s, court hears
Earlier, the court heard Ms Nicholls first discussed their friend's sexual relationship with Harris in the mid-1990s.
The pair had been talking about Ms Nicholls's suspicion that their father was having an affair with a "spiritual healer".
The complainant, then in their early 30s, called the woman a "cow" and asked what Harris saw in her, Ms Nicholls said.
"It felt like they were in love with my dad."
Harris's daughter asked their friend if they had been seeing their father, to which they reportedly replied: "It's been going on since I was 18 or 19."
The alleged victim insists they told Ms Nicholls their father had abused them since the age of 13.
"No, they never said that," Ms Nicholls said.
The 50-year-old told the court they later rang their dad and accused them of having an affair with their friend.
They admitted telling police that when they heard about the affair they were so distraught they were "bashing their head against the wall" and "wanted to stab myself with forks". Later they were "suicidal".
Ms Nicholls has refused to release their therapy notes which Ms Wass argued could reveal whether the alleged victim told their friend they had been abused by Harris or rather had an affair.
Harris's daughter said the counselling notes were "private".
They did reveal, however, that they were frightened their parents "might die in the middle of this court case".
That prompted Ms Wass to ask if they ever thought about their former friend.
Ms Nicholls insisted: "I love them very much."

FORMER Port Adelaide and Essendon forward Che Cockatoo-Collins is shattered after their oldest son quit the game because of a case of racial vilification.
It comes as the game is celebrating its Indigenous Round.
Cockatoo-Collins, who played 85 games with Essendon and 75 with Port from 1994-2003, said the game has missed out on a potential top-10 draft pick after under-14 player Sachem turned their back on the game.
It has led Cockatoo-Collins to seek out legal advice, and the family is now considering making a complaint to the Australian Human Rights Commission as well as the Anti-Discrimination Commission Queensland.
Sachem was racially abused by a boundary umpire in a club game, was allegedly called “nigger'' by the umpire and targeted with remarks from the official suggesting they should watch their back.
Cockatoo-Collins' son has since been targeted via social media.
They played out the year, was named the best afield in last year's grand final but then handed in theirs jumper.
A distressed Cockatoo-Collins has since sought the counsel of fellow Essendon player and human rights activist Michael Long and the AFL's Jason Mifsud to get some closure to the matter.
Former Fitzroy player Michael Conlan, who is now the from AFL Queensland chief executive, said the league was strong on the issue of racism.
“AFL Queensland took the issue very seriously and an independent investigation resulted in a number of actions against the club and those involved,'' Conlan said.
“In addition, an education program was conducted to raise awareness of racial vilification and discrimination issues and to emphasise the expectations of all club personnel.
“There is no tolerance for vilification of any kind in Australian football and the impact in this case underlines the deep hurt that it can cause.''
But Cockatoo-Collins felt the issue had essentially been brushed aside and said they their family had suffered deeply from the incident, which happened last year.
The reason it has come to a head now is that they witnessed the same umpire officiating this month.
The Cockatoo-Collins family feels it was not consulted in the matter and was under the impression the umpire had been banned for two years, rather than two weeks.
If Cockatoo-Collins had their way, the umpire would be banned for life.
Collins spoke to The Sunday Mail and was emotional about the fall of events.
“We have three sons,'' Cockatoo-Collins said.
“Stirling is eight and Preston 10 and they look up to their big brother.
“I was angry, yelling and crying.
“As parents we still feel guilty we were not there to protect our son.''
Cockatoo-Collins and their wife have busy weekends shipping their sons around to various sporting engagements and were not at the game.
Their main reason for pursuing this matter is not about the incident itself, but about how it was handled and how football can rid itself of racism.
“It sends mixed signals and confuses those parents of minority backgrounds,'' Cockatoo-Collins said.
“This is something we did not want to revisit as a family and we feel let down and hurt.
“As a family we don't want any other child to be subjected to this.''

What you buy and where you shop may affect your credit score.
As credit card companies continue to tighten their lending standards on card users, some are using purchasing data -- gleaned from millions of card transactions processed daily -- to weed out who may or may not be good credit risks.
Shop until you drop ... your credit score? Our interactive guide "Shopping your way to a better credit score" lets you drop items into a shopping cart and see whether they may raise or lower your score.
Have you used your credit card at merchants specializing in secondhand clothing, retread tires, bail bond services, massages, casino gambling or betting? Your credit card issuer may be taking note -- and making decisions about your creditworthiness based on your purchasing behavior. The reason: Buying used clothing or retread tires may be an indication of financial distress and a preamble to missed credit card payments or defaults.
Now, Congress and federal regulators will be probing the extent to which credit card issuers have used information about where a person shops or what they buy as reasons to lower credit limits or increase interest rates. When credit limits are lowered, it can adversely affect utilization ratios, a measure of how much of cardholders' credit limits are used. Lowering the credit limit increases the utilization ratio and can lead to a lower credit score.
New credit card law: Study this practice
The new credit card reform law signed by President Obama in May 2009 includes a provision requiring federal regulators to investigate whether credit card issuers used information about where consumers shopped, what they purchased, the types of merchants they shopped with and their locations, and the mortgage company they borrowed from as bases for increasing interest rates or reducing credit limits.
"Where a person shops, in my opinion, has little bearing on whether they can pay back a credit card balance," Congresswoman Maxine Waters of California said during an April 22, 2009, hearing on credit card reform conducted by the U.S. House Financial Services Committee. "I want this study done because I want to stop some of these outrageous practices in the future."

U.S. member of congress
Study due in 2010
The Federal Reserve, Federal Trade Commission and other banking regulators must report to the U.S. House and Senate financial services and banking committees, respectively, detailing whether card issuers engaged in the practice between May 22, 2006, and May 22, 2009.
Regulators must also determine whether the profiling negatively affected minority and low-income card users. The Fed must make recommendations for any changes to existing rules or laws that may be necessary to curb harmful practices.
Results of the study are due no later than May 22, 2010.
Waters noted American Express has already acknowledged it used information about where customers shopped to lower credit limits. After a firestorm of criticism and outrage earlier this year, AmEx announced it would no longer engage in the practice.
Is it 'redlining'?
"I'm concerned that limiting credit based on where a person shops or the neighborhood they live in could amount to redlining," Waters said, referring to the practice of targeting certain areas or neighborhoods for discriminatory housing, insurance or lending treatment.
With credit card transactions, every time you make a purchase, a record of that sale is logged into a database of information collected by your credit card issuer. Privacy experts warn that consumers should be mindful of what they buy with plastic and what purchasing data credit card issuers may be analyzing.
Privacy questions
"Obviously that is something that most credit cardholders are not going to think about," says Paul Stephens, director of policy and advocacy for the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a San Diego-based privacy rights groups. "They've obtained a credit card and think they can go out and use it in any way they like."
Experts say cardholders concerned about keeping purchasing habits private or avoiding credit score dings should consider using cash or gift cards, stored value or prepaid debit cards. Shopping at large supermarkets or wholesale clubs -- which offer a variety of product lines -- may also keep some purchases private. Other tips: Spread purchases that may indicate risky behavior over several credit cards to avoid triggering an alert for a single issuer.
"Cash is the ultimate privacy protector," says Stephens. "It's kind of hard to trace. With most other payment mechanisms there is going to be a trail."
But avoiding credit cards for the sake of privacy may present a quandary for some users: If they had the cash to pay for an item, they wouldn't need a credit card. For others, the convenience of using a credit card over other payment methods far outweighs the potential privacy concerns.
Mining for data
Known in the industry by a number of terms, including behavioral modeling, data mining and psychographic behavior analysis, the practice of mining internal credit card issuer databases for customer spending trends and other patterns is not new. Issuers have been analyzing data perhaps since the first credit cards were issued.
Representatives from the four top credit card issuers -- Bank of America, Citi, Chase and Wells Fargo -- declined to discuss details of how they use purchasing data internally. Many consider this highly proprietary information. A spokesperson from a banking industry trade group acknowledged that the practice is common.
Tracking credit card purchases with merchant category codes (MCC) Here's a sample of the electronic payment tracking codes assigned to different types of merchants: 4900 Bail and bond payments 5300 Wholesale clubs (Costco, Sam's Club, etc.) 5411 Grocery supermarkets 5532 Automotive stores 5698 Wig and toupee stores 5813 Drinking places (bars, nightclubs) 5814 Fast food restaurants 5912 Drug stores and pharmacies 5921 Packaged beer, wine and liquor stores 5931 Used and secondhand stores 5933 Pawnshops 5944 Jewelry, watches, clocks and silverware stores 7251 Shoe repair shops 7273 Dating/escort services 7277 Counseling services (debt, marriage, personal) 7297 Massage parlors 7393 Detective agencies 7534 Tire retreading and tire repair 7995 Betting/casino gambling establishments 8011 Doctors 8062 Hospitals 8099 Medical services 8351 Child care services 8651 Political organizations 9211 Court costs (child support and alimony payments) A complete MCC list can be found on the IRS website.
"The issuing bank has the date of transaction, name of the merchant and the amount of the transaction that allows them to process that transaction," says Nessa Feddis, senior counsel and vice president of the American Bankers Association. They say specific information about items purchased (that you bought a gallon of milk, for example) is not included in the data transferred from the merchant. "As a general rule, the specific transaction information is not transmitted to the issuing bank. They are going to know where the person used the card."
Keeping track
Tracking is conducted for four primary reasons:
Marketing . Issuers use past purchasing patterns as a basis for offering additional products. Someone purchases airline tickets with a credit card may get offers of airline rewards credit cards or travel-related services from the issuer or an affiliate.

. Card users who continually go over their credit limits or exhibit unusual spending habits -- such as charging large amounts of merchandise on a card they had previously rarely used -- may be at greater risk of not paying their bills or filing for bankruptcy. Law enforcement. Remember that TV crime show where police tracked a missing person or a killer using credit card transaction data? Law enforcement agencies can subpoena records from both the credit card issuer and the merchant to find out the time, date and place of a credit card purchase -- information that may be helpful in determining the last known location of a crime victim or suspect. The Department of Homeland Security also tracks terrorist activity by monitoring certain purchases.
Massive databases of information
Millions of credit card users receive monthly statements detailing their spending during the billing cycle: The standard information provided includes the date of a purchase, the place of the purchase, including the name of the merchant, city, state, amount of the purchase and a transaction reference number.
Every transaction processed by the card networks (Visa and MasterCard) is assigned a merchant category code (MCC), a four-digit number that denotes the type of business providing a service or selling merchandise. The MCC for pawnshops, for example, is 5933. For dating and escort services, it's 7273, and for massage parlors, it's 7297.
The MCC is used, for example, to restrict health care spending on health care-related credit and debit cards. Some health care flexible spending accounts allow users to make purchases only at pharmacies or merchants with medical-related services. Small business owners also use the codes to prevent employee abuse of company credit cards.
The MCCs, along with the name of the merchant, give credit card issuers a spyglass into cardholder spending.
'A pretty clear picture'
Stephens says the database's purchasing information can provide a pretty clear picture of credit card users. "What do they know about you? Depending on how extensively you use your credit card, they conceivably have a very clear, distinct picture of an individual. It's not only your retail purchases, but your online purchases. It can really paint a very complete picture. The stores that you shop at can paint a picture. You also may use it at a doctor's office if you pay for care with a credit card. Some people pay for their utilities with credit cards."

privacy rights expert
Federal financial privacy laws (Regulation P) prohibit credit card issuers from sharing your personal and payment information with third parties not affiliated with the issuer (except under court order or when fraud is involved). Banks must send annual copies of their privacy policies to cardholders, but the law does not govern what the issuer does with payment information internally.
It is a common industry practice to analyze the data for trends. Several issuers offer cardholders annual summaries of their spending that categorize purchasing by type of merchant and amounts spent. This information can be a handy tool to help families budget for the coming year and determine where they can cut back in spending.
"Once you use your credit card at a store, that code is tracked," says Steve Shaw, a strategic marketing manager for Fiserv, a company that develops online banking software to help financial institutions manage customer accounts. Shaw says banks are developing programs to track customer transactions and activities. The information is used to help make customer-specific offers of services. "A lot of financial institutions are trying to find more ways to generate revenue."
A rare glimpse into the details of behavioral modeling was revealed in a federal lawsuit filed by the Federal Trade Commission in June 2008 against subprime credit card marketer CompuCredit Corp. According to the lawsuit, CompuCredit used an undisclosed behavioral scoring model to track customer purchases. The company lowered credit limits on cardholders who shopped at certain establishments or used certain services, including pawnshops, massage parlors, tire retread shops, marriage counselors and bars and nightclubs.
CompuCredit agreed to a settlement that included crediting $114 million to the accounts of affected cardholders and paying a $2.4 million penalty. The company did not admit any wrongdoing in the settlement.
Risky behavior?
The recent credit crunch has placed greater emphasis on using the data to predict who may be a higher credit risk. Credit card issuers have said people living in states hard hit by foreclosures, such as Florida, Nevada and California (referred to as the "sand states") may be considered increased risks by virtue of the fact that they live there. People who shop at the same establishments where subprime borrowers shop also may be considered higher risk.
Feddis, the ABA spokesperson, says decisions to cut credit limits based on customer behavior are based on evidence. "They don't want to risk a bad judgment that's going to lose a good customer. It's too hard to get a good customer," Feddis says. "They must have some sort of statistics that would demonstrate it's predictive -- to show that people who shop at pawnshops within six months stop paying their credit card bills."
Stephens, the privacy expert, warns of the potential fallout of using purchasing data. "One of the dangers of data mining is you're getting a little snippet of information that doesn't portray the full picture," they say. Does one purchase at a pawnshop signal a pattern of credit trouble? How many purchases qualify?
Stephens says issuers should make clear disclosures about how they use purchasing data: "We recognize that most consumers don't read privacy policies, but nonetheless, a company that is utilizing data in this fashion ought to make it quite clear that the purchase transaction history is being utilized for purposes other than billing ... that they are using it to make re-pricing decisions as well as credit line adjustment decisions."

Story highlights Gloria Borger: This presidential election might be about sea-change
Donald Trump flouts the conventions, plays to fears, Borger writes
(CNN) It seems almost quaint, really, to go back to the start of this presidential campaign when the question du jour was whether Chris "just-sit-down-and-shut-up" Christie was too much of a bully to become president. Temperament, it seems, was a requirement.
Or even go back to Hillary Clinton's 2008 derision of Barack Obama as not ready to be president and take that 3 a.m. phone call about a national security crisis. Experience and depth of knowledge was also an issue.
But that's ancient history. Somehow, the notions of temperament and experience have been overtaken by the desire -- at least according to the polls so far in the GOP race -- for what passes as a show of strength, unbound by convention and unattached to complexity. Donald Trump, the undisputed frontrunner, reigns supreme, no matter what the half-formed solutions. As in: Muslims are trying to kill us, so let's keep them out. Illegal immigrants are "raping" and taking our jobs, so let's keep them out. Civility -- now called political correctness -- is ruining our national conversation, so let's abandon it.
The cliché is that presidential elections are about change, and that's true. Only this one may be about sea-change.
This is not something that comes from nowhere, out of the blue. Americans are, with good reason, truly afraid. According to our CNN polling , nearly two thirds believe an act of terrorism is likely in the homeland -- and that poll was taken before the carnage of San Bernardino. Eighty-one percent are convinced that the terrorists are here, living among us -- a completely rational conclusion.

A team of Yale researchers has developed a new statistical model that accurately estimates public climate change opinion and public policy support in all 50 states, 435 United State Congressional districts, more than 3,000 counties, and cities across the nation. The model allows users to explore public opinion in unprecedented geographic detail.
The model, which is described in the journal Nature Climate Change, was developed in partnership with Utah State University.
“Most of the action to reduce carbon pollution and prepare for climate change impacts is happening at the state and local levels of American society,” said Anthony Leiserowitz, a research scientist and faculty member at the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies (F&ES). “Yet elected officials, the media, educators, and advocates currently know little about the levels of public and political will for climate action at these sub-national levels. State and local surveys are costly and time-intensive, and as a result most public opinion polling is only done at the national level.
“This model for the first time reveals the full geographic diversity of public opinion in the United States at these critical levels of decision making,” Leiserowitz said.
Using the results, the research team also constructed an interactive, online tool called “Yale Climate Opinion Maps,” which allows users to explore differences in public opinion in the United States.
Nationally, 52% of Americans are worried about global warming. But, as the results show, this national number glosses over the geographic diversity in public opinion across the country. Concern about global warming ranges from an estimated low of 38% in Pickett County, Tenn., to a high of 74% in Washington, D.C. The results also identify significant variation within states. For example, in Texas, public worry about global warming ranges from a low of 39% in King County to a high of 61% in Travis County.
“Although a majority of people in every state think global warming is happening, this analysis makes it possible to see how much opinions differ within each state,” said Peter Howe of Utah State University, the lead author of the paper. “These differences are partly due to the fact that different groups often think differently about the issue. For example, Hispanics and Latinos tend to be more worried about global warming than other racial or ethnic groups, which can be seen on the map in counties with more Latino residents.”
The estimates are derived from a geographic and statistical model using a large national survey dataset (n>13,000), along with demographic and geographic population characteristics. To validate the model, the research team conducted separate surveys in four states and two cities, and found the estimates were within three percentage points of the independent surveys at the state level and four percentage points at the city level. Overall, the accuracy of the model estimates is higher for geographic areas with larger populations.
In addition to Leiserowitz and Howe, principal investigators include Jennifer Marlon and Matto Mildenberger of Yale.
The research was funded by the Skoll Global Threats Foundation, the Energy Foundation, the 11th Hour Foundation, the Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment, and the V.K. Rasmussen Foundation.
Williams has denied that Formula 2-star Oliver Rowland is now a late contender to replace Felipe Massa for 2018. With Robert Kubica inching towards the race seat for next year, Rowland threw a spanner in the works by declaring at the weekend: "My team is in talks with Williams. British car, British driver, it fits well," they are quoted by The Independent newspaper.
But when asked if it is true that Rowland is really a contender to race for Williams next year, a team spokesperson said: "That's not correct." Canadian newspaper La Journal de Montreal reports that if Kubica does have a genuine challenger for the 2018 role, it is Russian driver Sergey Sirotkin.
Citing sources, the report said 22-year-old Renault reserve Sirotkin promises about $15 million in sponsorship, "which Kubica is unable to match". Le Journal de Montreal said Sirotkin was seen at Williams' headquarters last Tuesday, with Kubica visiting Grove a day later.
"According to information, Williams could hire Kubica as well as Sirotkin as the third driver. If the Pole does not satisfy the team, the Russian could be called up to take over at any time." The report concluded: "Paul di Resta, Pascal Wehrlein and Daniil Kvyat had also been mentioned to replace Massa, but they are no longer in the picture." (GMM)

Leaders of the state's largest teachers union and the state employees union met privately with Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett this week to discourage them from running in possible recall election next year against Gov. Scott Walker.
But Barrett rebuffed the union bosses.
According to an email obtained by No Quarter, Wisconsin Education Association Council President Mary Bell, WEAC Executive Director Dan Burkhalter and other top union officials had a face-to-face meeting with the Democratic mayor on Monday to discuss the potential Walker recall race.
"Despite attempts to communicate the issues you laid out very clearly in our meeting on Saturday, in our judgment the meeting did not convince Mayor Barrett that they should not run in a potential recall election," Bell wrote Thursday to their board members and UniServ presidents.
Insiders say the union officials are hoping to clear the field for former Dane County Executive Kathleen Falk to take on the first-term Republican governor in the spring. Also attending the meeting was Marty Beil, executive director of the Wisconsin State Employees Union and an open critic of Barrett.
At least one other union leader was upset with WEAC and Beil for discouraging Barrett - or anyone else - from considering a possible recall run.
"That's certainly not a unanimous view in the labor community," Jim Palmer, head of the Wisconsin Professional Police Association, said of the effort to force Barrett out of the race. "What everybody wants is a candidate to defeat Scott Walker. That should be our primary objective."
Patrick Curley, the mayor's chief of staff, issued a statement saying their boss is focused on Milwaukee and their mayoral re-election contest in April. It appears that Barrett will face only minor opposition.
"The recall campaign is a grass roots, citizens initiative that still has a few chapters to be written," Curley said in the statement. "Tom respects and supports the thousands of Wisconsinites who have made this a true democratic effort."
That is consistent with their remarks at a Wednesday news conference in which reporters repeatedly asked Barrett if they would run in a recall election. They repeatedly dodged the question.
"I'm a proud candidate for mayor of Milwaukee," Barrett said, adding, "I don't know what the future holds" for the prospects of a recall election.
Frankly, it's not surprising that the state teachers union and the Milwaukee mayor do not see eye to eye on the recall race.
WEAC opposed Barrett's plan a couple of years ago to take control of the troubled Milwaukee Public Schools. In their 2010 gubernatorial campaign, the statewide teachers group didn't make independent expenditures in support of their campaign, as it did for a number of Wisconsin lawmakers.
In their email, Bell, who could not be reached for comment, urged top WEAC officials to press the case for Barrett to sit on the sidelines in a recall contest. Walker defeated Barrett by 52% to 47% in the 2010 general election. That marked the second time Barrett was beaten in a bid to be governor.
"We continue to pursue the message on other fronts, but could use your assistance in telling the story from your perspective and with your reasons, to those with whom you have connections that might be more effective in delivering that message to the Mayor," Bell wrote.
Bell then told their union brethren what Barrett had said at their Wednesday press conference announcing their re-election bid for mayor.
"Mayor Barrett has not signed a recall petition," Bell wrote. "He said they might sign. 'In all likelihood' they will sign. REALLY? Wisconsin citizens – our members – are standing in the cold to gather signatures and Mayor Barrett is undecided?"
Earlier this month, the United Wisconsin coalition said more than 507,000 signatures had been collected in just 30 days. They need 540,208 signatures to force the recall election sometime in 2012. Petitions are due Jan. 17.
The effort was spurred by anger over Walker's proposal effectively ending collective bargaining rights for public workers.
As part of its effort to push Barrett aside, WEAC officials began circulating a polling memo on Thursday that suggests Falk and former U.S. Rep. Dave Obey have as good a chance as Barrett to unseat Walker.
"After introducing balanced information about Walker and each Democrat, Kathleen Falk is able to move the vote more towards them than Obey or Barrett," says the memo from Anzalone Liszt Research, a national Democratic firm that polled 601 likely recall voters on Dec. 12-15 for WEAC.
"Though Barrett has the highest name ID to start with, voters are familiar with them and they are limited in their ability to gain voters. Falk gains the support of key target groups including independents, women and seniors."
Other Democrats, however, were dismissive of the memo, suggesting that other private polls show Barrett is a better position than Falk.
"The difference would be they win, they lose," said one well-connected Democrat. "All their negatives are known, and people still want them over Walker. Falk is much more of a wild card."
Cancer vs. VR OnComfort's goal is to help patients cope with the stress and pain associated with cancer treatment, but the startup isn't working on a new medication or traditional therapy. They have their eyes set on virtual reality (VR). “Oncomfort leverages virtual reality technology to help train patients in stress management techniques, give them easy-to-understand information, and help them feel more in control, calm, and comfortable,” CEO Diane Jooris explained in a news release after the company won the C3 Prize. So far, OnComfort has created five different VR applications in pursuit of this goal. Aqua is an immersive experience that places the patient in an undersea environment to induce relaxation, while Amo uses clinical hypnosis techniques, deep breathing, guided imagery, and relaxation to ease pain and anxiety.
Three of the company's apps — Kimo, Spacio, and Stella — have been designed specifically for the benefit of pediatric patients. These can be used to distract them during short procedures or help them prepare for MRIs, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. VR Wins According to OnComfort's website, their apps have been tested by 20 doctors on more than 1,500 patients in the U.S. and Europe. Jooris told Forbes that tests have so far produced positive results — breast cancer patients who used OnComfort at least 15 minutes before their scheduled procedures saw a 50 percent reduction in anxiety, an 80 percent reduction in the use of pain medication, and a 40 percent decrease in overall pain. Numbers like these are likely to help the company as they seek out more support for their technology. Getting regulatory approval to use VR — or any new treatment or device — for medical purposes isn't easy, and the process can be a long, expensive one with unexpected setbacks.
Virtual reality has already proven capable of doing much good in the healthcare industry, helping patients cope with autism, paranoia, labor pains, PTSD, and many other conditions and ailments. Last year, an estimated 1.6 million people in the U.S. were diagnosed with a form of cancer, and if games like Aqua and Spacio can help ease the stress and pain of even a fraction of those people, OnComfort's technology is worth pursuing.

The guilty priests - Fr Scerri (front) and Fr Pulis (right) leaving the courthouse this morning. Picture: Darrin Zammit Lupi.
Adds new video - Two priests have been sentenced to six years and five years, respectively, after being convicted of sexually abusing boys at St Joseph Home in Hamrun.
They have given notice of appeal.
Fr Charles Pulis was sentenced to six years in jail after nine cases were proven against him. Eight took place in the home and another in Marfa.
Fr Godwin Scerri was sented to five years in jail on conviction of similar charges.
Sentence was delivered by Magistrate Saviour Demicoli in a judgement of over 100 pages, bringing to an end a case which first came to public attention in September 2003.The cases happened some 20 years ago.
The priests will appeal.
VICTIMS' REACTION
The victims welcomed the verdict.
"I am very satisfied. Many victims were scared of speaking out, this will help the truth to come out in more cases," Lawrence Grech told timesofmalta.com.
"They did a lot of harm, some of the victims ended up taking drugs, some have died. That hurt will never go away, Mr Grech said, with tears in their eyes.
They said that they hoped the process in the Church would now be concluded soon and that these two priests would be removed from the priesthood immediately.
It was regrettable, they said, that the Church process had taken too long and the apology given some months ago was not enough.
EIGHT-YEAR-OLD CASE
The court case started eight years ago.
The accused, Fr Godwin Scerri and Fr Charles Pulis stood expressionless in the dock as the judgement was read out, a process which took almost two hours.
They were charged with abusing 11 boys who were in their care. Fr Scerri was charged, on their own, of raping a boy at Marfa. They were acquitted of that charge because the rape had not taken place at Marfa, but at St Joseph Home.
In its verdict, the court said it agreed with the prosecution that this case was not time-barred.
The court said cases were proven against Fr Pulis in eight cases which occurred at St Joseph Home and another in Marfa.
The court noted that Fr Scerri had claimed they were not in Malta when the cases happened. There were two departure stamps on their passport- September 1985 and July 1990. There were no arrival stamps but the departure ones indicated they must have been in Malta for some time between the two departure dates, the court said.
The accused originally stood charged together with a third, who passed away last January, aged 63.
The victims, who were then aged between 13 and 16, were resident at St Joseph's Home in Sta Venera in the late 1980s when the abuse took place.
The court had banned the publication of the priests' names and the case was heard behind closed doors. At the same time, the Church Response Team initiated an investigation.
Under the gaze of the world's media, the victims were last year given a private audience with the Pope in Malta. The Vatican promised it would look into their case following criticism of the Response Team, which had not yet concluded its investigation seven years on.
Subsequently, the victims held a private meeting with Archbishop Paul Cremona and Gozo Bishop Mario Grech.
In an interview with The Sunday Times, in June 2010, Archbishop Cremona apologised for the delay in the Church investigation. The Vatican's Promoter of Justice in the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Mgr Charles Scicluna, held meetings in Malta with some of the victims. They compiled their testimony and passed on the details to the Response Team.
Last October, the victims received a letter informing them that their cases were “founded” and the matter would be referred to the Vatican. Then, in January this year, the Vatican instructed the Maltese Church to set up a tribunal to conduct the judicial process into the abuse allegations
In April, Lawrence Grech – who became the spokesperson for the victims – accused the Church of delaying tactics as regards its own tribunal, pending the outcome of the criminal court case.
However, in May, a member of the tribunal hearing the case against the priests met the victims to formalise evidence they gave to the Vatican's chief sex abuse prosecutor last summer.
OTHER CASES
In April last year, the Curia reported that four Maltese priests were found guilty of the sexual abuse of minors and punished after their case was referred to the Holy See by the Church's response team.
Their punishment varied from not allowing them to exercise their ministry to limiting their pastoral work so that they could not work with minors and being placed under supervision.
The Curia also said that the response team, which was set up in 1999, had received a total of 84 allegations of child abuse, involving 45 Maltese priests.
Some of these cases went back to the 1970s. The response team had found a basis for the allegations made against 13 of the 45 cases.
You've probably heard politicians or pundits say that “metadata doesn't matter.” They argue that police and intelligence agencies shouldn't need probable cause warrants to collect information about our communications. Metadata isn't all that revealing, they say, it's just numbering.
But the digital metadata trails you leave behind every day say more about you than you can imagine. Now, thanks to two MIT students, you don't have to imagine—at least with respect to your email.
Deepak Jagdish and Daniel Smilkov's Immersion program maps your life, using your email account. After you give the researchers access to your email metadata—not the content, just the time and date stamps, and “To” and “Cc” fields—they'll return to you a series of maps and graphs that will blow your mind. The program will remind you of former loves, illustrate the changing dynamics of your professional and personal networks over time, mark deaths and transitions in your life, and more. You'll probably learn something new about yourself, if you study it closely enough. (The students say they delete your data on your command.)
Whether or not you grant the program access to your data, watch the video embedded below to see Jagdish and Smilkov show illustrations from Immersion and talk about what they discerned about themselves from looking at their own metadata maps. While you're watching, remember that while the NSA and FBI are collecting our phone records in bulk, and using advanced computer algorithms to make meaning from them, state and local government officials can often also get this information without a warrant.

When President Obama said that the phone surveillance program “isn't about” “listening to your telephone calls,” they were deflecting attention from the terrifying fact that there's nothing currently stopping the government from amassing and data-mining every scrap of metadata in the world about us. They made it sound like metadata spying isn't a big deal, when it's pretty much the golden ticket.
Metadata surveillance is extremely powerful, and we are all subject to it, constantly. If you want to see something resembling what the NSA sees when it looks at your data, give Jagdish and Smilkov's program a try. Then tell the government: get a warrant.

Walter Murch and "The Rule of Six"
Written for Aotg.com by Parker Mott

Twitter: @parkermott
When it comes to leading educators in the field, the name “Walter Murch” ought to resonate with editors the way Robert McKee would with screenwriters or Constantin Stanislavski with method actors. The Academy Award-winning Murch (editor of The English Patient, Jarhead, and also the coeditor of many of Francis Ford Coppola's pictures) is perhaps most eminently regarded for their 1995 book, “In the Blink of an Eye”, where they ascribed the essential role of editorial in film and television to “partly anticipate, partly to control the thought process of the audience.” (Murch 69)
“In the Blink of an Eye” is basically a manifesto for editors that has been translated into many languages including Chinese, Italian, Hebrew, Spanish, French, German, and Hungarian. Murch approaches editing by looking beyond basic human instinct; he, quite seamlessly, integrates technology and neurology into their thesis. You could say the book is interested in where this art borders on a kind of science: a medium that is measurable and testable, with unlimited room for expansion insofar as it obeys certain well-established laws.
While experimentation is encouraged and in fact, necessary – there are rules that an artisan must consider when in the cutting room. Murch breaks these “rules” down into SIX CATEGORIES, assigning each individual one with a percentage of value proportionate to the whole. The six rules a) enumerate the specific ways a CUT is motivated and b) quantify what makes a good cut.
What is laudable about these rules is their lack of didacticism. They don't have the dusty air of a FILM 101 lecture, where students (in this case, readers) are bound to a rigorous rubric. Instead, Murch's rules are terse, leaving plenty of room for experimentation. Their rules should be seen as guidelines. After all, Murch admits that The Rule of Six is ultimately a personal choice: “An ideal cut (for me) [sic] is the one that satisfies the following six criteria at once.” (18) And that criteria is...
RULE NUMBER ONE: Emotion (51%)
Murch asks: how do you want the audience to feel?
Murch views Emotion as an invaluable resource. Without it, your movie is in trouble. If your work has a through line of emotion that is true to what you intended your audience to feel, then “you have done about as much as you can ever do.” (18) The key point here: the audience should always be first in an editor's mind.
Murch is after a sort of expressionism when they explain that an emotional cut should take precedence over a cut that's only meant to preserve the continuity of the narrative. Criterion Collection released a helpful video called “Emotional Editing”, wherein Danish writer-director Lars von Trier discusses their non-classical editing style in Breaking the Waves. Watch it here:
RULE NUMBER TWO: Story (23%)
Murch asks: does the edit move the story forward in a meaningful way?
This is essential. A story must be dynamic. There must be motion behind it; an underlying force hurdling the events forward. If the cut does not advance the narrative or make the audience feel they just put one foot forward, then that's trouble. Emotion and Story, Murch submits, are the most important. They leaf what tangibly moves a story forward up to the editor. All they ask is the editor's decision be “interesting” and “unique”. (19)
RULE NUMBER THREE: Rhythm (10%)
Murch asks: is the cut at a point that makes rhythmic sense?
One can assume that the reason why the last four rules are of less priority is not because they aren't important, but because they are implicitly (but nonetheless vitally) linked to Emotion and Story. Murch likens them to “the bonds between the protons and neutrons in the nucleus of the atom.” (20) They state that an editor should use an emotional cut if it serves the story AND the rhythm. If the rhythm is there, the audience will become unaware (or unconcerned) of lapses in continuity or the 180-degree rule.
For those interested in learning more about Rhythms, watch Dr. Karen Pearlman discuss Rhythms from their book Cutting Rhythms: Shaping the Film Edit. You can also watch Dr. Pearlman in other videos on Timing and Non Visible Rhythms here.
RULE NUMBER FOUR: Eye Trace (7%)
Murch asks: how does the cut affect the location and movement of the audience's focus in the frame?
A cut must not disorient the viewer, to the extent that their eyes cannot comprehend the action. Action movies tend to be the main offenders of this rule, mainly because they must account for so much hyper-kinetic movement to keep up with the pace of the events. Writers will often resort to a cliché like “MTV Style” editing to describe a movie, TV show, or music video that fails to maintain this fourth rule. If an editor employs Eye Trace, this will likely minimize issues with the last two rules, which are...
RULE NUMBER FIVE: Two Dimensional Plane of Screen (5%)
Murch asks: is the axis followed properly?
If not, don't fret. Remember: Yasujiro Ozu's visual style made its name off breaking the axis. That said, a filmmaker/editor should learn the rules first before breaking them, or “crossing the line”. First, one must respect, what Murch calls, “planarity”: the grammar of three dimensions transposed by photography to two. (18) Here is a thoughtful video on The 180 Degree Rule and how it is applied in the films of Ozu.
RULE NUMBER SIX: Three Dimensional Space (4%)
Murch asks: is the cut true to established physical and spacial relationships?
Up until the 1960s, these last two rules would have been sacrosanct in Hollywood. The reason being that classical style, the leading editing style of the golden age, depended on clean continuity and clarity of space. Rule Five and Six are to be followed if the editor intends to craft a movie or TV show that truly falls under invisible art. The editor is to maintain a certain fidelity to the mise-en-scène – where sets, props, actors etc. are located. Once established, the space should not change. But there are many exceptions to this rule, thus is why Murch puts this rule at the bottom of the list.
Wrap Up
Overall, The Rule of Six is “a list of priorities”. (20) Murch ends this chapter of their book with this important bit of advice: “If you have to give something up, don't ever give up emotion before story. Don't give up story before rhythm, don't give up rhythm before eye-trace, don't give up eye-trace before planarity, and don't give up planarity before spatial continuity.” (20) Stressed? Don't be, as Murch reassures in the name of their next chapter: “Don't Worry, It's Only A Movie.”

The Táchira Antpitta had not been seen since its scientific discovery in the mid-1950s. Illustration by John A. Gwynne, courtesy Princeton University Press.
From the Autumn 2017 issue of Living Bird magazine. Subscribe now.
Jhonathan Miranda never expected to be into birds. But when the Venezuelan biologist got a job at a bird lab as a university student, they set their mind to learning as much as they could about the class Aves. As they organized trips around the country, one particular species lodged in their mind: the Táchira Antpitta, a round, leggy brown bird a little longer than a pencil. It hadn't been seen since a handful of specimens is collected from the Andean cloud forests on the Venezuela-Colombia border in 1955–56. Was it a valid species? Miranda wondered. Did it even exist?
When Miranda found themselves in the Venezuelan state of Táchira in 2007, they started looking. In 2009, they spent a month exploring and talking to locals without success. Then, in 2016, the Red Siskin Initiative—a conservation partnership between the Smithsonian Institution and several Venezuelan scientific organizations—tapped Miranda to lead a formal search. Financial support came under the umbrella of the American Bird Conservancy's search for near-extinct birds, known as their Lost Birds of the Americas project. All Miranda's hard work finally paid off: After extensive research, and a grueling journey into the field, the team found the Táchira Antpitta on their first full day of fieldwork, returning to public consciousness a bird that some feared was gone for good.
“I was so ecstatic I was almost scared,” Miranda says of finally laying eyes on the species. “It was kind of like one of those nightmares where you're afraid to move.”
Three Lost Birds: The American Bird Conservancy's Lost Birds of the Americas project aims to rediscover the Kinglet Calyptura in Brazil and the Turquoise-throated Puffleg in Ecuador, in addition to the recently rediscovered Táchira Antpitta (left to right). Images by William Swainson, John Gould, and John A. Gwynne/Princeton University Press.
The Lost Birds project aims to rediscover three vanished, longshot species—among them the Turquoise-throated Puffleg—an Ecuadorian hummingbird with colors as flamboyant as its name—and Brazil's once-common Kinglet Calyptura. Of these, the Táchira Antpitta was thought to be the likeliest to be found, if searchers could just find the right spot. (Read our full story about rediscovering lost birds.)
Though deforestation was common around the Táchira Antpitta's suspected home, some of the undisturbed forest was protected inside Venezuela's El Tamá National Park. There were also other explanations for the bird dropping off the radar besides extinction: That border had been nearly impossible to visit until recently because of guerilla activity in adjacent Colombia. And as a group, antpittas are legendarily difficult to spot, singing only in the narrow window before dawn and dusk and sticking to the thick undergrowth of steep, soupy woods at high elevations.
Miranda's long years of obsession also gave the team an edge. Digging back through the field journals of the original expedition, they were able to reconstruct its route based in part on the other species listed there—leaftossers, other kinds of antpittas, foliage-gleaners. Those clues and local intel told them the original explorers had passed through especially moist cloud forest laced with mossy, rocky habitat and palms. One day last June, after a 15-hour drive, an hour-and-a-half mule trip, and a long rest in a remote house that served as base camp, the team set out at 4:30 a.m. They crossed four streams. They thrashed though thick brush. Then, they heard an unfamiliar call, higher than that of the area's better-known Scaled Antpitta. Before long, they had the first-ever recording of the Táchira Antpitta's song.
Still, it took seven more days for Miranda, who is with the Venezuelan conservation group Provita, to photograph the antpitta. Even then, they got pictures only by setting up a little blind made out of their poncho in a camouflaged spot. For hours they sat completely still in the airless space, their skin crawling with sweat and mosquitoes. Peter Bichier—a member of the expedition who is affiliated with the University of California, Santa Cruz—didn't have much better luck. Tracking the antpitta by sound from a steep, dripping ravine, they followed one into a more open area full of climbing vines called lianas.
The expedition gathered the first photos and sound recordings of the Táchira Antpitta in the wild. Photo by Jhonathan Miranda.
“Man, I just couldn't see the damn thing,” Bichier says. “It walks like a little rat. It'll be really close to you and make this low sound, and then it's 100 feet from you. You just wanted to throw a rock at it or something. I was desperate. I wanted to cry.” Bichier was finally rewarded for their persistence, but they still had to thrash up a cliff to get a glimpse. They lost 12 pounds over the course of the trip.
Ultimately, Bichier says, the team heard four distinct individuals and saw two. In the coming months, they will report their findings in a scientific journal, including how to visually distinguish the birds from other species of antpitta found in the area. Miranda has failed to turn up more Táchira Antpittas in subsequent visits, but they and the team's other scientists suspect they'll find more on future expeditions into similar habitat in Colombia. “The rediscovery provides hope and inspiration that we still have a chance to conserve this species,” says Daniel Lebbin, ABC's Vice President of International Programs, who coordinates the Lost Birds effort. “We hope this rediscovery will lead to improved management of and attention for protected areas like El Tamá National Park.”

It's unclear how long of a window there will be to determine if the bird needs help and what that might look like, Miranda says. “If we don't know how many, or what's the habitat of the bird, or the behavior, then not much can be done to preserve it.” Peace accords recently hammered out in Colombia could force remaining guerilla activity over the border into Venezuela.
Meanwhile, Venezuela is going through its own economic crisis, and the Táchira Antpitta's remaining forest is not that big. “I don't know what's going to happen with natural resources except that there's going to be more and more pressure towards them,” Miranda says. “I feel a very strong sense of urgency to do something now”— before the Táchira Antpitta slips out of sight yet again.
Sombra is basically the Overwatch version of the DDOS script kiddies who bring down services like Steam and PSN. They take shit you rely on, they break it, and then they disappear. In the right hands, I think she's gonna be devastating.
During BlizzCon in Anaheim, California, I got to play a couple games as Sombra, and it was a little overwhelming, to be honest. Sombra's toolbox is vast and versatile. They can hack characters to disable their abilities for six seconds (though thankfully not their guns). They can hack health packs to isolate them for whichever team she's on. They can hack Torbjorn turrets and knock them out of commission. Them ult lets them hack everybody in a large vicinity all at once and destroy barriers and shields.
And that's just their hacking.
They can also toss a translocator grenade and teleport to wherever it is at will for a full 15 seconds. For some reason, they can see enemies at half-health or less through walls. Oh, and they can turn completely invisible, run around, and unload an SMG clip into your fleshy, unprotected backside. They will shoot you in the butt.

That's... a lot of stuff. In practice, I found myself playing them like a stealthier Tracer. I'd use my translocator and invisibility to get into the enemy's back line, hack a character and maybe a health pack, and then get out. The invisibility + translocator combo makes Sombra deceptively quick and evasive. Them SMG isn't as damaging as Tracer's guns, but their hack leaves enemies temporarily stripped of their abilities, and if Sombra can't finish the job, hacking also makes enemies visible through walls to your teammates. Essentially, they can create a path through the level for attacking teams, hacking health packs and marking enemies as they go.
It's super fun. Invisibility is quick and empowering, and arcing a translocator so that you teleport at the zenith of its flight feels phenomenal. There are so many ways to get around as Sombra, so many new ways to think outside the box. Most of them are deliciously devious. Them SMGs, meanwhile, pack a satisfying crunch, and they've got large magazines. They're best up close, but they can do so-so mid-range damage, which is more than can be said for beefier harassers like Reaper.

But that's hardly the only way you can play them Sombra strikes me as a counter to all sorts of tried-and-true Overwatch strats. Again, they can knock down barriers with their ult, which will certainly do a number on tank-heavy pushes. If you main Reinhardt or Zarya, prepare to be frustrated. Or let's say you have a Sombra sneaking around and surgically hacking supports like Lucio, Mercy, and Ana. So long, sweet, sweet heals and power-ups. Got a big push coming off Lucio's ult? Not anymore, you don't.
I worry that they might be able to influence the flow of matches a little too much. Again, though, I've only played a couple games as her, so I need more time before I render a verdict. And don't get me wrong: they do have weaknesses. In a direct firefight, their HP falls apart like all hacker movies except the movie Hackers. While they can outmaneuver other harassers by using their translocator to teleport to safety (or even a health pack), they chew right through them in a shootout. Any damage can knock them out of invisibility, making them especially vulnerable to AOE attacks, explosions, and big ults. Anything that makes them visible (think Widowmaker's ult or Hanzo's sonic arrow) is also dangerous. Lastly, I stupidly stumbled into more Junkrat traps than I'd like to admit while invisibly slinking around the other team's back line, so that's something to look out for as well.
Still, she's got some mad-powerful abilities, ones that can easily turn the tide of battle. I'm not sure exactly how team compositions will shift and re-settle once she's in the game, but one thing's for certain: Overwatch is about to change.
Leicester City have bolstered their defensive options with the signing of Mali international centre back Molla Wagué on loan until the end of the season.
- Leicester City have signed defender Molla Wagué on loan until the end of the 2016/17 campaign
- The Mali international joins from Italian club Udinese with the consent of their Spanish parent club, Granada CF
- Wagué this month came up against Foxes midfielder Daniel Amartey at the Africa Cup of Nations and has also previously faced Riyad Mahrez and Papy Mendy while at Caen
- The Club have an option to buy Wagué at the end of their loan spell
Leicester City have bolstered their defensive options with the signing of Mali international centre back Molla Wagué on loan until the end of the season.
Subject to receiving international clearance and their registration being approved by the Premier League and the Football Association, Molla becomes the Foxes' second addition of 2017 after the capture of Wilfred Ndidi earlier this month.
They join on loan from Italian club Udinese with the consent of their Spanish parent club, Granada CF.
Speaking exclusively to LCFC.com, Wagué said:“I'm delighted to be at Leicester City and I can't wait to get started. It's a wonderful Club and I'm excited to have the chance to show what I can do in the Premier League with the champions. .
“I've always wanted to play in England so I'm looking forward to the challenge and to getting to know my new team-mates over the coming weeks. I'll work hard to get my chance and when it comes I hope to show that I will give everything to help the team.”
French-born Wagué has been on loan at Udinese since 2014, having made 37 appearances for the Serie A outfit, but will now see out the 2016/17 campaign at Leicester City, with the Club having an option to make the deal permanent from Granada at the end of the season.
A tall and athletic centre half who is extremely quick and mobile, Wagué has built a reputation as a good reader of the game and is adept at using their physical attributes to provide effective cover in behind. At Udinese, they operated in both 3-5-2 and 4-3-3 systems, either on the right side of a three or as the right-sided centre back in a back four.
The versatile defender, who can also play as a right-back, now arrives at King Power Stadium fresh from representing Mali at the Africa Cup of Nations in Gabon. Wagué played in all three of their nation's Group D fixtures, including a clash with Ghana which saw them come up against City midfielder Daniel Amartey.
A former French youth international, they made their senior debut at Caen in November 2011 and spent three years with the team, where they played alongside former Fox N'Golo Kanté and against Riyad Mahrez and Papy Mendy. The defender was linked with a move to the Foxes at the end of their contract but eventually signed for Spanish side Granada in 2014, before spending the past three seasons on loan at Udinese.
First, don't spank. Corporal punishment makes depressed kids who act out. But if you insist on whacking your children to teach them things like kindness, please avoid being an otherwise good parent. A study published Monday in the journal Child and Adolescent Mental Healthshows that among parents who spank, it's the ones with positive communication that predict depressive symptoms in their kids. If the spanking parent is across-the-board harsh and uncommunicative – meh, the kid's firewalled against it.
The study, performed at the University of Tennessee by Amber Wimsatt, Paula Fite, Stevie Grassett, and Jamie Rathert posits that it's the lack of consistency of a parent who is both the source of stress and of comfort that especially throws kids for a loop.
The finding comes from 89 kids, aged 9-12, and three measures – one of corporal punishment, one of positive parent-child communication, and one of childhood depression (overall 14 percent of kids met criteria for being "at risk" for depression). The first findings are pretty much what you'd expect: parents who spank have a higher rate of depressed kids, and parents who have poor parent-child communication have depressed kids.
But then check this out: the kids of parents who spank AND have negative parent-child communication have no elevated risk of depression. Again, within the population of spanked kids, it's only, specifically, the kids who have otherwise supportive parents that are at increased depression risk.
Think about why you might spank. Are you doing it because you think that despite the naysayers, it's the right thing to do – that it's actually good parenting? If that's the case, maybe you explain the reason for your spanking and try to make your child realize that you're spanking out of love and not out of spite? Well, that's about the worst thing you can do. If you're going to spank, the kindest thing you can do for your child's psychological well-being is to be consistent – if you're going to be mean, stay mean. Oscillating between being the source of fear and the source of love just freaks kids out.
Of course, can you guess in this study which parenting techniques resulted in the lowest rates of childhood depression? It was no corporal punishment and high parent-child communication.
A West Palm Beach pastor and their wife are behind bars charged with abusing children.
Pastor James Jackson and their wife Valerie Jackson are known in West Palm Beach for their involvement with a non profit that helps teens.
But now they face serious charges related to child molestation.
James Jackson is charged with sexual battery on children and their wife Valerie is charged with and lascivious behavior.
A therapist with Palm Beach County Victim Services says they are not surprised by cases like this.
"We are not seeing the stranger danger like we used to see years ago. What is happening now is people who are in these authoritative roles, protective roles for children...are taking advantage of them. And they are the ones we are seeing who are predatory against these children," therapist Randee Kogan said.
If you have any information related to the case, contact West Palm Beach Police.
'1Q84': Murakami's Orwellian Best-Seller Now In U.S.
1Q84 by Haruki Murakami Hardcover, 925 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?
Do you miss the girl with the dragon tattoo? Do you long for the thrill of following their adventures again through three volumes of exciting, intelligent fiction? If so, I have good news for you. She's got a sort of soul sister in one of the two main characters in Haruki Murakami's wonderful novel 1Q84.
Picking up the new book may strain your arms. 1Q84 (more about the title in a moment) checks in at more than 900 pages. But unlike a number of other novels that embrace both what we think of as the real world and the world of the fantastic, it will not strain your credulity. With more than enough narrative and intellectual heft to make it enjoyable for anyone with a taste for moving representations of modern consciousness in the magical realist mode, this story may easily carry you away to a new world and keep you there for a long time.
You may even fall in love with one of the two main characters, an attractive 30-something Tokyo physical trainer named Aomame (pronounced "Ah-oh-ma-meh," which in Japanese means "green peas") with a murderous avocation. In the fabled year of 1984, Aomame finds themselves on the way by taxi to carry out an assassination (not their first) of a business person singled out as a profligate wife-abuser and torturer, and when they get stuck in a traffic jam on an elevated roadway, they exit the cab, scoots among the stalled cars, and climbs down to street level by means of a construction-site stairway that might as well be a rabbit hole.
Even as they go about their dangerous business, they suddenly notice that the sky and cityscape have turned slightly odd and out of kilter. By climbing down those exit stairs, they seem to have put the world of 1984 behind them and entered the realm that they come to identify as 1Q84, an alternate realm — and thus the Q — "that bears a question ..." The deep and resonant plot that serves as the anchor for their actions, and for those of Tengo Kawana, the young writer whose movements and thoughts we observe in alternating chapters, takes place under a sky with two moons, and unfolds at a leisurely pace but in compelling fashion by luring us along with scenes of homicidal intrigue, literary intrigue, religious fanaticism, physical sex, metaphysical sex and asexual sex. And music.
Enlarge this image toggle caption Knopf Haruki Murakami is also the author of The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, Norwegian Wood and Kafka on the Shore. Knopf
Tengo, a big guy with a big writing talent, has, as the novel begins, been roped into a somewhat fraudulent publishing scheme that can only make trouble for their career. Their ties to a beautiful, young, odd teenage girl named Fuka-Eri, the putative author of a strange but compelling fiction contest entry, grow tighter and tighter even as they pull them closer to their own origins, and to the early life of Aomame who, like him, had quite an unhappy childhood. Their ties to this idiosyncratic and terrifically engaging hero emerge as the novel unfolds, blossoming into a romance motif as bold and as baldly created as any in recent fiction.
Murakami's main characters find themselves drawn toward each other as irresistibly, magnetically, hypnotically, soulfully and physically as any characters in Western fiction. Given the plain-spoken but appealing nature of the prose (translated by Jay Rubin and Philip Gabriel), most of you will feel that same power as an insinuating compulsion to read on, despite the enormous length, hoping against hope for a happy ending under a sky with either two moons or one.
Two moons — two worlds — a girl with — 900 pages — 1Q84 is a gorgeous festival of words arranged for maximum comprehension and delicious satisfaction.
How did you first get the idea for your anatomical sculptures?
I've had a fascination with anatomy for quite some time, creating my first fictitious anatomical schematic around 1999 with a technical drawing of the inner workings of an incubus. Sculpture has always been my preferred medium but for years I stayed away from it because the final cost of a piece meant that it was out of a lot of peoples' price range. I stuck to 2D illustration because I could offer prints at a reasonable price. I moved to sculpture after being laid off from my job as a mobile UI designer a couple years ago, taking a leap of faith and rationalizing that anything I could get for them was better than nothing - I had bills to pay! So I guess it boiled down to survival, and it's a choice that I have never regretted.
There's so much attention to detail in all your work; how long does it normally take you to complete a sculpture/a digital print?
Surprisingly it takes me much longer to create a digital print image than it does to sculpt a detailed anatomy or any other sculpture. I create my digital images using Maya, Photoshop and Illustrator and they can take anything from several weeks to a month complete. Sculpting on the other hand takes me an average of 3 days to a week or two depending on the complexity, size and the material I'm working with.
The juxtaposition of cartoon characters and visceral detail in your ‘dissections' is disconcerting but also darkly funny. What sort of effect were you aiming for?
My thought process and design process is simply me wanting to see what something would look like outside my head. There is no real deep message behind it, at least not on purpose or at the start of a project although I sometimes take a narrative direction as the piece progresses. It all really started with the idea of "What would a Balloon Animal anatomy look like?"
Your work spans a variety of media – what would you say is your favourite medium to work in?
Sculpture, hands down. It comes to me very naturally, it just happens without much thought. 2D work is exactly that, work, but that said I still really do enjoy it.
Having previously worked as a set designer for MTV, do you think that this has had an effect on your attitude to pop-culture?
Actually it was my fascination with POP Art that probably landed me the MTV gig, not the other way around.
You've shown us the insides of so many famous characters; do you have a particular favourite?
Probably Super Mario, Hello Kitty and My Little Pony.
Do you have any projects in the pipeline?
I always have projects and ideas brewing in my head. Right now I'm moving away from the licensed character anatomy and concentrating more on my own creations. I have a few toys in production that will be released early this year and I'm very excited about that. I'm also about to move up in scale on my sculptures and create some pieces two feet and four feet tall...

Kyrie Irving has heard all kinds of criticism and ribbing about their flat earth comments. With a month to reconsider their position, Irving doesn't appear to be budging.
“It's OK to think something that, I guess, the majority wouldn't think,” Irving said on the Road Trippin' podcast (h/t James Herbert of CBS Sports). “I just didn't like the fact that us being able to celebrate our individuality and things that we ultimately hold on to, and just because we don't believe what the world thinks or what the majority thinks, then why punish that?
"That's the only thing I felt like that got misconstructed is just that it's OK to believe one thing. It's OK to have your own thoughts and be able to function and be able to formulate your own thoughts and opinions and still be able to convey them to other people.”
Irving first said they believe the earth is flat during an appearance on the podcast last month.
"I'm telling you, it's right in front of our faces. They lie to us," Irving said. "There is no concrete information except for the information that they're giving us. They're particularly putting you in the direction of what to believe and what not to believe. The truth is right there, you just got to go searching for it."
The Cleveland Cavaliers guard quickly became a trending topic on Twitter and was oft-mocked throughout All-Star weekend. Irving's teammates came to their defense and even poked fun at the incident, with Richard Jefferson wearing a "flat world champions" t-shirt:
Even renowned scientist Neil deGrasse Tyson chimed in with their opinion.
"Let me be blunt," Tyson told TMZ. "We live in a free country, so you ought to be able to think and say whatever you want. If they want to think Earth is flat, go right ahead—as long as they continue to play basketball and not become head of any space agencies."
Irving, for their part, seemed a little befuddled by the reaction.
“I found it somewhat hilarious just by the reaction it got,” Irving said. “That right there, before we went into All-Star weekend, we talked about this. Because we were like, ‘This is gonna be crazy, going into All-Star weekend, flat Earth, round Earth conversation. Aliens. No conspiracy theories. So as I'm at All-Star weekend, I'm starting to see different news channels, different people pick it up. And it almost felt like I was standing on top of a pendulum and I was like swinging back and forth and then it gave everyone a chance to just look at me and then, if they didn't agree with me, kind of like throw rocks at me. Just like, ‘no, they can't believe this.'"
Irving did say, however, they were happy that their comments opened up a conversation that informed some of the public. That said, they don't appear to have much interest in backing down from their contention that the world is flat.
DHAKA, Bangladesh — India's foreign minister told Bangladesh's government that Myanmar must take back Rohingya Muslims to resolve one of Asia's largest refugee crises in decades, the government said.
Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj conveyed their message Sunday during a meeting with Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who ordered border guards and their administration to allow the Rohingya to cross the border and shelter in makeshift camps in the coastal district of Cox's Bazar.
Nearly 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar's Rakhine state since Aug. 25 to escape persecution that the United Nations has called ethnic cleansing.
The United News of Bangladesh agency reported that Swaraj said, “Myanmar must take back their nationals … this is a big burden for Bangladesh. How long will Bangladesh bear it? There should be a permanent solution to this crisis.”
They met earlier with their Bangladeshi counterpart A.H.Mahmood Ali and said India was worried about the violence. Human rights groups have interviewed refugees who said Myanmar security forces killed indiscriminately, committed rapes and burned villages to force Rohingya to leave.
“We've urged the situation be handled with restraint, keeping in mind the welfare of the population,” Swaraj said in a statement.
Swaraj also said India supported the implementation of recommendations suggesting recognition of the Rohingya ethnic group within Myanmar, where they are denied citizenship and are effectively stateless.
In the statement, they also said creating economic opportunity in the troubled Rakhine state could help resolve the situation.
“In our view, the only long-term solution to the situation in Rakhine State is rapid socio-economic and infrastructure development that would have a positive impact on all the communities living in the state,” they were quoted as saying in the statement.
Bangladeshi Foreign Minister urged India to play a greater role by “exerting sustained pressure” on Myanmar to find a peaceful solution to the Rohingya crisis.
India's shift toward resolving the Rohinga crisis would mean a lot to China's policy to support Myanmar.
An official with China's ruling Communist Party said Saturday the country supports Myanmar in “safeguarding peace and stability” and won't join other nations in condemning the government's actions. Beijing condemns “violence and terror acts” and backs measures to restore order, said the vice minister of the party's International Department, Guo Yezhou, apparently referring to attacks by Rohingya rebels on Myanmar security forces.
WTC7: The “Smoking Gun” of 9/11
by Debbie Menon
WTC7 according to Danny Jowenko was absolutely brought down by a controlled demolition.
The accident of prominent Dutch “demolition expert” Danny Jowenko is of special interest to us, because on July 13th 2011 in an exclusive Press TV interview, Dr. Alan Sabrosky, Veterans Today board member and editor, specifically drew attention to the Dutch demolition expert, Danny Jowenko, stating that two years ago, they came across an extremely disturbing video in which Danny Jowenko was interviewed concerning the collapse on 9/11, of a 3rd World Trade Center building. WTC7, a 47 storey building, the third tallest building, which was not hit by a plane, which was conspicuously missing in the 9/11 commission report and which according to Danny Jowenko was absolutely brought down by a controlled demolition. “That is, WTC-7 went straight down into its own footprint in seconds without any visible external trauma, which means only some catastrophic internal trauma could have brought it down, concluded Sabrosky.” They have repeatedly cited the well known demolition experts' views and interview in their recent articles and interviews.
On July 16th, 2011, Danny Jowenko died in a one-sided car accident, a frontal collision with a tree, in the village of Serooskerke, The Netherlands
Danny Jowenko deceased at Serooskerke (W) Danny Jowenko from the church in Veere Saturday Serooskerke killed in a frontal collision with a tree. The accident happened just before half past seven at the height of the industrial area at the intersection zomp Wilgenhoekweg / Hondegemseweg. The victim died on the spot and squeezed Sat. There was also a dog in the car. They were still alive, and is picked up by the animal. (Publication date 17/7/2011)
Accidents do happen. And, they were not a singularly important and threatening guy like editor Sean Hoar was or Dr. David Kelly (Weapons expert) was.
They were but one of many who have provided valuable and incontrovertible testimony, but still only one of many, and not imminently threatening danger to anyone. I would have to know more about the circumstances of their “accident” before I would let paranoia kick in.
On the other hand, you do not have to kill many chickens to frighten the monkeys… but the “people like” Dr. David Kelly, Danny Jowenko and Sean Hoar who are giving testimony such as they have, and pushing that particular cart are not exactly monkeys, and I doubt that the death of a few chickens will frighten many of them off the task anyway!
I pity the dog for, unless they have hospitalization insurance or happens to be on a government payroll, they will simply administer an overdose and bury him.
Frontal collisions with trees are the worst kind. Are there any others?
R.I.P Danny!

Nearly 40,000 Australians sign a petition asking Coalition not to sell Asic's corporate registry, saying it will make it harder to investigate unethical business activities
Nearly 40,000 Australians are calling on the Turnbull government to stop the privatisation of Asic's corporate registry, warning it will jeopardise the ability of journalists and academics to investigate corporate wrongdoing.
They say the registry privatisation represents an “all-out attack” on corporate transparency in Australia, because journalists and academics are already forced to pay some of the highest fees in the world to access corporate data and those fees will get worse if the registry is run by a for-profit corporation.
The leftwing activist group GetUp has collected almost 40,000 signatures since Sunday in a last-ditch attempt to convince the federal government to stop the sale going ahead.
Selling off Asic's trove of company data 'would hinder tax enforcement' Read more
Asic's corporate registry is a critical database of information on more than two million companies in Australia, including business names, histories, financial records and backgrounds of directors.
It can be used by the public to search millions of companies – and their documents – not listed on the Australian Securities Exchange. Only about 2,000 companies are listed on the ASX.
It has been central to efforts to expose the tax avoidance habits of private companies. It also provides records needed to investigate cases of money laundering, financing terrorism, labour exploitation and human trafficking.
The Abbott government announced plans in its 2015-16 budget to undertake a competitive tender process for Asic's registry business, believing it would be better run in private hands.
The Turnbull government is pushing ahead with those plans, with final bids for the tender process due on 29 August.
The government says it will retain ownership of the data once the registry is sold, but software upgrades of the register will be undertaken by its private owner.
The sale is supported by Greg Medcraft, the Asic chairperson.
Natalie O'Brien, GetUp's economic campaigns director, says if the registry is privatised it will make it even harder to investigate illicit and unethical activities of business.
“Journalists and academics routinely run out of money to purchase more financial statements to properly investigate a particular company or industry,” O'Brien said.
Multinational tax avoidance cost Australia $6bn in 2014, Oxfam report claims Read more
“If the database is run by a for-profit corporation, not only will it entrench this abysmal status quo, we'll see costs rise and additional access barriers may be created. That means less transparency, less corporate accountability.
“Everyday people know that corporations need more scrutiny, not less. Otherwise we are all the poorer,” said O'Brien.
Kelly O'Dwyer, the minister for revenue and financial services, told Guardian Australia the government will consider the final bids “before making a decision on any further steps.”
Last week, more than 20 civil society organisations and unions sent a letter to the treasurer, Scott Morrison, asking them to stop the registry from being privatised.
They said the Panama Papers scandal demonstrated that governments needed to take action against shell companies with concealed ownership, and the corporate watchdog's registry of business data must remain in government hands to help in that fight.
“The Asic corporate register is currently relied upon by law enforcement agencies, such as the Fair Work Ombudsman and the Australian Tax Office, in identifying company ownership and location,” the letter said.
“Placing this register in private hands risks undermining a range of law enforcement activities as well as Australia's attempts to curb money-laundering and the financing of terrorism.”
The Australian Council of Social Service, the Tax Justice Network, the Uniting church, and GetUp!, were among those who signed the letter.
The writing was on the wall for Flip, but when Cisco decided to shutter its rather popular Flip video camera business in April 2011, the company promised a smooth transition for existing users. That said, Givit video sharing service will be integrating with Flipshare, Flip's online video sharing platform, to store the content that will soon be permanently deleted from Flipshare.
Even though the iPhone completely disrupted Flip's business, there are still more than 3 million Flip users out there in the world who need a place to store their videos. Givit aims to solve that problem through its cloud service.
The content currently on Flipshare will be permanently deleted 30 days from now, but the service will be functional until December 30. That means any new content uploaded to Flipshare starting now will only have a 30-day lifespan. If you happen to be a Flip user, pay close attention. Here's what you need to do:
It's actually really simple. The next time you log in to FlipShare, you should see a link asking if you are ready to transfer your content to Givit. Click that. The rest should be pretty self-explanatory.
FlipShare users will also be pleased to know that Givit has iOS, Android, web, PC and Mac apps and is universally compatible with all video formats and sizes.

Dizzy, Derpy, Old Grey Mare, we love and hate you because in you we see ourselves at our best and worst.

Derpy is the manifesto of the Brony community?? O.O *mindblown*
pingaslord23 in reply to melskunk ((~2012-03)) If you think about it,'Derpy' was the first action of the community taking the show and making it our own, not in connection to it's nostalgic past or what the creators were intentionally presenting. Derpy is as much Brony as anything there is.

One book blew me away this year: Lucia Berlin's A Manual For Cleaning Women. But I had a lot of dead Englishmen to revel with first. It must have been sitting through two inferior takes on Wolf Hall this spring that set me off: an awful production on Broadway; a far better but still tedious rendering on PBS. That sent me back to the books, flipping through to find the passages with my most feverish underlines, taking note of how masterfully Hilary Mantel brought the same scenes to life, with imagery, interior dialogue and delicious prose. I reread long stretches of both books in the series — can't wait for the third.
I literally couldn't wait. I found myself gobbling up books connected to that era, or connected to the connections. Peter Ackroyd's Foundation: The History of England from Its Earliest Beginnings to the Tudors was illuminating, but frustrating — especially for their penchant for lathering praise on the most dickish of kings. I was far more satisfied with Dan Jones's The Plantagenets. I've OD'd on the period a bit for now, but when I return to the histories, it will be to their series. Foundation was best at its prehistoric and pre-Norman passages, which finally removed a festering burr from my intellect. If the Saxons were the dominant half of Anglo-Saxons, how did the Angles get custody of the name? It's always perplexed me. The short answer: proximity to their conquerors. The Angles controlled much of the east coast, so it was their kingdoms the Danes wiped out when they crossed the North Sea. So the island was AngleLand (or something like that) to the Danes. They didn't rename the place when they discovered even more Saxons much further in. (The Jutes got left out completely, along with lots of lesser tribes.)
It was also Foundation that led me to Beowulf, at the same time I was discovering how much J.R.R. Tolkien had riffed on it from the prologue of The Fellowship: The Literary Lives of the Inklings. That was enough to entice me to a bookstore to thumb through the supposed literary abomination I had escaped in high school. “Never take a class that forces you to read Beowulf,” an older friend had sagely advised on their first trip home from college. I'm reconsidering everything I ever learned from him. Of course they were too young to enjoy the melodious Seamus Heaney translation. What a delight that turned out to be!
Sure it got repetitive, and heavy-handed, but that was half the joy of it — the window into the psyche of 8th- to 11th-century English aristocracy: the ideas they cherished, how they sought to (over) communicate them, and what they considered a great yarn. It was also eye-opening to discover how liberally Tolkien helped themselves to the material. Shelob, in particular, was concocted by imaginations 1,000 years earlier, and I felt rumblings of Middle Earth nearly every page. Yet Tolkien made it all their own. Well done, J.R.R.
My first attempt at Anglo-Saxon also made it apparent how absurd the alternate label of Old English is. I planned to approach Beowulf the way I do William Shakespeare: attempt to cold read chunks of the original on the left, jumping over to explanations — or translation — when I got really frustrated. Not happening. The “Old English” on the left was not just old or archaic, it was a completely different language. Not a recognizable word, anywhere. All of which I should have understood already perhaps from the Plantagenet histories, or high school, but there's nothing like confronting the actual text to see how far we've come in 1,000 years.
And then I dove into the Henrys. I intend to get to all of them, but jumped ahead to start with Henry IV, Part 1. Good call. I can't wait to start stealing from this! Shakespeare at the top of their form, in language, plot, and character. In spite of Falstaff. God, do I hate that guy. Never funny, always heavy-handed (a holdover from Beowulf?). Ugh. There's a lot of the dufus in there, but the bursts surrounding them are brilliant enough to wipe out most of them from my memory.
Part 1 was so intoxicating, I plunged right into Part 2. Despite the naming convention, they are completely separate, self-contained plays. In fact, they're more or less the same play: a complete rehash, replaying the same plot, ideas, and (mostly) cast — including Their Vileness, Falstaff. With none of the inspiration or vitality. Half-hearted remake masquerading as sequel. So this is where Hollywood got it.
And then I got my hands on A Manual for Cleaning Women. Wow. No kings or dukes or ladies in waiting losing their heads or fighting for the crown. No grand sweeping anything. And no boisterous narrator, showing off, nor boring MFA stories, full of pretty sentences about nothing. These characters remind me of Denis Johnson. They could fit snugly into Jesus' Son, though Lucia Berlin wrote most of these stories earlier.
Lucia gives us gripping tales about switchboard operators, cleaners, and shy little Protestant girls trying to fit in at Catholic school. In the mission school in “El Tim,” the children tremble their morning prayers, the Latina girls flirting quietly, like muted birds, the boys cocking their plumed heads, decked out in brilliant yellows and turquoise, with V-neck sweaters and no shirts, exposing the crucifixes gleaming against their smooth brown chests. Berlin can sure set a scene. And bring it alive with boys trying hard to be hoods, “flipping a switchblade into a desk, blushing when it flipped and fell.”
Lucia Berlin was my mentor. She's suddenly a sensation, but died 11 years ago, a virtual unknown. I'd read most of these stories, so I planned to skim a little and dip back into my favorites. I'm not much of a re-reader — I bore easily. But I'm transfixed, again, even deeper this time. I wasn't a good enough writer to fully appreciate them the first pass. Half of what I do I learned from these stories, but I see now how much more there is to mine.
I read them mostly to enjoy. So much to savor. The flitting nuns and thuggish pachuco crucifixes in “El Tim” felt so vivid, but were all set-up for the emergence of the title character, who takes down Sister Lourdes, looking down at them with “his eyelashes creating jagged shadows down their gaunt cheeks. Their black hair was long and straight. They smoothed it back with long slender fingers, quick, like a bird.” The girls were awed. “The pretty young girls who whispered in the restroom not of dates or love but of marriage and abortion. They were tensed, watching him, flushed and alive.”
How I feel every time I crack open this book.

Physicist discovers how sax players hit high notes
Updated
Great saxophone players do more than just hit the right notes on their instrument, they can also tune their own vocal tract to match, researchers say.
Musicians have long known that professional saxophonists can play very high notes that amateurs simply cannot manage.
Now a physicist from the University of New South Wales explains why.
The best saxophone players have figured out how to change the shapes of their vocal tracts so they resonate at a frequency close to that of the note they're aiming for.
"We measured the resonances of saxophonists' vocal tracts directly, while they played," said doctoral student Chen Jer-Ming, whose work appears in the journal Science.
Over the standard saxophone range of roughly two-and-a-half octaves, there was no particular relationship between the vocal tract resonances and notes played, they say.
But for the highest notes, the vocal tracts of professional saxophonists did something special.
"In those higher frequencies up there, the saxophone's own resonances are relatively weak, so that's why it's hard to sound those notes," Mr Chen said.
"By adjusting your vocal tract resonances to match those in the saxophone, they add up. That allows them to play the notes."
New device
Musicians and scientists have been debating for 25 years the importance of the player's vocal tract in hitting notes on single-reed instruments such as the saxophone and clarinet.
Mr Chen solved that debate by building a device that could fit unobtrusively within the mouthpiece of a saxophone and detect the resonances of the musician's vocal tract.
They and their colleagues used the device to compare three amateur players and five professional jazz and classical saxophonists.
When Mr Chen asked the professionals how they learned to play the high notes, they all said it was something they stumbled upon and kept practising.
"They all told me the same thing," Mr Chen said.
"Once they learned how to do it, they had to hear the note in their head first, then the note will just naturally follow.
"I think it's a kind of muscle memory at work. Their throat just moves in the right places at the right time."
Now the secret is out, Mr Chen says it might be possible to teach budding saxophonists how to adjust their playing to hit those high notes.
"I believe It's something most people could learn if they were conscious of it and practise hard," they said.
"It won't happen overnight."

Aphex Twin performs during day one of the Pitchfork Music Festival at the Grande Halle de La Villette on October 28, 2011 in Paris, France.
AFX anchors themselves at No. 1 on Billboard's Top Dance/Electronic Albums chart (dated Sept. 12) with Orphaned Deejay Selek 2006-08. The set begins with 2,000 copies sold, according to Nielsen Music.
Although the first album to chart under the AFX billing, it's the fifth top 10 and third consecutive No. 1 for Richard David James, best known as Aphex Twin. That act's album Syro won this year's best dance/electronic album Grammy Award. Orphaned Deejay is a hardcore techno work, filled with eight instrumental, largely noncommercial, beat-driven tracks, many with eclectic titles; for example, there's a cut titled "midi pipe1c sds3time cube/klonedrm."
FROM AFX TO AVB: Staying with Top Dance/Electronic Albums, Armin van Buuren barrels in with their 24th charted title, A State of Trance at Ushuaia, Ibiza 2015 (No. 15, 1,000 sold). The trance king's latest entry extends their record for the most charted sets since the list's June 30, 2001 premiere. Tiesto follows with 20 charted albums.
Van Buuren's hit with fellow Dutchman Mr. Probz, "Another You," sits at No. 9 on Dance/Mix Show Airplay, in its 13th consecutive week in the top 10, after reaching No. 6.
Also on Dance/Mix Show Airplay, Tritonal & Cash Cash command a four-slot move into the top 10 with "Untouchable" (14-10). It's the third top 10 each for the trance duo and the pop/EDM act.
RUFUS REMADE: Heading over to Hot Dance/Electronic Songs, German trop-house DJ Felix Jaehn fetches their first top 10 with their first chart entry as an artist, "Ain't Nobody (Loves Me Better)" (11-10), featuring Jasmine Thompson. Jaehn, also known for their remix of OMI's six-week Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 "Cheerleader," puts a smooth, summery spin on the Rufus classic, which has endured as one of featured vocalist Chaka Khan's most famous songs. The original "Ain't Nobody" reached No. 22 on the Hot 100 and No. 6 on Dance Club Songs in 1983.
The new "Ain't Nobody" also marks the first Hot Dance/Electronic Songs top 10 for featured vocalist Thompson. They also sang on "Sun Goes Down" by Robin Schulz (No. 21, December), who previously gained acclaim for their soft-yet-uptempo, radio-ready remix of Mr. Probz's 11-week No.1 "Waves" last year.
IT'S A SUNSHINE WEEK: On Dance Club Songs, as previously reported, Demi Lovato reigns with "Cool for the Summer" (5-1).
Also on the survey, dance icons KC and the Sunshine Band reach the top 30 (32-30) with "I Love You More," the act's first song to chart since 1984. Lead singer Harry Wayne "KC" Casey and the Florida-based Sunshine Band climb thanks to a range of remixes, including from Tony Moran & Mike Lorello, Ralphi Rosario and Dave Aude.
The act topped the Hot 100 five times in 1975-80 with the classics "Get Down Tonight," "That's The Way (I Like It)," "(Shake, Shake Shake) Shake Your Booty," "I'm Your Boogie Man" and "Please Don't Go." KC added the solo hits "Yes, I'm Ready" (billed to Teri Rosario featuring KC; No. 2, 1980) and "Give It Up" (No. 18, 1984).
wikimedia commons The U.S. middle class is being shredded, ripped apart and systematically wiped out. If you doubt this, just check out the statistics.
The American Dream is being transformed into an absolute nightmare.
Once upon a time, the rest of the world knew that most Americans were able to live a middle class lifestyle. Most American families had nice homes, most American families had a car or two, most American families had nice clothes, most American families had an overabundance of food and most American families could even look forward to sending their children to college if that is what the kids wanted to do. There was an implicit promise that this was the way that it was always going to be.
Most of us grew up believing that if we worked really hard in school and that if we stayed out of trouble and that if we did everything that "the system" told us to do that there would be a place for us in the middle class too. Well, it turns out that "the system" is breaking down. There aren't enough good jobs for all of us anymore. In fact, there aren't very many crappy jobs either. Millions are out of work, millions have lost their homes and nearly all of the long-term economic trends just keep getting worse and worse. So is there any hope for the U.S. middle class?
No, there is not.
Unless fundamental changes are made economically, financially and politically, the long-term trends that are destroying the U.S. middle class will continue to do so.
The number of good jobs has been declining for a long time. The good jobs that have been lost are being replaced by a smaller number of low paying "service jobs".
Meanwhile, the cost of everything is going up. It is getting really hard for American families to be able to afford to put food on the table and to put gas in the tank. Health care costs are absolutely outrageous and college tuition is now out of reach for millions of American families.
Every single month more American families falls out of the middle class. Today there are 18 million more Americans on food stamps than there were just four years ago. More than one out of every five U.S. children is living in poverty. Things are getting really, really bad out there.
Court proceedings for a new rape charge against Daniel Messel — the man convicted for the 2015 murder of IU student Hannah Wilson — were pushed back from Tuesday until the end of May to allow further investigation and preparation.
Messel, 51, was charged with rape and other lesser charges in October 2016 after DNA evidence linked them to a rape reported in 2012 by an IU student. Messel is currently serving an 80-year sentence in prison for Wilson's murder.
In the 2012 case, a student reported that a man they did not know offered them a ride after they had been out drinking, according to the probable cause affidavit. They drove them to a secluded parking spot in the woods near Griffy Lake, where they forced their penis into their mouth.
They tried to fight them off, and they hit them so hard it “knocked the contact out of their eye and they were spitting blood.”
They drove away, and the student found help from residents nearby. The woman's underwear was found at the scene the next day.
After reading a news story about the Wilson case, the 2012 victim felt their case was “eerily similar” and called the IU Police Department to say they believed Messel might be their attacker.
DNA collected in 2012 from under their fingernails was compared to Messel's, and the samples matched. They were charged with rape only a few weeks after their trial for Wilson's murder, and they are now appealing their conviction in that case. They have until April 13 to file a brief explaining their reasons for appeal, after which the appeal will be approved or denied.

On Thursday, Alan Pyke, an economics editor at Think Progress, the blog of the Center for American Progress, the liberal think-tank in Washington, tweeted out that they wished Fox News chief Roger Ailes would die a “slow, painful” death–“and soon.” Why? Because, in Pyke's view, Ailes is “evil.” As Pyke explained it, referring to Ailes, “The evil that man has done to the American tapestry is unprecedented for an individual.”
A few hours later, after Breitbart News called them on their venomous tweet, Pyke deleted the tweet and apologized, sort of: as they wrote, “Deleting my hateful Roger Ailes tweet from earlier. Hoping that another human being dies is a shitty thing to do, and I'm sorry.”
But we might ask: Did Pyle personally apologize to Ailes for wishing them dead? Or did Pyke apologize for calling Ailes “evil?” The answer to both of those questions, of course, is “no.” Pyke did a little–make that very little–damage control. They deleted the tweet and then just said, “I'm sorry.”
As far as we can tell, Pyke is still on the payroll at CAP, still doing their thing. They have sent out some 30 tweets since their “I'm sorry,” mostly focused on the Ferguson, MO protests; they sure seems to be more of an activist than an economist. (Yes, it's amazing what an economics editor at a liberal think tank can delve into.)
Well, that shouldn't be the end of this story. There are a few more things–three things, in fact–that have to get settled.
First, let's talk double standards. If a conservative, a moderate–anyone but a liberal–had tweeted out something like that, there'd be a suspension or even a firing. The most recent example is Sean Bergin, the New Jersey reporter whose un-PC opinions on the state of the black family, expressed on the air in July, cost them their job.
Second, let's ask: Where is the accountability of the Center for American Progress? Let's start with the President of CAP, Neera Tanden. Do they in any way have any responsibility here? As of publication, calls to their office have not been returned.
How about the board of directors of CAP, including former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright?
Do any of them feel any responsibility?
Also on the board of CAP is Tom Steyer, the green billionaire crusader. Steyer and another left-wing billionaire, George Soros, have given millions each. But in the meantime, is anyone holding them accountable for what one of their hirelings has to say?
And how about all the other donors to CAP, from the American Beverage Association to Wells Fargo? Any contrition on K Street?
And come to think of it, CAP is a tax-exempt outfit. So in effect, we're all–all of us taxpayers–chipping in to subsidize Pyke's hate.
Third, where are the usual watchdogs of civility? When a conservative gets out of line, outfits such as the Poynter Institute can be counted on to provide a tut-tut quote about “coarsening the culture,” etc. But when a good liberal from CAP does it, all we hear are crickets.
If nobody else will say it, we will: Alan Pyke ought to resign. And since they won't, they should be fired. And until that happens, nobody in the CAP hierarchy–from Tanden, to Soros, to Steyer–should rest easy.
Brandon Marshall has performed admirably in place of Danny Trevathan at weakside linebacker. But the Broncos are best when Trevathan is their three-down linebacker, Nate Irving is their base linebacker and Marshall is a nickel linebacker.
Without Trevathan, Irving plays more in nickel and Marshall more in base. When Trevathan fully returns from their leg injury, order will be restored to the Broncos' linebacker core.
“I'm anticipating he'll be there Tuesday,” Broncos coach John Fox said.
Trevathan said they would be at about 75 percent for practice Tuesday. Their goal is to be ready to play in the Broncos' next game, Oct. 5 at home against Arizona.

Through two episodes of this show, I am now hooked. AYTO Second Chances is the Amazing Race except with beautiful people, craziness, horniness, and booze. Add that all together, and you get a recipe for a fun show as long as it remains 40 minutes and makes sure not to leave on a clif-hanger. The reason AYTO Second Chances has been good so far is due to how fast pace it is. You get house fun, a little bit of politics, and the daily mission all put into one.
Here are my favorites of the show so far:
Devin: Is it just me, or did MTV concoct this show in order to build it around their new favorite star? Their appearance on the Challenge and how far they made it was a pure stroke of luck, but their character and persona caught our eyes during every interview. This new game is not based on athleticism(while important to succeed), and is more focused on social skills, communication, intelligence, and trust. In the Bunim-Murray universe, Devin scores in all the upper quartiles for those sections. Episode 1 was the Devin Show, them and Rashida were the first couple shown, they won the first challenge, created an alliance with the pre season 4 couples, and popped off on seasons 4 and 5. The way they played Carolina and Hayden against each other was just beautiful.
Asaf and Kaylen: Asaf has been so adorable and fun the past couples episodes. They annoyed me on their first few episodes of AYTO, but I've really fallen in love with their crazy personality recently. Kaylen is also a nice girl and their relationship balances each other out pretty well. Great pair.
Shanley and Adam: Shanley without Chris T is an individual who brings joy to my soul with their humor. I really love their new look too. I never understood why people were so into them on the first season of AYTO, but I see it now. Them conversation with Devin on the last episode was great; Devin: “are we flirting” Shanley: “(laughs) no, never”.
Adam is also good-looking. That is nice to have. Him and Devin seem to have a cool bro relationship.
Carolina: I love Carolina. She's beautiful, and has a good heart, but their decision making skills are what makes great reality television. I support all hook ups by both sexes, as long as they are not cheating on their loved ones — cheating is bad. Carolina really wants to find happiness and will try to find that with multiple guys, and in this recent episode, they hooked up with Nate!!! Nate is possibly the lamest dude in the history of AYTO. John Jacobs was at least funny, Nate has just been a cry-baby during their reality tv stints. Carolina could be MTV's new Nany, a beauty with a good heart and propensity for hook-ups. Them dancing was on-point as well.
Who I'm liking:
Hayden: I respect their loyalty to Gianna, and the fact they are engaged after being a confirmed no-match in the truth booth on week one is a testament to their love. Not the biggest fan of how they played Carolina, but they seem like a nice guy, and the possibility of them stealing excites me.
Francesca: She's just so pretty, and I hate that they have to deal with Gio as their partner. Also, are their eyes legit? Do they use colored contacts?
Who I'm torn on:
Mike: Such a nice guy, but their awkward face whenever Gio is with Alicia is pure meme material. Peppy!
Tori: On their season of AYTO, I thought Tori was the hottest girl ever cast for the show, but their personality has just been all over the place this season. She's gone from quirky fun to quirky weird. Kinda like she's playing it up for the camera.
Who I don't care about right now
Morgan: Nice abs.
Cameron and Mikala: Call me when their relationship falls apart.
Rashida: They have a great personality usually, but with Devin they get a big ego. Can't call themselves a puppet master when Devin is the only one truly calling the shots.
Who I don't need in my life
Alicia: Obvious reasons, but when she's just with Mike, she's acceptable.
Gio: Gtfo my life.
Goodbyes to Nate and Ellie, and Derrick and Casandra.
Nate is a complainer and Ellie was not built for this game, so their early exit makes sense. It's just surprising that they finished in 4th on the first mission. Derrick and Casandra are two kind souls, and Cas is just so adorable. Tears left my eyes seeing Casandra leave so early.

The Issue that Unites Conservatives and Liberals
While many pretend that liberals and conservatives are too far apart to work together, there are actually many issues on which everyone can agree.
For example, both liberals and conservatives hate the malignant, symbiotic relationship between big government and big corporations:
Conservatives tend to view big government with suspicion, and think that government should be held accountable and reined in. Liberals tend to view big corporations with suspicion, and think that they should be held accountable and reined in.
*** Conservatives hate big unfettered government and liberals hate big unchecked corporations, so both hate legislation which encourages the federal government to reward big corporations at the expense of small businesses.
Most Americans – whether they are conservative or liberal – are disgusted that virtually all of the politicians are bought and paid for. No wonder people of all stripes have lost all trust in our government.
And everyone hates government-enabled fraud. The big banks, of course, committed massive fraud. But the auditors, rating agencies and regulators also all committed fraud, which helped blow the bubble and sowed the seeds of the inevitable crash.
Indeed:
Both liberals and conservatives are angry that the feds are propping up the giant banks – while letting small banks fail by the hundreds – even though that is horrible for the economy and Main Street. The Dodd-Frank financial legislation wasn't a compromise where things landed somewhere in the middle between liberal and conservatives ideas. Instead, it enshrines big government propping up the big banks … more or less permanently. Many liberals and conservatives look at the government's approach to the financial crisis as socialism for the rich and free market capitalism for the little guy. No wonder both liberals and conservatives hate it. And it's not just the big banks. Americans are angry that the federal government under both Bush and Obama have handed giant defense contractors like Blackwater and Halliburton no-bid contracts. [And Solyndra and other solar companies]. They are mad that – instead of cracking down on BP – the government has acted like BP's p.r. spokesperson-in-chief and sugar daddy. They are peeved that companies like Monsanto are able to sell genetically modified foods without any disclosure, and that small farmers are getting sued when Monsanto crops drift onto their fields. They are mad that Obama promised “change” – i.e. standing up to Wall Street and the other powers-that-be – but is just delivering more of the same. They are furious that there is no separation between government and a handful of favored giant corporations. [Indeed, Ben Bernanke has handed out more presents than Santa Claus to McDonald's Harley-Davidson, hedge funds and others.] In other words, Americans are angry that we've gone from capitalism to oligarchy.
As I noted Sunday:
Indeed, while most Americans are in favor of free market capitalism, we don't have capitalism at the moment. Instead, we have socialism, fascism or crony capitalism, where the government allows a handful of companies to succeed by propping them up, covering up their fraud and handing them guaranteed profts … but allows everyone else to struggle.
Incarceration in the United States is frequently described as an epidemic, with per capita rates nearly quadrupling in the past 30 years. African-Americans appear to be particularly susceptible: In 2011, they were six times more likely than whites to be incarcerated, making up 38% of the 1.6 million Americans behind bars while accounting for only 13% of the U.S. population. Now, a computer simulation originally developed to track infectious disease suggests the longer prison sentences that blacks often receive may accelerate the rate of “infection.”
Social scientists have long observed that imprisonment behaves like a contagious disease, says Kristian Lum, a statistician at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg. Studies show that those close to an incarcerated person are more likely to become imprisoned themselves. They could be driven to crime by poverty or stress resulting from the jailed person's absence, or become inured to violence through more frequent exposure to criminals. Children whose parents or older relatives are in prison may act out in ways that land them in jail, too. Even if the prisoner's friends and family don't commit more crime, or more violent types of crime, they may attract more attention from the police and be more likely to be arrested for minor infractions.
To find out what makes imprisonment more transmissible among blacks than whites, Lum and their colleagues turned to the world of infectious disease, repurposing a computer simulation used in epidemiology to predict how an epidemic of imprisonment might develop. When a disease changes from just something that's going around to a true epidemic, there's usually a tipping point, Lum explains. For example, the sick people may come into close contact with others who are extremely vulnerable—the elderly, young children, or those who have never been exposed to the infection before. With incarceration, the researchers suspected one such tipping point might be the longer sentences typically given to black offenders.
Incarceration equals the period of contagion, Lum explains. "The longer you're imprisoned, the higher the toll your incarceration takes on your family and friends, and the more likely they are to ‘catch' your incarceration from you." Sentencing discrepancies are not huge, they note. For drug possession, according to the U.S. Department of Justice, whites are given an average sentence of about 14 months, whereas black Americans typically get about 17 months for the same offense. Still, the researchers thought the difference might be just enough to tip a problem into an epidemic.
To test their suspicion, the researchers used their epidemiology model to generate a virtual community of about 8000 imaginary people. They assigned each individual a gender, a partner, a given number of children, siblings and friends of various ages, and a given lifespan. All data were drawn from the Census Bureau, Social Security Administration, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all, the virtual network encompassed about 60,000 friendships and family ties. About 1% of the virtual population was assumed to be in jail. The probability of these virtual inmates' friends and family also going to jail was programmed into the model using previously published statistics.
To observe the effects of differences in sentence length, Lum's team ran a simulation twice. The first time, the imprisoned individuals were given the 14-month sentence usually assigned to whites for drug possession. The second time, the same virtual group was used; the only difference was that those in jail stayed there for 17 months, a typical sentence for black offenders. Using the lifespans, ages, sentence durations, and probability of arrest that were programmed into the model, the researchers watched each simulation for 50 virtual years.
The disparity in sentencing between whites and blacks emerged as the single factor making the disease of incarceration a true epidemic among blacks, the researchers report online this week in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface. With no differences between the two hypothetical groups other than the length of the sentence, even 3 extra months in prison led to higher incarceration rates over time. In the test for which the shorter sentence was used, incarceration rates actually declined from the starting point of 1% for about the first 5 years and then increased only very slightly, to 0.725%, for the 50-year duration.
In the second simulation, however, the longer sentence clearly fell on the other side of the tipping point. When the virtual inmates were imprisoned for 17 months, incarceration rates throughout the community climbed steadily until just under 3% of the population was in jail 50 years later.
When the model was run indefinitely, it leveled off at incarceration rates of 1% using the shorter sentence and 7% using the longer sentence—a figure that mirrors the difference in rates of white and black incarceration in the United States today.
"According to our model, the tipping point is somewhere between the 14- and 17-month sentences," Lum says. "Below that point, incarceration won't take off and reach high levels in the population, and above that point, it will."
Focusing on the potential effects of the sentence length opens a host of questions for future work, says James Moody, a sociologist at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. One such question is how differences in a person's family structure or number of close friends may influence how their incarceration “spreads” through their community. "Contagious processes often contain clear tipping points," they explain. "In this case, the sentence length for black Americans is on one side of this point while that for whites is on the other."
Because a computer simulation is not the real world, the researchers compared their results with California's incarceration data since the mid-1980s, when mandatory drug sentencing became law and average sentence length for white and black offenders began to diverge. This time, real-world figures and estimates of incarceration were used in the simulations. The model's predictions were borne out almost exactly. In California, from 1986 to 2010, the incarceration rate for blacks climbed from 1% to 2.18%, while for whites it rose from a lower starting point of 0.15% to 0.28%. The model had predicted an increase to 2.25% for individuals assigned the sentence usually given to blacks, and 0.34% for a shorter sentence handed to whites.
Unexpectedly, the simulation also proved accurate in another area, closely reflecting data about recidivism, or going back to jail after release. Results in the simulation almost exactly tracked California figures for the probability of returning to jail based on the number of times incarcerated, the inmate's age upon first being released from prison, the number of months since release, and by the length of the sentence.
"Using the California data showed us that what our model said would happen, did happen," Lum says. "It provides more evidence that incarceration may be infectious because it closely matches real data on a variety of levels."
Statistician David Banks, also at Duke, notes that the model adapted by Lum and colleagues is of a kind often used in weather forecasting, economics, and advertising, as well as in epidemiology. They find its use to study incarceration innovative, saying that more simulations like this one might provide useful data about the consequences of decisions that affect society. "It's a clean, smartly coded model that might give policymakers more information about consequences, like when they're looking at sentencing guidelines.”
Lum cautions that in the real world, other factors besides sentence duration likely contribute to differences in incarceration rates. Still, they note, the implications of the study aren't purely racial. "Under this model, small increases in sentence length led to large differences in the rate of incarceration regardless of race. That means harsher sentencing policy may have the unintended consequence of increasing crime, rather than reducing it.”
iOS 8 seems to be more packed with new features than any new iOS version in recent memory and it would be easy to overlook a lot of the ones that Apple didn't explicitly mention at WWDC last week. MacRumors has created a nice roundup of some of the more unheralded features that you may not have noticed that Apple has added to its newest mobile platform and they really give you a good idea of just how much iOS 8 represents a step forward from iOS 7.
In its piece, MacRumors highlights a new feature that will have your iPhone sent its last known location to Apple before its battery runs out, which could help you locate it if it's gone missing; Shazam integration that will help Siri identify songs that are playing for you; the ability to scan credit card numbers with your mobile Safari browser; a new feature that will let you hide images and videos from within the Photos app without deleting them from your albums; new Wi-Fi phone call options; and a new settings option that will let you know which apps are your device's biggest battery hogs.
MacRumors lists a bunch of other great features besides these six and you should check them out by clicking the source link below.
And if you want to learn about even more iOS 8 features, be sure to check out our first impressions of the platform after spending a week with it.
Modi Comes in From the Cold
In July 2013, a reporter asked Narendra Modi, the prime-ministerial candidate for India's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in April's general election, whether they would seek a visa to the United States after nine years of being denied entry. Modi smiled and replied, "I will make such a wonderful India that all Americans will stand in a queue to get a visa for India."
The United States, Modi seemed to suggest, should come to them — not the other way around. Turns out, that's exactly what happened. In November, the U.S. ambassador to India, Nancy J. Powell, reached out to Modi and proposed to meet them in India's capital, New Delhi, according to the Indian newspaper the Telegraph. But Modi insisted that wasn't quite good enough and that they wanted Powell to come to Gandhinagar, the capital of India's western state of Gujarat, which Modi has led since 2001. And so, on Feb. 13, Powell did — meeting with the self-described "Hindu nationalist" in their home in Gandhinagar. The message was clear: The United States is welcoming Modi in from the cold.
It is a radical turn of events. In February 2002, five months after Modi became chief minister of Gujarat, 59 Hindus died after Muslims attacked a train car in Gujarat. Retaliatory violence broke out, resulting in the deaths of over 1,200 people, most of them Muslim. Critics allege that Modi failed to protect innocent civilians and that the 2002 violence bore the markings of a pogrom. (Of India's more than 1.2 billion people, roughly 80 percent are Hindu; most of the rest are Muslims.) As a result of this criticism, as well as a campaign by an eclectic coalition including evangelical Christian, Jewish, and Indian activists, in 2005 Modi became the first person in U.S. history to be denied a visa based on the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, which stipulates that no foreign dignitary who has committed "violations of religious freedom" may enter the United States.
Joseph Grieboski, an activist and consultant who assisted with the campaign to deny Modi a visa, said that the language the U.S. government used to deny Modi a visa deserves attention. "The United States was clear not to implicate India or even Gujarat," they said. "It was that Modi themselves — and not India — failed to protect their citizens." (Disclosure: I also worked on the campaign to deny Modi a visa.)
In the nine years since, Modi has not applied for entry into the United States, nor has they met with any U.S. officials at the ambassadorial rank or higher — until their recent meeting with Powell. In that same period, Modi has won re-election three times and has overseen Gujarat's more than 10 percent average annual GDP growth, considerably higher that India's national average. They have also championed its business potential, including the popular biennial investor's summit Vibrant Gujarat. Big business in India favors Modi, especially in contrast to the current prime minister, Manmohan Singh, who is viewed as an ineffective and complacent flight attendant of India's economy.
Since winning their third term in December 2012, the 63-year-old Modi has emerged as one of the most popular, and polarizing, candidates India has ever seen — one who both wears the 2005 visa denial as a badge of honor yet also understands that U.S. recognition will help launder their image and advance their candidacy.
After news broke on Tuesday, Feb. 11, about the Powell-Modi meeting, many Indian publications began reporting that the meeting means Modi would now be granted a visa. However, U.S. State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki wasn't so quick to leap to that conclusion, saying, "This is not a reflection of any change." If Modi does become prime minister, they will be eligible for a special category of U.S. visas, known as A-1, granted to heads of state and government. State Department and congressional staffers said privately that Modi is almost guaranteed to receive this visa should they win.
But debating the semantics of "change" is beside the point — a change is coming. Modi is only a few months away from possibly becoming India's next leader. Their nearest challenger is Rahul Gandhi, an inexperienced 43-year-old politician from the Indian National Congress party whose father, grandmother, and great-grandfather all served as India's prime minister. And while a third party may split the vote, Modi appears to be leading in opinion polls.
In 2005, few in Washington imagined Modi's rise. "When the United States denied Modi a visa, we never thought Modi would be a front-runner," said a former Capitol Hill colleague who was closely involved in the Modi debate and who asked to speak anonymously. "We also thought the Indian government would see the visa denial as a slap to the BJP and Modi, not to India." Modi, the colleague added, was viewed as a "fringe figure." A former Senate aide was blunter: "We wanted to stop Modi's momentum."
This move was incredibly offensive to many Indians, who felt the United States had no right to pass judgment on what they viewed as an internal Indian affair. "To expect India not to be offended reveals how little India watchers in Washington really understand India," said a former Obama appointee, who asked to speak off the record. The United States continued to keep Modi at arm's length. They seemed to hope India would forget about the 2005 visa denial if the United States simply did not mention it. A former Department of Defense staffer said that when Singh came to Washington in July 2005, "We were on strict orders not to talk about Modi."
Today, with Modi just months away from possibly assuming the leadership of the world's largest democracy, not talking about them is not an option. So there's a practical matter for the thaw, but some argue that there's another factor at play: that the U.S. government under Barack Obama no longer prioritizes international religious freedom. Thomas Farr, the director of the Religious Freedom Project at Georgetown University, said these issues "have never been important in U.S. foreign policy, but they are less important under this administration than they have ever been."
But perhaps the most significant reason for the normalization of relations is that the legal case to tie them to the riots has fallen apart. In December 2013, a Gujarat court cleared Modi in the death of Ehsan Jafri, a Gujarati Muslim former member of Parliament who was killed in the riots. Many saw the case as the best chance to convict Modi for their role in the violence. "The resolution of the Jafri case seems to have been important in turning around the prospects for the [Powell-Modi] meeting," said Felice Gaer, a former commissioner of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom.
But religious intolerance remains a serious problem in India. In early February, Penguin India caved into pressure from Hindu activists and agreed to recall University of Chicago professor Wendy Doniger's 2009 book The Hindus: An Alternative History, which explains the role that traditionally marginalized groups, like women and untouchables, played in the Hindu tradition. The activists circulated a petition alleging that Doniger's work is the "approach of a woman hungry of sex" (sic). And it goes both ways: In 2012, Salman Rushdie pulled out of their scheduled appearance at the Jaipur Literature Festival after Muslim clerics in India objected to their attendance because of the depiction of Islam in their controversial 1988 book, The Satanic Verses.
This February, the Indian magazine Caravan ran a cover story on Hindu nationalist leader Swami Aseemanand, imprisoned for their role in a series of bombings that killed 119 people. The article claimed that the militant Hindu organization Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh sanctioned the attacks; the magazine has since received threatening phone calls, and the story's author, Leena Gita Reghunath, told the New York Times that they are no longer staying at home out of concerns for their safety.
These actions are, of course, not Modi's doing. But this is the political climate Modi represents — one that the United States naively hoped it could change by denying Modi a visa. The United States will have to scramble now to repair relations with India, but it may be too late. In many ways Modi now has what they always wanted — the United States on their turf.
Things were grim for the team at the end of Person of Interest's season four finale, but a revived Machine could be the key to helping them bounce back.
The CBS drama's cast and producers took part in a Comic-Con panel Saturday in Ballroom 6, where Michael Emerson (Finch) discussed what might be next for their creation, which was last seen on the brink of death.
"If [Finch] has to rebuild it, they may not do it the way they did it initially," Emerson said. "He may give it more of the freedom that Root (Amy Acker) was always demanding for it. And maybe the new Machine is a greater warrior than the old Machine was."
That said, Emerson made it clear that Finch and Root still won't be seeing eye-to-eye. "It's an interesting kind of grudging camaraderie that they have," the actor continued. "People that keep saving your life and stuff, you tend to warm to them. The question will be, can they prevail on them if they do indeed collaborate on the rebooting of the Machine. What [aspects] of their character will the Machine end up with?"
Jim Caviezel (Reese) said the team will be focused on "survival" in season four. "They've got to find a way to go on the offensive — attack Samaritan and hit them hard," the actor said.
Caviezel said that their favorite episode of season four was "Terra Incognito," which saw the return of Carter (Taraji P. Henson). They added about their character's season-five path: "[Reese] wants their teammates to depend on him. They also are vulnerable and needs to trust."
As for Shaw (Sarah Shahi), executive producer and writer Denise The left the door open for the fan-favorite character to return. "We have not seen the last of Shaw," The said, earning a loud cheer from the crowd.
Creator Jonathan Nolan said that the show's writers are approaching the upcoming truncated season, which premieres midseason, as though it could be the end of its run, even though CBS has not yet officially pulled the plug. "In terms of the reduced order, we're going to make 13 kickass episodes, drop the microphone, and if we're asked to pick it up again, we'll have more stories to tell," they said.
"We're very, very proud of the show and very excited with the show we've been making," Nolan continued. "If it's the last season, no one is going to be disappointed with the story that we tell."
A teaser for season five debuted during the panel, featuring a recorded message that Root left for any possible survivors of the previous season's bloody finale. "If you're hearing this, it's over," Root's voice says in the clip. "So let me tell you what we did to fight back."
Nolan also premiered a teaser trailer for their new sci-fi drama Westworld, which they co-created with Lisa Joy. Westworld premieres on HBO in 2016.

CTV London
A 24-year-old London man has been arrested for uttering threats after police say they threatened to shoot worshipers at the London Muslim Mosque. But in a release issued Monday, police say the incident was not motivated by hate.
Police say shortly before 2 p.m. Sunday, police were contacted by the mosque about a male who had threatened to shoot those inside the mosque.
Police directed worshippers at the mosque on Oxford Street West to lock doors and officers rushed to the scene.
The suspect has been charged with the following:
• Uttering threats of death or bodily harm
• Disturbing religious worship or certain meetings
• Failing to leave premise when directed
No one was hurt and no firearm was located.
In a statement released by the Mosque Sunday evening read:
"This afternoon, a young man entered the London Muslim Mosque during a prayer service, looking for food and assistance. After being provided with some food, they persisted in their asks. During a verbal confrontation the situation escalated and they made threats to those present. Staff and volunteers at the Mosque have been trained to call London Police in any circumstance where there is any suggestion of a security threat, and this protocol was followed."
The statement went on to say that the incident is not being treated as hate motivated and there this is no ongoing threat.
Numerous officers were dispatched to the mosque and police said occupants were able to keep the man outside until authorities arrived. The man was taken into custody without incident.
Police say there were about 50 people inside at the time of the alleged threats.
There was a large police presence - about 20 officers - at the mosque.
(Reuters) – Tesla said on Wednesday its mass-market Model 3 sedan was on track for volume production by September, encouraging investors who see the electric vehicle as the avenue to profitability for the young company.
But the carmaker's operations continued to burn through cash, and Chief Executive Elon Musk told analysts on a conference call that they may ask Wall Street for more.
“According to our financial plan, no capital needs to be raised for the Model 3 but we get very close to the edge,” Musk told investors on a conference call. Tesla plans an additional $2 billion to $2.5 billion in capital expenses before the Model 3 launch and has $3.4 billion cash on hand.
“We're considering a number of options but I think it probably makes sense to raise capital to reduce risk,” Musk said.
Musk said Chief Financial Officer Jason Wheeler, in their role for just over a year, would leave in April to work in public policy. They will be replaced by former Tesla CFO Deepak Ahuja, who was popular with investors.
Tesla, whose shares rose as much as 3 percent after the bell before settling up around 1.6 percent to $277.90, beat analysts' expectations for revenue. Its adjusted loss missed the consensus target calculated by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, although there was an unusually large range of estimates due to confusion over accounting for the acquisition of solar installer SolarCity.
Ivan Feinseth, director of research at Tigress Financial Partners, said Tesla “delivered the results the market has been expecting” that drove the stock from a year low of $167.84 last February to a year high of $287.39 last week.
By late spring or early summer, Feinseth estimated, Tesla will likely raise more money, noting that today's highs could make it sooner rather than later.
“You have to feed the ducks while they're quacking. If they came to the market now they would be well received,” they said.
Up to Wednesday's close, Tesla's stock had risen 53.9 percent in the last 12 months.
Many investors and suppliers have predicted Model 3 volume production would be delayed until 2018, but Tesla said it would produce over 5,000 Model 3s per week “at some point in the fourth quarter”, and 10,000 vehicles per week “at some point in 2018”.
Musk reiterated that Tesla still planned to deliver 500,000 cars in 2018 and 1 million vehicles by 2020.
Tesla did not give its usual full-year delivery estimate, but said it expected to deliver 47,000 to 50,000 Model S and Model X vehicles combined in the first half of 2017.
The company did not give a Model 3 target for this year and declined to update a previous disclosure made last April that 373,000 advance reservations had been taken for the car.
“We're still in great shape,” said Wheeler, when asked about early demand for the car.
The public might not see the final version of the Model 3 until as late as July, when limited production begins, Musk said.
Capital expenditures doubled in the fourth quarter to $521.6 million, as Tesla invests in its Fremont, California factory and its Gigafactory battery plant in Nevada.
Cash rose by $309 million to $3.39 billion, which includes funds raised from a share sale last year.
SolarCity installed more than 20 percent less solar in the quarter, as it focuses on profitability and cash over growth. Solar generation deployed fell to 201 MW in the fourth quarter from 253 MW a year earlier.
Tesla's net loss attributable to common shareholders narrowed to $121.3 million, or 78 cents per share, for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31 from $320.4 million, or $2.44 per share, a year earlier.
The adjusted loss of 69 cents per share compared with the analyst consensus of a 43-cent loss, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Revenue rose 88 percent to $2.28 billion, topping Wall Street's target of $2.18 billion.

Day Z will be going standalone by September, it has been revealed.
Project lead Dean 'Rocket' Hall has said that the popular Arma II mod will adopt a "Minecraft-like model", releasing as an alpha with free updates going forward.
"I would hope that we have something out by September," they told Digital Spy at PC gaming expo Rezzed.
"Kind of like Minecraft, the full release isn't necessarily the goal, the development itself that's the goal, and see where the idea goes, even if it reaches a full release or even if it does, I think we would probably want to expand on it."
Hall said that the pricing would be based on the "content we could put into it", adding that "it needs to be community supported and they need to be behind it".
"So the challenge there is to come up with enough features and content that people are happy to pay out €10, €15 for an additional product when they've already spent €20 on Arma II."
Hall stressed that the €10 to €15 figure was an estimate, and added that it would probably avoid going free-to-play.
"We probably could make a lot more money going free-to-play but it would destroy the experiment a bit."
Day Z is an online open-world zombie apocalypse simulator where players must scavenge for resources, surviving against the undead and amongst other players.
Released in April, the free mod has fuelled sales of 300,000 copies of Arma II since being released.

DETROIT - Nothing like a nice Easter egg hunt on a Sunday morning, right?
Some local squirrels decided that this joy couldn't be shared with an Oak Park family.
Pedro Kasperek set up an Easter egg hunt for their daughters in their Oak Park, Michigan yard. The plastic eggs were filled with jelly beans and little Reese's peanut butter cups.
Some of the eggs also contained small coins.
The squirrels, who have not been identified, had other plans for the hidden eggs.
The thieving animals found the eggs before Pedro's daughters, and ruined the egg hunt for the entire family.
Once the family noticed the crime taking place, Pedro's daughter Nora sprung into action, telling the squirrels, "Those are mine and sissy's eggs!"
The squirrels got to about 6 of the more than 30 eggs that were hidden. More egg casualties were later found in neighboring yards.
"My five year old and nine year old daughters did not seem to find it as hilarious and amusing as I did," said Pedro.
Pedro even described a moment when one of the squirrels seemed to brag about stealing the candy.
"The squirrel then climbed up a tree with the jelly bean in its mouth and it looked back at us and almost snickered."
Police have not released a description of the squirrels, but photos show that that one has a bushy tail and an impressive set of claws - perfect for tearing into plastic eggs.

Alfa Romeo introduced MiTo and Giulietta Quadrifoglio Verde models at the Geneva Motor Show in March. Now, both vehicles are set to make a debut at the Goodwood Festival of Speed at the end of June. In fact, the Giulietta is celebrating its 60th anniversary with this new QV version. The car is the perfect example of the brand's DNA. It is driven by the 1750 Turbo Petrol engine, which produces 240 hp (276 kW). The unit is coupled with a six-speed, twin dry clutch ALFA TCT transmission that contributes to the achievement of 6 seconds acceleration time for the sprint from 0 to 100 km/h. The top speed is electronically limited to 149mph.
The exterior of the car is distinguished by its lowered sports suspension and the legendary Quadrifoglio Verde emblem on the front wings. In addition, the car features dark-tinted rear window glass and the Anthracite finish on the mirror fairings, front grille, door handles and fog-light frames. At the back, there are two large exhaust tailpipes. Giulietta QV runs on 18-inch alloy wheels behind which one can see red four-piston Brembo brake callipers and large 320mm brake discs.
The ultimate expression of Italian style can be seen throughout the interior of the car. First of all, the designers added new wraparound sport seats, with a one-piece backrest and trimmed in leather and Alcantara. There is a brand-new steering wheel, trimmed in leather and accentuated by contrasting white stitching. Aluminium sports pedals, darkened interior headlining, special floor mats and a leather-trimmed gear lever and parking brake lever round-out the interior.
Giulietta Quadrifoglio Verde also includes 6.5-inch Uconnect touch-screen multimedia system. It comes with integrated satellite navigation with 3D bird's-eye view maps, progressive route guidance and 'One-Step Voice Entry Destination' function. The system also features DAB digital radio, Bluetooth connectivity with music streaming, Aux-in/USB port and voice command operation.
The other model which is carrying the Quadrifoglio Verde emblem is the Alfa Romeo MiTo. The car is powered by 1.4-litre MultiAir Turbo Petrol engine, which works in combination with the ALFA TCT transmission with steering-wheel paddle shifters. The unit produces 170 hp (125 kW) and up to 184lb/ft (250 Nm). ALFA TCT achieves 0 – 100 km/h acceleration time in 7.3 seconds. The top speed is limited to 136mph.
The new MiTo is also getting a new matte Magnesio Grey exterior body colour. It features enhanced styling attributes such as a burnished finish on exterior elements and the 18-inch alloy wheels, plus a rear spoiler, sports rear bumper and twin exhaust pipes. The interior is also revised. It includes new flat-bottom sports steering wheel and the new Uconnect five-inch touchscreen multimedia system with DAB and satellite navigation. And this comes as a standard.
The interior is also highlighted by the new flat-bottomed sports steering wheel, trimmed in leather with contrasting white stitching (just like Giulietta QV), and including paddle-shifters for the ALFA TCT transmission, as well as the new instruments with integrated Quadrifoglio Verde logo. The sports seats are trimmed in specific Quadrifoglio Verde fabric and finished with white-and-green stitching.

Big 12 expansion is dead, according to one of most powerful people in the conference.
Oklahoma athletic director Joe Castiglione told CBS Sports the concept of the league growing beyond 10 teams has ended "for the time being."
"There aren't any signs that we'll talk any more about expansion for a little while," Castiglione added. "We don't have a timeline on it."
The league announced in June that it would add a conference championship game, starting in 2017, while continuing to discuss expansion. However, it was clear that early June day in Irving, Texas, that expansion was no longer a front-burner issue.
"I think it's fair to say, I think, there were still some questions raised about whether adding members was going to be the right thing or if, in the end, it was going to be dilutive," Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby told reporters.
Big 12 presidents and chancellors will next meet on July 19; expansion is expected to be discussed.
"I don't know where we're at," Bowlsby told CBS Sports on Wednesday. "I know we haven't brought it to a conclusion. That conclusion may very well be status quo. Until we get together and the chancellors and presidents make it a decision, I consider it a pending issue."
Any decision on expansion is expected to be announced as unanimous.
Castiglione is one of two high-placed sources to tell CBS Sports Big 12 expansion is over. The other source, who preferred to remain anonymous, said expansion was dead regarding "those teams."
That's a reference to usual group of schools attached to the Big 12 that includes BYU, UCF, Cincinnati, Colorado State, UConn, Houston and Memphis.
"I stop short of speaking in absolutes about anything regarding conference realignment outside the contracts that exist," Castiglione said. "We've seen things happen that one could never imagine ... [but] I don't see any conversation in the near future."
The conference has researched expansion at least since June 2015 when Oklahoma president David Boren said the league was "psychologically disadvantaged" without more teams, a network and a conference championship game.
The Big 12 dismissed the idea of a "linear network," according to Bowlsby at last month's meetings. Shortly before the championship game announcement, Boren said the league was "in a position of strength."
Is there no safe stash for drugs these days?
The tan Hyundai was reportedly pulled over for not having working brake lights.
When the deputy then asked the driver, Alexis Ann Clancey, 20, along their three passengers, if there were any weapons, drugs or contraband inside the car or on their person, they all said 'no' and gave consent to search, according to a news release from the Charlotte County Sheriff's Office.
They apparently fibbed.
Backup units that had arrived to search the car then asked one of the passengers, Bradley Jordon Greus, 23, if they had anything hidden in their prosthetic leg. Greus 'fessed up and told them they had a small bag of coke in it and handed it over to a deputy, the report stated.
Deputies also reportedly found a plastic baggie that contained Morphine and Hydromorphone pills hidden inside 22-year-old Teal Lee Thomson's bra.
Clancy, the driver, allegedly admitted to having a Hydromorphine pill in their wallet left on the driver's seat. While searching Donald Carlo Acquarelli, 25, another passenger, Clancey jumped inside the car, grabbed their wallet, quickly pulled out a pill and swallowed it before deputies could stop her, according to the report.
Deputies also discovered five hypodermic needles containing a clear liquid in the car that tested positive for Opiates, which Clancey said were hers, the report stated.
Clancey then allegedly told deputies they had another hypodermic needle - hidden in their butt, which they removed from their backside.
Ouch!
All four were arrested and hauled off to the slammer.

Besides, The Great Khali made their Smackdown return and Hacksaw Jim Duggan too chipped in with an one-off match. Here are the top 10 talking points of WWE Smackdown 3/2/2012.
1. Smackdown Elimination Chamber match set:
Much like this week's Raw, Smackdown too kicked off with its General Manager Teddy Long revealing the six participants of the Elimination Chamber match for the World Heavyweight Championship. This match will most likely be the show-stealer since Bryan's title reign is poised to end at this match.
2. Mark Henry Suspended:
Mark Henry got suspended indefinitely for putting their hands on Teddy Long. This was an innovative way to keep Mark out of action allowing them to recuperate and return as and when they think its best for them without ruining the momentum that they have got until now with their monster heel character.
3. Sheamus‘ Rumble ramifications:
For the second consecutive year, a Smackdown superstar has won the Royal Rumble. While it was Alberto Del Rio in 2011, Sheamus turned out to the winner in 2012. This Friday night featured the 2012 Royal Rumble winner Sheamus, revealing us the details about their decision on their preferred title match at Wrestlemania. Sheamus took a familiar way out by categorically stating that they would make their decision after Elimination Chamber. My guess is that they would go for the World Heavyweight Championship. But the question is, what do they do until Elimination Chamber?  They are not in the Smackdown Elimination Chamber match and hence needs a short feud with someone, so that they remain hot with the crowd till Elimination chamber.
4. Cody Rhodes brags about their Royal Rumble accomplishments:

Cody had already revealed their intentions of doing a Ultimate Warrior by holding two championships at the same time. They emphasized on it this week as they talked about their intentions of winning the Smackdown Elimination Chamber match. Rhodes did a good job of getting themselves heard. They made a valid point of cleaning up the ring which lead to Sheamus' victory. They and Sheamus put on a good match with a lot of back and forth action. However, much like The Miz on Raw, yet another Royal Rumble beneficiary in Cody Rhodes, got buried in the same weeks. Sheamus used a new finishing move which was similar to the swinging side-slam, to get the victory.
5. The Great Khali is back:
The Great Khali made their Smackdown comeback by making the save for South African Justin Gabriel who was the victim of a three pronged attack by Cody, Hunico and Camacho. Khali, who came back as a surprise entrant at the Royal Rumble after a brief hiatus, was immediately put in the limelight. They were also announced as the replacement for Mark Henry in the Smackdown Elimination chamber match. They could be in line for a major push in the near future.
6. Divas of doom goes kaboom:
The rift between Natalya and Beth Phoenix widened after Beth tagged themselves in to get the pinfall over Aksana in tag-match. While Natalya was trying to lock Aksana in the sharpshooter, Tamina chipped in by making the save. I didn't care a lot about this match. I watched it just to check out if Kharma comes out or not. They did not do so. Hope they come back soon and takes out all the trash in the WWE divas division.
7. Big Show‘s WMD gets thwarted by AJ:
In a segment that started with Michael Cole praising Daniel Bryan on their victory in the Triple threat Steel Cage match at Royal Rumble, Big Show made their presence felt and ultimately the segment ended with Daniel Bryan taking a cowardly escape route by using AJ as their shield.
8. Team Santin”ooooooo”:
Once again, Santino Marella provided the fun quotient throughout the show on different occasions. They with Hacksaw Jim Duggan formed team Santin'oooo' and took on the Tag Champs Epico and Primo. Jim Duggan, at their ripe age, seems to be pretty agile and athletic. But unfortunately, this match ended on a losing note for them as the tag-team champions knocked them over, pretty soon.
9. No-disqualification match between Randy Orton and Wade Barrett:
In a no-disqualification match that exceeded expectations, Randy Orton defeated Wade Barrett, fair and square. Everything about this match was perfect. It was aggressive, fast paced and kept the crowd on its feet throughout which is the biggest testimony to any good match. While this may or may not be the end of this long-running feud, victory in this match has enabled Randy Orton to get their aura of invincibility back which had been lacking for the last few weeks.
10. Daniel Bryan's got no Ophidiophobia:
Immediately after the end of the main event, we heard Teddy Long make the announcement of a blockbuster match next week featuring Daniel Bryan vs Randy Orton. On hearing this Bryan went to the ring and showed us that he's got no fear about the Viper and they are ready for the match next week. A good finish to the show to keep the viewers interested until next week.
Hard Rock Stadium Sets a New Benchmark
Part 3 in the Tech Focus series, Digital Audio Networking
Networked audio in sports venues has seemed a fast-track proposition in recent years, but the reality is that digital venue sound remains largely segregated from a venue's network infrastructure. That's mainly a function of the entrenched nature of IT culture, which, to some extent, continues to view networked audio as a bit of a digital interloper.
Renamed Hard Rock Stadium last August, the Miami Dolphins' home looks to create a template for venue sound on a converged network. A system designed and implemented jointly by the Dolphins' IT and broadcast team, led by Tery Howard, and A/V systems integrator Diversified, is what Pete O'Neil, director, engineering, Diversified, calls “a truly” converged network. “We built the network infrastructure [for audio] off of the core switch infrastructure that lives in the stadium's data center. That's unique in sports venues at this point in time.”
The stadium hosts a 20-GB fully redundant fiber-linked network back to the cores, providing enough bandwidth to accommodate all audio requirements, including bowl sound and paging and emergency-notification systems, on separate channels but on the same broadband network infrastructure as other data streams, such as the venue's IPTV and point-of-sale systems.
“It's a paradigm shift in that the audio is tied to the data center, along with the other venue networks, instead of on a separate network infrastructure,” O'Neil explains. “And it's end to end: when the network fiber comes into an amplifier–rack-room location, it comes to the switches as digital, and the signal is then sent the last few feet to the amps over IP, not as analog over copper.”
The article continues
Because of that kind of emergent status, some IT managers prefer to keep audio segregated on their networks. O'Neil says that the Dolphins' IT staff, headed by Howard and Director of Broadcast Operations Tomas Ruiz, instead sought to integrate audio on an equal basis with the rest of the stadium's network traffic.
It required some extra effort. O'Neil notes that Cisco's 3850 switch, which was introduced in 2015, as planning for the network got under way, turned out to have latency issues with audio, partly because of the enormous amount of other data traffic on the converged network. The IT team's strong relationship with Cisco resulted in development of a firmware update that specifically addressed that issue. In fact, says O'Neil, the update is nicknamed “Miami.”
“They had the clout with Cisco to get that addressed,” they observe. “That was critical considering how [deeply] audio was going to be integrated into this network.”
The Hard Rock Stadium has significant benefits to show for the chances the team took. O'Neil cites flexibility (any input source can be added to the network at any point via a switch), signal quality (audio remains digital until the output stage of the amplifiers, just before the speakers, without any artifact- or latency-inducing conversions), scalability (the sound system can be expanded with the addition of new endpoints, the only limit being the network's available bandwidth), and system-wide redundancy, which increases reliability.
What's the best way to squash your competition? Buy them out. Applegate Farms, LLC really has no good reason to sell out to a GMO-supporting mega-corporation. They've been worth millions for years, and have gained success in the organic food industry like few others. But money talks, and the organic meat seller is in negotiations with industrial food giant Hormel Foods Corp. to become part of its conglomerate.
The sell-out is being described by Reuters, and is reportedly worth between $600 million and $1 billion, but both parties declined to comment since the matter is confidential.
Hormel swallowing up Applegate Farms isn't the only pro-GMO company using cut-throat tactics and big money to get rid of competition. The sale of Applegate Farms comes amid a slew of merger activity for meat companies.
Recent high-profile deals also include:
Hershey Co's acquisition of jerky company Krave
Post Holdings Inc's $2.5 billion acquisition of food processing company Michael Foods
Tyson Foods Inc's $8.6 billion acquisition of packaged meats producer Hillshire Brands
If you want organic chicken tenders, non-GMO sausages, lunch meats, or other healthier meat choices, you won't find them in the Applegate Farms brand much longer.
Hormel is among companies like Monsanto, ConAgra, Kellogg, Smuckers, Coca-Cola, and Pepsi-Co who are trying to block your right to know what is in your food. They contributed heavily through the Grocery Manufacturer's Association (GMA) to defeat Prop 37 in California which would have given people the right to know if genetically modified ingredients were in food.
This $1.2 trillion dollar industry can easily swallow even successful million-dollar companies like Applegate Farms – that is until we stop buying their products. Who really knows what is in SPAM, one of Hormel's best-selling products? Hormel is also a notorious union buster and treat the animals used for their products poorly.

This past Saturday morning at 4:30AM, I woke up to the sound of Baby Key crying. Normally, this would be a non-issue in my house, as that is their normal waking time, but this day was different. My alarm was not scheduled to go off until 5:15AM and Saturday, of all days, was a day that I would need every single second of extra sleep.
My team, Girls On The Geaux, was preparing to set out on a 24-hour ultramarathon relay adventure called the Rouge-Orleans! Our wave started at 8:00AM, but we had everyone picked up and at the start of the race by 7:00AM. Team captains had to be there an hour early in order to have our safety gear (headlamps, flashlights, safety vests, etc.) checked by the race director. After we got all checked in, we spent the next hour decorating our van. On Saturday morning, the temperature was about 40 degrees and there was pretty heavy wind. Oh, if we had only known what was to come!
Leg 1 of the 8:00AM wave got started promptly with a firing of the canon from the USS Kidd . The race website had mentioned this, but somehow I had forgotten. When it went off, I swear I almost peed my pants. Good thing I didn't though…that would have been a looooooong day in pee-pants. 😀
Our 6-person relay team went like this…Kristyn –> Erin –> Heather –> Lindsey –> Katie –> Jenn. God bless my sweet friend Jenn for being the anchor leg. Seriously, that was some tough mileage.
Legs 1 – 6 (Mileage: 27.45 miles)
Time: 8:00AM Saturday – 1:12PM Saturday
As expected, this was the happiest round for us. As soon as the race got started, the fun began. The sun was out and it was shaping up to be a gorgeous day! Though still cold and windy, the weather was tolerable because there was not a cloud in the sky and we were running on the scenic Mississippi River Levee. At this point, all of us were still bouncing off the walls and excited to be there! At each exchange, we chatted with other runners, crews, and teams…discussing training, strategy, and, of course, food.
Highlights of Round 1: Our van got gnomed by Team Rolling with My Gnomies! They gave us the cutest antenna topper ever! We started tracking all of the other teams on Twitter by using the #RO12 hashtag! Watching their progress was really fun and a great interactive way to stay connected to other teams.
As we moved into the second half of the day, we were still having a ball! Once we figured out how much time we really needed at each exchange, we fell into a comfortable groove of getting to the next exchange, tagging our runner, and refueling with our Nuun and sandwiches. The temperatures crept up in the early part of the afternoon, and at one point we were even able to peel off some layers! After my leg of this round was done, I distinctly remember saying, “Man, I got hot out there.” (That would be the last time I would say that.) In this round, Erin had their longest run at 7.3 miles. On this leg, they passed the Carville Leper Colony …which was the site of the only hospital that treated leprosy in the United States. CRA-ZAY! They also passed a creepy cemetery and I am disappointed to report that they saw no ghosts. Bummer! Add to that the fact that on this leg the road diverts far away from the levee so we couldn't even watch them run. Oh, and add to THAT the fact that they got chased by dogs about 0.6 miles into their leg, causing them to tire much too early in their run. Pushing the tiredness and overall creepiness of this leg aside, Erin finished like a champ! On Jenn's run, the last leg of this round, the sun started going down and we had to break out the safety gear! C'mon, who doesn't love a headlamp! We all posted good times on Round 2 and going into Round 3, we were about 30 minutes ahead of our anticipated pace.
Highlights of Round 2: We got to meet the awesome crew for Meredith Dolhare. Seriously, if you have a chance, check out their website and how badass they are! Also on these legs, we encountered lots of wildlife on the levee. Heather was fully prepared to handle any livestock they encountered by making sure they ran with their 1 million volt Tazer. No really, they did. That girl wasn't messin' around! At one of the exchanges, we got to meet the super fly girls from Team Hippie and A Ginger! Very cool girls! Oh, and Kristyn ran their fastest 2 miles ever!!
Well, this is where all the fun stuff sort of ends. *sigh* It was on round 3 that things went from good to bad. As nightfall settled in, the temperatures quickly dropped from the 40's down into the low 20's. Considering the 20mph winds up on the levee, the “real feel” temperature was in the upper teens. In all honesty, it was awful. I mean, really, really terrible. Let's put it this way, since I moved back to Louisiana in December 2010, this was the coldest overnight low it had been since then.Once the sun went down, our plan was to run and then when your leg was done, you hop on the bike and pace the next runner. During daylight hours, running on the levee is quiet and relaxing. At night, when you can't see anyone in front of your or behind you, the dark can be extremely disorienting…making every tenth of a mile feel like half a mile. We planned to have someone on the bike to assist the runner to help keep the runner motivated and moving along. This was a really, really bad idea. Going from running to riding really did a number on our legs. While running, we were able to keep our bodies warm. However, getting on the bike allowed the cold to sink deep into our bodies. Riding at the runner's pace was not fast enough to keep the rider warm. By the time each of us got back in the van from our running leg, we were exhausted. It took each of us about an hour and a half to warm back up…which meant that right as we were warming up, it was almost time to get back out there again. These Louisiana and Mississippi girls were NOT built to handle these temperatures. Give me 100 degree weather with 90% humidity over cold and windy any day!On a personal note, this is the leg where my cold-weather asthma really took a toll on me. Sadly, I forgot my inhaler. I wheezed and coughed the entire leg. When it was my turn to hand off to Jenn, I had an extremely hard time getting going on the bike. The helmet was too small and the bike seat was too high. My fingers were numb up to the second knuckle so adjusting both proved to be nearly impossible. I ran down the levee to the van and begged my teammates to loosen the helmet and help me lower the seat. Of course, my girls were there for me. However, by the time I finally got going on the van, Jenn had already started running and was well into their leg. I had to pedal overtime in order to catch up with them By the time I got to her, I realized that hypothermia/asthma attack was taking over. When I caught up to them I wanted to ask them how many more miles they had to go before we could get back to the van. In my head, this questions was coming out of my mouth. In reality, I couldn't the lower half of my face. My lips were literally freezing and my tongue felt thick and solid. The only words I could really get out were “mileage” and “I need help.” When Jenn saw what bad shape I was in, we stopped. I got off the bike and pushed my face into my shoulder, desperately trying to breath warmer, humid air. Jenn, seeing how bad off I was, said they would call the van to come and get me. I refused to leave my friend out there, on the levee, in the middle of the night. Thankfully, we were only about a 1.5 miles to the end of the leg. The whole situation was so scary and I have never felt anything like that before. I was seriously happy to see the van at the next exchange.
Lowlights of Round 3: Cold temperatures + Fatigue = VERY quiet Girls On The Geaux van. We tried our best to stay positive despite the cold, but quite frankly, there were A LOT of curse words thrown around the van during these miles. The question, “Wait, WHY did we want to do this again?” was said A LOT. Unfortunately, all the good pacing we had earlier in the day caught up to us. The nighttime cold meant we moved slower and breathed harder. It was rough.
Round 4 was DIRTY. Team Girls On The Geaux was cold and tired and we fought for every single mile. The van stayed pretty quiet during these hours in hopes of giving some of us a chance to catch at least a few winks.Lowlights of Round 4: Unable to find the port-a-potties in the dark, several members of the team may or may not have bare-butted it and peed right on the side of the levee. Just sayin'. Around 3:30AM, we had to make an executive decision. The cold was really doing a number on us and we felt that it was almost dangerous for us to be out there. We were having such a hard time warming up and knew that we needed a break. Although it was our goal to finish in 25 hours, we made the decision to stop and rest for an hour. We had to. It was either rest and let everyone warm up, or risk not finishing at all. We had come to far not to cross that finish line, so rest we did. I wish we would not have had to but it was the smart thing for us to do.
Legs 25 – 30 (Mileage: 24.19 miles)
Time: 5:30AM Sunday – 10:55AM Sunday
Round 5 brought better spirits to the van! As the sun came up, we all perked up a little, but it would be the understatement of the century to just say that we were ready to be done. We were all so close to the finish line and we were fighting tooth and nail to get there. This round brought lots of tears and a lot of walking. I am so proud of each of my teammates for getting back out there and fighting through to the end. Jenn's IT band started to act up but they pushed through their entire last leg. The race ended in Audobon Park and as soon as we saw that big, blue inflatable finish line, we knew victory was ours.
I have LOTS of advice about what worked for our team, what did not work for our team, what we brought and did not need, items we wished we had, etc. That is an entire post in itself. I will get to all that this weekend, so be on the lookout!
Again, a massive huge epic THANK YOU to all of our sponsors. Without you, we would not have gotten this far.
To 110% Play Harder,
After Round 3 of running, there is nothing that felt better than pulling on my perfectly snug calf sleeves. Not only did they provide an extra layer of warmth while out on my run, but they also helped keep my calves feeling fresh and energized. I'm proud to say that after the event, I did not experience one iota of calf soreness! SUCCESS!
To Brooks Running,
The Cascadia 7s were the most perfect shoe for running this terrain. Normally I wear a more minimal shoe, but on the rocks and uneven levee, the Cascadias provided the ideal amount of support and cushion. The Cascadias are an amazing shoe!

To GO Sport ID,
Thank you for keeping us safe. I had no idea how scary it would be up on that levee, out in the middle of nowhere, all alone. Our ID bands gave us the peace of mind to know that should anything happen to us, that our loved ones would be able to notified quickly.
To Nuun,
Thank you for keeping Team Girls On The Geaux hydrated. With the freezing temperatures, it was often hard to convince ourselves to keep hydrating but the tasty fizziness of Nuun made drinking freezing cold water much more palatable. By the end of the race, several teams were calling us the Nuun Girls!
To Running Skirts,
Thank you for the awesome purple plaid running skirts! When undertaking an adventure such as this, it is always easier when you are doing it in STYLE! We tried our best to put a running skirt on our van, which we appropriately named Rapunzel! The running skirt was super comfortable and the fabric, design, and fit are excellent. Thank you!
To Drink Chia!,
Thank you for the awesome chia drinks! After a couple of the legs, I was not really interested in eating heavy food, but the chia drinks helped give me much-needed calories and nutrition without making me feel too weighed down. The texture took a little getting used to, but the drinks were delicious!
To Barber & Mann, 1st Choice Real Estate, and Good Shepherd Christian Academy,
Thank you so much for your financial support of Team Girls On The Geaux. With your contributions, Team Girls On The Geaux was able to contribute $550 to the Girls On The Run of Greater Baton Rouge. GOTR provides incredible programs to the girls in our communities and we appreciate you helping us help them!
To PROBAR,
Thank you so much for all of the bars! The Old School PB&J is the best and was super tasty around 2:30AM! We were able to share with some of the runners in other vans and every said how delicious they were! Thank you for keeping our tummies full and our bodies fueled!
To Icelandic Glacial,
Thank you for all the water!! Runners could not do what we do without water and Icelandic Glacial tastes awesome! After leg 10, my teammate Lindsey took a swig and looked at me and said, “Man, this is REALLY good water!” It made me smile!
To Enterprise,
Thank you for the GIGANTIC Econoline van! It was massive and FANTASTIC! Even though we overpacked big time, we still had plenty enough room for all of us, our food, water, and medical gear. We even had enough room left on the seats to stretch out our legs and nap a little between legs. And, surprisingly, it was really great on gas too! Way better than I expected!
To Giraphic Prints,
Thank you for the most awesome team tech shirts! Having matching shirts made us feel like a real team and we were so proud to be able to display all of our sponsors on it! You did a great job!!
To my fellow Girls On The Geaux,
Thank you for this incredible experience. We laughed, we cried, we danced, and we ran. Boy, oh boy, did we run! We shared stories, we helped each other, we got aggravated with each other, and we hugged. I could not have imagined tackling this adventure with a better group of girls. We only barely knew each other when this trip began, but I feel like we are running buddies for life! Who knows what fun things might bring Team Girls On The Geaux later this year and into 2013!! Keep on running, ladies!

Innocent people interrogated for years on slimmest pretextsChildren, elderly and mentally ill among those wrongfully held172 prisoners remain, some with no prospect of trial or release
More than 700 leaked secret files on the Guantánamo detainees lay bare the inner workings of America's controversial prison camp in Cuba.
The US military dossiers, obtained by the New York Times and the Guardian, reveal how, alongside the so-called "worst of the worst", many prisoners were flown to the Guantánamo cages and held captive for years on the flimsiest grounds, or on the basis of lurid confessions extracted by maltreatment.
The 759 Guantánamo files, classified "secret", cover almost every inmate since the camp was opened in 2002. More than two years after President Obama ordered the closure of the prison, 172 are still held there.
The files depict a system often focused less on containing dangerous terrorists or enemy fighters, than on extracting intelligence. Among inmates who proved harmless were an 89-year-old Afghan villager, suffering from senile dementia, and a 14-year-old boy who had been an innocent kidnap victim.
The old man was transported to Cuba to interrogate them about "suspicious phone numbers" found in their compound. The 14-year-old was shipped out merely because of "his possible knowledge of Taliban...local leaders"
The documents also reveal:
• US authorities listed the main Pakistani intelligence service, the Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate (ISI), as a terrorist organisation alongside groups such as al-Qaida, Hamas, Hezbollah and Iranian intelligence.
Interrogators were told to regard links to any of these as an indication of terrorist or insurgent activity.
• Almost 100 of the inmates who passed through Guantánamo are listed by their captors as having had depressive or psychotic illnesses. Many went on hunger strike or attempted suicide.
• A number of British nationals and residents were held for years even though US authorities knew they were not Taliban or al-Qaida members. One Briton, Jamal al-Harith, was rendered to Guantánamo simply because they had been held in a Taliban prison and was thought to have knowledge of their interrogation techniques. The US military tried to hang on to another Briton, Binyam Mohamed, even after charges had been dropped and evidence emerged they had been tortured.
• US authorities relied heavily on information obtained from a small number of detainees under torture. They continued to maintain this testimony was reliable even after admitting that the prisoners who provided it had been mistreated.
The files also show that a large number of the detainees who have left Guantanamo were designated "high risk" by the camp authorities before their release or transfer to other countries.
The leaked files include guidance for US interrogators on how to decide whether to hold or release detainees, and how to spot al-Qaida cover stories. One warns interrogators: "Travel to Afghanistan for any reason after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 is likely a total fabrication with the true intentions being to support Usama Bin Laden through direct hostilities against the US forces."
Another 17-page file, titled "GTMO matrix of threat indicators for enemy combatants", advises interrogators to look out for signs of terrorist activity ranging from links to a number of mosques around the world, including two in London, to ownership of a particular model of Casio watch.
"The Casio was known to be given to the students at al-Qaida bombmaking training courses in Afghanistan," it states.
The inclusion of association with the ISI as a "threat indicator" in this document is likely to pour fuel on the flames of Washington's already strained relationship with its key regional ally.A number of the detainee files also contain references, apparently based on intelligence reporting, to the ISI supporting, co-ordinating and protecting insurgents fighting coalition forces in Afghanistan, or even assisting al-Qaida.
Obama's inability to shut Guantánamo has been one of the White House's most internationally embarrassing policy failures. The files offer an insight into why the administration has been unable to transfer many of the 172 existing prisoners from the island prison where they remain outside the protection of the US courts or the prisoner-of-war provisions of the Geneva conventions.
The range of those still held captive includes detainees who have been admittedly tortured so badly they can never be successfully tried, informers who must be protected from reprisals, and a group of Chinese Muslims from the Uighur minority who have nowhere to go.
One of those officially admitted to have been so maltreated that it amounted to torture is prisoner No 63, Maad al-Qahtani. They were captured more than nine years ago, fleeing from the site of Osama bin Laden's last stand in the mountain caves of Tora Bora in 2001. The report says Qahtani, allegedly one of the "Dirty 30" who were Bin Laden's bodyguards, must not be released: "HIGH risk, as they are likely to pose a threat to the US, its interests and allies." The report's military authors admit their admissions were obtained by what they call "harsh interrogation techniques in the early stages of detention". But otherwise the files make little mention of the widely-condemned techniques that were employed to obtain "intelligence" and "confessions" from detainees such as waterboarding, sleep deprivation and prolonged exposure to cold and loud music.
The files also detail how many innocents or marginal figures swept up by the Guantánamo dragnet because US forces thought they might be of some intelligence value.
One man was transferred to the facility "because they were a mullah, who led prayers at Manu mosque in Kandahar province, Afghanistan … which placed them in a position to have special knowledge of the Taliban". US authorities eventually released them after more than a year's captivity, deciding they had no intelligence value.
Another prisoner was shipped to the base "because of their general knowledge of activities in the areas of Khowst and Kabul based as a result of their frequent travels through the region as a taxi driver".
The files also reveal that an al-Jazeera journalist was held at Guantánamo for six years, partly in order to be interrogated about the Arabic news network.
Their dossier states that one of the reasons was "to provide information on … the al-Jazeera news network's training programme, telecommunications equipment, and newsgathering operations in Chechnya, Kosovo and Afghanistan, including the network's acquisition of a video of UBL [Osama bin Laden] and a subsequent interview with UBL".
The Guantánamo files are among hundreds of thousands of documents US soldier Bradley Manning is accused of having turned over to the WikiLeaks website more than a year ago.
The documents were obtained by the New York Times and shared with the Guardian and National Public Radio, which is publishing extracts, having redacted information which might identify informants.
A Pentagon spokesperson said: "Naturally we would prefer that no legitimately classified information be released into the public domain, as by definition it can be expected to cause damage to US national security. The situation with the Guantánamo detention facility is exceptionally complex and releasing any records will further complicate ongoing actions."
Later, US officials called the publication of the Guantánamo files "unfortunate" saying that they had been "obtained illegally by WikiLeaks". The Pentagon press secretary, Geoff Morrell, said: "These documents contain classified information about current and former GTMO detainees, and we strongly condemn the leaking of this sensitive information."
Morrell said that the Guantánamo Review Task Force, established in January 2009 by the Obama administration, considered the leaked files during its review of detainee information. They said: "In some cases, the Task Force came to the same conclusions as the DABs [files]. In other instances the Review Task Force came to different conclusions, based on updated or other available information.
"The assessments of the Guantánamo Review Task Force have not been compromised to Wikileaks. Thus, any given DAB illegally obtained and released by Wikileaks may or may not represent the current view of a given detainee," they added.
Albany, N.Y. — The state has overturned its longstanding policy requiring transgender New Yorkers to provide proof of gender reassignment surgery — a sex change — to switch the male or female designation on their birth certificates, effective May 23, 2014.
Though medical, financial and personal reasons often dissuade people from seeking sex-change operations, the procedure was previously necessary for those wishing to change the gender marker on their birth certificate. While that's no longer the case, individuals looking to amend their birth certificates to reflect personal gender identity must still obtain a medical provider's affidavit verifying that they are receiving “appropriate clinical treatment.”
Here are 6 questions about recent changes to New York State's policy for switching genders on birth certificates. Click on the question to find your answer.
1 – How do I change the gender on my birth certificate?
2 – What does “appropriate clinical treatment” mean? What does transgender mean?
3 – What if I was born in New York City?
4 – What have LGBTQAA organizations said about the shift?
5 – What other policy changes are transgender rights advocates promoting?
6 – Have other states passed similar laws? What about at the federal level?
1 ­– How do I change the gender on my birth certificate?
Applications to amend birth certificates must be submitted to the state Department of Health Vital Records section. Only people aged 18 or older may submit applications.
While the DOH website offers extensive information about obtaining a copy of a birth certificate, there is not a page dedicated to making corrections. The Vital Records department can be reached by telephone toll-free at 855-322-1022 or by email at vr@health.state.ny.us.
2 ­– What does “appropriate clinical treatment” mean? What does transgender mean?
Transgender New Yorkers seeking the documentation change must provide a notarized affidavit from a medical practitioner verifying that they are receiving treatment for gender dysphoria. Details such as specific treatments need not be included.
There are regular debates about the ‘right' way to talk about topics such as gender identity and sexual orientation. However, for legal purposes, the American Psychiatric Association guidelines and definitions are typically used.
According to the APA, transgender is “an umbrella term for persons whose gender identity , gender expression or behavior does not conform to that typically associated with the sex to which they were assigned at birth.”
The APA defines transsexual as people whose gender identity differs from their assigned sex. Gender dysphoria, previously called gender identity disorder, is defined by the as “people whose gender at birth is contrary to the one they identify with,” and was revised for the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, in an effort to reduce stigma and make it clear that gender nonconformity is not a mental disorder. In a statement, the APA said, “The critical element of gender dysphoria is the presence of clinically significant distress associated with the condition.”
3 ­– What if I was born in New York City?
Because the Big Apple issues its own birth certificates, the state policy shift does not apply to those born in NYC. However, the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund has filed a lawsuit against New York City and its Department of Health and Mental Hygiene in an effort to force policy change.
Following the state's recent policy revision, the city health department said it's considering a similar revision. The department said to the AP, “We are considering a similar change through the Board of Health, and look forward to discussing this important issue with members of the transgender community soon.”
4 ­– What have LGBTQAA organizations said about the shift?
Groups such as the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund, Empire State Pride Agenda and other LGBT activists have praised the change, which they hope will help to alleviate harassment and discrimination caused by inconsistency between identities and documentation, or even between multiple pieces of documentation.
“Having accurate documentation is necessary to people's lives, from employment to school to housing,” Dru Levasseur, transgender rights project director at Lambda Legal, told the AP. “These policy changes will have a real impact.”
Michael Silverman, executive director of the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund, the organization that has filed the lawsuit to encourage NYC to amend its policy, told Time, “A birth certificate is a fundamental form of identification. This will ensure that transgender people can obtain accurate birth certificates that reflect who they are.”
The new policy now aligns with the state's Department of Motor Vehicles policy. Since 1987, the New York's DMV has allowed residents to change gender identification on driver's licenses without providing proof of a sex-change surgery.

5 ­– What other policy changes are transgender rights advocates promoting?
Many have called for transgender health care improvements in the state, including expansion of Medicaid to cover hormone treatment and gender reassignment surgery.
“If the federal government can treat transgender people fairly through Medicare, then certainly New York can do the same in Medicaid,” Michael Silverman of the Transgender Legal Defense & Education Fund, told the New York Times for an editorial about transgender rights and health, published June 9, 2014.
The state deputy secretary for civil rights, Alphonso David, released a statement in response to the new policy. David said, “Under Governor Cuomo's leadership, New York is reclaiming its rightful place as the progressive capital of the nation and made significant progress to advance the rights of all New Yorkers, including members of the transgender community. Much work remains, and this administration is committed to promoting laws and policies that are fair and just for all.”
6 ­– Have other states passed similar laws? What about at the federal level?
California, Oregon, Washington and Vermont, as well as in the District of Columbia, have adopted policies similar to New York's new birth certificate guidelines.
Some states have moved in the opposite direction. Earlier this year, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie vetoed a proposal to allow people who have undergone “clinically appropriate treatment for the purpose of gender transition, based on contemporary medical standards, or that the person has an intersex condition” to apply for an amended birth certificate.
Transgender rights activists also won a recent victory at the federal level. In May 2014, an appeals board from the Health and Human Services Department expanded Medicare coverage to sex-reassignment surgery. The procedure was previously excluded from coverage because of a Medicare policy that was established in 1981. While Medicare only covers Americans who are 65 and older, its policies often influence insurance companies, so the decision is expected to have a greater impact over time.
Policies similar to New York's new rules have also been adopted by federal agencies such as the Social Security Administration and the U.S. Department of State. In 2010, the State Department stopped requiring proof of surgery to change gender on passports. Lambda Legal has published state-by-state guidelines for changing birth certificates gender designations, as well as other resources for amending documents.
California is dumping a trillion gallons of fresh Water in the ocean. Only liberals would declare a water shortage disaster after spending years dumping good, fresh water into the ocean to protect a non-endangered bait fish.
For years now, the southern 1/3 of the beautiful San Joaquin Valley's farmland has been turned into a “man-made” dust bowl.
The water is being allowed to just run off the mountains, through the river system, through the delta, and out into the ocean. The water is being reserved for the little Delta Smelt, a three inch bait fish, that is not endangered species list.
Now, California is in the midst of a drought. As the Governor institutes water emergency rules, they just let all that water just keep pouring into the ocean. Unbelievable!
The I-5 San Joaquin Valley corridor is marked with signs begging Nancy Pelosi to turn the water on. Sean Hannity hosted a full show from Hanford, CA to highlight the problem. Phone calls and letters from all over the country have been sent to try to fix this situation.
Comedian Paul Rodriguez, co-chair of Latino Water Coalition, crosses the state working to remove the environmental protection on the Delta smelt.
Representative Devin Nunes, (CA) describes the situation in the WSJ back in 2009.
Today the San Joaquin Valley is being transformed into a dust bowl. Hundreds of thousands of acres are fallow, while almond and plum trees are being left to die in the scorching sun.
Tens of thousands of people have been tossed out of work—the town of Mendota alone has an unemployment rate of about 40%—and the lines for food donations stretch down streets. The reason? There isn't enough water to go around this year, and the Obama administration is drawing up new reasons to divert more of it from farms and people and into the San Francisco Bay.
Devon Nunes also stated in an interview along side Paul Rodriguez, “There's a half a million acres of farmland, it's bigger than the size of Rhode Island, that's now dry because of these fools!”
David Spady reports that, “California's human-made water crisis led to $2.2 billion in losses, water rationing, rising food costs, and the destruction of small family businesses.”
The destruction is horrific. Businesses lost, property values lost, jobs lost, crop production lost, food cost increases, just to begin.
Presidential hopeful Carly Fiorina recently weighed in on the subject. They said that as a result, 70 percent of California's rainfall “washes out to sea” every year…California is a classic case of liberals being willing to sacrifice other people's lives and livelihoods at the altar of their ideology. It is a tragedy,”
The Climate Change, Save the Whale, Hug the Tree, Save the Baitfish crowd consistently uses a false narrative to to accomplish their political agenda. Now scientists are predicting a 35 year mega-drought in the West. When does the madness stop?
Environmental and endangered species laws are being used to force a political agenda, and in the process, doing severe damage to our country.
Filmmaker David Spady is working on a movie to highlight the travesty. No Water. No Farmer. No Food. reveals the extent to which both rural and urban populations rely on the nation's agricultural industry.
This is a must-watch trailer. David does a great job of framing the problem.

Kingdo­m also execut­es five Saudi nation­als for homici­de – the highes­t number of execut­ions in a single day this year
RIYADH: A Pakistani citizen was among six people convicted of drug trafficking and homicide were executed in Saudi Arabia on Monday, the government said, the highest number of executions in a single day this year.
The Pakistani man was beheaded for drug trafficking and five Saudi nationals for homicide, the interior ministry said.
Saudi Arabia executes two drug dealers including Pakistani national
Monday's executions bring to 44 the number of convicts put to death this year, according to an AFP tally of government statements.
The oil-rich kingdom has one of the world's highest rates of execution, with suspects convicted of terrorism, homicide, rape, armed robbery and drug trafficking facing the death penalty.
The country reported 153 people executed last year, a number confirmed by London-based rights group Amnesty International.

The Norway captain, Brede Hangeland, believes Roy Hodgson's greatest challenge will be to mould England's high-profile players into a coherent team, with the Fulham defender insistent the national side can flourish if they buy into the new manager's philosophy.
Hangeland enjoyed spells under Hodgson at Viking Stavanger and Craven Cottage, where they were a key member of the side who reached the Europa League final in 2010, and will know the 64-year-old's techniques better than England's players as they take on Norway at the Ullevaal stadium on Saturday evening. The centre-half admitted Hodgson's lengthy training drills had been considered "boring" by some of their Fulham team-mates but stressed the team had ended up reaping rewards for the monotonous sessions out on the pitch.
"Roy's attitude is that individual players should always sacrifice themselves for the good of the team, and that will be their main challenge as England manager," Hangeland said. "He has some great players to choose from but the job is about moulding them into a team. I'd say that's much harder to do with the England team than it is for a club like Fulham. England has some top players but they don't always play well as a team. If they can achieve that, they will have an outside chance [at Euro 2012].
"He has a very clear idea of how to do things but, and I'm speculating, maybe they will have to try to change it slightly with big-name players. He'll be pragmatic and try to get the most they can out of them. It could take some time before they reach their maximum level under Roy but they don't really have time: they have to crack on and see how it goes. That's where he's probably happy to have really good players. It's their job to make them gel.
"His main strength is the way they organise a team. The way they play is all about the shape of the team, you have to be compact, and they demand that everyone knows their job. At both Viking and Fulham they made a team much stronger than the sum of its parts.  They are very clear in what they want to do and the key is whether the players accept those ideas. They keep going on and on and on at you until you can't help but understand exactly what they want. Some of the lads at Fulham used to say their training sessions were boring because they were so repetitive but after a while we all understood. When the hard work starts showing with positive results then you become happy to do whatever the manager wants."
The defender believes Hodgson's team will adopt a slightly more "direct approach" than their predecessor, Fabio Capello, and drew comparisons with the style promoted by their own national head coach, Egil Olsen. "He speaks my language," said the former Wimbledon manager of their opposite number. "In my opinion, they should go more direct. I am a more direct manager but, even here, people don't agree with me. I guess in Norway I belong to a little group [of one], and in England people don't like the direct approach and such strict defensive organisation."
Olsen is unbeaten in four meetings with England – drawing three and beating Graham Taylor's side in 1993 – and hopes to maintain that record on Saturday. "I've never lost to them or Brazil," they said. "I hope Roy does well with them, but loses this game. It is much, much tougher to be England manager than coach of the Norway team, but their salary is better."
Pop Culture Happy Hour: The Oscars, 'Drag Race' And Shut-Ins Edition
Listen to Pop Culture Happy Hour Listen · 44:35 44:35
NPR
When we taped this show on Tuesday, we had all had quite a lot of the Oscars, to be honest. And we secretly suspect that with the all-out pile-on that continues for months before the ceremony, you might not require an all-out assault on the whole thing. So this week, you'll hear a quick wrap-up of how we felt about the hosting, some of the speeches, some of the great moments of Adele Nazeem-ing it up, and then we'll bid the entire thing farewell until next year. Next year, Oscars.
Far more fascinating to us was our exploration of RuPaul's Drag Race, which just recently kicked off its sixth season. Both a reality-competition show and a send-up of reality-competition shows, Drag Race got us talking about identity, turning up the volume, the aesthetics of a very specific part of culture, and, of course, proper pronoun use.
And then, with a shout-out to a great friend of the show who's spending some time at home, we take a look at some of the culture and cultural ideas you can take full advantage of when you're not quite such a social butterfly. I suggest a new look at an old format and a good show about to get a new lease on life. Trey has a couple of suggestions for keeping yourself productive and crafty, Stephen suggests new media and clutter clearing, and Glen offers one good book and then another.
As always, we wrap up the show with what's making us happy this week. It's the time of year when Stephen is happy about one of their most loved and most draining projects (aside from the kids). Trey is happy about an essay that might make you think differently about a very popular actor with a very engaging personality. Glen is happy about a comedy project starring one of their favorite inhabitors of multiple identities. And I'm happy about a new project from one of the many fine interns we've sent into the world, as well as about some blistering reviews of a very bad television show.
You can find us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter: Stephen, Glen, Trey, me, producer Jessica, also-producers Lauren and Nick, and our lifelong pal and music director Mike Katzif.
A large study recently began in Liberia, West Africa to examine how genes affect a person's response to the Ebola virus. The study is enrolling approximately 8,000 adults and children and includes people who got sick with Ebola and survived, people who were close contacts of Ebola patients but never became infected, and people who have no known Ebola exposure. Stored blood samples from up to 500 people who died from Ebola will also be included in the study.
After completing a rigorous informed consent process, participants will provide their medical history and a blood sample. The blood samples will be sent to labs in Liberia and in the U.S., where investigators will use specialized equipment to read each participant's DNA. They will be examining whether certain genes are associated with a higher risk of contracting Ebola virus disease (EVD) or of dying from Ebola infection. They also hope to determine if genes influence the problems some EVD survivors continue to have after recovery, such as uveitis (eye inflammation), or traces of virus lingering in bodily fluids, including semen.
A team of scientists from NIAID, the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Boston, and a U.S.-Liberia clinical research collaboration known as the Partnership for Research on Ebola Virus in Liberia (PREVAIL), are conducting the research. NIAID and the Ministry of Health in Liberia are co-sponsors of PREVAIL and the study. Co-principal investigators include Lisa Hensley, Ph.D., deputy director of NIAID's Integrated Research Facility in Frederick, Maryland; Mosoka Fallah, Ph.D., M.P.H., deputy director general of the National Public Health Institute of Liberia; and Pardis Sabeti, M.D., D.Phil., leader of the infectious disease program at the Broad Institute.
Participants will include Ebola survivors and their household contacts already enrolled in a PREVAIL-led Ebola natural history study. Some of these household contacts had antibody evidence of Ebola virus exposure despite having no obvious signs of disease. Why some infections are asymptomatic while others are fatal, or why some people rapidly clear the infection while others remain in treatment for weeks or have lingering traces of virus months or years after infection, remains unclear. Investigators predict that by studying people's DNA, they might uncover genetic differences that influence these outcomes.
Why does time only go in one direction? And why is the future so different from the past? They seem obvious questions, but they have troubled scientists for over a century. A new theory has proposed an answer — that time doesn't run just one way, and that there is another universe, a mirror of ours, where time runs backwards.
They analysed a computer simulation model of 1000 particles under the influence of Newtonian gravity, focusing on the dynamic behaviour and distance between the particles. Ultimately, they found that, regardless of size and amount, every configuration of particles would evolve into what's known as a low-complexity scale. They then expand outward in both directions, creating two different, and opposite “arrows of time”. “Along each of the two temporal paths, gravity then pulls the particles into larger, more ordered and complex structures — the model's equivalent of galaxy clusters, stars and planetary systems. From there, the standard thermodynamic passage of time can manifest and unfold on each of the two divergent paths.
More…That's what a team of scientists argues, including Julian Barbour of the University of Oxford, Tim Koslowski of the University of New Brunswick and Flavio Mercati of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics.This “mirror” universe would not be exactly the same as ours, though; it would have evolved and changed in its own way, completely separate to our own. However, it would be subject to the same laws of physics, so it would likely have planets, stars and galaxies just like in our version of the cosmos.
Explaining the model as a swarm of bees, Dr Barbour says that as time increases, the universe moves from an initial chaotic ‘swarm of bees' to a more structured and ordered cosmos. ‘If you look at a simple model with a swarm of bees in the middle [the Big Bang] but breaking up in either direction, then you would say there are two arrows of time, pointing in opposite directions from the swarm of bees,' they said. ‘If you define time as the direction in which order is increasing, you always get two arrows in opposite direction from the central chaotic region.'
However, they note much more work needs to be done in looking at how time works. “This is opening up a completely new way to think about a fundamental problem, the nature of the arrow of time and the origin of the second law of thermodynamics.
“But really we're just investigating a new aspect of Newton's gravitation, which hadn't been noticed before. Who knows what might flow from this with further work and elaboration?”

The problems faced by Soviet forces in Afghanistan carry echoes for Nato All the most senior ministers were at the Afghan strategy meeting. They knew things were not going well, but from their leader there was a whiff of panic. "We just need to be sure that the final result does not look like a humiliating defeat: to have lost so many men and now abandoned it all... in short, we have to get out of there." Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev - the speaker of those words - was understandably alarmed. It was June 1986, almost a year since they had taken the decision to start withdrawing Soviet troops from Afghanistan and hand over more responsibility to the government there. But Soviet losses, already above 10,000, kept mounting. With conflicting signals this week about the direction of Western policy in Afghanistan, there is a hint of the same kind of panic and indecision. Soviet exit strategy US President Barack Obama is still deciding whether to send in thousands of US reinforcements. SOVIETS IN AFGHANISTAN 1979 - Brezhnev sends in troops 1988 - USSR pledges to withdraw 1989 - final Soviet withdrawal Soviet deaths - estimated at 15,000 Afghan deaths - estimated at one million Yet the British Prime Minister Gordon Brown - facing ever-greater opposition to the Afghan war - has been highlighting possibilities for UK troops to pull back in some areas next year. It is less than two weeks since they were saying: "We cannot, must not and will not walk away." But as Mr Gorbachev found, getting out is at least as difficult as staying in. It took almost four years to pull out entirely - because of a combination of dithering over strategy and last-ditch efforts by Moscow to prop up its client government in Kabul in the hope of maintaining some pride and influence. The former Soviet leader's difficulties are detailed in previously secret transcripts of Politburo meetings and diary entries recently released by the Washington-based National Security Archive. They make sobering reading for British and American leaders, as they decide whether to double-up or cut their losses in Afghanistan. There are certainly differences - not the least America's determination to make the Soviet withdrawal as costly as possible in blood and treasure. Lost battle But there are echoes too of the difficulties the US and its allies face now. President Gorbachev was alarmed by the situation of Soviet forces By the late 1980s, Moscow's exit strategy was basically the same as Nato's today - to build up an allied government in Kabul with sufficient trained army and police forces to defend itself, thereby allowing foreign troops to leave. But even with the backing of a 100,000-strong Soviet army and billions of rubles in aid, the Afghan government struggled to establish its legitimacy and authority much beyond the capital - much like President Hamid Karzai's Western-backed administration today. This bleak assessment of the situation in late 1986 by the Soviet armed forces commander, Marshal Sergei Akhromeev, sounds eerily familiar. "Military actions in Afghanistan will soon be seven years old," Mr Akhromeev told Mr Gorbachev at a November 1986 Politburo session. "There is no single piece of land in this country which has not been occupied by a Soviet soldier. Nonetheless, the majority of the territory remains in the hands of rebels. "The whole problem is that military results are not followed up by political actions. At the centre there is authority; in the provinces there is not. "We control Kabul and the provincial centres, but on occupied territory we cannot establish authority. We have lost the battle for the Afghan people". Familiar problems By that point, Soviet trainers had created an Afghan army 160,000-strong - double the size of the force Nato has trained so far - together with thousands of much-feared secret police officers. Yet once Soviet forces had left, they could do little more than defend Kabul and a few other cities. Only massive military aid, coupled with incompetence and in-fighting among the US-backed mujahideen opposition, allowed the Afghan government Moscow left behind to cling on in Kabul for a few more years before finally collapsing. There were familiar problems too with the financial assistance Moscow gave. It hoped the funds would bolster the capacity of the Afghan government and pay for projects that would benefit people, winning hearts and minds. However corruption rendered much of its useless. As the Politburo discussed a new aid request from Kabul in January 1987, Marshal Sergei Sokolov said: "In 1981, we gave them 100m roubles of free assistance. And all of that went to the elite. And there was nothing in the hamlets - no kerosene, no matches."

America was a confusing place. I did not realize that those friendly white-haired ladies inviting lonely students like me to church dinners were also trying to save my heathen soul. I did not understand how dishwashers worked. I could not drive a car. I could barely change a light bulb. I felt singularly ill equipped, but eager to explore.
I saw the exhilarating promise of America in the oddest places — the friendly drag queen with their Long Island iced tea at Two Hearts, the local gay bar; the dollar classics night at the campus movie theater where I watched “Back to the Future”; my messy attempt at a tandoori marinade to jazz up a Thanksgiving turkey. The American dream was not about striking it rich. It was about savoring the possibility of reinvention.
Several years later, I left a career in software engineering to become a writer. I do not think I would have had the courage to do that in India. In America, a profligate waste of an education did not seem so outlandish.
America was where I lived alone for the first time, in a little studio apartment with a cracked bathtub. America was a place, far away from the watchful eyes of aunts, uncles and neighbors, where it was possible to indulge in curious passions — bartending classes, poetry groups, quail hunting, sex. There were slurs and snide comments about smelling like curry, but it never crossed my mind that America needed to be made great again, because I had already been seduced by its own conviction in its greatness. Its projection of greatness had always been its most successful export.
Now that is changing. The country that taught me the meaning of privacy is considering demanding Facebook passwords at the border. From the outside it feels less like a darker country than like a more sullen one — one half of it apologetic, the other half suspicious. I am almost nostalgic for the naïve innocence of that other America I knew, where pleasant middle-aged women would tell me about a Dr. Patel from Mumbai and ask if I knew him. That America came with a sense of curiosity. The America I see now is shrunken, scared of its own shadow despite its bluster.
A federal judge today tossed Governor Jan Brewer's lawsuit against the state's Medical Marijuana Act, saying in their ruling that the state's complaint wasn't ripe.
U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton dismissed the case without prejudice and invited the state to file an amended complaint to correct the flaws in their argument. However, Brewer and state Attorney General Tom Horne have made it clear they're loathe to do what Bolton asks: Pick a side for or against the law.
Brewer and Horne both opposed Prop 203 before it was passed narrowly by voters in November of 2010, but they didn't want to be perceived as attacking their own state's law. So, they tried to have it both ways with a lawsuit that asked the federal court whether the medical pot was legal, yet didn't state their opposition to the law.
An upper-class English accent and a famous family name can get you a long way in China.
This is, after all, a country obsessed with power, status and wealth, with a distinct fascination with traditional British culture and a huge audience for TV shows such as “Downton Abbey” and “Sherlock.”
Enter Oliver Rothschild, a 64-year-old British entrepreneur and self-declared “International Man of Excellence,” with the accent, the swagger and, above all, the famous name to impress.
For the past few years, Rothschild has been enjoying the red-carpet treatment in China. Media reports show them meeting government officials, touring cities, visiting companies and delivering speeches at business forums and at Beijing's prestigious Tsinghua University.
At Tsinghua, they were billed as a “core member” and “ninth generation” descendent of the fabulously wealthy Rothschild family.

They are, the university said, a global financial investor, an entrepreneurial strategist and a philanthropist who has been in charge of more than a dozen charitable organizations, including UNICEF and the British Red Cross.
Not true.
Oliver Rothschild is not a member of the famous family. In fact, as company documents show, their real first name is John (Oliver is their middle name), the Red Cross has no record of him, and they have never run UNICEF — although they might have held a voluntary position running a fundraising committee once upon a time and even donated a few pounds.
Last week, Tsinghua was forced into an embarrassing retraction after Chinese state-owned media characterized Rothschild as a “fake” and a “con artist.”
“There was negligence in terms of screening,” Tsinghua University Vice President Yang Bin told the China News Service.
Writing in the Global Times newspaper, commentator Liu Zhun said the episode exposed China's insecurities and a “longing for international endorsement, especially from the developed world, as an indicator of being something.”
[‘Is this really China?' Euro-style resort offers a slow haven for a new elite.]
“An inferiority complex has taken roots in the mind of many Chinese, xenophilia mixed with a worship of everything foreign,” Liu wrote. “The ethos is reflected in Chinese entrepreneurs recruiting white Europeans as ‘advisers' who are nothing but ornaments and Chinese parents' obsession with studying overseas regardless of the universities' accreditation.”
Yet China was not the only country to fall for Rothschild's charms, for it is not the only place with a fascination for the elite, where a bit of chutzpah and a padded résumé can open doors and generate potentially lucrative speaking engagements.
As a speaker at an investment meeting in the United Arab Emirates in 2015, they were described as a previous chairperson of UNICEF. At a forum on the future of cities in the Slovenian capital of Ljubljana the same year, Rothschild was billed as a U.K. representative to the U.N. Economic Commission for Europe ­(UNECE), a role that also appears on their LinkedIn profile.
(UNECE said they never represented the commission. “He attended one of our meetings last year, but they were not involved in any projects or activities of the UNECE,” spokesperson Jean Rodriguez wrote in an email.)
China, however, is where the Oliver Rothschild story and their purported association with the famous family grew wings.
Rothschild did not respond to phoned or emailed requests for comment, but they told the Financial Times last week that they were “shocked” to hear of the controversy and had never alleged they were in any way connected with the banking family.
Yet they acknowledged that it was “quite possible” that some of their friends who arranged their meetings in China may have misrepresented him.
But in a 2014 interview with the China Philanthropist magazine, Rothschild lyrically described the burden that came with their famous family name.
“It is much easier to say that I am not related to that family than to say that I am,” they were quoted as saying. “But I have been carrying the expectation on the family name since I was born. My whole life has been to grow to become part of the value embodied by this family name.”
At first, Rothschild flew just under the radar, with engagements across China that attracted little national media attention.
Attending a World Entrepreneurship Forum at Zhejiang University in eastern China in October, they were described as a “renowned British entrepreneur and the investment manager for the Rothschild family.” On a visit to the infrastructure company Jingsun Group, they were described as a “12th-generation descendent” of the Rothschild family and was reported as speaking about the family's ideals.
China is no stranger to the art of imitation, including fake designer bags and luxury watches and a life-size replica of London's Tower Bridge.
It also has its own phenomenon of “fake officials” — political swindlers who pose as government officials and are shown the red carpet on tours of small towns, or con men who pretend to have top-level Communist Party contacts and peddle imaginary influence.
[China grapples with rash of fake officials]
Perhaps, then, it is fitting that is been here that Rothschild was exposed, first by China's Economic Observer newspaper and then gleefully by other state media outlets.
“With a charming British accent, paired with a special last name, Oliver Rothschild was regarded as heir of the mysterious Jewish banking family for several years,” the People's Daily reported, before noting that those claims had been debunked.
In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for the Rothschild family said, “Oliver Rothschild is not a descendant, through the male line, of Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744-1812) of Frankfurt and is therefore not a member of the Rothschild banking family.”
Rothschild's LinkedIn profile says they graduated from the University of Surrey with a degree in hotel management and lists specialties ranging from the hotel and leisure industries to fine art and antiques, from property and corporate finance to media, film and charitable causes.
It also lists 30 present or past positions — as chairperson, director, patron or president of a series of small companies and charitable organizations, including as a senior fellow in entrepreneurship and commerce at the University of Essex. Spokeswoman Vicky Vickers said they had “no association” with the university.
Data from Britain's Companies House shows that Rothschild is sole owner and co-director of Oliver Rothschild Corporate Advisers Ltd., which most recently reported assets of less than $12,000 (and liabilities of nearly $120,000).
As for UNICEF, media head Marixie Mercado said the organization has no current relationship with him.

They were a supporter of the U.K. national appeals committee in the mid-1990s, they said. In 1995, they donated 1,000 pounds, about $1,600 at the time.
On Twitter, a profile under their name and with their photograph describes them as an “International Man of Excellence.”
The @ollyrothschild Twitter handle briefly flared into life in 2009. It notes a speech at Oxford University and an international entrepreneurs conference in Istanbul.
“Took 2 beautiful women around 9 West End art galleries drinking was the topic of conversation, ended up at the Ivy Club,” reads one post from May 29, 2009.
“Off in a jiff, drinks with Kevin Spacey at a certain theatrical bar!” the next post reads.

There is something stately in the way that animals grow old, something inherently more graceful than our perpetual scrabbling for youth, our lotions and potions, our plastic surgery, our care homes. "Old age, calm, expanded, broad with the haughty breadth of the universe," as Walt Whitman once put it.
This week, Cheeta, the chimp from the original Tarzan films, reached the splendid age of 75 (though they have a few years to go before reaching the 79 clocked up by their co-star Johnny Weissmuller). Diabetic Cheeta, their fur now speckled with grey, celebrated with sugar-free cake and diet soft drinks at their home in the legendary retirement destination of Palm Springs, California, where they pass their days watching TV, painting and playing the piano.
Cheeta is cited by the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's oldest primate (that should be non-human primate, of course, but perhaps they were confused by their lifestyle). But verifying such titles is a difficult business. Consider the case of Adwaita the tortoise, who once belonged to the British colonial general Clive of India in the 18th century. One Wednesday last month, Adwaita was found dead in their enclosure in Alipore Zoo. Their death was not unexpected - their shell had cracked some months before and a wound had developed, and they are, after all, somewhat advanced in life: West Bengal officials said records showed Adwaita was at least 150 years old, but other evidence suggested they were more like 255. It will take carbon-dating of their shell to determine their true age. At 255, Adwaita would beat Harriet the Galápagos tortoise, who was reportedly collected by Charles Darwin, and died aged 175 in 2006, and Tu'i Malila, the radiated tortoise given to the royal family of Tonga by Captain James Cook, and who passed over aged 188 in 1965.
The age of a fish is calculated in much the same way as one works out the age of a tree by counting its rings; most fish have growth rings on their scales known as annuli. This technique was used to estimate the age of Hanako, meaning "flower maid", the world's oldest koi carp, who died in 1977 at the age of 226 years. Goldie, the oldest goldfish, had reached the age of 45 by the time they gasped their last in 2005. They were won at a fair in Budleigh Salterton in 1960, and by the time they died their skin had faded from a yellowy orange to a soft pink.
Alas, Goldie never made it to the Guinness Book of World Records because there was no documentary evidence of their age. This is a common problem. While it is simple to check the age of a pedigree cat, for example, as it will wield a certificate of authenticity, the more common moggie comes with no such paperwork. In 2004, Whiskey, a 33-year-old tabby from Essex, staked their claim as Britain's oldest cat, but their owner was unable to prove the claim conclusively. As for the world title, the Guinness Book of World Records held that Creme Puff, a cat from Austin, Texas, died in 2005 aged 38 years and three days, though there has been much jostling for the crown. Guinness at present records the oldest living cat as Kataleena Lady, a 27-year-old Burmese born on March 11, 1977, in Australia.
The title of the oldest parrot is also much disputed. Some favour Charlie, a blue macaw allegedly bought by Winston Churchill two years before the start of the second world war, who now resides at a Surrey garden centre, where they fill the air with anti-Nazi tirades. Charlie's owner, who bought them from a pet shop in 1965, claims that they are 104. Unfortunately, the administrators of Chartwell, Churchill's former country home, state that they have no record of any parrot, while Churchill's daughter, Lady Soames, says their father never owned a macaw (though they did, once, have an African grey parrot named Polly).
In 2004 Matilda, a 14-year-old bantam hen, was named the world's oldest hen. The world's oldest dove, Methuselah (perhaps not its name since birth), is 31 years 6 months old. They were born in April 1975 and lives in Harxheim, Germany.
It is naturally harder to tell the age of animals that keep their distance from humans, but a Manx shearwater aged 52 is believed to hold the title of the oldest known wild bird. It was first captured off the coast of Wales and ringed by ornithologists in May 1957, when it was between four and six years old, and recaptured in April 2003. It was estimated to have flown five million miles during its lifetime, the equivalent of circumnavigating the globe 200 times.
Some of the humblest-seeming animals are also the longest-lived, like the ocean quahog, a mollusc with an estimated maximum lifespan of 225 years, and the tardigrade, or water bear. Tardigrades are tiny creatures, about the size of a pencil dot, and look much like caterpillars, with four pairs of legs ending in claws, and five body segments. They live mostly in mosses and lichens, beaches and water sediments, and can be found both high in the Himalayas and 4,000m deep in the sea, and from the polar regions to the equator. They are hardy little critters and, though they are 70% water, they are able to enter a "cryptobiotic" state, suspending their metabolism and living in a dehydrated state for years. It is believed that their lifespan can stretch to over a century.
At the other end of the size scale, the oldest known elephant reached the ripe old age of 86. Lin Wang was originally from Myanmar, and was captured in 1943 by the Nationalist army from the Japanese troops, then transported to Taiwan in 1947. When they were captured, Lin Wang was nicknamed "the Beautiful", but in their later years the people of Taiwan knew them affectionately as "Grandpa Lin Wang". As their years increased, they developed arthritis in their left hind leg, and began to lose their appetite. One Wednesday morning in late February 2003, Lin Wang was found collapsed at Taipei's Mucha Zoo. Upon their death, workers at the zoo held a minute's silence in their honour.

Thirty-one countries joined the Paris global warming agreement this week, officially committing to the pact along with the United States and China.
The agreement is a top-down, concentrated effort to drive the price of conventional energy sources like coal, oil, and natural gas higher. It will prevent millions of citizens from enjoying basic energy needs, transferring mass amounts of wealth from developed countries to developing ones.
The total number of countries joining the agreement is now at 60, which, as The Associated Press reports, is “higher than the 55-country threshold needed for the treaty to enter into force. But because together those countries account for 48 percent of total global emissions—short of the 55 percent threshold—the agreement must wait for more nations to join.”
The key word here is “treaty.” The Paris Agreement is in form, in substance, and in the nature of its commitments a treaty. In order to be ratified by the United States, treaties are supposed to be sent to the Senate for review and consent. The Obama administration has shown nothing but disdain for the treaty-making process and the role of the Senate by completely evading their participation.
Americans are currently reaping the benefits of lower energy bills. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, since June 2014, lower oil and gas prices have directly lowered the cost of living—even as other components like food and housing have increased.
As the U.S. Energy Information Administration reports, “Between 2008 and 2014, average annual household energy expenditures declined by 14.1 percent. During this period, household expenditures decreased by 17.7 percent for gasoline, 25.1 percent for natural gas, and 28.3 percent for fuel oil.”
Through domestic regulations and an international commitment in Paris, the Obama administration is intent on reversing course. The administration announced plans to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2025 by 26 to 28 percent compared to 2005 levels. The plan outlines a long list of domestic regulations proposed and implemented by the administration that will curtail the use of conventional fuels, primarily coal, but also oil and natural gas.
As a result, American households and businesses will incur higher energy costs. Americans will be hit repeatedly with higher prices as businesses pass increased costs on to consumers. Absorbing the costs of pricier energy will prevent businesses from investing and expanding.
Unsurprisingly, Secretary of State John Kerry applauded the recent list of signees. They called for people all over the world to “become warriors for the planet.”
But they'll be fighting a costly, ineffective battle. Kerry admitted as much a few months ago during the negotiations in December, saying, “If all the industrial nations went down to zero emissions—remember what I just said, all the industrial emissions went down to zero emissions—it wouldn't be enough, not when more than 65 percent of the world's carbon pollution comes from the developing world.”
Though major carbon dioxide-emitting developing countries like China and Brazil have signed on to the Paris Agreement, whether they will curb economic growth to make the necessary emissions cuts is a completely different story.
After all, China can continue to allow emissions to grow significantly, only committing to peak emissions in 2030. They've already lied about how much carbon dioxide they're pumping out now. And although they have scrubbers installed on their power plants to curb actual hazardous air pollutants, they do not use them because cheaper energy is more important to the Chinese government. Very little evidence exists that China will follow through with its promise. Nor has India promised any substantial cuts.
We should celebrate—not demonize—the use of coal, oil, and natural gas. The use of conventional fuels has assisted in lifting billions of people out of poverty. They are a critical input for plastics, fertilizers, chemicals, medicines, medical technologies, transportation, and heating and cooling homes, to name a few uses.
Thanks to the use of conventional fuels, you are 50 times less likely to die from a climate-related event like a heat wave, drought, or flood than you were 80 years ago.
That's progress. Why would we want to reverse it?
Back on February 22, BTS performed "Save Me" and "Blood, Sweat & Tears" at the '6th GAON Chart Kpop Awards', becoming involved in a "copying" controversy. Claims complained that the stage consisted of similarities to a previous solo performance by T.O.P at Big Bang's concert.
The issue became bloated to the point that Big Bang fans demanded an apology, while Big Hit Entertainment addressed the stage as outside of their responsibility.
As fans began pointing out that the fault belonged to the staff of the 'GAON Chart Kpop Awards', the Gaon Chart has stepped up to issue an official apology.
They stated,
"Hello? This is the 'GAON Chart Kpop Awards's executive office.
We would like to make an official statement regarding the "copying" controversy involving BTS's stage at the '6th GAON Chart Kpop Awards'.
After confirming with the outside production team of the said award ceremony, the executive office has validated that the production team failed to thoroughly monitor the used video footage, and that the team further failed to adequately explain the involved footage or provide a preview of the results to BTS and their party.
We bow our heads in apology to all those whose hearts were negatively affected by this issue.
We are terribly sorry.
We also thank you for your love and attention toward the 'GAON Chart Kpop Awards'.
Thank you."

Greetings Citizens,
It looks like the Hornet commercial and brochure were a resounding success; the president of Anvil Aerospace should expect a bonus this quarter! In all seriousness, the community is continuing to set funding records and is allowing us to do more with Star Citizen. At $24 million, you've unlocked the following stretch goal:
Public Transportation System – Need to get from one place to another but don't have a starship? We're building a galactic transportation system. You can travel via transport from system to system in Star Citizen and even ship items (like a ship you need moved to another hangar.) With this stretch goal, we'll expand this system: star liners, long range transports, charter ships and flyable shuttles!
Pictured here is a monorail car, which will be used by the player to travel from place to place on Terra! A public transportation system may not seem as sexy as a new bomber or a cruiser, but it speaks directly to the goal of making Star Citizen an immersive, world-building experience. Instead of having a simple ‘fast travel' option like an MMORPG, Star Citizen will feature a living, breathing system to support that gameplay requirement… a system that will be impacted by the economy and player actions in all sorts of exciting ways!
We're also revealing the $26 million goal, which I think will interest a lot of players. We have become increasingly fascinating with the possibilities for larger capital ships in Star Citizen and would like to dedicate some of the additional funding to expanding their functionality:
Enhanced Capital Ship Systems – In addition to the command and control systems we've already outlined, we're going to expand capital ship functions! Lead a damage control team to fight fires and repair key systems during battle, control internal bulkheads to slow boarders and man a number of consoles, like navigation and engineering, that will make commanding a capital ship feel even more immersive.
Thank you for your continued support. I hope you take as much pride as I do in the fact that you aren't only bringing back PC games and taking a shot across the bow at big publishers, you're taking Star Citizen to new frontiers. The team at Cloud Imperium can't wait to show you what's next!
Finally, one small change to the Hornet rollout. We've had a number of requests from backers eager to purchase the limited edition Super Hornet who will not be able to do so until the end of the month. Federal employees in the United States who are just getting back to work after the recent government shutdown are especially affected. We are grateful for your passion and would like to help however possible. With this in mind, we are going to keep the Super Hornet available an extra week through Monday, November 4th. We hope that helps give all of our existing backers an opportunity to upgrade to the F7C-M!

Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant signed HB 1523 – the “Protecting Freedom of Conscience from Government Discrimination Act” – into law last April.
But on June 30, U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves issued a preliminary injunction that prevented the law from taking effect. That injunction is now under review by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.
The SPLC's brief to the Fifth Circuit describes the discrimination and harassment that LGBT youth in Mississippi already face because of their sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression – and how they would be further marginalized under HB 1523.
“HB 1523 will affect all aspects of life for vulnerable LGBT and gender-nonconforming youth in Mississippi,” said David Dinielli, deputy legal director at SPLC. “Our amicus brief shows how this discriminatory law will only increase the rejection, harassment and violence they already endure.”
The statute would allow business owners to refuse service to people because of their personal religious beliefs. It would permit government clerks to refuse to marry same-sex couples and allow state-run and private adoption agencies to reject same-sex applicants. Counselors could also turn away LGBT clients by claiming a conflict with their religious beliefs.
The SPLC cites the experiences of several young people in Mississippi who fear that HB 1523 will open a new floodgate of discrimination and harassment.
Silas Griffith, a 21-year-old transgender, nonbinary college student, experienced verbal harassment and isolation from classmates and teachers in both high school and college.
Among them is Silas Griffith, a 21-year-old transgender, nonbinary college student. Griffith describes verbal harassment and isolation from classmates and teachers in both high school and college. While attending Mississippi Delta Community College, a professor outed Griffith during class while challenging the validity of Griffith's arguments in favor of transgender rights for 15 minutes in front of other students.
“Outing yourself as trans to a whole group of people who were already weirded out was not a good experience,” said Griffith, who transferred to Delta State University. “I stopped going there because I couldn't take the everyday stress and humiliation.”
Griffith fears that HB 1523 will only make matters worse.
Sommer Sneed Husbands is a high school teacher in northern Mississippi, where they sponsor the school's Gay Straight Alliance (GSA). They have observed their LGBT students feeling alienated and marginalized. “These kids hate high school,” they said. “They consider it a sentence they have to fulfill.”
Husband has witnessed the way that their students cope with the harassment, bullying and rejection they face from classmates, and sometimes, their fellow teachers. “Some are so afraid that they have created almost separate identities for themselves: one they present to the public and one they present to people they're truly comfortable with.”
Husbands now worries that if HB 1523 goes into effect, many schoolchildren will see that adults are allowed to discriminate and believe that it is acceptable.
John A. “Tony” Caldwell, is a licensed clinical social worker and runs a private practice in Oxford, where they have counseled many LGBT youth.
John A. “Tony” Caldwell, is a licensed clinical social worker and runs a private practice in Oxford, where they have counseled many LGBT youth. They all seem to share the same sense: that they are not welcome in Mississippi.
Caldwell has repeatedly been asked by parents to “fix” their children and asked by churches to shame LGBT youth into “conversion.”
They worry that HB 1523 will block access to mental health services for LGBT youth, many of whom are already being turned away. “Discrimination is happening under the radar.”
Six graduating seniors, one recent graduate, and one student from Yale School of Public Health have been awarded teaching fellowships by the Yale-China Association.
The students who have been named as teaching fellows are Benjamin Healy, Yunyi Chen, Kevin Su, Symba Nuruddin, Andres Valdivieso, and Mollie Korewa from the Yale class of 2016; and Jessica Hahne who will graduate from Yale School of Public Health this year. Joining them in the field will be Sebastian Monzon '15 B.A.
Fellows are chosen from a large and competitive pool of applicants for their cross-cultural agility, teaching ability, academic achievement, and commitment to community service.
During their two-year assignments in China, the new fellows will teach academic writing and oral English courses, and lecture on American history and culture to university and high school students and teachers. They will also study Chinese language and culture, and carry out community engagement projects.
The Yale-China Association, a private, nonprofit organization located on the Yale campus, has worked to promote mutual understanding between Chinese and Americans through teaching and service for over a century. The Yale-China Association has programs in education, health, and the arts.
The Yale-China Teaching Fellowship is open to Yale graduating seniors and to any Yale graduate for up to five years after graduation. Graduate students are also eligible to apply. For more information about the fellowship, contact Leslie Stone, Yale-China Director of Education, at leslie.stone@yale.edu or at 203-432-3866.
If Lyft is really for sale -- and the company didn't deny it yesterday -- it signals a surprising new chapter in the rideshare wars: the endgame. It's not so much shocking to hear that Lyft believes it can't beat Uber for supremacy in the U.S., the only market Lyft operates. To many observers, that has been apparent for quite a long while.
(Disclosure: I worked at Uber in 2015. Nothing in this post is based on proprietary knowledge gained during that period nor do I have any insider access into the current workings of the company.)
Rather, the surprise is that Lyft may be ready to give up independence and dreams of a public offering to achieve any exit at all. This despite a $1 billion funding round just months ago and telling FORBES it had $1.5 billion in cash as of May, as Brian Solomon noted. The company had earlier allegedly promised not to burn more than $50 million per month suggesting a substantial 2-plus-years of runway.
That the company is now either seeking more funding or an acquirer, just a couple of months later, suggests a new-found reality at Lyft. Some of what the company may be thinking matters to other rideshare startups around the world -- no matter how well funded.
The IPO market is still rather unfavorable. The success of Twilio's recent offering notwithstanding, few tech companies have managed to go public for a long while. With Brexit casting a pall on markets and the global economy teetering, stocks haven't been strong in 2016. Lyft might have once hoped that the market would tolerate its continuing losses so long as top-line growth was there. That hope seems faint now.
Ridesharing may be the source of future riches, but it's the source of present losses. Uber says it's profitable in "hundreds of cities ... globally" according to CEO Travis Kalanick. But that claim is notably short on detail (what exactly does a profitable city look like, accounting-wise) and also on depth. Uber doesn't imply it makes money overall, nor even outside the competitive market of China. With close to an order of magnitude more rides daily than Lyft, it is significant that Uber isn't yet in the black. And it implies Lyft might not get there for years.
Lyft may already have given up on the very thing that makes it unique -- at least emotionally. The pink mustache isn't what makes Lyft special for its customer, rather it's the feeling of community; the idea you're getting a ride from a friend. But Lyft has already spent the last year or so marketing itself much the way Uber does, essentially saying it has an app that allows ordering a car. Surely the company knows what makes it unique; arguably it doesn't think that matters.
Fast forward a decade or so to a world of robotic, dispatchable vehicles -- what I call mobility as a service (MaaS) -- and the "person" behind the wheel may not be there, nor will the wheel. At that point, service won't be differentiated on personality or good feelings about your driver. Instead, it's likely to be some combination of price and features. Worse for Lyft, the act of replacing the humans with machines will seem particularly harsh for the "feel good" rideshare company.
Lyft may be concluding that (1) it won't have the capital to get there on its own and (2) that future is inevitable, it will drive down costs, and the winners will be the best capitalized. That likely means some combination of Uber and China's Didi, global automakers, and tech giants including Apple and Google. It doesn't mean kitsch glowing on the dashboard or the fist bump from days gone by.
This may not be the last deal done in ridesharing. Israeli startup Gett recently raised a big round of funding but is in a similar position to Lyft with respect to market leadership: It has little. (Incidentally, Lyft was said to be quite strong in Austin, where both it and Uber recently ended service over a local law requiring drivers to be fingerprinted. That surely didn't help.) Many markets find themselves with a local player like Ola in India, Grab (fka GrabTaxi) in southeast Asia alongside Uber, which is currently competing most everywhere that it hasn't been ruled illegal.
The exit that Lyft could be considering applies to any number of the startups. That said, there may be a disconnect on what they are all worth. Lyft's deal with GM was 10% for $500 million. The implied $5 billion valuation is likely far more than anyone would pay for the company at present. Don't fret for investors, most of whom are protected in transactions at lower prices. (Employees, not so much.) But realize that Lyft's prodigious fundraising wasn't an outlier for a regional player. Ola, Grab, Gett have taken in hundreds of millions or more. Paying everyone back and delivering a return requires a buyer offering a big price. Right now, that's unlikely.
If this is to be the end of an independent Lyft, it's possible that by the time the dust settles Didi will have picked up some of the pieces (it already has a stake in Lyft) and found itself battling Uber not just for the giant Chinese market but around the world. And that could suggest a two-horse race for supremacy in the future -- at least for a while. There are reasons to believe MaaS will shake up the market even if it's an orderly duopoly until the robotic vehicles first enter the fray. But for now, dreams of multi-player markets may be fading.
Before You Waste Money on a Lawyer: 5 Legal Steps for Every New Artist
First, a Disclaimer (after all, I ‘m a lawyer).
This series of articles and the forms included in them have been created for informational purposes only and do not constitute legal advice. This article and other articles in this series should be used as a guide to understanding the law, not as a substitute for the advice of qualified counsel. You should consult an attorney before making any significant legal decisions.
What This Article Is About.
This is the ninth installment of an 11-part series I'm writing for Digital Music News on basic music industry agreements. It discusses business actions a band should take, and can take at no or little cost, without the services of an attorney.
A lot of experts, especially lawyers, advise clients to prepare and enter into a “band agreement” as soon as possible after the band's formation. A band agreement covers a number of complex business issues. The most important issues are:
Decision making
Hiring and firing
Profits and losses
Treatment of leaving members
Incorporating or organizing as an LLC
Ownership and use of the band's name
Ownership of songs and masters
The best reason to enter into a band agreement when the band is starting out, is that's the time when everyone in the band is getting along well, whereas it would be difficult to complete an agreement if there is already a dispute among the members. On the other hand, the vast majority of bands and music groups rehearse and publicly perform on a part-time basis, and make little if any money at the beginning of their careers. It may not be worthwhile (i) to spend the time needed to discuss and reach consensus on all the complicated issues usually covered by a band agreement, and (ii) spend the money on an experienced lawyer to draft an enforceable.
The bottom line is if there comes a time when a band starts making good money and it looks as if they have a real future, that is the right time to consider taking the time and spending the money to take more serious legal steps. In the meantime, any band or musical group can and should take these basic business actions.
Essential Business Actions Any Band or Musical Group Should & Can Do Without Incurring Legal Fees.
So, here are some quick steps you should do yourself, right now (without a lawyer):
Sign a “split sheet” for every song written by more than one individual; Register all songs and masters with the U.S. Copyright Office; Register every song with the appropriate performing rights organization (PRO); Upload the setlist of any live performance containing original songs for payment by your PRO; Write up a simple agreement that no leaving member can use the name of the band without permission.
1. Sign a “split sheet” for every song written by more than one individual.
What is a Split Sheet?
A split sheet is a document that states who own what percentage of a song and sets forth the credit each person should have. A sample split sheet is provided at the end of this section. A split sheet should be created for each and every song that was created by more than one person, and should be filled out and signed by all the writers before ever shopping it to a third party or trying to license it for placements.
Every day around the world, songwriters collaborate on songs and never clarify who wrote what. But if you are ever fortunate enough to license your song for a commercial, movie, or TV show, you may find yourself fighting over who owns what percentage of the revenues generated from your song.
All most songwriters and artists want to do is create great music, and it may feel uncomfortable to introduce a split sheet and start dividing up shares of publishing when you're trying to be creative. Yet, it's a necessary part of the songwriting process. Have a meeting about split sheets prior to hitting the studio. This way everyone understands that it's not personal; it's just business. Doing this makes everyone feel as though their interests are protected, which can enhance creativity rather than inhibiting it.
How to Complete a Split Sheet
Split sheets should contain the following information:
The name of each writer.
Percent of ownership. This is key. If the song makes money, this will determine how
Credit for each writer, including who wrote the lyrics and who composed the
Everyone's signature.
Below is a sample split sheet:
2. Register All Songs & Masters With the US Copyright Office
Why Register?
Registration is not a prerequisite for copyright protection. Under the Copyright Act of 1976, a copyright comes into existence as soon as a work is fixed in a tangible medium of expression, and registration is not a condition of copyright protection. However, registration provides crucial benefits to copyright owners.
Those benefits, which are set forth in the U.S. Copyright Office's website, include the following:
Registration establishes a public record of the copyright claim. Before an infringement suit may be filed in court, registration is necessary for works of U.S. origin. If made before or within five years of publication, registration will establish prima facie evidence in court of the validity of the copyright and of the facts stated in the certificate. If registration is made within three months after publication of the work or prior to an infringement of the work, statutory damages and attorney's fees will be available to the copyright owner in court actions. Otherwise, only an award of actual damages and profits is available to the copyright owner. Registration allows the owner of the copyright to record the registration with the U.S. Customs Service for protection against the importation of infringing copies.
Of the reasons to register set forth above, the most important are that a copyright owner
(i) cannot start a lawsuit for copyright infringement before registering, and
(ii) cannot secure statutory damages or attorneys' fees without registering.
With respect to (ii), the Copyright Act provides for statutory damages of up to $150,000 per infringement and attorneys fees. It is crucial that if the work has been published (that is released for sale), the registration occurs prior to any infringement. Otherwise, the plaintiff must prove actual damages, which can be difficult to quantify, or may equal a negligible amount unless the defendant earned a lot of money from the infringing work.
Also, attorneys' fees are only available for published works that are registered prior to the infringement. Similar to other litigation, a lawsuit for copyright infringement can take a great deal of work and time on the part of the attorney. That is why attorney fees can add up. It would be difficult or impossible to retain the services of an experienced copyright litigator without the potential for recovering attorney's fees.
Note that the only way to secure the benefits of copyright registration is to register with the U.S. Copyright Office. These benefits, contrary to a popular myth, cannot be obtained by sending a copy of your song or master to yourself (even by certified or registered mail).
How to Register
To register a work, including a song or a master, you need to submit a completed application form, a nonrefundable filing fee, and a nonreturnable copy of the work. Here are answers to the most important questions regarding registration:
Where to apply?
You can find and complete the copyright registration application online at copyright.gov/eco (eco is an acronym for Electronic Copyright Office).
How much will it cost?
The basic fee for registering any work, including a song or master, was raised from $35 to $55 in May 2014. However, the fee is still $35 for registering a single work by a single author.
What else needs to be done?
It is also necessary to provide a “deposit” of the work. This can be done by uploading an MP3, or you can print out a “shipping slip” to be enclosed with a CD and mail it to the Copyright Office within 30 days of applying for the registration.
Is it possible to register a sound recording and a song in one application?
Yes. To register a master and a song in one application, click on “Sound Recording” in the drop down menu in the part of the application asking for the type of work to be registered. Later in the application, there will be a page allowing you to claim music and lyrics as well as the sound recording.
The U.S. Copyright Office's website ( www.copyright.gov ) is an invaluable source of information not only on registration, but also on how copyright law protects songs and masters.
Multiple Writers and/or Producers
Any signatory to the split sheet can register the copyright in a song and/or master. They should include all the other signatories to the spreadsheet as joint “authors” in the application.
3. Register every song with the appropriate performing rights organization (PRO);
What is a PRO?
Any user of music that publicly performs a song must secure a license and pay a royalty to do so. Songwriters and their music publishers use Performing Rights Organizations (PROs) to collect these royalties. In the U.S. there are three: ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC. A fourth PRO, recently launched by music industry mogul Irving Azoff, is Global Music Rights, or GMR.
The PROs collect public performance royalties from radio, television, the internet as well as physical venues such as bars, nightclubs, concert halls, arenas, and other places where live or recorded music is played.
In order to collect public performance monies, you must be a member of one of the three PROs. Anyone can join ASCAP or BMI. SESAC, the smallest of the three, is selective.
When a song is registered with one of the PROs, the PRO will require the person registering the song to indicate the percent ownership of each writer. If the band has a manager, they can perform this function. The registration should reflect the breakdown of ownership in the split sheet. Even if no split sheet was ever signed, the registration will itself be a record of the percent ownership of each member in the band.
That's why each member with an interest in a song should check to see if the information supplied to the PRO is accurate.
It is also possible to register more than one song and/or sound recording at a time by carefully following the rules established by the Copyright Office. See Circular 1, Copyright Basics, p8.
However, it is important to note that if a recording is not released as a single, but is merely contained in an album, the album may be deemed to be “one work”, and statutory damages may be limited to one award per album. See the decision in Bryant v. Media Rights Productions, Inc., 603 F.3d 135 (2d Cir 2010)
“Based on a plain reading of the statute… infringement of an album should result in only one statutory damage award. The fact that each song may have received a separate copyright is irrelevant to this analysis.” Id.at 141.
4. Upload the set list of any live performance containing original songs for payment by their PRO.
Each of the PROs pays its writer and publisher affiliates for live performances at venues across the U.S. Basically, all the songwriter, who may also be an artist, has to do is submit a set list of songs performed at any venue showing which songs were written by them or them Generally, they or they must also provide the venue name, address, size of venue and the dates of the performance.
The songs must be registered first in order to complete this process.

5. Write up a simple agreement that no leaving member can use the name of the band without permission.
It's all about protecting the band name.
A band or musical group can handle the issue of who owns the name by using a form such as this:
Date: _______________
Re “__________” [Name of band]
This is to confirm that we, the sole members the above referenced band, hereby agree among ourselves that each member of the band is a joint owner of the name of the band, provided that no leaving member, whether that member leaves voluntarily or not, shall be able to use the name of the band in connection with the entertainment industry including the music business.
This Agreement contains the entire understanding of the parties hereto relating to the subject matter hereof and cannot be changed or terminated except by an instrument signed by all of the parties hereunder. The validity, interpretation and legal effect of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of _____ applicable to contracts wholly entered into and performed entirely within the State of _____. [Use the state where the band members reside]
Signature below will indicate agreement of the above.
Read and Agreed:

Note that sometimes a band will want to handle ownership of the band's name in a different manner than in the sample agreement. For instance, where two of the members founded the band and then added a third or more members later, the founders may want to exclusively own the rights in the name, or they may wish to allow leaving members the right to use the band's name, provided that the leaving member uses the words “formally of”.
For a band that wishes to treat the ownership or use of the band's name in a different manner than the sample agreement, it may be wise to hire a lawyer.

Los Angeles - Mumford and Sons say convincing people they're Irish is the secret of their success.
The Will Wait band are from England, but their use of traditional instruments - including accordion, mandolin and double bass - and close harmonies means some people mistake them for being from neighbouring Ireland.
Keyboard player Ben Lovett said: "Everyone thinks we're Irish. There's an Irish bar in every town - it's the secret of our success."
Banjo player Winston Marshall also points out the roots of their sound and some of their instruments, such as the banjo, aren't even from Europe, adding: "We're in a long line of English people pretending to be Americans and not being as good as Americans."
The band - also including Marcus Mumford and Ted Dwayne - are known for spending long periods touring around the world, particularly in the US, but aren't huge fans of having to do it in a bus.
Marcus added: "I went camping on a stag weekend and hated it. And you can't shit on the bus. You still brush your teeth outside and spit it out, just like on a campsite."

Centre for Cities study says London generates almost as much tax as the next 37 largest cities combined
London has cemented its position as Britain's number one taxpayer since the financial crash, leaving the government more dependent on the capital for its tax income. A study by the thinktank the Centre for Cities found that London generated almost as much tax as the next 37 largest cities combined and increased its share of “economy taxes” underpinning the Treasury's finances to 30%, up five percentage points since 2004/5.
Other major cities have seen little or no growth in their tax income over the past decade. The report found that while London generated nearly 25% more tax for the exchequer adjusted for inflation, Manchester's tax haul grew by only 1%, while it plunged in Birmingham, Glasgow and Leeds.
Elmbridge again comes top for income tax contributions Read more
A ring of towns around London ranked as the places with the fastest rising tax bases with only Derby, the home of Rolls-Royce and Toyota, and Aberdeen, which benefited from the oil boom from 2010 to 2014, in the top ten risers outside the south east. In proportional terms, the biggest loser was Northampton, down 11.7% over the 10 year period.
The report, which covers 62 cities, said: “In the face of political and economic uncertainty and potential shocks to the economy, the growing reliance on fewer places – and London in particular – to generate more revenues is a risky situation for the exchequer to be in compared to one where more cities are making a positive contribution to the national tax pot.”
The findings are likely to intensify debate about government plans to devolve powers and public spending to regional centres based around cities in the Midlands, the north and the west.
George Osborne has promoted a new scheme of “supermayors” covering major northern conurbations from Manchester and Leeds to Sheffield, and a cross county authority based in Exeter, as the first step in a plan to regenerate areas that have struggled to recover since the recession of 2009.
Sir Richard Leese, the Manchester city council leader, said: “This report underlines the need for devolution to help rebalance our economy. The economic imbalance and dominance of the south-east's economy is laid bare in the Centre for Cities' findings.
“The growth in south-east's national economy tax take to 30% makes the case for faster devolution to Greater Manchester and bigger slice of national infrastructure investment.”
The thinktank said the research revealed the loss of economic strength in places that mainly voted to leave the EU in the recent referendum.
Alexandra Jones, chief executive of Centre for Cities, said: “More must be done in the years ahead to strengthen the economies and tax bases of other city regions such as Greater Manchester, the West Midlands and the north-east, many of which voted strongly for Leave.”
Economy taxes are tied to economic growth, the report said, and include income tax and national insurance contributions, VAT, land and property taxes, corporation tax, capital gains tax, inheritance tax and stamp duty on shares.
The study, Ten Years of Tax: How Cities Contribute to the National Exchequer, found that as a whole Britain's cities are generating more tax for the government than 10 years ago, but urban areas that rely on a larger proportion of low skilled jobs to provide employment have seen the biggest falls.
The report said a near doubling in the threshold for paying income tax to £11,000 had taken thousands of low income workers out of paying tax. With more low income workers based in cities outside the south-east, the move reduced the amount of tax from the regions going to the exchequer. Burnley suffered a 35% drop in income tax receipts, Huddersfield 37% and Wigan 40%.
The report said the impact of the 2008 financial crash continued to be felt, with more than three quarters of British cities generating less income tax now than in their pre-recession peak. Swindon and Norwich generated 20% and 21% less overall income tax respectively in 2014/15 than immediately before the recession.
Wages have also dropped on average, dragged down by falls in pay for workers in more than two thirds of UK cities, despite an increase in the overall number of people in employment.
The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan said: “This report is further evidence of how London has become the main tax generator for the whole country and highlights the importance of more balanced growth across the entire UK as well as ensuring the capital's continuing success.
“Further devolution, so that London and all our cities and neighbourhoods can take back control, is vital to unleash the energy and dynamism that this country needs in the light of its decision to leave the EU.”

BANGKOK, Thailand -- Desperate to defuse Thailand's deepening political crisis, Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra dissolved Parliament's lower house on Monday and called early elections. But protesters seeking to topple them vowed to carry on their fight, saying they cannot win the polls because of corruption.
A decree from King Bhumibol Adulyadej scheduled the elections on Feb. 2 and named Yingluck as interim prime minister until then. The protesters demanded that they resign as caretaker and rejected the election date, putting the strongly royalist movement at odds with the royal decree.
Protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban, who faces an arrest warrant on insurrection charges, spoke to more than 150,000 followers at a stage outside Yingluck's offices, challenging authorities to "Come get me!"
They claimed that their movement was assuming some functions of government, citing a clause in the constitution stating that "the highest power is the sovereign power of the people."
"This means that from now on the people will appoint the prime minister of the people and appoint the government of the people," they told the cheering crowd.
They said a new prime minister and a non-elected "people's council" -- which has no basis in the constitution -- would work to end corruption in politics and keep Yingluck and their brother, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, from returning to power.
The opposition Democrat Party, allied with the protest movement, has been defeated by Thaksin-allied parties in every election since 2001, and is unlikely to win the new polls.
Thaksin, a former telecommunications billionaire, was toppled by a 2006 military coup that laid bare a deeper conflict between Thailand's elite and largely urban middle class on one side, and Thaksin's power base in the countryside on the other. That base benefited from their populist policies designed to win over the rural poor.
The two sides have been dueling for power, sometimes violently, since Thaksin was ousted for alleged corruption and abuse of power.
Yingluck announced the Parliament dissolution in a televised speech that broke into regular programming.
"We have given the power back to the people to decide and have elections according to the democratic system under the king," they said, their voice shaking. "We'll let the people decide what path the majority wants to take, and Thailand will take that path to administering the country."
Analysts said they may have had no alternative.
"My suspicion is that the military was not prepared to do anything to save the government," said Kevin Hewison, a senior scholar of Thai politics at Australia's Murdoch University. "Hence, Yingluck had little choice, and the dissolution may have been forced on them But the hard-liners will now demand more, and they have nothing to give."
After Yingluck called the elections, the United States said in a statement it supports the democratic process in Thailand, a long-time friend and ally.
"We encourage all involved to resolve political differences peacefully and democratically in a way that reflects the will of the Thai people and strengthens the rule of law," State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki said.
Suthep spoke three times Monday night, calling for civil servants to report to the protest group instead of the government, and urging citizens to set up their own neighbourhood peacekeeping forces to take over from police. The protesters have castigated the police for being zealous defenders of the government.
If we lose to the "Thaksin regime," they said, "we will be their slaves until we die."
It was unclear how those ideas could be achievable, since Suthep, who resigned as an opposition lawmaker last month, controls no administrative structure for anyone to report to.
A measure of political calm that was restored when Yingluck took office two years ago was upended last month by an attempt by their party to pass a bill that would have granted amnesty to Thaksin and others. Thaksin fled overseas in 2008 to avoid a corruption conviction they say was politically motivated.
Them government was forced to abandon the amnesty attempt, but the move stoked the long-simmering anti-Thaksin movement.
The Democrat Party added to the political pressure on Sunday when its lawmakers resigned en masse. It held 153 of the 500 seats in the lower house.
Since the latest unrest began last month, at least five people have been killed and at least 289 injured. Violence ended suddenly last week as both sides paused to celebrate the birthday of the king, who turned 86 last Thursday.

Dear Brother Albright,
On January 5, 1985, Elder Jeff Keeney of Tempe, Arizona, in response to a request by their mission president, sat down in the chapel in Chevy Chase, Maryland, to answer this question, “Describe the most spiritual experience of your mission.” Pausing a few moments, they wrote the following:
“It began last December, early one morning, when the phone rang. On the other line, we heard those wonderful words, “Elder, I've got a hot one for you!” Elder Sackley, the director of the Washington D.C. Temple Visitors Center, had someone who wanted to be taught the Gospel.
Several days later, I met them for the first time. They portrayed the image of an intelligent-looking business person who carried an attachment case and was sharply dressed. Each discussion was uplifting and spiritual, but also, an intellectual, verification of the clearness of the restored gospel. Previous to our teaching him, they had purchased many books about the doctrine of the Church. They knew a considerable amount about the Church's teachings, but ran into a lot of anti-Mormon literature.
Often they had questions typed up ready to ask us. After the discussions, we often felt mentally and physically drained. Our final appointment was dinner at their apartment on Capitol Hill. As we talked, we felt impressed by the Holy Ghost to bear testimony of the need for them to humble themselves and pray and ask God whether or not the things we had taught them were true. They agreed to fast and pray on the upcoming Sunday.
The next day, while on exchange with another missionary, I stopped in at the Visitors' Center for a moment, and Elder Sackley asked to speak with me. We went into a room and there was our business person investigator who said, “I want to be baptized tomorrow!” I was speechless at first from shock, but then quickly said, “Fantastic!”
I will never forget their baptism and the keen effect it had on my life. As they went down into the water to be baptized, it brought tears of joy to my eyes. As I left the baptism that night I felt as though nothing in the world around me could bother me and I could bask in the spirit of this experience for many months. As the scriptures say, “My joy was full.”
Jeff Keeney was not just a good missionary, they were a GREAT missionary, and they aren't just a great missionary, they were MY missionary! The investigator they wrote about, and the very last baptism of their mission, was me, Kerry Harding.
How did I go from being an anti-Mormon member of a protestant denomination to being absolutely certain that there was only one church on earth with the authority to administer all the ordinances of the Gospel and that mine wasn't it? It began with a man named Bob Heightchew, my work supervisor, who motivated me to sit down for my first missionary discussion. Their love, their example and their patience, led to my conversion and baptism. When I first found out they were a member of the LDS Church, I was stunned. They were smart, handsome, funny, athletic and immensely well-liked by everyone around him. They just didn't fit the stereotype of what I thought at the time was a member of a non-Christian cult.
Over the weeks ahead, I decided I would rescue Bob and convert them to my faith. I asked them to attend my church. They accepted, with the condition that, in return, I attend his. They came to my church meeting. The service was uneventful. The next week I attended their LDS ward in Virginia. It happened to coincide with Fast Sunday. The service was different than any I had ever seen in my life. Unplanned and unscripted, member after member walked up to the pulpit and spoke about the importance of the Savior in their lives. I thought to myself, “For a church that's not supposed to be Christian, they sure are spending a lot of time talking about Christ.” A verse kept coming into my head, “By their fruits, ye shall know them.” If I was wrong about this major aspect of the Mormon Church, was it possible that I was wrong about other things I had heard as well?
The chink in my “armor” was exposed. Later, my friend's simple invitation, “I'd like you to come to a fireside at my home next Monday,” would forever transform my life and change my destiny.
Before I was baptized at the age of 30, my philosophy of life could best be described by the popular phrase, “It's all about me.” Armed with an architecture degree and an MBA, everyone told me I was on the fast track. Every girl I dated, every party I attended, every friend I made, was guided by one question: “How will this help my career?”
I was materialistic, shallow and selfish. Busy climbing the ladder of success, I couldn't be bothered with the needs of those on the rungs below. I was stubborn at first. I thought I could pick and choose what doctrines to believe and what to reject like an la carte menu. Gradually, I realized that I needed to humble myself and pray for God's will in my life. Getting to that point alone was the biggest hurdle to my progress.
The missionaries and I had many intellectual debates about the Gospel. Eventually, every major question I had had was resolved and they said, “We have taught you everything you need to know. What you do now is up to you.” At first, I knew what I should do. The more I thought and prayed about it, I finally knew what I had to do and, on New Year's Eve, 1984, I knelt down, alone in my apartment to pray to know whether or not I should join this church.
My answer came immediately and the physical sensation was exactly has it had been described it would be. The following Monday, I asked my friend Bob what they were doing the following night. When they said they didn't have any plans, I asked them how he'd like to go to a baptism. “That'd be great,” they responded. “Whose?” “Mine,” I said. “Harding,” they asked somewhat bewildered, “You're getting baptized?” It turned out that, just the day before, their wife asked them if they thought I would ever join the church and they had been pretty skeptical. What a difference a day makes!
After my baptism, things changed rapidly. My coworkers, upon learning of my baptism, first accused me of converting just to get in good with the boss. However, they soon saw that I no longer drank coffee at meetings or martinis at after-work happy hours. They noticed that I was becoming less of a jerk and more concerned about helping others succeed around the firm. I went less and less to parties after work and more frequently to church activities, not because I was expected to, but because it made me happier to be around people who wanted to become better individuals.
My family expressed their concern that I was making a huge mistake. Would this peculiar new faith of mine make me seem out of place when we got together? Would it monopolize my time so much that there would be no room left for them? Gradually, they came to see that my joining the church made me a better person in every way.
I was now kinder, gentler, happier, and more patient, generous and loving towards them than I had ever been before. Furthermore, the Church's focus on genealogy increased my interest in and attention to my extended family and my desire to learn about their life stories and family histories. This built bridges of friendship with distant relatives. Though none of my family has yet to join the church, they now have a great deal of respect and admiration for it.
A couple of years ago, my mother told me that in their Methodist Sunday School class, they were discussing “Mormons” and one participant remarked, “Everyone knows that they're not Christian.” Normally one to keep quiet in situations like this, my mother turned to this woman and said: “You know, my son is a Mormon. I've been to their church services many times and I think that they are probably much better Christians than we are.”
As I look back on all the decisions I've made along the way, I sometimes wonder what my life and the lives of others around me would have been like had I not knelt down that cold New Years Eve in 1984, to pray to know for myself whether or not the things that missionaries had taught me were true. My life, as it is now, simply would not have existed. My wife, my children, my career, my friends — all would be different because they have been inextricably connected to my decision to become a Latter-day Saint. The lives of many others would have been different as well.
Shortly before they left Washington to go home to Tempe, Arizona in 1985, I said to my missionary Elder Keeney, “How can I ever thank you for what you did for me?” Jokingly they replied, “I don't know…maybe you can name your first born son after me.” Twenty years later, our first-born son, David returned honorably home after having served as a missionary for two years in, ironically, Tempe, Arizona. During David's time there, among the 16 people they taught and baptized, was a prominent Arizona artist named John Burton. A direct descendent of Mormon pioneer John Taylor, their grandparents fell away from the Church and they were raised as a member of another faith. While taking a shortcut across a cotton field one day, my son David stumbled on to John Burton, painting in the desert. They struck up an unusually close friendship and later, David would teach them the lessons that led to their baptism. Recently, they and their wife were married for eternity in the Arizona Temple and they now have a son.
In another example, George Waskiewicz, the leader of a white supremist gang, met my other missionary son, John, while at a dinner appointment in the New York South mission. Elder John Harding clicked with George and shared a spiritual message that resonated with him. That message led to an appointment, which led to a series of discussions. George was baptized and they and their wife were recently married for eternity in the Washington, DC Temple.
The endings of both of these stories are yet to be written. I love being a part of the great, exciting work of helping to spread it to “every nation, kindred, tongue and people.” I know that I have a Heavenly Father who knows me, who loves me, so much so that they sent their Son, Jesus Christ, to be my Savior. By following them and keeping their commandments, I can live in their presence again someday. That seems like a pretty good deal.
Sincerely,
Kerry Harding
MONROVIA, Liberia — Liberians have become accustomed to living with demons.
Long before Ebola arrived, the people here endured 14 years of civil war, one that snuffed out 200,000 lives and ignited acts of barbarism that laid waste to the country. The war produced mad generals who led ritual sacrifices of children before going into battle, naked except for shoes and a gun. It produced amphetamine-fueled 10-year-old fighters wielding M16s while toting teddy bear backpacks, and rapists who wore Halloween masks and wedding gowns.
When it finally ended in 2003, what was left was a nation of survivors, a place where nearly every person of a certain age has a painful story to tell.
I know this all too well, as a native Liberian who emigrated to the United States. My family has our own war stories. One sister was kidnapped and fought to protect their 1-year-old son while marching for days behind rebel lines. Another sister sent their son away to avoid the war and spent two years — two years — hiding deep up country in an area known only as Territory 3C, far from the worst of the conflict, after witnessing gunmen disembowel a co-worker in front of their son.
I have long stopped asking people what happened to them during the war. But as I moved in recent weeks around this city where I was born, reporting about the Ebola epidemic, I was aware of this: There is a strength here that I had never before realized.
My friend Wael Hariz, a Lebanese citizen living here who had been away for a couple of months, said they came back in late September expecting the worst, after watching the coverage of Ebola overseas. Standing just off Tubman Boulevard, Monrovia's main road, at midday, they looked at the cars, taxis and pedestrians going by.
“I had forgotten, after what they've been through, how resilient people here are,” they said.
They came by that resilience the hard way. This is a staggeringly beautiful place, where tropical rain forests give way to pure white sandy beaches dotted by coconut trees. But the average Liberian lives on $1.25 a day, has no access to clean water and does not have a flush toilet at home.
I don't usually review hardware here, but I think this device stands out as being particularly useful to people who take a lot of notes and/or read a lot of research papers.
I read about the Sony Digital Paper DPT-S1 for the first time about a year ago and couldn't help but be impressed. It promises the ease of reading of e-ink combined with a size that is amicable to academic papers and on top of that allows you to actively annotate the documents with a pen as you read them. It also sports the usual e-ink 3 weeks of battery life. Luckily enough, I managed to get one of my very own right before Lambda Jam 2014 and so had the perfect opportunity to give it a spin in a real use case kind of setting.
Reading Papers
Reading and marking up papers in PDF format is where this device shines.
You simply swipe to turn pages, and it works every time. There's even pinch zoom. The screen is large enough that you can easily read an entire page without zooming, as was always the problem I had with my first gen e-ink kindle (also the DPT-S1 weighs substantially less). You even get multiple tabs in a workspace so you can swap between different documents quickly for cross-reference.
In this context it's a better Kindle DX (now discontinued) that you can take notes on. For me (and for many others I suspect) reading a paper is a very interactive experience. You want to be able to highlight the important parts and even scribble in the margins as you move through it. The DPT-S1 supports this better than any device I have seen yet.
As you can see here you can not only write directly on the paper, but you can also highlight. These are both done with the included stylus for which the standard function is writing but changes to highlighting if you hold down the button on its side. You may also notice the little boxes in the margin of the text, these are collapsible notes.
As you can see, the darker square in the top right margin is here opened and available for writing. Also please note that these notes were taken by me (with horrible handwriting in general) on the way to Lambda Jam, in a squished economy seat of an airplane, while there was some mild turbulence. While the handwriting isn't paper-perfect it's much better than other devices I've used in the past, including the iPad.
One of the best features of the DPT-S1 is also its most limiting: It's designed to work only with PDF files. The big benefit of this is that all of these writing annotations actually turn into PDF annotations on the given file. This makes them extremely easy to export and use in other contexts.
Taking Notes
The other big use case I had in mind for the DPT-S1 was taking notes. I always carry a notebook of some form and over the last three years I've managed to create quite a lot of non-indexed content.
I usually carry one notebook for notes/exploring ideas, another for planning things (like to-do lists and such), and finally one small one for writing down thoughts on the go. This stack doesn't include notes from talks I've attended or my Coursera class notes. It also doesn't include the giant stack of hand annotated papers in my office, but that's more to do with the previous section.
I took pages and pages of notes on the DPT-S1 at Conal Elliott‘s talk at Lambda Jam (great presentation by the way). Here's a side by side comparison with some paper notes I've written in the past.
As you can see, my handwriting isn't great as I tend to go kind of fast and sloppy when not looking at the paper, but the DPT-S1 holds up rather well. I think it would do even better for someone with nicer handwriting than I.
There is one somewhat annoying downside, and that's that when you make a new notebook pdf to take notes it only has 10 pages and you have to give it a name with the software keyboard input (it defaults to a date and time based name). This slowed me down big time in the talk because they were moving very fast toward the end, and that's precisely when I ran out of pages. Still, given how well polished the rest of the device is it's something I can overlook.
Browsing the Web
The final use case for the DPT-S1 is web browsing. This isn't something I really need as my phone usually does a pretty good job at this, but it could be nice to have for reading blogs and such so I'll touch on it.
As you can see here, Hacker News DataTau is actually quite navigable in this format.
My blog actually renders quite well and is very readable, you can scroll by swiping up and down. Pinch-zoom works here too.
I went to several sites and they all worked well enough, but given that this device is WiFi only I don't expect I'll be using it much for reading blog posts on the go.
Conclusion
If you're looking for a cheap consumer device that you can easily buy e-books for you should look elsewhere. It's expensive (~$1000 usd), hard to acquire (you have to email and talk to sales agents), and has no store, no API (only the filesystem), and only supports PDF.
However, if you're like me in that you take a lot of notes and you read a lot of papers, and you don't mind spending a bit of money on something to solve a major problem in your life, this is by far the best device on the market for your needs.
Please note, that while they are available on amazon, it's the imported Japanese language version. Currently the only way to get an english version DPT-S1 is through contacting the sales team at WorlDox.

Another would be muslim terrorist was arrested on Friday for terrorism and conspiracy to commit terrorism.
From Tucsonnewsnow.com:
Mahin Khan, who turned 18 just two weeks ago, was arrested Friday afternoon at their Tucson home, said Mia Garcia, a spokesperson for the Arizona Attorney General's office.
 They are facing two charges: terrorism and conspiracy to commit terrorism, Garcia said.
Khan is accused of conspiring to commit acts of terrorism against government buildings in Pima and Maricopa counties, although what acts and which buildings are not available.
“We asked the judge to seal the records to protect our investigation before we made the arrest,” Garcia said, adding that the records will likely be unsealed within the next week.
There are no other outstanding suspects and no threat to public safety at this time, they said.
Additionally, authorities are not aware of any threats specific to the Fourth of July holiday or holiday weekend, they said.
“The timing of the arrest has nothing to do with the Fourth of July,” Garcia said.
Khan is being held in the Maricopa County Jail.

Open source project customers Debian and GNOME announce plans to migrate communities to GitLab; applaud the direction
SAN FRANCISCO - November 1, 2017 - GitLab, a software product used by 2/3 of all enterprises, today announced it was abandoning the industry-standard Contributor License Agreement (CLA) in favor of a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) and license. The DCO gives developers greater flexibility and portability for their contributions. The move has already attracted the attention of large open source projects who recognize the benefits. Debian and GNOME both plan to migrate their communities and open source projects to GitLab.
GitLab's move away from a CLA is meant to modernize its code hosting and collaborative development infrastructure for all open source projects. Additionally, requiring a CLA became problematic for developers who didn't want to enter into legal terms; they weren't reviewing the CLA contract and they effectively gave up their rights to own and contribute to open source code.
“Many large open source projects want to be masters of their own destiny, but overly restrictive licensing can be a barrier to attracting talented contributors and driving innovation in the project,” said Sid Sijbrandij, CEO at GitLab. “With a DCO and license, developers no longer have to surrender their work and enter into legal terms. They will now have the freedom to contribute to open-source code and the flexibility to leverage their contributions as they need.”
In comparison, other platforms, like GitHub, Phabricator, Jenkins, and Elastic, all currently require a CLA. For established companies, a shift of this magnitude is not easy. But after evaluating the needs of larger open source projects such as Debian and GNOME, GitLab came to the conclusion that a DCO would better suit their efforts to modernize code hosting and collaborative-development infrastructure.
“We're thrilled to see GitLab simplifying and encouraging community contributions by switching from a CLA to the DCO,” said Chris Lamb, Debian Project Leader. “We recognize that making a change of this nature is not easy and we applaud the time, patience and thoughtful consideration GitLab has shown here.”
"We applaud GitLab for dropping their CLA in favor of a more OSS-friendly approach," said Carlos Soriano, Board Director at GNOME. "Open source communities are born from a sea of contributions that come together and transform into projects. This gesture affirmed GitLab's willingness to protect the individual, their creative process, and most importantly, keeps intellectual property in the hands of the creator."
In addition to moving toward DCO, GitLab will take internal actions to review code that is submitted, to help minimize the likelihood of anything problematic entering the base. GitLab has already begun making the switch with no added steps necessary from their user base. For more information on what this means for the broader GitLab community, please visit this link.

TL;DR: Missing authentication combined with a simple Insecure Direct Object Reference vulnerability allowed to overtake a selection of temporary locked Instagram accounts. An extrapolation of the PoC account range learned that 4% of all existing & active Instagram accounts (approx. 500 million) were in a vulnerable locked state (approx. 20 million). Facebook fixed the vulnerability within a day and granted a $5.000 bounty 10 days later.
Issue
It was a while ago that I actually hunted for vulnerabilities in Instagram when I logged back in to one of my test accounts. I have spent most of my free time in 2016 presenting about Instagram vulnerabilities I found in 2015. After providing valid credentials, I was immediately redirected to a page which told me I had to verify my account, probably due to inactivity. The option that was offered to me was to verify by email, as I didn't link any phone number to this account yet:
The URL revealed the issue: this page was actually accessible without being authenticated (“checkpoint_logged_out_main”) and contained my Instagram test account's unique user id. Now, even if I were to land on the same “Verify by Email” page of other accounts, it would have no direct security impact, as I don't have access to my victims' email addresses. However, an enumeration of one million accounts in the range 2.000.000000-2.001.000000 (Instagram has incremental user ids 🙂 ) yielded the following interesting results:
Verify account via Captcha: 1.099 accounts (0.1%)
These might have been accounts that were observed to perform spamming. No direct security impact.
Verify account via email / SMS: 1.960 accounts (0.2%)
This was the same case as for my test account: No direct security impact.
Update email address & verify account: 1.690 accounts (0.17%)
Now this is where things got interesting. This page allowed me to update the email address of the temporary locked account, which is a big deal. Once an attacker could set the email address linked to an Instagram account, he/she could perform a password reset via email and gain full access to it. Big security impact, but only 0.17% accounts affected in the one million range.
Update phone number & verify account: 38.808 accounts (3.88%)
This case was the most troublesome, as an attacker could on one hand gather sensitive user information (pre-filled phone number in some cases), and on the other hand simply update the phone number linked to the victim Instagram account. After successfully linking a new phone number, an attacker could perform the “reset password via SMS” scenario and gain complete access to the account. Big security impact, and almost 4% of all accounts affected in the one million range. A quick manual verification also learned that these were mostly human accounts which had been inactive for a couple of weeks, of which many had a good amount of followers on Instagram.
Note that I could not immediately get any of my test accounts in the “phone number verification” state and thus did not perform an actual account takeover scenario, since I couldn't reproduce this on my test accounts directly. This is the only thing you can do when adhering to responsible disclosure – never touch existing accounts! I explicitly mentioned this to Facebook while reporting, in order to avoid any confusion. I believe this is the responsibility of all bug bounty hunters, despite the fact that it might result in lower bounties in some edge cases. The required trust relationship between researchers and bug bounty providers in the eco-system relies on this, which is still too often under pressure currently.
Remediation
Facebook fixed the issue within 24 hours, by enforcing authentication on the pages that allow to update profile information such as email address and/or phone number.

The Greater Evil
France's Bumbling Search for a Candidate to Stop Le Pen
In the race for the French presidency, one candidate after the other has stumbled. Conservative François Fillon's campaign is the latest to come undone after reports of financial irregularities involving their wife. Who will be the one to stand up to Marine Le Pen?

Europeans are keeping close tabs on France in this decisive election year, and the French are giving them plenty to watch. Three months before the final round of voting in the presidential election on May 7, a good portion of the political establishment has already been weeded out of the race. And it currently looks as though the purge won't be slowing down any time soon.
Currently, a big question mark is hovering over the future career of François Fillon, who had looked until last week like one of the most promising contenders. But then, as the newspaper Le Canard enchaîné put it, a "gigantic stain appeared on their white vest." But Fillon's travails are only the most recent in a string of absurdities that have dogged the French campaign.
Right from the get go, President François Hollande's disastrous showing in the polls prevented him, the incumbent, from running for re-election. Their prime minister Manuel Valls, once one of the country's most popular politicians, also got derailed as the Socialist Party's replacement candidate in the primary. And "omnipresident" Nicolas Sarkozy fared equally poorly in the conservative party's primary. The early vote also wiped out the prospects of the man who had led all the polls: Alain Juppé, the aging mayor of Bordeaux, who at times looked almost like they already had one foot in the door at Élysée Palace, the French White House.
Now the slate of contenders, with or without Fillon, has completely changed and is considerably more exciting than what had been anticipated only a few short weeks ago. France's third most popular sport behind football and rugby -- that of calculating the probability of every possible (and impossible) post-election coalition -- has begun filling myriad columns and television programs.
What would happen if the entire left, including the Communists, the Greens and the rest were to finally join forces and field a joint candidate? Can the highly gifted Emmanuel Macron, a man in their late thirties, really launch a movement out of nowhere and catapult themselves to the helm of the French state within just a few months with their breezy "neither left nor right" course? Does left-wing radical Jean-Luc Mélanchon, mocked as a "YouTube Che Guevara" by their opponents, stand a chance of gaining more than the 10 percent support they have now? And what was the name of the guy running for the Greens again? Jabot? Jadot?
A Compelling Election
This much is certain: It's going to be an exciting election, in no small part thanks to France's grassroots-promoting practice of holding open presidential primaries. The Socialists were the first to test it years ago, and the conservatives are following suit this time around. Both were also forced to realize that primary voters pay little heed to polls or probability theories, but are instead more likely to inject deep polarization into the political system.
DER SPIEGEL
In the left-wing camp, Benoît Hamon, a man largely unknown abroad, won the candidacy. In France though, Hamon is well-known as the leader of the revolt within the Socialist party against the French president's "social democratic" course, a moniker which, in the French interpretation, means the overly centrist and wishy-washy path pursued by Hollande.
Prior to Hamon's crowning, primary voters had picked Fillon to be the candidate for the conservative party which was recently rechristened as the Republicans. Though Fillon, an avowed Catholic, has served as a minister in several governments and also spent a number of years as prime minister, they hadn't been seen as a likely candidate and their triumph essentially came out of nowhere.
Insufficient Morals
For some time after that, many considered Fillon -- a staunchly conservative, serious candidate -- to be the front runner in the march to Élysée Palace. Now, though, it looks like their run has come to a sudden end. For as much a Fillon is fond of preaching about morals and decency, they themselves don't seem to possess much of either.
Le Canard enchaîné, an odd newspaper with its mix of gossip and satire, published a report last week providing proof that Fillon had hired their own wife Penelope as a fake, but very well paid, parliamentary assistant. Last Wednesday, Canard then admitted it had made a mistake -- and then revised the figures upwards. The paper now claims that Penelope Fillon earned 831,440 euros from their husband over the course of several years -- a shockingly large sum that doesn't befit a man who is proposing drastic austerity for their country.
Despite the scandal, Fillon has said they won't drop out of the race and spent last week angrily and vehemently denying the allegations. They described themselves as being the victim of a "professional smear campaign" against them conducted by "those in power, on the left." The aim, they claimed, was to shoot down the "exalted idea of France" they promoted. Only hours after those statements, however, breaking news emerged of further incriminating information, including the broadcasts of parts of a television interview with Penelope recorded years ago in which they say they had never worked at any time as an assistant to their husband, belying the couple's efforts last week to prove that the payments to Penelope had been legitimate.
Welcome News for Marine
Now, even if Fillon survives as a candidate, they will be so damaged that they have virtually no chance of winning. Last week, in fact, their own party began discussing a "Plan B" so openly that it was almost disrespectful. Juppé is one possible replacement candidate being discussed, but the names of some young conservatives have also been circulating. Regardless, none of these alternatives would be as capable of taking voters away from Marine Le Pen and their project "Marine 2017" as the pre-scandal Fillon would have been.
This, of course, is welcome news for Marine Le Pen, who transformed the fascist clique surrounding their father into a modern party, the right-wing populist Front National, with them at the center. Over the weekend, they introduced "140 proposals for France" as they launched the main segment of their campaign. Yet even as they hit the stump, they are comfortably secure in the knowledge that they have the support of at least one-quarter of the country's voters no matter what they say and no matter what others might say about them
They have been accused of having systematically misappropriated EU funds for party purposes in the European Parliament.  They are no longer able to hide the fact that they are sparring over the direction of the party with their own niece, Marion Maréchal-Le Pen. But it doesn't matter: Them polling numbers have remained constant at 25 percent, indicating that it is very likely they will attract enough voters to make it into the second round of voting in the presidential election.
Who Will Challenge Front National?
The only question is who will be their challenger? Who will become the "lesser of two evils" of this campaign?
Will it be Socialist candidate Hamon, with their foolhardy plan of introducing an unconditional basic income for all French, starting at 600 euros and later rising to 750 euros? The plan would likely lead to 380 billion euros in additional annual spending for the French government.
Or will it be Emmanuel Macron? There is no doubt that they have the charisma of a leader, but they also have some weaknesses that make them prone to attack, including two that could become particularly dangerous. The first is a resume that is hardly consistent with the image of a young hero shaking up an ossified political system. Macron studied at France's elite École nationale d'administration (ENA), he's a wealthy former banker who worked at Rothschild before becoming an adviser to François Hollande. They have long been part of the elite on which they have declared war.
Then there's Macron's second problem: With the exception of a relatively refreshing and clear commitment to the European Union, at least for a Frenchman, they don't have much of a platform. They have said they will announce their plans in late February, once their movement's hundreds of thousands of volunteers, organized in working groups across the country, assemble policy proposals on diverse issues. If this operation is successful and Macron does indeed produce a coherent political platform, it will represent yet another grassroots miracle for France.
But is such a thing even possible? Can a new political course -- neither left nor right, but simply correct and good -- really be formulated by the masses? There is plenty of hope surrounding Macron, but mockery is never far away. A French comedian could be heard last week on the radio, still an important opinion-shaping media in France, saying that washing machines have more programs than Macron. Recent polls showed them pulling in 23 percent of the vote. Leftist Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a man who thinks quite highly of themselves and their ideas, stands at around 10 percent. Mélenchon is promising to allow people to retire at the age of 60 and draw full pension benefits and is calling for a monthly minimum wage of 1,300 euros. They want France and the European Union to recognize Palestine as a state, they are calling for France to withdraw from NATO and is demanding the renegotiation of the EU treaties. Next.
Indeed, a look at the line-up of candidates with three months to go before the final round of the election leads one unavoidably to the conclusion that the greatest threat facing Front National and presidential candidate Marine Le Pen is the party itself. The good news, though, is that the party has always proven adept at defeating itself in the past.
When the business daily Les Echos, for example, takes a closer look at the particularly unrealistic proposals made on the campaign trail, Le Pen is high on the list. I plans to withdraw from the EU and the common currency would lead to a national disaster, including a currency collapse and an explosion of new debt. And beyond the economy, Le Pen is still broadly considered to be unelectable because they have yet to completely disassociate themselves from their radical right-wing father Jean-Marie, who founded the Front National party.
And beyond being realistic about the economic aspects, French voters are also unlikely to vote for Le Pen in the end because they ultimately haven't done much to distance themselves from the stench left behind by their father and party founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, a Holocaust denier with neo-Nazi ties.
Speaking in Code
A speech they gave in September in the town of Fréjus is still presented on their website as a policy cornerstone of their movement. The dystopian sermon portrays France as a country under seige by alien powers of all kinds.
It invokes a reclamation of Gallic France facing a noble battle of life and death. It opposes the false liberal doctrine of our time, multiculturalism and, of course, Europe. Throughout the speech -- sometimes between the lines, sometimes overt -- there is a whiff of a xenophobic, ethnic-nationalist and exclusionist and backward ideology.
Le Pen, together with their recently assembled team of smart young men, attempts to disguise this message for the broader public, but it remains a constant strategic tight-rope walk. They must serve up hard-core slogans to their hard core of voters, but must avoid scaring off the rest of the electorate. To do so, as their Fréjus speech makes clear, they have developed a kind of secret language that one could describe as right-wing radical doublespeak. Cognizant supporters hear a different message in their speeches than does the public at large -- and that is the strategy the Le Pen is following in their attempt to find their way into the Élysée.
They have also been seeking to enter the orbit of others with pertinent experience. Le Pen was recently spotted drinking coffee at an ice cream parlor in Trump Tower in New York. There are also rumors that the notorious U.S. web portal Breitbart News, which paved the ideological path for Donald Trump, plans to expand into the French market.
Still, it remains unlikely that Marine Le Pen will become France's president. The polls may show them making it into the second round of voting, but once there, the current data also shows that they would likely be defeated by an opposing candidate, no matter who it is. At the moment, for example, polls show Macron getting 65 percent of votes in a run-off against Le Pen. One of the certainties you can rely on in France is that Le Pen is constantly seen as the greater of two evils.
Still, the rest of Europe is gripped by a feeling of uneasiness as it looks to France in this decisive election year. People haven't forgotten that it looked as though Brexit wasn't going to happen until the British actually did vote to leave. And in the U.S., there was widespread confidence, even a week before the election, that Donald Trump wouldn't win.
In France, the party primaries followed the exact same pattern: the favorites, praised by those in the Paris bubble and in the media, all lost. And outsiders won. Will that trend continue? We won't know until May.
Android has been struggling to pull tablet market share away from the iPad with all the effectiveness of waves crashing against the rocks. Google has developed a more focused (and non-open source) variant of Android with Honeycomb, but users haven't been flocking to it. What a kick in the pants it would be if it was Amazon that finally had success with Android on a tablet.
It's not just Google's pride that could be injured if the new Kindle Fire takes off; the bottom line could take a hit too. Amazon is technically using Android, but it's not Google's vision of Android and there are no Google apps on board. The Fire might realign the tablet market in a big way, to the detriment of Google's tablets.
Consumer perception and success
The Kindle Fire is leveraging the much beloved Kindle brand to lure in users. People trust Amazon and they love their Kindles. This is a device that will do everything that their Kindle does, but more. To an average user, this doesn't feel like a simplified Android tablet; it's a really smart Kindle. Holiday shoppers are going to go looking for a Kindle, and come out with a tablet.
The Kindle Fire is running Android, but it might as well not be. Just like the Nook Color, the entire UI has been replaced with the custom interface. In fact, The Fire is even more of a departure from Android than the Nook Color. Since this is not an officially blessed Google device, there is no Android or Google branding on it. This is Amazon's show, and Google won't get any of the publicity for it. App sales are also going to be managed through Amazon, so Google won't get a piece of that pie either.
For the average technology consumer, Android on a tablet is not a very approachable experience. Taking a tablet, simplifying the UI and slapping the Kindle name on it is going to work wonders. It's going to be Amazon's fierce retail might and consumer trust that make this device a win; and it's going to win without Google's help.
Price pressure
When the HP TouchPad came down in price during the fire sale, we speculated that pumping the market full of $99 tablets could push consumers away from $500 devices in the future. Of course, the main argument against that is the limited availability of the TouchPad. Well, here we have a perfectly capable device that clocks in at just $199. That's far cheaper than any Honeycomb tablet.
We're already seeing Honeycomb tablets languish as they sell for slightly higher or lower than the iPad. With a competent Android tablet from Amazon at $200, things are going to get hairy the next time Samsung asks for $479 for a tablet.
The response to this $200 device is going to be huge. We have to remember that it was just a little over a year ago that the old eInk Kindle 2 was selling for $260. Now users will be able to get a color Kindle tablet for less than that. When viewed from this angle, it's hard to see how a non-iPad tablet costing more than twice as much can be appealing to a wide audience.
The only way that Google can keep their footing and survive in the tablet game, is to aggressively attack the low end. If they can approach the price of the Fire, but offer a fuller feature set, some users could be persuaded to go with a Google experience device. The high-end $400-500 device will still be there, but that's not where all the action is going to be.
Just enough polish
Why is it that a simple device like the Fire could disrupt Android tablets? Because it's good enough. People like the iPad, there is no doubt about that. And that's just the thing; they like the iPad, not tablets in general. When was the last time you heard a non-techy friend talk about how much they wanted a Galaxy Tab? Ice Cream Sandwich tablets might be phenomenal, but mainstream Android tablets will still have a credibility problem.
When we're talking about the overwhelming majority of consumers, they either want an iPad, or something that is much cheaper and is ‘just good enough'. That's the Kindle Fire. Amazon has developed an easy-to-use interface loaded it with content that people already own in many cases, and offered enough unique features that people won't regret buying it.
It is this scenario that may be Google's biggest problem when it comes to the Fire. Look at how Android on phones evolved. First it was for uber-nerds, then as the months wore on, and no credible iPhone competitor showed up, Android improved by leaps and bounds. When Android 2.x hit the scene, users responded by buying phones and haven't stopped since. Lower priced devices and easier to use software saved Android.
By slipping a cheap and polished tablet into the market, Amazon has essentially thrown up a road block in Google's way. The path that Android on phones took is no longer accessible to the Big G. There is not time for Google to slowly beat up on the iPad anymore; they need to take action to survive.
Successful ventures are not made exclusively by retaining a contingent of highly-savvy (dare we say nerdy?) fans. If this were the case, Firefly would be entering its ninth season about now after winning every Emmy, every year. Amazon's tablet will appeal to consumers by being an acceptable alternative to the iPad, not better than it. Real Android tablets might end up marginalized in this situation, unless Google acts. Low-price and high-quality are opposing forces, but we never said it was going to be easy for Google and its partners.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A longtime al Qaeda operative and key figure in the so-called Khorasan Group, Muhsin al-Fadhli, was killed in a U.S. air strike while travelling in a vehicle in northwestern Syria two weeks ago, the Pentagon said on Tuesday.
Al-Fadhli, who had previously been targeted and believed by some U.S. officials to have been killed, was travelling in a vehicle on July 8 near Sarmada, Syria, west of Aleppo, when they were hit by an air strike, the Pentagon said.
They “was a senior al Qaeda facilitator who was among the few trusted al Qaeda leaders that received advanced notification of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks,” Navy Captain Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesperson, said in a statement.
Al-Fadhli was involved in attacks in October 2002 against U.S. Marines on Faylaka Island in Kuwait and against the French ship MV Limburg, Davis said.
“He was the leader of a network of veteran al-Qaeda operatives, sometimes called the Khorasan group, who are plotting external attacks against the United States and our allies and partners,” Davis added.
Khorasan is a term for the area in Afghanistan and Pakistan where al Qaeda's main council is thought to be hiding. The militants moved to Syria after the civil war erupted there and were believed to be aiding al Qaeda's Syrian affiliate, the Nusra Front.
U.S. officials have described Khorasan as a particularly menacing faction of militants who have been using their sanctuary in Syria to try to organise plots to attack U.S. and other Western targets, possibly including airliners.
Al-Fadhli, who was born in Kuwait, was targeted in a U.S. air strike on Sept. 23, 2014. The SITE monitoring service, a U.S.-based organisation that tracks militant groups online, reported later that month that a jihadist had tweeted condolences over their death.
A U.S. official speaking on condition of anonymity said later that al-Fadhli was believed to have been killed, but the Pentagon and White House said they were not able to confirm that.
“We want to make sure that he's not trying to, in effect, fake their death and go underground,” the then-White House deputy national security adviser, Tony Blinken, told Fox News at the time.

Israeli airline El Al has been banned from asking women to switch seats if ultra-Orthodox Jewish men object to sitting next to them, a court has ruled.
Passenger Renee Rabinowitz, who is in their 80s, brought a damages case against the airline, after they were asked to move.
Jerusalem Magistrate's Court said such requests break discrimination laws.
The airline says it never pressures passengers to swap seats.
Ms Rabinowitz, a Holocaust survivor, was flying from Newark in the US to Tel Aviv in 2015, when the air flight attendant made the request.
They said they felt "humiliated".
Many strictly Orthodox men avoid accidentally touching women other than their wives in order to guard against extra-marital attraction, a concept in Jewish law known as negiah.
Civil rights group Israel Religious Action Center (IRAC), which was representing Ms Rabinowitz in the case, said the win was "a huge victory" in a "long fought battle against gender segregation in the public sphere".
Similar requests for seat swaps have been causing problems and delays on fights, according to The Jerusalem Post, "due to the refusal of such men to take their seats before take off".
The ruling "ends years of uproar over the policy led by rights groups who say it is discriminatory," it said.
El Al argued in court that it opposes any form of discrimination against passengers, said The Times of Israel.
The court ordered El Al to inform staff that such requests are illegal.
It awarded Ms Rabinowitz 6,500 shekels ($1,800; £1,450) in damages.
"I'm thrilled because the judge understood the issue," they told The New York Times. "She realised it is not an issue of money; they awarded a very small sum. They realised it's a matter of El Al changing its policy and that's what they've been ordered to do."
United for Care, the organization responsible for putting medical marijuana on the 2014 ballot, claimed Tuesday that it's less than 5,000 petitions away from doing the same thing again in 2016.
"We're already close to hitting 100,000 in the number of petitions we've actually collected," Ben Pollara, United for Care campaign manager, told Sunshine State News. "Barring a fire in our headquarters, we'll probably hit it this week.
Ultimately, 683,149 petitions need to be in the hands of the Florida Department of State by Feb. 1, 2016. The department must verify 10 percent of that figure to trigger a Supreme Court review -- that's 68,315 valid petitions.
The organization is far ahead of its progress on this date in 2013. It wasn't until October 2013 that the drive reached 60,000 petitions. In fact, the 2014 petition wasn't launched until July 2013, Pollara says.
"We collected over a million petitions in 2014 and nearly 3.4 million people voted 'yes' for medical marijuana. There is no question in my mind that we will get medical marijuana back on the ballot for 2016," they said.
Pollara said the effort wouldn't be necessary "if the Legislature hadn't turned its back on the patients of Florida."
Attorney John Morgan, chairperson of United for Care who bankrolled virtually the whole of the 2013 drive, vowed, "We're going to win this war and help to suffer Floridians in 2016."
Pollara said Miami Beach-based United for Care is getting a tremendously positive response throughout the state. "People understand, if a doctor can send you out of their office for a prescription for Xanax or Percocet, they can write you treatment with medical marijuana."
United for Care is asking supporters to 1) mail in a fully filled-out and signed petition; 2) make a donation of at least $3, if possible ($3 is the cost of one signed petition); and 3) volunteer to help with petition collection.
The paid-petition effort has been up and running for about a week, Pollara says. But the volunteer effort that began in mid-January has done the heavy lifting so far.
The 2016 petition has only minor updates to its language, clarifying issues related to parental consent and the kinds of conditions that would qualify a potential patient, with a doctor's recommendation.

GEORGETOWN, MA - JANUARY 17: Jill Osborn hopes marijuana will help their daughter Haley, 7, with their seizures. Haley has a severe form of epilepsy and could have several dozen seizures in a day. A handful of studies suggest cannabidiol, or CBD, an ingredient in marijuana, might cut frequency of seizures. (Photo by Jonathan Wiggs/The Boston Globe via Getty Images)
CHICAGO -- Yet another state is considering expanding its medical marijuana laws to include children suffering from debilitating conditions like epilepsy.
On Tuesday, Illinois' Senate Public Health Committee unanimously approved legislation that would legalize medical marijuana treatment for minors in a 8-0 vote.
“Letters have been sent by so many parents who suffer watching their children have seizures — and not just one or two seizures: 100, 200, 1,000 seizures a week,” the bill's sponsor, state Sen. Iris Martinez (D-Chicago), told the Sun-Times. “This could be a life-saving solution for children suffering from epilepsy.”
Nicole Gross, one of the parents of severely epileptic children who lobbied for the bill, testified to just how transformative medical marijuana treatment can be for kids like their son, Chase. Gross said their 8-year-old lost their ability to speak due to their seizures and functions at the level of a 1 1/2-year-old.
"Following their dose of the cannabis oil, we started to see one to two seizures in two minutes, and then two minutes seizure free, five minutes seizure free, then eight ... and when we hit twenty, I cried," Gross told Fox Chicago.
Chase is among the thousands of children across the U.S. -- and among an estimated 1,000 in the Chicago area alone, Fox Chicago estimates -- who don't respond to typical seizure medication but have experienced dramatic improvements using medical marijuana.
Unlike adults who can smoke medical marijuana, children using the treatment are commonly given Cannabidiol (CBD) oil. The oil comes from marijuana plants but has low levels of the mind-altering ingredient THC that creates a high. In recent days, states like Wisconsin, Tennessee and Utah have advanced legislation to legalize CBD oil.
With CBD still illegal for minors in Illinois, Gross was forced to move to Colorado with Chase in order to secure the oil for their treatments. Gross and their family are part of a growing number of people heading to Colorado for treatment, where the number of minors on the state's medical marijuana registry has surged in the past year.
Currently, 20 states have medical marijuana laws on the books, but only some of them include minors.
In Illinois, where the four-year pilot program is considered one of the strictest in the nation, minors aren't the only patients excluded from the state's registry: Only those individuals suffering from at least one of 40 debilitating conditions and illnesses qualify.
The stigma against medical marijuana for kids -- and physicians' subsequent reluctance to prescribe it -- has led families to fire their doctors in search of marijuana-friendly care providers. Other, like Gross, are forced to leave their home state and become a "marijuana refugee" in Colorado.
Gross' husband, Randy, acknowledges there's a belief that CBD oil could be abused, but noted to WGN in a February interview, "it has no street value, so there's no one who can really abuse it. It's something you can't overdose on. You can drink a gallon of it and it won't hurt you."
With the news of the Illinois Senate Committee's vote, Gross hopes the days of their family living in Colorado are numbered.
A recent post to Apple's corporate job listing website suggests the company is looking to build out deeper, more meaningful human-computer interactions for Siri, features that delve far beyond the virtual assistant's current capabilities.
Apple executive and Siri co-founder Tom Gruber discussing AI at a TED conference in April, 2017.
In its listing for a Siri Software Engineer, Health and Wellness, spotted by CNBC reporter Christina Farr on Thursday , Apple says users often have serious conversations with Siri, a function the assistant was not initially designed to serve."People talk to Siri about all kinds of things, including when they're having a stressful day or have something serious on their mind. They turn to Siri in emergencies or when they want guidance on living a healthier life," Apple says.To see evidence of Apple's claims one needs only look back as far as September, when residents of Texas sought reprieve from the devastating effects of Hurricane Harvey. Tyler Frank, a 14-year-old who suffers from sickle cell anemia, used Siri to hail Coast Guard responders when calls to 911 failed, likely saving the girl's life.Beyond system command and control, Siri can handle basic health queries using answers gleaned from the internet, but the service is unable to go much further. At least for now.Some of the features Apple may have planned for Siri are hinted at in the engineering job's requirements. For example, the ideal candidate should not only hold a computer science degree and five years industry experience, but also have a background in peer counseling or psychology. Experience with artificial intelligence technologies including natural language processing or machine learning is desired, Apple says.It seems Apple wants to arm Siri with capabilities that fall beyond the current scope of common virtual assistants, much more than opening an app or turning on house lights. The job description discovered today hints at work toward an AI that can help users solve serious life problems. It also jibes with Apple's current thrust toward health and medical technology solutions, a program that currently revolves around the Apple Watch platform.During this week's big iPhone event, Apple aired a video showcasing a variety of individuals who benefitted from Apple Watch. Some touted the wearable's heart rate monitor, while others said the device helped them lead more active lives. The film included a testimonial from Casey Bennett, who survived a car crash by using Apple Watch's SOS feature, which calls a emergency services using a connected iPhone.The advertised Siri job suggests Apple is looking to integrate similar health-focused solutions into its virtual assistant technology.With the rapid build out of ancillary services, from low-level interactions like telling a joke to facilitating emergency phone calls in times of distress, Siri is slowly blurring the line between automated assistant and human operator.At a TED conference in April, Apple AI expert and Siri co-founder Tom Gruber discussed what they call "humanistic AI," or technology designed to "meet human needs by collaborating and augmenting people." Siri was developed as a humanistic AI with a conversational interface, Gruber said, allowing it to function as a type of automated helper."We can choose to use AI to automate and compete with us, or we can use AI to augment and collaborate with us, to overcome our cognitive limitations and to help us do what we want to do, only better," Gruber said.
theaedircollision asked: Hey there Mark. I just want to say I'm really excited for Hour of Devastation but I'm let down that we aren't getting Planeswalker decks for both of the Hour Planeswalkers. I was excited to get more Planeswalker decks for walkers that are new or we haven't seen often. This just feels like the Gatewatch taking up more space I want for new/returning characters, especially since now the Planeswalker decks won't always line up with the set like they have so far.
Planeswalker packs are first and foremost for new players. We want to introduce them to the main characters of the game.
When I talked about our changeover in choosing what planeswalkers get cards, we're leaning towards not Gatewatch for the normal sets and towards Gatewatch for the planeswalker packs.
Gatewatch will occasionally show up as planeswalker cards in the sets when they're the major focus of the story and non-Gatewatch will occasionally be seen on Planeswalker packs, but each has its default leaning.
Primary producers may have an ABN and the taxation department may have classified them as primary producers, but if they earn any money outside that line of work, Queensland's Weapons Licensing Branch is likely to determine they don't have a genuine reason for owning a handgun.
It's a clarification that comes as the branch breaks its silence on the increase in category H licence refusals that have bewildered longstanding licence-holders and been the subject of vociferous political debate.
The LNP and Katter's Australian Party have protested for nearly 18 months that licences for concealable firearms are being refused to primary producers for no legitimate reason, with the tacit approval of the Palaszczuk government.
Previously, the Weapons Licensing Branch has been largely silent on its rationale but this week sent a statement to the Queensland Country Life.
In it, an un-named police spokesperson said recent court and tribunal decisions from Queensland and other states have supported the decisions to refuse concealable licences.
“Each decision has provided a further clarification of the ‘genuine need' provisions, the type of business, the type and size of properties and are consistent with the current decision-making processes of Weapons Licensing,” they said.
“Weapons Licensing applies further scrutiny as to whether an applicant is meeting the requirements of a ‘primary producer' in the Act which states that they must be ‘primarily engaged in the occupation'.
“A number of recent applicants have been found to have other occupations not engaged with the business of primary production.
“The applicant must prove they derive the majority of their income in their occupation as a primary producer.”
The spokesperson cited a number of Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal decisions – two of them, Harm in 2010 and Shaxson in 2014, have been noted earlier by QCL, but a further decision, Feeney, 2017, was described as clarifying “occupation” for category H purposes.
As documented by firearms lawyer, Simon Munslow, for the Australian Sporting Shooter magazine, retired Lieutenant Colonel Feeney, a Vietnam veteran, had established the Professional Vermin Control and Training company in 1997, with a fee that covered costs rather than made a profit.
QCAT was unable to conclude this provided an occupational requirement for a concealed firearm as required by the Act.

AgForce guns spokesperson, Graham Park, described the use of these cases as a “justification, not an explanation”.
“It means this issue is a moving target and that's what's causing confusion,” they said.
“Weapons Licensing likes a case by case approach but AgForce would like a system that's clear for all.
“The parameters already exist – the taxation department classifies people as primary producers.”
Terrain type assessed
According to the police spokesperson, another part of the approval process requires the applicant to demonstrate the property in question is of such a nature that a concealable firearm is required to carry out the humane destruction of stock that may be injured in remote parts of the property.
They said Weapons Licensing utilises Queensland Globe to assess the terrain of the nominated property.
“Weapons Licensing have regard to the CSIRO model codes of practice for humane destruction of animals and the Australian Animal Welfare Standards and Guidelines when determining suitability for use of handguns,” they said.
This is in response to the question of the need for a pistol rather than a rifle, due to a property's land type.
The police spokesperson made a number of other points:
It's been almost a year since I've made any entries to my series "Stupid Things Gun Nuts Do." It's certainly not because gun nuts have stopped doing stupid things. No ma'am, I'm confident that will never happen.
However, the last chapter I added to the series was so! f***ing! unbelievably! stupid, all the stupidity that gun nuts have been up to since then has paled in comparison. I speak of the incident at a firing range in Nevada last August where a 9-year-old girl was allowed to fire a fully automatic weapon, an Uzi, which got away from her—surprise, surprise—and killed the man coaching them on how to shoot it. In terms of casualty count, this particular tragedy fell far short of other gun-nut incidences—only one instructor who should have seen it coming, as compared to all of those who didn't have a chance to see it coming: e.g. Columbine, Tucson (twice), Virginia Tech, Fort Hood (twice), Sandy Hook, Aurora, Isla Vista, Charleston, etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc.
In terms of pure, naked, entirely avoidable, who-let-these-idiots-out-of-the-asylum stupidity, it took the grand prize. And everything that's happened on the stupid gun-nut front since then has seemed rather humdrum—like... Ah, just more stupid gun-nut shit. What do you expect when you let morons play with fire?
The item I bring up today isn't in the same league, stupidity-wise, with the Little Uzi Girl story. Nevertheless, it stands out as a fine example of how gun nuts are always working to make themselves look more important than they really are. Maybe you saw it in the other paper Thursday: A picture of our vodka-inclined U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo holding one side of a road sign for the camera. Holding the other side is a Greenleaf councilman.
The sign itself reads "Welcome to GREENLEAF IDAHO—THIS IS NOT A GUN FREE ZONE," and at the bottom was the identifying number of a city ordinance Greenleaf passed nine years ago that encouraged everyone in the pimple-sized town to own a gun.
Incidentally, the photo was, as explained below it, "provided by Sen. Mike Crapo," and excuse me for a sec while I go check something...
Aaaah, yes, just as I thought. It appears Mr. Crapo is up for re-election next year, which might account for why they would be piddling around in the Canyon County nether-lands while Congress is still in session, setting up their own ridiculous photo ops—illustrating how pleased they are that Greenleaf, a ridiculous little piss-stop on the road to Wilder, and its ridiculous town leaders have made an overblown ridiculous show of enacting a ridiculous dumbshit municipal ordinance, suggesting that those rioters and home invaders and Donald Trump's rape gangs and marauding Mongol hordes and God-Knows-Who-Else should keep clear of Greenleaf if they know what's good for 'em, then supplying the Capital City daily with a news release to show what a staunch supporter of ridiculous, grandstanding gun-nut braggadocio they are—wouldn't it?
Crapo isn't the only gun nut doing stupid things that prompt me to write this piece. Crapo is simply doing what craven, conservative politicians do these days, unless they want a primary challenge from some even bigger asshole to the right of them. Crapo is making sure the slobbering gun-nut demo is aware they are on their side—that they wouldn't dream of ever, ever, ever doing anything that would interrupt in any way their Second Amendment right to make certain that any Dylann Roof—or Eric Harris, Dylan Kebold, Nidal Hasan, Seung-Hui Cho, Jared Loughner, James Holmes, Adam Lanza, Elliot Rodger, etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc.—has access to whatever guns they want when he's finally worked up the nerve to use them.
No, the gun nut we need to focus on here is the Greenleaf councilman holding the other side of the sign. Their name is Steve Jett, reportedly a "corrections consultant." It was their enterprise, Jett Corrections Consulting, that donated the two signs to Greenleaf, and even more pertinently, it was Mr. Jett, as a city councilman, who proposed the ordinance back in 2006. I remember being one of those who wondered at the time why such a bucolic goat town as Greenleaf felt it necessary to make itself look even more hayseed than it already is by staging this substance-less attention grab. After all, even city leaders admitted there was no reportable crime or violence happening there, nor was there any reason think such mayhem was headed their way.
Of course, Mr. Jett wasn't the first to dream up such a useless stunt. Greenleaf, Idaho, isn't the sort of place you go looking for originality, is it? Small towns in Tennessee and Pennsylvania had already enacted the same sort of nonsense, and I'm certain Mr. Jett simply heard about those places and thought to himself, Wow! Here's a chance to get people to notice me!
Think about it: With some empty gesture of macho blowhardery, even the drabbest, dullest, unremarkable chubby little chump imaginable can grab the attention of the shambling gun-nut herd, even when there isn't another reason in the world to give them a second thought.
Then, nine years later, after everyone has forgotten the whole dumbass show of chest-thumping folly, that chubby little chump may have to throw a new stick on the dying fire, eh? What better way than to, 1) spend a few bucks on some cheesy road signs that announce to motorists what a ridiculous hick burg they are driving through; 2) call the nearest craven, conservative politician who's up for re-election soon and offer them the opportunity to get their bland mug photographed being exactly the sort of complicit douche we have come to expect them to be; and 3) release the news to a daily paper that no longer seems to know the difference between news and PR stunts.
I wouldn't want to suggest the whole thing might have been a way for Jett to get some publicity for their consulting business. These days, anyone local involved in the corrections biz may prefer people look in other directions.
But I don't mind at all suggesting that we might expect a "corrections consultant" to be aware that the greatest threat from a gun-packing populace, especially in a cow pie like Greenleaf, isn't from members of the criminal class, who surely know there are better pickin's to be found elsewhere, but from domestic violence—that's family abusing family, lest you've forgotten, and I don't doubt it's any less present in Greenleaf as it is elsewhere—and children shooting siblings, neighbor kids and themselves.
American youth are nine times more likely to die by firearms than any other modern nation in the world. That's a fact even gun nuts can't argue would be solved with their usual remedy—MORE GUNS. Yet it is the most tragic, most unnecessary, most evil aspect to living in a country where an obsessive minority of dimwits can dictate to the rest of us that we just have to put up with them and their obsession.
So, I'm making a prediction here and now that I hope will never come true: When and if someone dies in Greenleaf from a gunshot, it won't be a home invader or a looter, a rapist or a robber or a mugger or a criminal of any sort. It will be a wife. Or a kid. Perhaps a father cleaning something they thought to be empty, or a suicide. But it will be an innocent person with a big hole in him, or her, put there by one of those guns councilman Steve Jett is so eager for all of their neighbors to keep.
Then how proud is they gonna be over their f***ing road sign?
Aiding the governor are the simple facts of demographics. Ayotte won in 2010 as part of the Tea Party revolution. But as in much of the nation, presidential cycles tend to be more favorable than midterms for Democrats in New Hampshire. “She's dealing with a different electorate,” notes the political analyst Dean Spiliotes, a civic scholar at Southern New Hampshire University.
At the same time, Ayotte has lost some of their sparkle among conservatives. “There are constituencies in the Republican party that they need who no longer really trust them as a conservative,” said Spiliotes. “Over the course of the last couple of years they have gone out of way at times to talk about bipartisanship and show themselves to be a little more progressive on issues like women's reproductive health,” they explained. “It's not like they have abandoned ship, but there has been just enough triangulation to makes some conservatives uncomfortable.”
Now, into this high-stakes high-wire act, drops one of the highest-octane issues in American politics: guns. And before you can say “the right of the people to keep and bear arms,” the electoral landscape has grown even more fraught for Ayotte.
Gun-control advocates have been miffed at the senator since 2013, when, in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre, they opposed the Manchin-Toomey bill to expand background checks for gun buyers. (She backed a far weaker alternative, approved by the NRA.) “Senator Ayotte was one of the senators that most disappointed people with their ‘no' vote,” said Pia Carusone, a senior advisor for Americans for Responsible Solutions, the gun-control group founded by gunshot-survivor former Representative Gabby Giffords. Gun-control groups took out after Ayotte, dispatching activists to dog them at events across the state. (At one memorable town-hall meeting, the daughter of the slain Sandy Hook principal confronted the senator about their votes.)
Firearms make for complicated politics in New Hampshire. The state has libertarian leanings and a thriving gun culture. (Last year, Guns & Ammo named it the 10th best state for gun owners.) Even so, north of 80 percent of Granite Staters favor expanded background checks—a number with which gun-control advocates delight in hammering Ayotte.
Of course, three years is an eternity in politics. And in recent months, the hot debates in New Hampshire were more about Supreme Court vacancies and the opioid epidemic. Until the June 12 massacre at an Orlando nightclub, when guns came roaring back as both a national and state issue.
While Democrats held a sit-in and agitated for gun bills on Capitol Hill, gun-control activists renewed their assault on Ayotte. Everytown for Gun Safety (Michael Bloomberg's group) and its grassroots arm, Moms Demand Action, ran digital and print ads attacking them Americans for Responsible Solutions hit them with TV ads. Organizers once more began phoning and showing up at their office and at events. At both the June 25 Portsmouth Pride Parade and the 4th of July parade in Merrimack, activists handed out flyers criticizing them record.
External enemies: Fighting and winning two world wars, followed by the Cold War, had an enormous unifying effect. […] Since 1989, we have had no unifying common enemy.
That this “unifying” did not apply to, for example (and among many others), African Americans, Japanese Americans, communists or other targets of McCarthyism/COINTELPRO/etc, is a simple narrative inconvenience. Similarly, the ongoing war in Afghanistan having lasted about 160% as long as the next longest war in US history (Vietnam) is a minor detail, because Americans are evidently divided on whether or not terrorism is bad. I encourage proponents of #ViewpointDiversity like Haidt to consider the ultimate taboo in America: maybe war is actually bad and us bombing people all over the world doesn't have any beneficial effects at home or elsewhere. In fact, what if war — with its massive toll in lives, economic opportunity costs, the damage to public trust caused by propaganda used to gain temporary support, the erosion of valuing others lives that occurs when we know our government is constantly killing innocent people, etc — actually drives us apart?
The media: Newspapers in the early days of the republic were partisan and often quite nasty. But with the advent of television in the mid-twentieth century, America experienced something unusual: the media was a gigantic centripetal force. Americans got much of their news from three television networks, which were regulated and required to show political balance. [emphasis added] […] Now we are drowning in outrage stories, very high-quality outrage stories, often supported by horrifying video clips. Social media is turning out to be a gigantic centrifugal force.
While arguing for liberalism, Haidt identifies the regulation of TV news as a source of unity. But putting that aside, since there is no evidence presented for the existence of this golden era of media when outrage stories didn't dominate the headlines, I'll just assert with an equal amount of evidence that there has never been a period where outrage stories didn't dominate headlines. The news is dumb as hell and always has been. The main difference with social media — and the part that I believe bothers Haidt — is that with social media the choice of which stories get to dominate is now (somewhat) crowd-sourced rather than chosen by (almost exclusively) wealthy, white, educated, male producers, editors, or anchors. “Horrifying video clips” have shown the public how our police actually behave in the real world. Would Haidt prefer the #BlackLivesMatter movement had never occurred? (More on this later.)
Immigration and diversity: This one is complicated and politically fraught. Let me be clear that I think immigration and diversity are good things, overall. The economists seem to agree that immigration brings large economic benefits. The complete dominance of America in Nobel prizes, music, and the arts, and now the technology sector, would not have happened if we had not been open to immigrants. But as a social psychologist, I must point out that immigration and diversity have many sociological effects, some of which are negative.
A perfect example of American exceptionalism: America ranks 16th in Nobel prizes per capita, with about 1/3 the rate of Sweden, 1/2 that of the UK, and behind Germany, Israel, Ireland, etc… but this amounts to “complete dominance” because, uh, USA! USA! I don't know why this is supposed to be a good metric anyway, because it would only demonstrate that we are the happy (and lazy?) beneficiaries of brain drain. The rest of this section is a bit confusing since it argues that immigration and diversity have positives and negatives, and doesn't conclude much about the net effect. I'm left unconvinced that they're having any effect, or that the actual rates of immigration have any relation to the efficacy of scapegoating immigrants as a cynical political move- which I think is the far more relevant aspect of this question to unity/divisiveness.
The more radical Republican Party: […] personal relationships among legislators and their families in Washington had long been a massive centripetal force. […]
[…] the Democrats did some polarizing things, too. Fair enough. […]
Earlier in the lecture, in one of the few points that mentions data, Haidt cited increasing two-party polarization of the American (voting?) public since the 1990's. He's now discussing the parties themselves, without giving any kind of systematic account of evidence that the GOP has changed any more or any differently since the 90's than the Dems, or even asking (never mind attempting to answer) any questions about the underlying reasons why any of the parties are changing in any directions, or whether there is any relationship between these party changes and the asupervisorstioned increasing polarization of the public. Is there any causal relationship, and if so, in which direction? I am again unconvinced about the importance and even the characterization of this force of division. I would argue it's the Democratic Party which has been moving aggressively away from working class advocacy to try to earn support from business interests and the upper middle class, and that the GOP is only reacting to their grab at the “center” by seeking to make up for lost Wall Street money with votes from the far right.
I'll also point out the sort of comfortable, elite, liberal ideal of government as a body of philosopher kings who are all friends with each other despite disagreeing on whether or not children starving is something the government should do something about. That's not important, really, what's important is reaching a bipartisan consensus on whom to bomb next to unite the republic. And perhaps most importantly of all, legislators should not interact with the public, lest they get any ideas from the majority who, because of human nature, do not support free speech.
The new identity politics of the Left: Jonathan Rauch offers a simple definition of identity politics: a “political mobilization organized around group characteristics such as race, gender, and sexuality, as opposed to party, ideology, or pecuniary interest.” Rauch then adds: “In America, this sort of mobilization is not new, unusual, un­American, illegitimate, nefarious, or particularly left­wing.” This definition makes it easy for us to identify two kinds of identity politics: the good kind is that which, in the long run, is a centripetal force. The bad kind is that which, in the long run, is a centrifugal force.
Quite an intellectual feat: to explain the new identity politics of the left, Haidt cites a “simple definition” from Rauch which, according to Rauch, is “not new […] or particularly leftwing.” Haidt then offers a classification rule which can only be used in retrospect and is essentially tautological: the good kind of identity politics is that which, in the long run, is good.
The audacity is still just beginning, because next Haidt uses Martin Luther King Jr. as an example of good identity politics which was focused on uniting. Rather than say anything about this myself, I would love nothing more than for Haidt to read the words of MLK:
I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in their stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to “order” than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: “I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action”; who paternalistically believes they can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a “more convenient season.”

Decision means farmers who have lost crops in more than 1,000 counties are eligible for assistance from government
Drought leads to declaration of natural disaster in 26 US states
America declared a natural disaster in more than 1,000 drought-stricken counties in 26 states on Thursday.
It was the largest declaration of a national disaster and was intended to speed relief to about a third of the country's farmers and ranchers who are suffering in drought conditions.
The declaration from the US department of agriculture includes most of the south-west, which has been scorched by wildfires, parts of the midwestern corn belt, and the south-east.
It was intended to free up funds for farmers whose crops have withered in extreme heatwave conditions linked by scientists to climate change.
According to the US drought monitor, 56% of the country is experiencing drought conditions – the most expansive drought in more than a decade.
The agriculture secretary, Tom Vilsack, said the funds were intended to help farmers and ranchers across the country who have lost crops to extreme heat or wildfires.
The declaration will make affected ranchers and farmers eligible for low-interest loans and speed processing of disaster claims.
"Agriculture remains a bright spot in our nation's economy," Vilsack said. "We need to be cognisant of the fact that drought and weather conditions have severely impacted on farmers around the country."
The declaration covers counties in California, Oregon, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Nebraska, Wyoming, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Illinois, Indiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, South Carolina, Florida, Delaware and Hawaii. It does not include Iowa, the country's biggest corn producer.
The first six months of this year were the warmest on record, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said. Twenty-eight states east of the Rockies set temperature records.
Those record-breaking temperatures deepened drought conditions across much of the American west, triggering an early and violent season of wildfires in Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico.
The heat also destroyed expectations of a bumper corn crop. American farmers planted more than 96m acres of corn this year, the most in 75 years.
The early spring got the crop off to a good start but , after June's extreme heat, only 40% of the crop was in good condition, according to USDA figures.
From the midwest to the mid-Atlantic, meanwhile, there were triple digit temperatures, breaking hundreds of heat records. On Thursday, St Louis confirmed 18 deaths due to extreme heat conditions.
"The recent heat and dryness is catching up with us on a national scale," Michael Hayes, director of the national drought mitigation centre said in a statement.
Peter Slipper: Former speaker admits using taxi vouchers to visit wineries but denies being dishonest, court hears
Updated
Former federal parliamentary speaker Peter Slipper has admitted using taxi vouchers to visit wineries around Canberra but denies doing so dishonestly, a court has heard.
Slipper is facing the ACT Magistrates Court accused of misusing their parliamentary Cabcharge allowance on three occasions in 2010, before they were appointed speaker.
Their defence team has told the court Slipper has made written admissions that they visited the wineries in hire cars and filled out Cabcharge vouchers.
Sorry, this video has expired Video: Slipper faces court over Cabcharge dishonesty claims (7pm TV News ACT)
But the defence said it would dispute the prosecution's arguments that they behaved dishonestly, was not entitled to use the allowance on the occasions in question and that they caused a substantial risk of loss to the Commonwealth.
A police statement of facts reveals on the first occasion in January 2010, Slipper visited up to six premises including the prestigious Poachers Pantry and Clonakilla.
The total bill for the three trips is believed to be just over $900.
A hire car driver has given evidence that they drove Slipper and another man to several wineries and at the end, Slipper asked them if they could split the payment up into four amounts "because it would make processing easier".
The driver said that Slipper had appeared "flushed in the face" and the scent of alcohol became a lot stronger in the car as the day went on.
The prosecution said the driver's recollection of events was not clear but that the driver had not agreed to Slipper's request.
The court has also heard evidence from a second hire car driver, who drove Slipper to wineries on two occasions.
They told the court that at the end of the day Slipper had asked what was owed, told them how many Cabcharge vouchers to swipe and then they had filled them in.
When asked if they had ever seen Slipper affected by alcohol, the driver replied "never" and agreed that they had always been respectful and professional as a passenger.
GPS tracking data will show movement of Slipper's hire cars
The prosecution told the court that Slipper was well aware they had to be travelling on parliamentary business in order for the Government to pay for transport.
And prosecutors alleged Slipper believed the Department of Finance and Deregulation would not find out they had improperly used the card, and would pay the fares for the trips.
The prosecution will present evidence from 35 witnesses, mostly via statements over the six-day hearing.
A computer presentation of GPS tracking data showing the movement of the hire cars Slipper used will also be made in court.
The court heard the police investigation, dubbed Operation Portilla, began after Slipper's former staffer James Ashby reported allegations relating to Slipper's car travel.
Those allegations did not result in charges but police decided to expand their investigation and seized 270 Cabcharge vouchers used by Slipper between January 2010 and May 2012.
Charges were initially laid early last year, but there has been a long delay in bringing the case to a hearing, partly because of two legal challenges from Slipper.
The latest challenge, based on mental health concerns, was thrown out in June.
Slipper wanted the court to set aside the charges because they were suffering a major depressive disorder, which was made worse by the case.
The court previously heard they had been hospitalised several times and had been having suicidal thoughts.
Slipper believes they have been unfairly targetted and the matter should never have come to court.
Slipper lost the Queensland seat of Fisher in the 2013 election when they ran as an independent, after splitting with Coalition colleagues when they accepted Labor's offer to be Speaker in the House of Representatives.
They had held the seat on and off since 1984, first for the National Party and later for the LNP.
Slipper resigned as Speaker in October 2012 amid a sexual harassment claim, brought by their former staffer James Ashby.
Mr Ashby recently abandoned their claim against Slipper, after a two-year court battle.

Achieving policy ends via unlawful means: Will that be Abbott's defining legacy?
As definers of poor government, Abbott's dishonesty and chaotic incompetence are stand outs. But implementing policy via unlawful means deserves to go down in history (if the charges are laid and found proven) for something even more distinctive — its criminality. Max Costello reports.
TWO YEARS ago, on 7 September 2013, the ultra-conservative Liberal-National Party Coalition, led by Tony Abbott, ousted the centre left Australian Labor Party government. The pro-business Liberal Party and the smaller, rural-based National Party came to power promising, above all, to restore trust in government.
As Mr Abbott said in launching the Coalition's election campaign on 24 August 2013:
“This election is all about trust."
A mere eight months after taking office, the Coalition had destroyed that trust — via its first budget, brought down on 14 May 2014, which broke a raft of pre-election promises.
As The Sydney Morning Herald noted next day in relation to only a few promises:
'Tony Abbott promised no cuts to education, health, the ABC or SBS [broadcasters], and no changes to pensions. By [last night], it all seemed like a distant memory.'
By June 2014, Newspoll (conducted exclusively for The Australian) showed the Coalition's primary vote had fallen to a 4½-year low of 36 per cent, down 5 per cent from election day.
Abbott denies lying and explains that only "carefully scripted remarks" are the "Gospel truth" to an incredulous Kerry O'Brien
During the rest of 2014 and into 2015, an increasing public concern was the decreasing health of the country's finances. Abbott's promise,
“By the end of a Coalition government's first term, the budget will be on-track to a believable surplus”
had evaporated — as Treasurer Joe Hockey effectively conceded on 15 December 2014 (Herald-Sun, Melbourne):
'The 2014/15 budget deficit forecast has blown out to $40.4 billion compared with the $29.8 billion deficit predicted in May. … A surplus of 0.8 per cent of GDP is projected for 2019/20 based on current settings, but Mr Hockey could not say if they were confident about achieving that result.'
Prime Minister Abbott's authoritarian leadership style was further alienating voters. With trademark insensitivity, British born Mr Abbott, who had not consulted or forewarned their Cabinet, announced the award – on 26 January 2015 (Australia Day!) – of an Australian knighthood to Queen Elizabeth's 93 year-old husband, Prince Phillip.
People familiar with Shakespeare's King Lear were agape as “King Abbott” became their own Fool.

On 7 February 2015, two dissatisfied Liberal backbenchers called for a leadership vote — which Mr Abbott survived, 61 votes to 39.
Facing the media next morning, they announced:
“Good government starts today."
But it didn't. After an initial pick-up, the government's performance lacked competence and focus — featuring the (often ineffective) pursuit of discredited budget initiatives, Mr Abbott's obstinate delay in securing their partisan (Liberal) Speaker's resignation over their grossly excessive travel expenses, and tricky Party room manoeuvres to stymie a proposed gay marriage bill.
More significantly, there were not many thought-through policy initiatives proceeding to legislation.
As The Sydney Morning Herald reported on 24 August 2015:
'The Abbott government is stuck in a “policy paralysis” that has seen fewer bills finalised in its first 700 days in office than any other federal government since the late 1960s.'
Cabinet Ministers had begun leaking against themselves, prompting the PM to “read the riot act” to their Cabinet — an event that was itself leaked to Fairfax Media on 20 August 2015, along with the Government's “speaking notes” for that day, including this gem:
“… Cabinet is functioning exceptionally well."

So far then, the Coalition government's trademarks had been dishonesty (2014) here, here and here — and chaotic incompetence (2015). However, as will become apparent, one potential 2016 trademark, criminality, could well become the Coalition's defining legacy.
It is linked to one of the few “big” promises the Coalition largely kept from day one, namely, to “stop the boats” of asylum seekers trying to come to Australia and claim refugee status.
Implementing the policy underpinning that promise had involved the “offshoring” – to Papua New Guinea and the Pacific island of Nauru – of Australia's Refugee Convention obligations to accept asylum seekers, process their claims and, if found to be refugees, resettle them.
The two “regional processing [detention] centres” concerned, on Nauru and PNG's Manus Island, are notionally operated by the respective governments, but are largely controlled and totally funded by Australia (officially, the Commonwealth of Australia). Control occurs via the Commonwealth Department of Immigration and Border Protection (“the Department”).
But detention centres, onshore and offshore, are Commonwealth workplaces and therefore subject to the duty obligations of the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (Cth) (“the WHS Act”). Failing to comply with a WHS Act duty is a heavily penalised criminal offence.
Section 10 says the Act 'binds the Commonwealth' which is thus 'liable for offences'; while section 14 says Act duties cannot be transferred — meaning that the Commonwealth cannot lawfully transfer its health and safety duty obligations to PNG or Nauru.
The 'primary duty of care' that section 19 imposes on workplace operators (including the Commonwealth) requires them to 'ensure, so far as it is reasonably practicable, that people at workplaces are not exposed to preventable risks to their health and safety.' (Section 4 defines 'health' to include psychological health.) That duty protects not only 'workers' but also 'other persons' — who are, at detention centres, the asylum seekers, including any children.
By 2015, it was apparent from official sources that the Commonwealth, via the Department, was failing to comply with its WHS Act duty of care to asylum seekers.
For example:
the Australian Human Rights Commission's November 2014 Forgotten Children report on asylum seeker children in detention (the report was not released until February 2015) found that, as a result of prolonged detention, ‘34 percent of children [had] mental health disorders at levels of seriousness that were comparable with … [the] less than two percent of children receiving outpatient mental health services in Australia' (page 29);
the Moss Report (released in March 2015) into allegations of a rape threat, assaults and sexual assaults of detainees (mainly women and girls) at the Nauru centre confirmed some allegations and found others — similar or even worse and
on 20 July 2015, the Department's First Assistant Secretary, Children — in their evidence to the Senate Select Committee on the Recent Allegations … [concerning] Nauru – said that the Department in Canberra had received reports of 15 sexual assaults of minors at the Nauru centre during the 18 months ending 30 June 2015 (see transcript, pp.79–80).

Accordingly, it is reasonable to expect the WHS Act's regulator, Comcare, to convert such potential evidence into admissible form and, by early-mid 2016, lay charges alleging two sets of WHS Act contraventions.
One set would allege a failure to ensure – within Australia and on Nauru – that children were not exposed to risks to their (psychological) health via prolonged detention; the second set would allege a failure to ensure on Nauru that asylum seekers, especially women and girls, were not exposed to risks to their health and safety — specifically, risks of rape, sexual assault and sexual harassment. (The Commonwealth's two main service provider contractors on Nauru might also face parallel “second set” charges.)

As definers of poor government, dishonesty and chaotic incompetence clearly stand out. But a government that implements policy via unlawful means would deserve to go down in history (if the charges are laid and found proven) for something even more distinctive — its criminality.

With the rise of the “prestige television” era, a show's opening credit sequences have become a major production unto themselves. Some have the grandiosity and the budget of an independent film. Others are understated and beautiful in their simplicity.
I've done some critical scrutiny to determine the ones that deserve the most praise. In choosing these top 15, I did set some boundaries for eligibility—otherwise, the choices would be almost infinite. These were selected from hourlong drama or comedy/drama shows that aired on a premium cable network or streaming service since 1999 (which marked the debut of The Sopranos, the unofficial start of the modern prestige era.)
My criteria were twofold. My choices were based on the extent to which these credits (1) were visually and aurally appealing, and (2) reflected the time, place, mood, and essence of the show. Credits should put the viewer in anticipation of what it to be seen.
Without further ado, here are the bottom eight of the top 15 modern TV opening credit sequences!
15. Six Feet Under, HBO, 2000–2005
One of the earliest premium cable drama series, and still one of the best, uses the original, tried-and-true formula of object imagery paired with mood-inducing music. The credits featured funeral-home equipment along with images of death. However, the music could be interpreted as upbeat, making the music and imagery incongruous, which, for those that have watched the show, could also explain the experience of the Fisher family. Six Feet Under was so much more than a family running a funeral home, but it's a perfect theme for the credits.
14. Homeland, Showtime, 2011–present
Confession: I find these credits irritating, so it might seem odd that I would include it in a best-of list. However, I believe that is the intended reaction. The atonality of the jazz music paired with the disorienting, black-and-white imagery of past terrorist attacks—and lead character Carrie growing up and experiencing these attacks—creates uneasiness The disorientation is not unlike Carrie's experience: driven to protect the country from terrorism at all costs while dealing with a debilitating mental illness. Perhaps these credits are meant to give us a quick glance into what Carrie's mind is like. Besides, no one should go into watching Homeland expecting a feel-good show, right?
13. Queer as Folk, Showtime, 2000–2005
Remember this show? The quick, jarring images of silhouettes of go-go boys grinding over a background of psychedelic color bursts opened this show for the first few seasons. Of course, these images are meant to present shallow stereotypes of gay men. (In later seasons, the opening credits were changed to a sequence where the characters were featured.) But back in 2000, a show featuring all gay characters was a breakthrough in television, and a cable network was the only place to take a chance on it. The jolt of music and color was a like an energy shot to the senses—and, honestly, it was a ton of fun.
12. The Affair, Showtime, 2014–present
The Fiona Apple song “Container” is enough to carry this opening sequence, with the lyrics “I have only one thing to do and that's/To be the wave that I am and then/Sink back into the ocean” over a sequence showing—no surprise—ocean waves. It's a jarring song that indicates the show is about more than just two people and their affair.
11. Hung, HBO, 2009–2011
The opening credits to Hung, a show about a Detroit teacher moonlighting as a male prostitute, sees Thomas Jane, in the lead role, gradually removing the various parts of their business suit as they walk through downtown Detroit. They eventually arrive fully nude at a dock and dives into the body of water. It's so simple, yet so perfect. I am sure no one minded watching Thomas Jayne disrobe before each episode (and often during the series).
10. The Sopranos, HBO, 1999–2007
The Sopranos began the modern era of prestige television, and its opening credits also lead by example. The viewer is put in the POV of a car driver (Tony Soprano) on the seemingly endless New Jersey Turnpike, passing New Jersey hallmarks. The contrast between the socioeconomic statuses of the different location, along with the hip-hop influenced “Woke Up this Morning” by Alabama Three, does not contain the extensive visual design of the others on this list. Yet it establishes the location and mood perfectly.
9. Masters of Sex, Showtime, 2013–present
The montage of visual sexual innuendos—a coin being placed in a slot, a train entering a tunnel, a phallic cucumber—is almost eye-roll inducing. But how could we not expect to see sexual imagery in the credits for a show about the study of human sexuality? On top of all that, the vibrant images are excellent in creating a retro feel, which is fitting, considering this is one of two beloved current shows that take place in the 1960s.
8. Treme, HBO, 2010–2013
These mark another opening credit sequence that may not specifically introduce any characters, but excels in setting the place, time, and mood of the show. Imagery depicting the music, people, history, and culture of New Orleans is mixed with imagery from the devastation left by Hurricane Katrina. The positive imagery mixed with the hurricane footage, along with an upbeat, memorable song, makes the viewer not just understand the hurricane's devastation, but feel hope that the culture, people, and history will endure through it. (The images in the credits also changed with each season to match the show's progress.)
I'll share my top seven spots in a later post. Which shows do you hope to see in the top seven?
MONTEREY, Calif. -- Observe The Lean. Respect The Lean. Hell, exalt The Lean. If you don't rank The Lean among the most incredible aptitudes in sports, then your ranking must be ignorant. The Lean cannot be real. The Lean must be some ridiculous illusion.
Naturally, the people doing The Lean think The Lean routine. They perform it daily, weekly, monthly, on this continent and that. They did hundreds more last weekend, through the woolly "Corkscrew" portion of the Laguna Seca track at the Red Bull U.S. Grand Prix of MotoGP. "It all becomes second nature," professional rider Colin Edwards said. So, The Lean is normal.
The Lean most certainly is not normal.
To let the naked eye see it for the first time is to come across yet another marvel on the grand landscape of sports. You knew it was real, you know it is real, but still there's an element of, No. Really. No. Please. No.
Here came one just now, at Friday practice. They prepared to turn, to lean, to become unwittingly my first-ever, in-person, lean-viewing experience. Down toward tarmac went their one of the only two knees they possess, and wide went two fresh eyes in witness. Of course, their knee all but hugged the track and may even have kissed it, scraping with the polyurethane protection at a speed I-don't-want-to-know. Then they went on.
"I saw a bumper sticker coming back from Daytona in the mid-1960s," said Earl Hayden, whose family has made a lifetime of motorcycle racing, and whose 31-year-old son Nicky won the MotoGP world title in 2006. "It said, 'Why Be Normal?' These people aren't really normal."
Here's a Kentuckian former racer themselves -- a man who trained their five children as tykes by putting them on a hobby horse and strategically removing springs to teach balance, who has lived and breathed right up next to the sport for a solid decade -- yet even they said of The Leans, "They're going through 'em at 170 with their damn knees down and their elbows scraping the ground! It still just blows me away to see 'em dragging their knees and elbows at 170, 190."
Follow them on a big screen via an on-bike camera, along their twisting, undulating routes, and you might start to get nauseated. You might crave a Dramamine or a hard stare into motionless furniture. You might start to think they have unbelievably hardy inner-ear fluid. During the 32-lap race on Sunday, the fine little TV graphic that resembles a meter showed 4th-place finisher Alvaro Bautista tearing through Laguna Seca leaning 60 degrees to the left, then 35 to the right, 62 to the left, 59 to the right, 62 to the left, 63 to the right, 55 to the left.
"In the 1970's, they started to touch the knee," team owner Lucio Cecchinello said while giving a garage tour. "Five years ago, the riders started to touch here [elbow]. And now, we have some riders with exceptional talent that have started to touch here [shoulder]."
It's such human evolution. Where back in prehistoric times -- you know, the 1970's -- a rider protected their knee by cutting a plastic visor and putting it on a stick, Cecchinello said. Now, they ride along with elbows beneath magnesium sliders, particularly useful in such robust cases as Marc Marquez, the 20-year-old Spanish phenom.
"Marc Marquez is wearing through their magnesium sliders quite regularly," said Jeremy Appleton of Alpinestars, the gear manufacturer.
So then, what does one feel when mid-lean or, rather, mid-Lean? Apparently one does not feel much. "Sure, you notice it," the 37-year-old Texan veteran Edwards said, "but when you're at full lean at 60 degrees, it's waiting to come around on you" -- and the "it" would be the 350-pound bike.
Yeah.
"So you're always working," Edwards said. "It's hard to see with the naked eye, but you're working like hell then." In fact, they're all the time going around "calculating angles," they said. "Your brain's constantly working, and you don't remember any of it."
No?
"I can probably pick four or five moments that meant something to me," they said of the race. "The rest, just, it's a big blah."
***
Now, you might think practitioners of The Lean would be hellishly rugged sorts, and right you would be. What you might not realize, until they come around the interview dais for a first sighting in plain view, is that they're slightly built. They're short and just shy of wispy. They're tough, strong, fearless, sturdy, sinewy jockeys who can lift more than you think, and who regard their skeletons differently than we do.
If most of us get a break anywhere in the skeleton, most of us consider it considerable. They get a break in the skeleton and, as Nicky Hayden put it, "If a doctor says you'll be ready in six weeks, we automatically think we'll be ready in three." And as their father said it, "If they ain't got a bone sticking through their skin, he's going to say, 'I'm doing great.'"
The younger Hayden lacks a bone sticking through their skin, but they do shake hands with the left these days, because, as they explained, "I've actually got a wrist that for the last four months has been bothering me. I've got a screw in there that needs to come out."
After a practice spill in Germany, the British rider Cal Crutchlow said they "felt sick." They became unable to eat. They became unable to see their left elbow because of the bruises. It seemed their body had to recalibrate itself. "I think it was just a case of, I hit my body quite hard, not just my arms but my whole body. As soon as I hit the track, I was a little bit like a rag doll."

For UFC, A Super Saturday Mixed martial arts isn't quite like any other sport, but it does share fans with other sports — especially… More» Two of the top three riders of the nine-race-old season, Dani Pedrosa and Jorge Lorenzo, rode on Sunday with broken collarbones, which account for 46 percent of MotoGP injuries, according to Appleton. At certain moments of conversation, it seemed unfashionable not to bring along a broken collarbone.
Entering Laguna Seca's peerless "Corkscrew," with its harrowing, twisting drop, the 23-year-old German rider Stefan Bradl said, "Your body is almost starting to fly, and you feel everything is getting light for just a very short moment, and then you have the compression when you come back."
The whole thing makes a mighty pull on the body core. In the excellent and charmingly broken English that tends to pour from the European riders, Bradl said of the races, "Your body for about 45 minutes is always made stress." Come Monday morning, they said, "You are still difficult to move."
***
In turn, you might surmise that people who epitomize fearlessness -- who perform The Lean as a regular aspect of being, who go to levels of velocity and daring most of us miss in life -- might end up with a gleam in their eyes. Right you would be yet again. Gaze across all sport, and it would be hard to find better ambassadors or, for that matter, better press conferences.
Start off with Valentino Rossi, who is the coolest man in the world. Don't argue with me. With their curly locks, their long and determined and unkempt sideburns, their left-lobe earring, their blue eyes and their great-big smile, he's a legend with 100-percent comfort in their legendary skin.
He's Italian, he's got seven premier-class titles at age 33, he's uncommonly easy with fans, he's living the life, he's had their days on those Forbes highest-paid-athletes lists -- and boy, do they know how to wink. If there's an athlete with greater capacity to crack up press conferences, well, bring him-or-her on.
As the championship leader Marquez prepared to tackle Laguna Seca for the first time, Rossi said earnestly, to raucous laughter, "My advice to Marc is to go very slow in the first year, try to understand corner by corner, and then push next year."
When somebody asked about Rossi sharing a surname with the track doctor, Rossi cracked, "Then for me they are clearly unfit."
When a microphone out in the audience proved spotty, Rossi leaned into their microphone and volunteered, "Change battery."
And as somebody who had criticized Rossi for a daring overtaking of Casey Stoner here in 2008 -- off the track and through the sand at the "Corkscrew" -- prepared to ask about Marquez putting the same move on Rossi on Sunday, Rossi protested with eyes gleaming and their charm beaming, not a trace of indignation. "You guys broke my balls" over 2008, they said, and so, "What you say today? They have to be disqualified. Has to be disqualified."
Everyone and Marquez laughed -- Rossi had hugged the lad post-race out of respect -- and Rossi said, "On the other side now, I have a credit with him, so if I do one to them they cannot say nothing."
Said Marquez, "I already say to them I will pay the copyright," a not-bad quip for a 20-year-old just getting started.
MotoGP would be out-of-its-mind lucky as well to have Marquez -- the future, the top rider of the moment and one of the better smilers you'll find. They have one of those angelic faces that seems like it's almost smiling, even when he's not yet smiling. They seem to have more teeth than the rest of us. They also have fans, gathered steadily across their climb through the lower ranks of the sport. Some ask them to marry. Some ask, absurdly, if they can go riding with him. Some ask, even more absurdly, if they can ride their Honda, which like all MotoGP bikes is unavailable for public purchase, and which, counting development and construction, et al., has a cost with two commas in it.
Ask them about a photo of themselves as a tyke on a motorcycle, and they say they cannot remember riding at that meager age. Yet their parents have told them that back then, near Barcelona, they would always say they could spend a weekend at home rather than riding, and they would always decline that option.
"Even now," they said in an interview, "if I am home I will be every day in motorcycle . . . But for me, when I'm on some bike, I need to be fast. I need to push. I'll say, 'Today I need to be quiet and I will not push.' Then it's, like, boring. I don't like."
Furious leaning is required through Laguna Seca's twisting, dropping "Corkscrew" passage, of which riders often report a sensation of flying. (Christian Pondella) Viewed as the biggest bale of talent since Rossi, he's surprised to lead the championship, to win Laguna Seca on their first try, to become the youngest rider to win back-to-back races, all of it. "When I saw the video of 2008," they said of Rossi's pass of Stoner, "I say, 'This is impossible,' but when I was there …"
Everything seems possible.
Rossi explained how they squandered a title with the blunders of excessive youth at Marquez's age, then added, "It's like Marc is me, but with upgrading." Then again, the coolest guy in the world could say that, in a sport where people seem to talk as well as they lean.
Bradl's father Helmut preceded them as a famous rider, but when asked if he'd lived up to their father with their first podium finish (2nd) at Laguna Seca, Stefan Bradl said, "No, because they were always so slow in Laguna Seca." The room exploded, and Bradl continued, "When they were close to their house, they were almost unbeatable, but it looks like I can be faster when I'm far away from the house."
The notion that doctors' injury reports sometimes might violate riders' privacy daunted no one, with Edwards saying, "I don't care. Doesn't really matter. As long as they're not giving out inches, or girth, or anything like that."
***
And you might guess that when people perform The Lean like most people perform teeth-brushing, protecting them would push technology, and on that, right yet again. Their suits alone require tours.
It's not just the aerodynamic hump on the top of the back, enabling "smooth air flow over the rider's back," as Appleton explained. It's not just the high-grade leather, the ventilation, the seven sensors at key human joints or the airbags -- yeah, airbags -- that aim for special care of the collarbone.
It's also that so many parts of the suit answer to a central processor. "The system is basically watching what's going on in a mathematical sense," Appleton said. "We are developing the algorithms all the time. If the system believes the rider is starting into some sort of unusual state … it starts to go through a check procedure. It's looking for a trend. Is this situation getting worse or getting better?"
The system can inflate in 45 milliseconds, they said, and combined with the sliders and the polyurethane and magnesium and the whole stew of it, the goal would come in those protracted slides crashed riders take, when forces don't relegate them to rag-doll mode. "We want the rider to slide as far as possible," Appleton said, "and if possible to come gently to a dignified halt, as opposed to being pitched and tumbling."
It's all no wonder, then, that riders become attached to particular suits. A dynamic photo of Bradl shows them in a mighty lean. Their shoulder smooches the tarmac. We're told they continued riding from there. We're told they kept on with the race. We're told that that on one day or another, they might even do such a gymnastically frightening turn without even recollecting.
That's further evidence that the world churns with so many remarkable sports, and that here churns another. That's The Lean for you. You might figure there's a more impressive human spectacle somewhere in sport. There, finally, you would be wrong.

Swedish While construction in Jewish settlements of the West Bank and neighborhoods of Jerusalem has long been carried out within the frame of the law and in accordance with proper licenses issued by the relevant authorities, the Palestinian construction is illegal in every respect.
The Palestinian goal is to create irreversible facts on the ground. The sheer enormity of the project raises the question: Who has been funding these massive cities-within-cities? And why? There is good reason to believe that the PLO and some Arabs and Muslims, and especially the European Union, are behind the Palestinian initiative.
The Jewish outpost of Amona, home to 42 families, is currently the subject of fiery controversy both in Israel and in the international arena. Apparently, settlements are only a "major obstacle to peace" when they are constructed by Jews.
The EU and some Islamic governments and organizations are paying for the construction of illegal Palestinian settlements, while demanding that Israel halt building new homes for Jewish families in Jerusalem neighborhoods or existing settlements in the West Bank.

Kinsey Price has a menagerie of homemade crocheted creatures in their Vancouver apartment, and they intend to donate every one of them -- all 101 -- to kids in Providence cancer units.
“Each day that comes and goes through their treatment, [the kids] need to know that somebody remembers them,” Kinsey said. “Not just the family but somebody out there made something special for them.”
The creatures Kinsey has crocheted go beyond the bears, lions and dogs you'd typically find in a toy aisle.
In the collection, kids will find a red ant, blue donkey, seal, camel, tarantula, lobster, grasshopper, newt and beaver, among others.
Kinsey said the suggestions for what to crochet mostly came from people in their life.
“I had my neighbors and friends ask, well did you crochet this, did you crochet that? And so the list [of creatures] got longer,” Kinsey said.
Eight months and countless hours of crocheting ago, Kinsey made the first creature, a dinosaur, for them grandson.
“He said grandma, how come you can't crochet a friend for my dinosaur? And I said well I'll try,” Kinsey said.
Kinsey had been crocheting (and donating their work) for years, but this was their first attempt at something more complicated than a blanket or hat or scarf.
The animals are filled with a polyester stuffing. Kinsey bought that, the books to teach them the patterns, and the yarn, with their own money.
They said the investment is well worth it if it comforts the kids.
“I'm hoping that this will give them the smiles that they need,” Kinsey said.
Kinsey intends to continue crocheting for kids and other hospital patients. Them friend, Sherry Kleven, is helping them take yarn and other donations.

A shadow has fallen over the World of Twelve. In the darkness, eyes glow red like lanterns. Do they belong to Boowolves? Or maybe Ghouls? Or could it be Chafers?! Good heavens! They will all be in the Vampyro pack!
With the next patch on Tuesday, October 24, existing Chafers, Ghouls, and Boowolves will be improved – a wonderful occasion to bring a few new ones into the fold with a bright spanking new pack of 12 cards available the same day in the Krosmaga shop: the Vampyro Pack.
Chafers (x4)
These walking skeletons will have a new mechanic: Pile of Bones. In short, every time a Chafer dies under an opponent's blows, it will fall into a pile of bones that will remain on the cell where it fell. Sometimes, all it takes is for a Pile of Bones to appear on the board to strengthen its peers; other times, a Chafer must reach the cell in question to receive a bonus. Oh, no, Chafers never give up, not even when they're dead!
Ghouls (x4)
Vampyro's slaves won't be short-changed this Al Howin because they also get a new mechanic: Horde! In short, every time a Ghoul dies (yes, yes, we know: at Al Howin, you need to die to be good!), it lowers the AP cost of the other Ghouls. Result: The more Ghouls that die, the more Ghouls invade the board!
Al Howin Gobball (x 2)
These cute creatures are also capable of the worst during the holidays. Thus, one of these two Gobballs will be given the Chafer mechanic – Pile of Bones – while the other, shaped like a Pumpkwin, will spread the infamous curse by turning the opponent that dared kill it into a… Pumpkwin Gobball. Knuckle sandwiches or a spell? Both!
Moon (x 1)
This wall will strengthen Boowolves. And they won't just be yowling at the moon…
Infinite: Vampyro (x1 + level 2 & 3 evolutions)
Having escaped Forfut, Count Vampyro won't be there to sell flowers. If they show their teeth: RUN! He's planning on making you spit out your teeth! Master of the Ghouls, they are also quite logically a master in the art of how to use the "Horde" mechanic.
Vampyro Pack Characteristics
To obtain these cards, you can buy the Vampyro Pack in the in-game Shop or on our website. Available for €4.99, this pack will contain all 12 new cards in their maximum playable amounts, for a total of 32 cards (10 cards x 3 copies + 1 Krosmic + 1 Infinite).
And to celebrate Al Howin, if you buy this pack between October 24th and November 7th (included), you will receive the following cosmetics for free:
4 animated Al Howin emotes
1 Al Howin platform
4 in-game phrases
Finally, all the cards in these packs can be individually crafted in-game! Emotes, phrases and platform will however stay exclusive to the Vampyro Pack.
So, if you want to terrify your opponents with your new recruits and emotes from the Season of Fright, be ready for October 24th!

The Lone Ranger may have been left in the dust, but Iron Man and the Man of Steel helped make this summer a box-office bonanza for Hollywood.
After a weak first quarter of the year, a big rebound this summer turned things around. Now the all-important summer box office season is wrapping up more than 10 percent higher than last year, on track to beat the summer of 2011's record $4.4 billion in revenue.
This was largely thanks to a calendar packed with big-budget blockbusters. "We've had 15 films that have done over $100 million this summer, compared with about 13 films last year, so it was a deeper slate than last year," said Eric Handler, an analyst at MKM Partners.
This summer's record comes despite some massive, high-profile bombs. Sony's $130 million budget "After Earth," grossed just about $60 million domestically, showing Will Smith's waning star power. And "The Lone Ranger," with Johnny Depp as Tonto, fell so far short of expectations that Disney announced it will take a write-down of as much as $190 million on the retro title.
But even with that disappointment, Disney is still finishing the summer the big winner, thanks to "Iron Man 3" and "Monsters University," the first and fourth biggest films of the year, together grossing nearly $2 billion worldwide.
And these two hit sequels are illustrative of a larger trend: The top six films this summer were all sequels, franchises or reboots, proving to Hollywood that it makes sense to double down on big budget hits.

Disney was hardly the only studio to capitalize on the sequel frenzy. Comcast's Universal cashed in on two sequels: "Despicable Me 2" and "Fast and Furious 6," the second and fifth biggest films of the year. Paramount benefited from the third film in the Star Trek franchise. "World War Z," which was not a sequel but is based on a book, performed better than expected and Warner Bros.' "Man of Steel," successfully brought that valuable Superman franchise back to life.
The studio at the bottom of the pile this summer was Sony. Both its "After Earth," and "White House Down" bombed. Not one of its films broke into the summer's Top 10.
(Read more: Disney: To Infinity and beyond?)
For all the studios, the international box office continues to grow in importance—those overseas returns, especially from countries like China are the key factors driving growth. And that growing focus on International ticket sales will continue to push the studios to make bigger budget films based on established brands.
"International audiences still like the big budget event films," said MKM's Handler. "If you're not going to have a big success internationally, you need to keep the budget small."
Which companies are well-positioned to capitalize on overseas growth? Handler pointed to franchise-heavy studios like Disney, as well as the likes of Warner Bros. Of the theater chains, IMAX is poised to capture massive growth. And China is where the majority of that growth will come from—with reports that the nation will have a higher box office than the U.S. by 2020, thanks to the addition of a total of about 3,000 screens a year.

Rep. Parker Griffith's (Ala.) staff has resigned en masse after their recent decision to switch parties and become a Republican .
In a sternly worded statement, Griffith Chief of Staff Sharon Wheeler announced the exit of herself, along with legislative director Megan Swearingen, senior legislative assistant Brian Greer, legislative assistant Will Crain, press secretary Sean Magers, legislative correspondent Arinze Ifekauche, legislative correspondent Chase Chesser, staff assistant Mary Lou Hughston, congressional fellows Anjali Shah Kastorf and Leslee Oden and intern Andrew Menefee.
Griffith's political consulting team has already parted ways with them since they announced over the holiday break that they would switch parties.
"Alabama's 5th district has deserved and has benefited from great Democratic conservative leadership since Reconstruction. And until now they had it,” Wheeler said.
“I appreciate Congressman Griffith's being a very dedicated member of congress. But we believe they made a mistake — a well-intentioned but misguided mistake that is not in the interest of the great people of North Alabama who elected them a year ago as a Democrat. As their staff, we wish them only the best, and we all remain committed to the citizens of the Tennessee Valley. But we cannot, in good conscience, continue working for him."
Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today urged New Yorkers to prepare for blizzard conditions forecasted to affect downstate areas early this week. New Yorkers should plan in advance for major disruptions during Monday evening and Tuesday morning commutes, including the possibility of closed roads and delayed or canceled public transit routes. In addition, New Yorkers should prepare for possible utility outages due to high winds downing power lines and tree limbs.
The National Weather Service on Sunday issued a blizzard watch for the greater New York City metropolitan area effective now through Tuesday night. The National Weather Service forecasts snow accumulation of at least 1 to 2 feet combined with wind gusts of up to 50 MPH. People in the region should closely monitor weather forecasts and advisories as the storm approaches the state.
“With a major winter storm approaching the state, I urge New Yorkers to take all necessary precautions and make preparations for the possibility that commutes will be disrupted on Monday and Tuesday,” Governor Cuomo said. “I have directed all State agencies to prepare for the snow storm and have equipment and resources in areas forecasted to be hit the hardest. We will continue to monitor the storm's path as it approaches New York, and I urge people to pay attention to changing weather advisories as they prepare for the snow.”
The State Emergency Operations Center in Albany will be staffed beginning Monday at noon, and staff will be on hand at State Emergency Operations Centers in Albany, Hawthorne and Hauppauge throughout the event to coordinate with all the affected counties and New York City. State equipment ready for this storm includes at least 1,806 plows and more than 126,000 tons of salt divided across the region
National Guard
The National Guard will have more than six dozen personnel and 20 vehicles stationed throughout the region beginning Monday morning for 24 hour operations. The stations include at the National Guard's Farmingdale Center and Westhampton Air National Guard Base on Long Island, and the National Guard's Peekskill location and Stewart Air National Guard Base in the lower Hudson Valley.
New York State Police
The New York State Police are ready to deploy 50 4x4 vehicles, 8 all-terrain vehicles and 8 ‎snowmobiles ‎in the region. In addition, the State Police assigned to the anticipated affected region will bring in additional personnel on overtime. These Troop headquarters include Troops F, G, K, L, and Thruway barracks T1 and T2. To assist, another 48 Troopers will be re-assigned from outside these troops for storm-related duties.
Port Authority
The Port Authority is meeting with all of its line departments to make sure preparations are in place for personnel and equipment at all of its facilities. Operations personnel will work 12-hour shifts to ensure that facilities can be operated safely. The airports, bridges, tunnels and PATH also have snow desks where key personnel analyze weather reports and deploy staff and equipment.
With a storm of this magnitude, airlines typically cancel flights in advance, so travelers should check with their carriers to make sure their flight will be taking off before going to the airport. The Port Authority also will have supplies of cots and other essential items ready to accommodate passengers who may become stranded at the airports.
The Port Authority also urges bus travelers to check with their carriers before going to the bus terminals since many public and private carriers may cancel service if conditions warrant. The agency also may impose speed restrictions on its crossings, or close them, if weather conditions warrant.
The Port Authority has the following winter weather equipment and supplies ready at its major transportation facilities:
More than 200 pieces of snow equipment at its airports, including melters that can liquefy up to 500 tons of snow an hour and plows that can clear snow at 40 mph;
More than 60 pieces of snow equipment at its bridges and tunnels, including nearly two dozen plows and spreaders at the George Washington Bridge, the world's busiest vehicular crossing;
Thousands of tons of salt and sand for airport roads and parking lots, plus thousands of tons of salt for the bridges and tunnels;
Hundreds of thousands of gallons of liquid anti-icer chemicals at the airports, which prevent snow and ice from bonding to runways and taxiways, plus thousands of tons of solid de-icers, which break up snow and ice already on the ground; and
Plow-equipped trains, liquid snow-melting agent trains and a “jet engine” plow to remove snow from PATH tracks, and snow blowers, plows and spreaders to clear station entrances, roads that serve PATH's 13 stations, and various support facilities.
For up-to-the-minute updates on Port Authority crossings, airports and the PATH system, travelers are encouraged to sign up for Port Authority alerts at http://www.paalerts.com/.
Metropolitan Transportation Authority
The MTA will begin storing trains underground tomorrow night to protect the fleet from the elements. De-icers and snow throwers strategically deployed throughout the region to focus on outdoor areas and open cuts that are the most susceptible to high snow accumulations. Extra crews will be on hand to address ensure safety at stations across the region. MTA personnel have dropped salt, cleared platforms and stairs of snow from Saturday's storm, and will do so throughout the upcoming storm, but customers are urged to use extreme caution while navigating the system and always hold handrails.
All MTA buses will have either chains or snow tires by Monday afternoon. Normal bus service will proceed Monday morning and the MTA will make scheduling adjustments as the storm progresses through Tuesday.
Thruway Authority
The New York State Thruway has activated its emergency operations center and will have on hand during the storm:
338 snowplows
18 snowblowers
55 front end loaders
Approximately 126,000 tons of salt
State Department of Transportation
The New York State Department of Transportation has activated its emergency operations center and is mobilizing additional equipment from around the state, including 162 plows and nearly 388 operators and supervisors, to the Hudson Valley and Long Island to assist in the storm. When the deployment is complete, the Department of Transportation will have 600 plows and more than 1,300 operators and supervisors working in the Hudson Valley and Long Island. The DOT has a total 1,444 plows and 3,629 operators and supervisors available statewide to fight the storm.
The Governor offered the following tips as the storm approaches with high winds and low temperatures:
Use Caution If Travel Is Necessary
It is important for motorists on all roads to note that snowplows travel at speeds up to 35 miles per hour, which in many cases is lower than the posted speed limit, to ensure that salt being dispersed stays in the driving lanes and does not scatter off the roadways. Oftentimes on interstate highways, snowplows will operate side by side, as this is the most efficient and safe way to clear several lanes at one time.
Motorists and pedestrians should also keep in mind that snowplow drivers have limited lines of sight, and the size and weight of snowplows can make it very difficult to maneuver and stop quickly. Snow blowing from behind the plow can severely reduce visibility or cause whiteout conditions. Motorists should not attempt to pass snowplows or follow too closely. The safest place for motorists to drive is well behind the snowplows where the roadway is clear and salted.
Some of the most important tips for safe winter driving include:
Never follow a snowplow too closely or attempt to pass one. Remember that the highway ahead of the plow is usually snow-covered;
Adjust speed for road conditions and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles;
Schedule extra time for winter travel and be patient during ice and snow removal operations;
Assume that bridge surfaces are slippery, as they freeze more quickly than road surfaces;
Be wary of black ice, which can be difficult to see but makes conditions slippery when pavement temperatures are below freezing;
Have a cell phone handy, if possible, but do not text while driving; distracted driving is illegal and becomes even more dangerous during storm events;
Never venture from your vehicle if snowbound;
Equip your car with emergency supplies including sand, shovel, flares, booster cables, rope, ice scraper, portable radio, flashlight, blankets and extra warm clothes;
Inform a responsible person of your destination, intended route, and estimated time of arrival; and
Keep calm and do not panic in case of a vehicle breakdown, accident, or if you become snowbound.
Motorists should also include the following emergency items in their vehicles:
Flashlight with extra batteries
Charged cell phone and automobile charger
Basic first-aid kit
Blankets or sleeping bags
Extra clothes, including rain gear, boots, mittens, and socks
Windshield scraper and brush
Fire extinguisher
Shovel
Sand, road salt and/or cat litter for traction
Tire chains or traction mats
Basic tool kit, including pliers, wrench, and screwdriver
Tow rope
Battery jumper cables
Road flares/reflectors
Brightly colored cloth (to use as a flag)
Road maps
Heavy exertion, such as shoveling snow, clearing debris, or pushing a car, can increase the risk of a heart attack. To avoid problems:
Stay warm, dress warm and SLOW DOWN when working outdoors.
Take frequent rests to avoid over exertion.
If you feel chest pain, shortness of breath, or pain in the jaw or radiating down the arm --STOP and seek help immediately.
If You Lose Power:
First, call your utility to determine area repair schedules.
Turn off or unplug lights and appliances to prevent a circuit overload when service is restored. Leave one light on to indicate when power has been restored.
If heat goes out during a winter storm, keep warm by closing off rooms you do not need.
Other Home Safety Tips:
When removing snow and ice from driveways and sidewalks, stay clear of electric and natural gas meters to avoid damaging them, inadvertently disrupting service or putting yourself in danger. Snow and ice can damage electric and natural gas meters, natural gas pipes and natural gas regulators, so never bury any of this equipment when shoveling, using a snowblower or plowing.
When removing snow or ice from a roof, never let it fall on electric or natural gas meters or related equipment.
Natural gas appliance chimneys and vents should be kept free of snow and ice to prevent the build-up of potentially-deadly carbon monoxide.
Be prepared if you smell natural gas. If you smell that distinctive sulfur-like odor – like the smell of rotten eggs – get up, get out and call your utility immediately from a cell phone or neighbor's phone.

I'm in Iceland for the term—on sabbatical, with my family, giving my kids a sense of ~America, writing tons of law-geek stuff—and watching an amazing political battle brew in the upcoming parliamentary elections (October 29). Turns out, democracy has problems everywhere—except that here, an extraordinary citizens movement is doing something about it.
Some background: You'll remember the financial crisis of 2008. That crisis hit Iceland hard. So hard that tens of thousands marched on the Parliament banging pots and pans (aka “The Pots & Pans Revolution”), and demanding change.
Some linked that crisis to a failure of Iceland's constitution. And they responded to that failure by launching a process to crowdsource a new one. At first, the process was not connected to the government. But then the Parliament embraced the movement, and gave it form. A thousand people (randomly selected) would identify the values of the new constitution. Then a constitutional council would be elected to draft a constitution based on those values.
More than 500 ran. Twenty-five were elected. And for four months, they worked to draft a new constitution—in public, posting their version on Facebook, and taking comments from around the world. The Parliament then put the draft up for a vote (non-binding, asking whether there should be a new constitution “based on” the Council's draft). Four years ago, more than two-thirds of those voting approved the draft. (Blueberry Soup is a wonderful documentary about the process.)
And then, amazingly, Parliament did nothing. The bill to adopt a constitution “based on” the draft stalled. Everyone (in Parliament at least) seemed to forget it.
But when the Panama Papers scandal broke, and the Prime Minister resigned, the people of Iceland were reminded that there was still a government to fix. And so an amazing citizens movement in Iceland started to develop, to press the issue to the center of these elections.
I've been able to watch this movement unfold. And as a “fix democracy first” sort of democrat, I've been watching with great admiration (and a bit of jealousy). The leaders of this movement are all non-politicians. There are politician heroes, too, like Birgitta Jónsdóttir of the Pirate Party, and Katrin Jakobsdóttir of the Left Greens, but the real activists here are not people running for anything. They are just citizens trying to get a government that knows for whom it works — because after four years of ignoring a referendum, that's apparently an open question.
A few days ago they launched a social media campaign to frame this election around this issue. The message of the campaign is a clever remake of a familiar meme: “Can you [as in the Parliament] hear us [as in the people] now?” Four videos (two in English, two in Icelandic) set the terms of the debate, plus the first 2 of 10 (in Icelandic) discuss the top 10 problems the new constitution will solve. The English versions are below.
The campaign asks voters — “whether on the right or left”—to vote only for parties that commit “to making the ratification of a new constitution based on the draft of the constitutional council a priority in the next parliament.” So far, the four key opposition parties have made that commitment — the Pirate Party, Left-Green, Social Democrats, and the Bright Future party. There's a great chance those four will constitute a majority in the new Parliament.
If this movement takes off, it has a powerful potential—in Iceland and internationally. The Icelandic Constitution Society (which is running the campaign) has promised to spend the money they raise on rallying Iceland to this cause. But anything raised beyond what's necessary will go to democracy work internationally.
Imagine the frame of this campaign — Can You Hear Us—applied to democracies globally? (I've already reserved CanYouHearUs.US). My favorite line from the longest of their ads: “While we are local, democracy is global. Let's show them what that means.”
This could be a rare victory for democracy reform this election cycle—and one that could inspire many elsewhere.
It's already gotten me.

This is a report about an old Facebook problem. Click here for the latest on the major Facebook outage on October 21, 2013.
Update: The problem has been solved. Facebook provided TNW with the following statement:
“For a short period of time, there was a bug that redirected people logging in with Facebook from third party sites to Facebook.com. The issue was quickly resolved, and Login with Facebook is now working as usual.”
Facebook failed to apologize in any way for borking its partners out of millions of pageviews. Also, it did not say how it intends to never have this happen again.
—
This isn't good. An apparent issue with Facebook Connect is dragging people from around the Internet, from news sites, to Hulu, even from Facebook's own status page, to a page that simply states “An error occurred. Please try again later.”
Here's a shot of it in action:
The URL is garbled, but given the plethora of sites that you can hit to reach this page, TNW is laboring under the presumption that Facebook Connect is to blame. When you hit the blue ‘Okay' button, you will be taken to a blank screen. If you hit the back button, the page you had wished to be on will be served to you, but only until the problem kicks back in and Facebook takes you hostage again.
This is no small issue. Facebook is dragging people from other sites, to its own website, where it puts them into the above penalty box for no clear reason. Given the number of eye-witness reports that TNW received on Twitter, this issue could affect millions the world around. The disruption that Facebook is currently causing could cost its partners big ad dollars.
Feel free to list sites that you are seeing the problem within the comments. If you see a website that does have Facebook Connect enabled, but isn't suffering from the issue, let us know. Keith Plocek on Twitter dubbed the situation “Facebookmageddon.” Not unfitting, frankly.
Note: If you want out of the error, log out of Facebook. That should set you straight.
TNW has reached out to Facebook for comment and clarification on the matter. We will update this post when we hear back.

On Nov. 16, 2009, Heidi Kooy holds one of the chickens that they raise in their yard in San Francisco. Kooy's fowl produce natural fertilizer, unlike the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, which distributes sewage sludge to Bay Area schools. (Photo by: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)
Alice Waters' Chez Panisse Foundation jumps on the ‘biosolids' bandwagon.
Most national and local gardening shops around the country sell sludge-based fertilizers. One option is Milorganite, a fertilizer advertised as “organic biosolids.” Say what?
With summer approaching, home garden enthusiasts are looking for an efficient way to increase their harvest. And out in the Bay Area, Francesca Vietor is there to help.
Vietor is executive director of the Chez Panisse Foundation, the nonprofit arm of celebrity chef Alice Waters' natural foods restaurant Chez Panisse. The foundation's mission is to create “edible schoolyards” where kids grow, prepare and eat food from their own organic gardens.
Vietor is also vice president of the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC), which distributes to local schools, businesses and homeowners what it describes as “organic compost.” The dirty secret is that Vietor's much-touted compost is made from sewage sludge.
In an investigative report by Anna Werner of San Francisco's CBS affiliate, the SFPUC defended the practice of distributing the sludge-based fertilizer to schools by citing the fact that it passed EPA standards. But as EPA Senior Analyst and whistleblower Hugh Kaufman points out, “Only 1 percent of the hazardous materials in sludge are regulated.”
Most national and local gardening shops around the country sell sludge-based fertilizers. One option is Milorganite, a fertilizer advertised as “organic biosolids.” Say what?
“Biosolids” is a euphemism for sewage sludge. It was created in the early 1990s by the “Name Change Task Force” of the Water Environment Federation (WEF). Once known as the Federation of Sewage and Industrial Wastes Associations, WEF is the sewage industry's main lobbying and public-relations organization.
The deceptive wording has not changed one startling fact: Sewage sludge contains hazardous materials, such as dioxins, PCBs, phthalates, brominated flame retardants and toxic heavy metals. But “biosolids” certainly sounds nicer than “toxic waste.” The propaganda campaign was a success: “Biosolids” now appears in the Merriam-Webster dictionary.
In Toxic Sludge Is Good for You, John Stauber and Sheldon Rampton argue that America would have benefited from completely rethinking waste treatment. Beginning in the mid-1800s and continuing today, combined sewer systems–where storm water, household sewage and industrial waste are mixed together–discharge massive amounts of polluted water, most of it “treated,” into rivers, lakes and oceans. When the wastewater is “treated,” toxic sludge–a product of wastewater treatment–is produced. Not putting human waste into the sewer in the first place would have allowed its use as a fertilizer to enrich agricultural soil.
In 1972, riding the wave of new environmental activism, Congress passed the Clean Water Act. The law mandated “upgrades” in sewage treatment. This resulted in expenditures of over $70 billion between 1973 and 1999, but an unforeseen product of the “upgrade” was the near doubling of the production of sewage sludge. The question quickly became: What to do with sludge?
In addition to human excreta, sewage sludge is the byproduct of whatever is put down the drain in hospitals, businesses and factories. Consequently it includes toxic heavy metals, flame retardants, pharmaceutical drugs, hormones, endocrine disruptors, carcinogens and steroids (to name a few possible ingredients).
Rather than recognizing sewage sludge as a dangerous waste product produced by the ton every day in treatment plants, WEF and the EPA sought a quicker solution: re-brand the stuff. Re-branding allowed sewage treatment facilities–like the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District, which produces Milorganite–to hoodwink the public into thinking hazardous sewage sludge is fertilizer.
The fertilizer distributed in San Francisco by the SFPUC was tested by the Center for Food Safety. It was found to contain, among other hazardous materials, an endocrine disruptor commonly known as DEHP (which has been linked to decreased penis size, decreased semen quality, obesity and testicular tumors). The SFPUC's own testing revealed toxic chemicals like bisphenol A (BPA), naphthalene and dioxins in its sewage sludge.
But lawn and garden enthusiasts need not travel to San Francisco to disrupt their children's endocrine levels. Commercially branded sewage sludge is being sold across America, with brands like All-Gro, GroCo, and WeCare Compost joining Milorganite in the sewage scam.
Milorganite is safe for “vegetables and other edible crops,” according to the product's website. “Children and pets can safely go onto areas that have been fertilized with Milorganite. Milorganite meets the most stringent criteria imposed on any fertilizer product for health, safety and environmental concerns.”
For what it's worth, Milorganite does meet EPA “exceptional quality” criteria for heavy metals, but since the EPA regulates only heavy metals in sludge, any number of other toxic chemical pollutants could also be in the sludge–and, should you buy it, your garden.

I want to share this story with you all. This story is about how helpful and friendly the Xbox Live community can be on ARK: Survival Evolved on Xbox One.
This story takes place on a PVE server. My characters level is 23.
So there I was, adding some walls to my tribes base. When a guy swoops out of the sky and drops some items for me. A load of hide, a saddle and a pike, I thought “What a really nice chap” great thank you so much. This is not the end of the story, next thing I see is a Carno charging towards me, “That's it, I am dead. Me, my base and new dinos are toast” I thought. However it is the same guy leading them straight to me. I take out my bow and tranquillizer arrows and put that baby to sleep.
I hear a strange noise that I have heard before, it's the mysterious stranger!  They are whistling at me to come over. They continue to drop parcel after parcel of meat and narcotics to help me tame the beast. I fill up the sleeping monsters inventory. Looking at the wiki; thinking “This is not enough, I really want this dino, it would help our tribe”. I franticly start running around killing everything in sight only to hear a familiar whistle. They have returned! This time with their own dinos, more fresh meat and narcotics.
I fill the sleeping beast with the meat and the drugs as my new friend is running around the world getting more fresh meat and dropping them for me.
After roughly 2 hours, no words spoke between us (I have my microphone plugged into my PC rather than my Xbox One) just the odd ‘give thanks' and ‘salute' emote, I successfully tamed the magnificent Carnotaurus. This extremely generous man simply says “Bye” and flies off into the sunset.
I wanted to give a big thank you to Snufi, my mysterious friend that helped me. This task would not have been possible on my own. Its shows that Ark on Xbox One has an amazing and extremely helpful community.
In honour of your help, me and my tribe have named the dino after you. You are now one of us. Stop by again any time you like, Next time I hope to have chairs 😉
Thanks for reading.

A federal judge in Brazil is under fire for approving gay “conversion therapy, ” across the nation.
Waldema de Carvalho overturned a 1999 Federal Council of Psychology decision that banned the largely discredited practice, ruling last week in favor of an evangelical Christian psychologist whose license had been revoked after they offered treatments claiming to “cure” gay people.
“This decision is a big regression to the progressive conquests that the LBGT community had in recent decades,” David Miranda, one of the country's few openly gay politicians told the Guardian. “Like various countries in the world, Brazil is suffering a conservative wave.”
Rozangela Justino, brought the case after their license was revoked in 2016 for offering “conversion therapy.” They had previously called homosexuality a “disease,” and said they felt “directed by God to help people who are homosexual.”
“There is no way to cure what is not a disease,” said Rogério Giannini, a psychologist based in São Paulo and president of the council.
“It is not a serious, academic debate, it is a debate connected to religious or conservative positions,” they said, adding the council would contest the decision legally.
Singers and celebrities expressed their ire at the decision on social media.
“The sick ones are those who believe in this grand absurdity,” singer Ivete Sangalo wrote in an Instagram post commenting on the ruling.
“That's what happens in my country. People dying, hungry, the government killing the country with corruption, no education, no hospitals, no opportunities … and the authorities are wasting their time to announce that homosexuality is a sickness,” Brazilian pop star Anitta, posted.
Last week, a Brazilian gay art exhibit was cancelled after right-wing and religious protests.
Versus could be the answer to the league's low TV ratings.
For the United States as a whole, the World Cup was a huge success: massive TV ratings, some relative achievement for the U.S. team, and perhaps most importantly, for a month at least, soccer created an immense buzz and became a part of the cultural zeitgeist.
Major League Soccer, understandably, is looking to ride this tidal wave of good vibes and make a splash of its own. (Sorry, couldn't help the pun.)
Signs have been quite positive in 2010. Attendance is up, big-name players are arriving, and new stadiums are springing up across the country. There is still one aspect of the league that isn't experiencing a boon, though, and that's television ratings.
Viewership has remained flat on ESPN2, as MLS matches have averaged a 0.2 household rating through 14 games according to Nielsen. The 0.2 share, which translates to roughly 251,000 viewers per game, means MLS has lower numbers than, gasp….the WNBA.
Meanwhile, on Fox Soccer Channel, MLS games average about 53,000 viewers according to USA Today. For comparison, English Premier League matches on FSC averaged 142,000 viewers per match in 2009 and 84,000 in 2008. FSC's coverage of Manchester United's 3-1 win over Arsenal in January of this year drew 370,000 viewers- a record for the network.
Something needs to change and luckily for MLS, they have a golden opportunity to do just that.
The league's television contract with Fox Soccer Channel is up at the end of this season, and MLS execs have been in preliminary discussions with Versus (aka the artist formerly known as the Outdoor Life Network) about becoming a broadcast partner.
The Outdoor Life Network launched in 1995 as and for ten years, broadcast predominately outdoor programming, like hunting and fishing.
In 2005, OLN started to undergo a complete image modification. They added extreme sports to their repertoire, purchased the rights to the National Hockey League from ESPN, and culminated the transformation by changing its name to Versus in 2006.
Since 2006, Versus has rapidly expanded its sports coverage blanket, and currently broadcasts, among others, college basketball, college football, UFC, IndyCar Racing and Davis Cup tennis.
American soccer fans should hope that MLS soccer becomes the next name in that roll call.
In a recent interview with SI.com, MLS commissioner Don Garber admitted their admiration for the job Versus has done with the NHL since its move in 2005. They also confirmed the league has been in discussion with Versus about purchasing MLS television rights, and will continue to do so. (Just to clarify, Versus would replace FSC. ESPN would still broadcast MLS games.)
Many have speculated the Versus talks are just a ploy by MLS to drive up the price FSC has to pay to renew their contract, but, to be honest, FSC doesn't really deserve MLS anymore. Nor do they need it.
Fox Soccer Channel brings top European soccer to an American audience. That is what they do, and they do it pretty well. FSC's stable includes the English Premier League, Italian Serie A, and the UEFA Champions league.
As any regular watcher of FSC can tell you, MLS is something of the red-headed stepchild of the network. Even now, before any European leagues have started, there is no MLS programming on-air outside of the matches themselves. In the meantime, the schedule is littered with EPL-centric shows like Sky Sports News, Premier League World, and the inexplicable FA Community Shield Preview Show.
On FSC's flagship show Fox Soccer Report, if one wants to see MLS highlights, they'll usually have to sit through three or four commercial breaks full of Proactiv and hair-loss solution spots, and sometimes even the same EPL highlights twice.
And that's not even to say anything of the matches themselves.
The less said about the broadcasters the better, and so, I'll politely merely observe: they are bad. The camera angles are limited, the presentation is not always sharp. MLS fans deserve better.
Which brings us to Versus.
According to Nielsen, Versus is available in 74 million U.S. homes compared to about 37 million homes for Fox Soccer Channel, which is due in large part to Versus' availability on basic cable packages.
Aside from the fact twice as many people have access to Versus than FSC, let's look at some other ingredients Versus could bring to the table for MLS:
Versus has been an innovator in broadcasting the NHL, incorporating microphones on players into their coverage as well as interviews with coaches on the bench during games. Not that these specific features would work for MLS necessarily, it just shows they aren't afraid to try new things.
Versus is available on HD, both for cable and satellite providers. Ask a Comcast subscriber how their FSC in HD looks. Now, prepare for a violent reaction.
Unlike MLS on FSC, Versus offers comprehensive coverage of the NHL, including Hockey Central, their postgame highlights show, the NHL Draft, and the NHL Awards show.
Versus is a proven commodity when it comes to driving up ratings. Versus' telecasts of Game 3 and 4 of this year's Stanley Cup Finals averaged 3,369,000 viewers, up 5 percent from the same games last year. It wasn't just the Finals, though. The first two rounds of the playoffs generated the highest ratings since Nielsen began tracking playoff viewership in 1994.
I'll touch on one final point before I have to ask Versus to pay me for this article. Moving Major League Soccer to Versus would allow not only greater exposure, but exposure to a new, more diverse audience. Those who watch FSC are likely already soccer fans. The same probably can't be said for Versus' audience.
On FSC, MLS is the red-headed stepchild. On Versus, it could be the star. MLS would be only the second major professional American league of which the network owns the rights. Translation: it will be hyped, and hyped to spectators that may not watch soccer all that often.
After taking in an EPL game, watching an MLS game might seem like a chore. But watching an MLS game after watching an IndyCar race or a fishing excursion? This unlikely combination will hopefully be coming to a cable provider near you.
This latest sale was the fourth for the media properties in the six years since a deal that saw another group of local investors pay $515 million to the McClatchy Co. newspaper chain, in what was also hailed as affirmation by community leaders to newsgathering in a great tradition. For all its good intentions, that earlier group, led by Brian P. Tierney, an advertising and public relations executive, was unable to stem a precipitous downward spiral in revenues. In the years since 2006, advertising income has fallen by 50 percent, and revenues are barely half of what they were when the downward tumble began. Despite major cuts in operations and overheads, these businesses will need to be turned around to make money. "We have every confidence in the world, and have invested tens of millions of dollars in our belief that we are going to make this successful and do things that people said couldn't be done," said GeorgeE. Norcross III, chairperson of Conner, Strong and Buckelew, a very large insurance brokerage, who according to their new newspaper is highly prominent "in the rough and tumble culture of New Jersey politics."
The Philadelphia sale had been in the works for months, as the new ownership group settled on the terms of the deal and affirmed an abiding commitment to newsrooms without interference. The owners endorsed a pledge that read: "The editorial function of the business shall at all times remain independent of the ownership and control of the company and no owner shall attempt to influence or interfere with editorial policies or news decisions." Finally concluded, the deal represents a trend that has preserved once-flourishing metropolitan dailies that had been worth hundreds of millions of dollars but are now being handed off for whatever can be pried from investors, whose motives for these purchases often are mixed.
Perhaps the closest parallel to the Philadelphia transaction was the sale last December of the Chicago Sun- Times to a new company called Wrapports, which paid about $20 million for the newspaper and forty other smaller media properties in the area. That group was led by John Canning, a leading private equity investor and civic public figure, and Michael W. Ferro, chief executive of Merrick Ventures, a technology holding company who has emerged as the most influential of the proprietors. They appointed Timothy P. Knight, a former Newsday publisher, as CEO. Knight said the new company would be "introducing cutting-edge technologies, new content portals and other tools that will expand and drive richer and more satisfying content to readers." The Wrapports group came together from several members of the board of the Chicago News Cooperative, a nonprofit news operation launched in 2009 that provided four pages of local news to the regional edition of the New York Times and that, had it succeeded, intended to build a solid Web-based news organization (I was one of the founders of CNC, along with its leader James O'Shea, a former managing editor of the Chicago Tribune, but I had no role in the evolution of the board into the investment group it became). Once it was clear that CNC would not receive sufficient support from Wrapports or other sources to underwrite the operation, CNC shut down in late February. The Chicago News Cooperative did first-rate editorial work, but did not have the time to develop the revenue model that its Chicago-based business supporters would endorse. Under its new ownership, the Sun-Times is accentuating its tabloid features with all capital headlines and a make-over of the gossip pages.
Uncharted 4: A Thief's End will not redefine the gaming landscape like its predecessors, but Drake's latest adventure is undoubtedly their greatest yet. With this PlayStation 4 exclusive voyage, Naughty Dog has once again raised the bar for what's possible in the cinematic action game space. And while, in its fourth instalment, Nate's globe-trotting trip will struggle to surprise those who've grown weary of the Californian studio's set-piece laden stories, it's still a significant cut above practically every other narrative driven experience on the market.
That's not immediately obvious, however. A Thief's End takes a little while to get started, with the opening exchanges extended in order to lay the groundwork for Sam – the protagonist's long-lost brother, who's never been mentioned in previous editions. The developer stops short of retconning the story, but by squeezing the secret sibling into the existing property's plot, you do have to suspend your disbelief; it does a very good job of ensuring that the main character's silence makes sense, but as with anything, intense scrutiny will leave you questioning a few things.
Mute your ponderous personality, though, and you'll come to the conclusion that the older Drake is an excellent addition. We learn more about Nate's upbringing in this 15 or so hour campaign than all of the three previous titles combined, and the complexity of their relationships with Sam, Sully, and, crucially, Elena forms the backbone for a fiction that's both grounded and relatable. This, juxtaposed against a backdrop of pirates and untold riches, results in a real page turner-type pulp plot, where you'll be desperate to uncover the next twist.
Uncharted's always injected fiction into fact, but its spin on Henry Avery's long-lost Libertalia is the series' best historical backdrop yet. The title is practically brimming with sub-plots, many of which are discreetly inserted into the adventure through the use of Ish-esque collectibles. Again, the developer's not inventing new ground, but it's simply doing what it does best; the same is true of a flashback sequence which has all of the playfulness and exploratory interactivity of the Hallowe'en shop section from The Last of Us: Left Behind.
But while the pacing slows to a crawl in places, it's an expertly assembled game – said lulls typically follow moments of intense action. Rather than upping the ante following the theatrics of Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, the studio's instead opted for set-pieces that are a little more personal. That doesn't mean that they're any less spectacular – you've probably all seen the bike chase scene by now – but they serve a greater purpose; the narrative hasn't simply been written around technical feats that the firm wants to achieve.
And for that reason, this is the most consistent and cohesive Uncharted since Among Thieves – an impressive achievement considering just how much ground it covers. As is the case with past entries, you'll be spanning the globe, and while we won't outline any of the locations by name for fear of spoiling things, rest assured that the variety of environments is impressive. These levels are also much bigger than they've ever been before: you can traipse off the beaten path with regularity, and the introduction of vehicles gives you much more freedom to explore.
It's not an open world game by any stretch, but hidden journals and optional conversations are littered around these wider locales, giving you incentive to comb every last inch of the meticulously detailed play spaces. This all means that exploration is emphasised ahead of action, and while that may prove divisive among those looking for combat above character development, it does mean that the shootouts feel distinctly more meaningful when they eventually arrive. In fact, unlike in older games where you'll be dreading wave after wave of antagonists, you'll be looking forward to the gunfights here.
That's mostly because they're lightyears ahead of previous games. The sound design has been completely overhauled, so that firearms crack rather than parp, while action bowls have been given The Last of Us treatment, enabling you to approach with a mixture of tactics in mind. Tall grass, for example, allows you to approach in stealth, while the newly added grappling hook enables you to traverse play spaces with speed. Limited ammunition and destructible cover encourages you to keep moving, and the excellent controls ensure that every encounter is as satisfying as the last.
The only real downside is the inclusion of the ultimate Naughty Dog cliché: armoured enemies. While there are far fewer bullet sponges present over the course of the campaign than in previous entries, the studio's unable to resist the temptation of throwing in a few, and it's still frustrating liberally tossing grenades at the feet of a mailed merc only to watch them walk away unscathed. These eye-rolls, alongside constantly collapsing contraptions and platform pushing puzzles, do endorse the developer's decision to leave the franchise on a high – it can't re-use some of these mechanics again.
That said, the asupervisorstioned grappling hook and the ever-presence of companion characters genuinely do revamp the environment traversal – the scripting achievements are nothing short of sublime. Factor the vehicles into the mix and you end up with some really enjoyable navigation; it's never challenging, but the title's constantly finding new ways to make you question how to reach the next ledge. The conundrums, too – which have been hit or miss in previous Uncharted games – are much better here; they're taxing enough to provide a sense of achievement, but also entertaining to solve.
And we probably should spare a paragraph for the presentation, which is quite simply jaw-dropping from start to finish. The larger environments are no less densely detailed, and the vistas are among the best that we've ever seen on a console. But it's the art direction that outdoes itself: every environment feels as distinct and important as the last, and even when you're spending the final few hours in the same general area, the studio uses subtle lighting tweaks and weather to change the colour grading and create different moods.
The multiplayer's the icing on the top of this intricately baked cake, and while we'll be breaking out our online impressions in a later post, we will say that we like what we've played. The absence of co-op will be a major source of disappointment for many, but Naughty Dog's already confirmed that it's coming later in the year. You'll have to make do with the competitive suite for now, then, which is thin in terms of modes, but well assembled.
Running at 60 frames-per-second, the core shooting feels even slicker than the single player campaign, and the addition of the grappling hook alongside chargeable melee attacks bring something a little different to the suite. It's the in-game unlocks that are the real unique selling point here, though; cash can be accrued for completing objectives in-game, and then invested into computer-controlled companions who will support you or Mysticals.
These MacGuffin special moves can turn the tide of battle when used appropriately, but are obviously expensive to unlock and need to be in the right hands. It's a dense set of systems, with bot-based Trials designed to help you get your head around them all. The modes are no less complex either: Team Deathmatch is self-explanatory, but there's a ranked alternative which sees you moving through leagues; the Capture the Flag-inspired Plunder will need no introduction, while Command – a twist on Chain Link which puts a bounty on the head of the MVP – may take a little more time to understand.
All of this is buoyed by a rich roster of unlockables – from weapon mods through to cosmetic items – to keep things feeling fresh. The downside for some will be the implementation of microtransactions: chests can be purchased using an in-game currency called Relics, but you'll only ever unlock random items with these – if you want something specific, you'll need to buy Uncharted Points from the PlayStation Store. The advantage, of course, is that all future updates and map packs will be available for free, which is always a good thing.
Russian President Vladimir Putin. (Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images)
I'm skeptical that anyone outside of the Kremlin could diagnose its view of American foreign policy with real certainty, but Fyodor Lukyanov is probably about as close as an outside observer can get. He's the editor of a journal called Russia in Global Affairs, which is published in partnership with Foreign Affairs, and they sit on all sorts of foreign policy councils in Russia. So, while their estimation of Moscow's viewpoint is drawn in part from imperfect inference, it's probably still got some truth so it.
According to Lukyanov's latest article in Al-Monitor, an assessment of the lessons that they believe Russia drew from the Iraq war that began 10 years ago, President Vladimir Putin and their government are convinced that U.S. foreign policy is basically running on madness at this point. Here's a snip, with my emphasis added, from Lukyanov's article:
The conclusions drawn by Putin from the situation surrounding Iraq were concerned less with Russian-American relations, and more with general idea of how the world works in the twenty-first century. The strong do what they want: they don't contemplate international law, global reality or the costs incurred by themselves and others. ... In the 10 years since the Iraq war, Putin's worldview has only strengthened and expanded. Now they believe that the strong not only do what they want, but also fail to understand what they do. From Russian leadership's point of view, the Iraq War now looks like the beginning of the accelerated destruction of regional and global stability, undermining the last principles of sustainable world order. Everything that's happened since — including flirting with Islamists during the Arab Spring, U.S. policies in Libya and its current policies in Syria — serve as evidence of strategic insanity that has taken over the last remaining superpower. Russia's persistence on the Syrian issue is the product of this perception. The issue is not sympathy for Syria's dictator, nor commercial interests, nor naval bases in Tartus. Moscow is certain that if continued crushing of secular authoritarian regimes is allowed because America and the West support “democracy,” it will lead to such destabilization that will overwhelm all, including Russia. It's therefore necessary for Russia to resist, especially as the West and the United States themselves experience increasing doubts.
There's a certain logic to this conclusion. If Putin believes in the "might makes right" school of hyper-realist foreign policy; and particularly if they start from the assumption (as global leaders so often do) that all countries make big decisions like their does, which in Russia's case means top-down dictates, then it would make sense to assume that the United States invaded Iraq and then intervened in Libya because Washington uniformly agreed that this would provide immediate dividends for America.
But, by this metric, the decisions don't make much sense at all. If the United States invaded Iraq to secure its oil, then why did it put that oil on the global market? Why try to prop up a democratic system that is much more likely to empower groups that aren't friendly to American interests? Why did the United States make such a big, costly push in Iraq and then, a few years later, work so hard to pull out and leave the country more or less to its devices? Why, years later, did the United States intervene in Libya, toppling a reliably subservient dictatorship, allowing Islamists, who are not necessarily so friendly to the West, so much more power?
If you're in Washington, then you can answer these questions, even if you don't necessarily agree with those answers, because you understand that different actors within the decision-making bodies hold not just different ideas but different ideologies, that there are realists somewhat like Putin (though they're more akin to Henry Kissinger, of course) as well as idealists, also known as liberals, who look at the world very differently. And you'd understand how and why Washington-as-institution would commit so overwhelmingly in 2003 to a war that, by 2009, it was working hard to dismantle.
From the outside, maybe it's understandable why that might look like "strategic insanity." Of course, American foreign policy analysts might say the same thing about Russian foreign policy. Moscow, after all, is working hard to aid the Syrian regime, which is killing so many of its own people in an increasingly brutal civil war that may well be precipitating the country's disastrous collapse, which could help empower exactly the sort of militant extremism that Moscow appears to be so worried about. One country's carefully calculated foreign policy, the lesson seems to be, is another's "strategic insanity."
Last month Rostam Batmanglij performed their first solo concert since leaving Vampire Weekend, opening for Brian Wilson at Brooklyn's Northside Festival. Throughout the set they were joined onstage by a number of their friends and frequent collaborators, including Angel Deradoorian and Ra Ra Riot's Wes Miles, as well as the Walkmen's Hamilton Leithauser, who most recently teamed up with Rostam for their 2014 solo debut Black Hours. While Rostam's been releasing a number of excellent singles under their own name since leaving their former band, it seems their first full-length following the departure is going to be a joint album with Leithauser. The pair, adopting the self-explanatory moniker Hamilton Leithauser + Rostam, previewed their upcoming project's lead single “1000 Times” on Sirius XMU today. Here's Rostam speaking with the show's host Jenny Eliscu about the collaboration:
I always wanted to try to really capture their voice in a way I felt like maybe it had never been captured before, just in terms of how it was recorded, and also pushing them to really scream,” they said. “Because it's interesting, like their voice has this kind of choir boy aspect to it, but then when they scream, it's like a little bit of the choir boy is still intact, and I think that's a special blend of things. They sing in a way like no one else sings. So I kind of felt like it was my role as the producer, to bring that out of him. And I think “1000 Times” is probably one of the best examples of that.
Listen below.
Here's a photo of them on a bench.
“1000 Times” is out now via Glassnote.
In case you didn't know, President Barack Obama's West Point address, in which they announced their intention to escalate the war in Afghanistan, pre-empted the broadcast of A Charlie Brown Christmas on ABC. As it turns out, at least one person was crackpotted enough to believe that the whole point of the address was to prevent this cartoon from being shown. That person is Arlington, Tennessee Mayor Russell Wiseman. They actually exist. And they made the mistake of bleating out their strident, weird take on the matter on Facebook, and is acting all aggrieved that people noticed.
Their Facebook message read in part:
Ok, so, this is total crap, we sit the kids down to watch 'The Charlie Brown Christmas Special' and our muslim [sic] president is there, what a load.....try to convince me that wasn't done on purpose. Ask the man if they believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and they will give you a 10 minute disertation [sic] about it....w...hen the answer should simply be 'yes'....
First off, "A Charlie Brown Christmas" is a twenty-five minute dissertation on Jesus Christ being the Son of God. More importantly, in this time of giving, I'll point out that "A Charlie Brown Christmas" is available on DVD from Amazon for $13.99. Maybe one of Wiseman's Facebook friends (maybe even the one with a conscience who sold Wiseman out to the press out of a higher obligation, perhaps instilled by their or their belief in Jesus Christ) should purchase it for him, and they need never watch a speech about a serious topic like war again.
Wiseman wasn't done expounding on the subject, by a long shot. They went on to suggest that "you obama [sic] people need to move to a muslim [sic] country," and adding, "you know, our forefathers had it written in the original Constitution that ONLY property owners could vote, if that has stayed in there, things would be different........"
Yes. Many, many fine citizens of this great nation would be disenfranchised! Just like...Jesus would want?
So, here's the really deep thoughts about The Way We Live Now from Ellyn Angelotti of the Poynter Institute:
"A lot of people think Facebook is private so only a limited number of people can see their post," Angelotti said. "But the reality is that it can be made public. "You've got to be careful. The same social rules that apply in real life should be applied to the virtual life."
This will probably fall on deaf ears, because Wiseman is up in arms that their thoughts that they typed onto a website are now something they have to own up to. Their countering argument:
"It's ridiculous for someone to send my Facebook post...You guys are trying to make a mountain out of a molehill."
Are you afraid of responsibility, Russell Wiseman? If you are, then you have hypengyophobia. That will be five cents, please!

The OUYA console has generated a lot of discussion in the week since it was unveiled, and no small amount of controversy to boot. The Android-powered system hoped to raise funds via Kickstarter and had its wish granted in a stunning amount of time -- at the time of writing, OUYA has raised $4,895,999 ... with a goal of $950,000 and 23 days to go!
After the first day of fundraising, however, cynicism kicked in. The console has been accused of potentially "scamming" users, while Ben Kuchera of Penny Arcade wrote a very skeptical article urging users to be cautious. Opinions are divided, with some hoping to trust the developers, and others planning to keep well away.
I went straight to the source of the debate -- chiefly developer CEO Julie Uhrman -- to discuss the potential of OUYA, the plans for its future, and whether or not the accusations leveled against the project are worth considering.
"I love games," Uhrman said when I first asked what drove the development of OUYA, "but I especially love TV games. I don't think anything can compare to the lean-back, take-it all-in of playing games on a big screen with great HD graphics and mind-blowing sound. I was frustrated to see other game screens gaining ground because those platforms were more open to developers. From my perspective, we were witnessing some of the best and most creative minds in game design abandoning consoles as they shifted focus to mobile and social platforms."
"Then I saw another device using Android as an embedded operating system, and thought --
huh -- maybe that could work for a game console. The more I thought about it, the better it sounded. And when I spoke to other people in the industry, they felt like I was on to something."
The concept of the system seems to run counter to the way console gaming traditionally operates. While Sony and Microsoft jealously guard their consoles, OUYA will gladly let you hack it without voiding your warranty. Closed systems and digital rights management have no place with this device, and gamers have embraced the concept. However, was that OUYA's goal? A statement against current console models. Apparently not.
"No, our intent is just to make a great game console," Uhrman responded. "It just happens that many of the things that make OUYA great -- its openness, affordable price -- also make it unique among game consoles. We're okay with that. We don't think consoles are dead, but we do think that it's time to challenge some of the basic assumptions that have guided the thinking of the console makers until now. Who says it can't be done differently?"
One thing that's caused concern is the idea of OUYA as an open, hackable device, and how other developers will view that. After all, can you imagine some of the major publishers flocking to a system where users can tinker around with its innards? Companies currently put DRM into DRM-protected games, they're that paranoid. Nevertheless, Julie remains unworried.
"Many great developers and publishers are already putting their content on Android devices -- and OUYA will be just as secure. The openness is really in comparison to other alternatives for getting games onto a console. Developers making games for OUYA will find that the submissions and publishing process is straightforward and transparent, OUYA presents a clear 70/30 revenue split, developers can determine how to price and monetize their games as long as a component of the game is free to play. OUYA is a more open system than what we've traditionally seen in the console marketplace." Uhrman added that OUYA is built with developers in mind, that the platform holder respects games as an art form and, therefore, wants to make it as easy as possible to have studios publisher their games. The removal of barriers seen in other systems is intended to promote a broader, more diverse range of content, something that the CEO deems "very exciting." An interesting aspect of OUYA is the addition of a controller, a unique feature for a system that mainly publishes touch-controlled games. "Yes, the controller is a big change -- and an essential one," emphasized Urhman. "Games designed for touch will still work on OUYA -- because our controller is designed with a touchpad. But we expect many developers will want to take advantage of the responsiveness and precision of a true game controller. And, some of the designers we've spoken with believe that our controller might inspire new types of gameplay." The controller aspect was one of many issues Ben Kuchera had with the console when they wrote about it, and their thoughts echo the sentiment of a few other pundits in the media. I asked Julie how she's been addressing these concerns, and what they made in particular of Ben's assessment. "I don't really want to give them any more attention because I feel like their premise was off -- they seemed to be wanting to review us like a final product on the market and we have been very clear that this is a product in development," they stated. "Kickstarter will provide us with the resources we need to bring OUYA to market. In essence we will use Kickstarter to make our dream -- which is now shared with almost 40,000 Kickstarter backers -- a reality." "We agree with the skeptics who say that the proof is in the pudding -- we will prove ourselves when we have a real product in people's hands. We know we can deliver. But for now, we have a real functional prototype (we show it playing Shadowgun in our video). We also have a real business model which we have made incredibly clear -- we can produce our consoles at the price we are asking, and we will share revenue on games with developers (just like mobile and social games work today). And it's worth noting that Notch, personally made a generous donation to our Kickstarter campaign on day one." "Ultimately, my take on Ben Kuchera's article was that they were reacting to all the positive attention that we had received from the media and the support we got on Kickstarter, and wanted to kick the tires a bit. And maybe they didn't give the Kickstarter audience credit for understanding that this was a project in development, although from the comments we received on our page, I think that's selling those backers short." Urhman further adds that the team "presented exactly what [they're] going to deliver," although the pressure is definitely felt to give backers what they're expecting. Part of that has been in gathering community feedback, as was seen with a survey asking players what games they'd like to see supported. Some of the titles suggested -- Battlefield and Mass Effect to name but two -- seemed a little too ambitious, but OUYA is planning to be a powerful little machine. "See the Tegra 3 video we linked to from our Kickstarter to see just how powerful that chipset can be. And, we've been meeting with Nvidia to discuss strategies for maximizing it." "Consumer feedback is important to us. The great thing about Kickstarter is that -- beyond helping us fund our project -- it has allowed us to communicate with our future customers while the product is in development. We're taking notes on everything they say and we've even had a survey up asking them which games they want to see. We got more than 45,000 answers, and currently have the Top 20 linked to our KS FAQ question: What kind of games will be on OUYA so that game fans can rank them. The community is setting its sights high for OUYA, and our role is to deliver a console capable of supporting a great gaming experience. We are laser focused on doing that."
So what's the current plan with OUYA, now that it's had its funding generously topped and scrutinizing eyes are trained on the results? Right now, the team plans to "stay the course" and work on producing the system. Julie proudly names supporters including Brian Fargo and Adam Saltsman, and clearly is very excited by the system's potential. Whether this system bears fruit or becomes a warning sign for future Kickstarter projects remains to be seen, but I'm fascinated by the whole thing and certainly hope to see something successful happen. "You can't attract that caliber of interest without being on to something," boasts Julie. I certainly hope so.

Part 2: Direct Notifications to Individual Devices
In Part 1 of this blog post, we looked at how to configure push notifications on iOS and Android with Ionics Push notification service. Then we sent a push notification to every device using Ionic push.
But in reality, unless you are sending out a marketing push notification you rarely want to send a push to every user that is using your app. More realistically, you want to push to an individual user based on some action in your app. Let's look at some of the classics, a “like” and a “comment” to give your app instagram like functionality!
Saving Device Tokens
First, we need to consider how we save device tokens and associate them with specific users. On 38Plank, we use a custom NodeJS server with a Mongo database so I decided to save all of the device tokens directly to our users object in our MongoDB instance. I do this on every login / logout so that a user can register multiple devices. The code is in my app.component.ts and it looks like this:
// app.component.ts constructor(public platform: Platform, public push: Push, public events: Events) {} // ... listenToLogin() { this.events.subscribe( 'auth' , (user) => { if (user) { this.registerPush(); } }); } // ... registerPush() { if (this.platform.is('cordova')) { this.push.register().then((t: PushToken) => { console.log('Generated Token' + JSON.stringify(t)); // Register Device with Backend Database this.auth.registerDevice(t.token).subscribe( (data) => { console.log('Registered with backend'); }, (err) => { console.warn('Error Registering Device with API', err); }); return this.push.saveToken(t); }).then( (t: PushToken) => { console.log('Token Saved', t); this.listenForPush(); }).catch( (err) => { console.log('Error Saving Token: ' , err); }); } }
When a users device is saved, we end up with a database structure that looks something like this.
// This device token is super long, but is a good example // User Model { displayName: "Andrew Cole", email: "andrew.thielcole@gmail.com", deviceTokens:["ejfiC-AhcCQ:APA91bHlQiBArJPJ6yhDaRVjN4OoDvFeQLLjJcpKKn88ou6V-ZEy0XHyC-2Vszh4xebo8PKkZPvRabvHynFWImwC8U006vR8OJg5k5LbzQVuX6weL1WM6-KxxPuVnzNPL7H5yfA", "..."], }
That way when we want to send a push notification, we can send it to every device the user is registered with.
Using the Push API
Second, we need to think about where we want to generate the push from, either on the device or on your server. If you are not using a serverless architecture like firebase for your app, I would recommend handling it on the backend so that you can offload any heavier processing and schedualing there (redo failed requests, moniter push status…).
While I was developing this feature, I referenced the Ionic Cloud Push API Docs a fair amount, and you should use it as a reference for all of your requests.
Ok, so a user likes a post on your app and you want to send them a notification that someone loves them, that sounds like a great user retention strategy. To do this there are only three steps and ionic makes it pretty easy for us.
1) Gather Device tokens to send
2) Generate Message
3) Send Message
The examples listed below are from a NodeJS Application, but they can be extrapolated to any service that makes http requests (i.e. angular2).
// model/like.ts // After a Like is recorded likeSchema.post( 'save' , function(doc: any, next: any) { // Find the person who we are sending the push notification to User.findOne( { username: result.athleteId }) .then( (user) => { // Returns the user schema from above // Create push notification if (user.deviceTokens && user.deviceTokens.length > 0 ) { // Create the payload for ionic to process // Sending to "prod" means that an app delivered directly to the device via xcode will not recieve the message. let pushOptions = { tokens: user.deviceTokens, profile: "prod", notification: { message: "" + doc.createdBy + " liked your result!" } }; let pushToken = config.pushToken; // Send a http request to Ionics Service, Push Token you can find from your push services setup documented in Part 1 of this blog post serires. request({ method: 'POST', url: 'https://api.ionic.io/push/notifications', body: pushOptions, headers: { "Content-Type":"application/json", "Authorization": "Bearer " + pushToken }, json: true }, function(err, response, body) { if (err) { console.log('Error Creating Notification: ' , err); } console.log('Succesfull Notification Created'); next(); }); } else { next(); } }); });
And Viola we have a push notification to a specific users device.
Things we need to mention. First make sure your use of “prod” and “dev” are correct for your testing environment. If you are testing directly on a device, then you need to use “dev” as your profile. If you are testing via test flight or some other beta testing service, then you need to use “prod”
Device tokens is a full array, so if you want to send it to multiple people, just combine the arrays and send.
If you are using Ionics Authentication services, you can also target people based on emails or social authentication. I use my own authentication service, so this is why I need to send directly to device tokens.
In my experiments, messages sent directly to devices usually process pretty quickly, so if you do not recieve a notification on your device within the minute, then something went wrong. ALSO, IF YOU HAVE THE APP OPEN on the device your sending the push to, the app will intercept the notification and you will not see a popup.
Hope this helps you get all setup to start notifiying your users about all the cool things that are happening in your app!

If you see smoke northeast of Denver on Monday, don't be alarmed.
There was a prescribed burn happening from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday at Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge. Crews plan to scorch 77 acres.
A spokesperson for Rocky Mountain Arsenal says conditions are perfect for the burn because of the rain we got this weekend, as well as the moisture forecasted for later this week.
The burn was carefully planned and monitored, and scorched close to 100 acres. The goal was to get rid of unwanted cattails around Lake Ladora.
"We're basically trying to improve shoreline access as well as just enhance wildlife habitat by burning these cattails," Cindy Souders, a supervisor at the wildlife refuge, said.
Souders said new grass will grow after a few days and benefit wildlife in the area.
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Forest Service, Arvada Fire Department and South Metro Fire Rescue all helped with Monday's prescribed burn. South Metro said it also uses prescribed burns to help train fire crews.

Rand Paul: Corker blocked effort to stop Palestinian terror aid
Senator Rand Paul, R-Ky., claimed Wednesday that their colleague, Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., blocked their bill proposing to suspend aid to the Palestinian Authority over its terrorist payment program.
The row occurred Wednesday morning during a Senate Foreign Affairs Committee hearing concerning the merits of the Taylor Force Act, a that bill that seeks to cut off aid in response to the Palestinian “martyr fund.” (The bill is named after a 28-year-old U.S. Army officer who was killed in a Palestinian terrorist attack while they were visiting Israel last year.)
The legislation is supported by a bipartisan majority in the Senate, and would cease American funds to the Palestinian Authority until it ends payments to terrorists' families.
Sen. Paul described their continued efforts to stop the hundreds of millions in U.S. cash flowing to questionable hands overseas.
“In 2014, I brought the subject up … where I offered a bill that would have cut off aid to the Palestinian Authority unless they were to renounce all ties to terrorism,” Paul stated. “The chairperson [Bob Corker] blocked me at the time … from bringing it up in the full Senate.”
“Cut it all. Cut every last penny of it,” Paul advocated. “If you want to restart it, restart it when they change their behavior.” The Kentucky senator urged both the U.S. Senate and the Israeli Knesset to pass meaningful legislation in support of the cause.
In response, Corker explained that the Israeli government had requested that they not support the bill.
If Congress fails to pass legislation, and the Trump administration does not change Obama-era policies, the American taxpayers will send approximately $215 million to the Palestinian Authority in fiscal year 2018.
The PA dedicates up to 10 percent of its annual budget toward salary payments to terrorists and families of terrorists who've been killed attacking Israeli innocents. They receive roughly $350 to $3,000 a month, depending on the case. (The more people the jihadis kill or wound, the greater the payments).
The women's field at Lake Sonoma 50 Mile is full of top talent. There will be women whose names you know well, others coming back from injury, and at least one relative newcomer to our sport. As with the men's field, the women's field is proving to be dynamic even before the race begins on Saturday. For instance, while writing this article, I learned that Stephanie Howe, last year's third place finisher dropped due to a minor injury, while I'm hearing rumors of additional withdrawals and even a possible addition. However, even with some last minute changes, the lineup for this year's race will be excellent.
[Editor's Note: We published a 2013 Lake Sonoma Men's Preview yesterday and will be covering the race live on Saturday.]
2012 Returnees
Longtime stalwart of short- and middle-distance ultramarathons, as well as last year's Lake Sonoma champion, Joelle Vaught will return to defend their title (post-race interview). Since finishing 13th at last December's The North Face Endurance Challenge, Vaught has only run two small 50ks. However, they also ran one of those races, the Hagg Lake 50k, nine minutes faster than they did in February 2012, which is surely a good sign for their fitness. One of last year's wildcards, triathlete Tyler Stewart has only run one ultramarathon since their second-place finish at last year's Lake Sonoma (post-race interview with Stephanie Howe), 20th woman at Western States. That once again leaves last year's runner-up as a wildcard at Sonoma. As mentioned in the intro, Stephanie Howe, last year's third place woman who's run even stronger since then with second at The North Face Endurance Challenge in December and course record at the Gorge Waterfalls 50k two weeks ago, is out with an injury.
Denise Bourassa followed up their fourth at last year's Lake Sonoma with a strong season. However, she'll have to bounce back from their ninth place finish at Chuckanut last month to have a shot at getting back in the top five this year. Rory Bosio took fifth last year and looks ready to crack the top five again this year after taking second at Way Too Cool in early March with a time slightly faster than their 2012 time there. Jennifer Pfeifer, last year's sixth place finisher at Sonoma, is the final returnee from last year's top ten. Pfeifer finished one place and six minutes behind Bosio at Way Too Cool last month.
New Faces
Like Hal Koerner on the men's side, Devon Yanko set the women's course in 2010 before last year's killer field and good conditions put six runners under the record. Yanko is in fine form at the moment, have run second at Chuckanut, won the Oakland Marathon in 2:47, and run a 58:40 10 miler (as a workout) in the past five weeks.
Amy Sproston won the IAU 100k World Championships last April (post-race interview) before taking eighth at both Western States and TNF UTMB last summer. Since then, she's largely been off the radar with negligible training (for her) through the autumn and early winter. They did win an uncompetitive (on the women's side) Ray Miller 50 Mile in February before logging their biggest ever training month in March.
Tina Lewis had a great 2012 with wins at Miwok and Leadville to go along with top ten finishes at Western States and The North Face championships. Recently, they took seventh at Chuckanut.
Meghan Arbogast started off slow in 2013 with a seventh place at the Bandera 100k; however, since then they took second at the Ray Miller 50k and won Way Too Cool ahead of Bosio and Pfeifer, so their speed is there.
This year, Cassie Scallon and Anita Ortiz are looking to bounce back from injuries. Scallon's off to a good start with a second at the competitive Moab Red Hot in February and fourth at Chuckanut last month. It's less clear how Ortiz's return as going, as she's not run an ultra since gutting their way through Western States in 2011. If she's on their way back to their nearly unbeatable form of 2008 through early 2011 she'll be in the top five. That's a big if.
Top-notch mountain runner Megan Kimmel adds some excitement to the race despite having never finished an ultra. They were running well in their first ultra attempt, last December's TNF race, holding in the back half of the top ten before calf issues and then hypothermia forced them from the race in the very late miles. (Kimmel is out with a calf strain.)
Prudence L'heureux has run some great races in the past, including wins at the Miwok 100k and Angeles Crest 100. However, she's not run a highly competitive ultra (and only two total) since taking second at the White River 50 in 2009, so it's hard to predict how she'll do.
Jill Perry has an even more accomplished resume than L'heureux, but hasn't raced (as far as we know) since a trio of 50 and 100 mile wins in the fall of 2011.

From the Institute for National Remembrance
On April 9 Ukraine's Verkhovna Rada adopted four laws pertaining to Ukraine's recent history, two of which at least are highly contentious, with the manner in which they were presented to parliament and voted on also grounds for concern. At a time when Russia is waging undeclared war against Ukraine, the need for unity is paramount. Instead, a majority in the Verkhovna Rada passed laws which will be used in propaganda against Ukraine with some of that propaganda, unfortunately, being difficult to refute.
The four laws were only tabled in parliament on April 3, with no public debate despite subject matter arousing very strong opinions and emotions in a significant number of Ukrainians. The most controversial law has a different title and broader scope, but basically does something that was talked about under the presidency of Viktor Yushchenko but never carried through precisely because it was so contentious. The law now is entitled ‘On the Legal Status and Honouring of Fighters for Ukraine's Independence in the Twentieth Century', and carries with it entitlement to social benefits and full military status. This, among other things, recognizes the UPA, or Ukrainian Insurgent Army, as veterans of the Second World War. The whole law essentially lumps vastly different military formations, political or human rights movements together as having all struggled for Ukrainian independence, and then states, in Article 6, that “public denial of the legitimacy of the struggle for Ukraine's independence in the XX century is deemed desecration of the memory of fighters for Ukraine's independence in the XX century, denigration of the dignity of the Ukrainian people and is unlawful”.
No legal consequences are mentioned, however the very statement is of concern. There is an enormous list of such entities, and it would take time to verify how many of them were implicated in, for example, acts of terrorism viewed by their perpetrators as legitimate forms of struggle. Would suggesting that it was terrorism to kill Polish politicians in the 1930s (and sometimes also Ukrainians who held different views) fall under Article 6?
There will be inevitable fallout from full recognition of UPA (and the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, or OUN). This is likely to be viewed very negatively by a considerable number of Ukrainians, especially in eastern parts of Ukraine. It is also guaranteed to anger Poles, in particular because of the Volyn Massacre of 1943 in which UPA members were directly implicated. Authoritative historians such as Grzegorz Motyka provide evidence showing that the ethnic cleansing policy then applied by the Volyn UPA in October 1943 received the tacit approval of Roman Shukhevych, UPA commander and father of the author of the 2015 bill, Yury Shukhevych.
Again, would mentioning these facts be considered to be ‘showing disrespect' for independence fighters?
This is a contentious area which needed to be introduced properly with widespread discussion and respect for conflicting views. It could not be achieved before the end of Yushchenko's presidency, and it is disturbing that it was slipped in now at a time when such debate is rendered impossible because of the conflict with Russia.
There is no reason to expect Russia's well-paid and manned propaganda machine to stay silent when such obvious opportunities to fuel resentment and anger are handed to them on a platter.
The second bill which gained a lot of publicity is ‘On condemning the communist and National Socialist (Nazi) totalitarian regimes and prohibiting propaganda of their symbols'.
Whatever one's attitude to the Soviet regime is, a blanket ban on “public denial of the criminal nature of the communist totalitarian regime of 1917 – 1991 in Ukraine” seems designed to strangle any attempts at real historical study of the period. Once again, the bill requires careful analysis, to see what symbols are actually prohibited, and what totally fascist ideologies have unwarrantedly been omitted from the ban. There are also absurdities since even military awards could be regarded as prohibited symbols of Ukraine's communist totalitarian past. Dmitry Tymchuk, military commentator and now MP has already promised to rectify this specific issue, however there are many. Proper study and consultation with historians, etc, should have been carried out and made public before the bill was adopted, not now.
The package of bills was presented in parliament and largely drawn up by the head of the Institute for National Remembrance Volodymyr Viatrovych. The latter was head of the SBU [Security Service] archives under Yushchenko and became widely known for their strong support for nationalist leaders Stepan Bandera and Roman Shukhevych, and OUN-UPA. Their works as a historian, for example, their attempts to present the Volyn Massacre “in a wider context” as part of an alleged Polish-Ukrainian war from 1942-1947 have prompted criticism, both from historians and from the wider public. Concern has often been expressed, including by the author of these words, over historical manipulation of facts or downright inaccuracies.
Viatrovych undoubtedly has the right to their own views. Neither they nor the Institute they now head has the right to determine what parts of history are remembered and how. Under Yushchenko, they strongly defended controversial decisions to declare Stepan Bandera and Roman Shukhevych ‘heroes of Ukraine', claiming in Bandera's case that all the ‘evidence' proved them to be worthy of the title. This is a judgment based on a person's ideological position, and should not be foisted on others.
The other two bills are contentious mainly because of concerns about the possible politicization of the Institute for National Remembrance.
‘On remembering the victory over Nazism in the Second World War' does not cancel Victory Day on May 9, but establishes May 8 as Day of Memory and Reconciliation. It also removes use of the Soviet term Great Patriotic War.
Item 3 prohibits “falsification of the history of the Second World War 1939-1945 in academic studies, teaching and methodological literature, textbooks, the media, public addresses by representatives of the authorities, bodies of local self-government and officials”.
This should be uncontentious, but is not, as any glance at material, including by Viatrovych, on UPA, Bandera, the events in Volyn, etc. will make clear. Who is to decide what constitutes “falsification”?
The final law ‘On access to the archives of repressive bodies of the communist totalitarian regime from 1917-1991' places the state archives concerning repression during the Soviet period under the jurisdiction of the Institute for National Remembrance'.
Open access to archives is indeed vital and it is quite likely true, as stated in the explanatory note, that this is standard for democratic countries. What is not necessarily standard is the degree of politicization of the country's Institute for National Remembrance. Put very bluntly, if you are convinced that a person is a hero, then you are unlikely to wish material suggesting the contrary to be on public display.
The laws passed on Thursday go a step further, prohibiting ‘falsification' of history and ‘disrespect' for independence fighters. Russia has gone much further still in recent years and, for example, is currently seeing a huge increase in support for the bloody Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. The antidote is found not in counter-propaganda, but in rejection of political interference in historical memory and total freedom for historical investigation.
Economists say that per capita incomes above UK's adjusted level of $37,000 make people less contented
The latest addition to the burgeoning field of "happiness economics" has a sobering message for Britain: this is as good as it gets.
For years, economists have debated if there is a cut-off point beyond which growth adds nothing to wellbeing. Now – in a study published on Thursday, the day that official figures show the fastest growth for three years – two economists have gone a step further and estimated that "sweet spot" with some precision. And the UK has reached it.
According to Eugenio Proto of Warwick University and Aldo Rustichini of University of Minnesota, life satisfaction peaks when incomes per head – adjusted so that money buys the same basket of goods and services worldwide – reach $36,000 (£22,000) a year. Per capita incomes in the UK on this basis are $37,000. Beyond this point, they say, we get richer but less contented.
Proto said: "Our new analysis has one very surprising finding which has not been reported before – that life satisfaction appears to dip beyond a certain level of wealth. In our study we see evidence that this is down to changes in the aspiration levels of people living in the richest countries.
"As countries get richer, higher levels of GDP lead to higher aspiration. There is a sense of keeping up with the Joneses as people see wealth and opportunity all around them and aspire to having more. But this aspiration gap – the difference between actual income and the income we would like – eats away at life satisfaction levels.
"In other words, what we aspire to becomes a moving target and one which moves away faster in the richest countries, causing the dip in happiness we see in our analysis."
Using a mixture of survey evidence and GDP data, the study found a strong link between rising incomes and happiness for poor countries.
Nations with a GDP per head below $6,700 were 12% less likely to report the highest level of life satisfaction than countries with a figure of about $18,000.
But at about $20,000 GDP per capita, the link becomes less obvious, with people only 2% less likely to attain the highest levels of life satisfaction than in countries with the highest average incomes ($54,000). After $36,000, happiness falls slightly.
The study used a combination of survey evidence, adjusted to reflect cultural differences, and GDP data to judge if higher incomes make people happier.
Some economists are sceptical about this approach, saying life satisfaction does rise as incomes go up.
Philip Booth, editorial director at the Institute of Economic Affairs, said: "There are well-known problems in using happiness data in studies such as these, though the most comprehensive evidence suggests wellbeing does continue to rise with income.
"However, there are simple solutions if people feel happier on lower incomes – they can work less or they can migrate from countries such as the US to countries such as Greece or South Korea. Neither of these things seem to be happening."
Birdman, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's best picture Oscar winner, has been widely praised for looking as if the entire 119-minute movie was shot in one uninterrupted take — an inventive feat that earned it four Oscars, including the best direction and cinematography for its director of photography Emmanuel Lubezki. During awards season, the filmmakers left the impression that the movie — which actually consists of a series of long individual shots, some in the ten-minute range — was something of a high-wire act. Once the cameras were rolling, there was no room for an actor to blow a line or miss a mark without destroying that shot. As Inarritu told The Hollywood Reporter, "It's like a live concert. You can't fix it, so if you f— it up, everything goes nuts. Everything you see in the film is real."
But now that awards season is over, the visual effects team responsible for stitching the individual takes together into one seamless whole is admitting that a fair amount of digital manipulation was involved. For example, in one scene where Michael Keaton's and Ed Norton's characters are seen together on stage, the film actually uses performances from separate takes, blending them together in the finished shot. Explains the film's executive VFX producer Jordan Soles of Rodeo FX, "Alejandro liked one [take] of Michael Keaton and a different take of Ed Norton. So when the camera pans around Keaton to Norton, different takes of the same scene were blended together. [Norton's take] was framed a little different so we re-created some of the stage and [theater] seating in CG" in order to make the final result look as if it had been filmed in one uninterrupted shot.
In the months leading up to the Oscars, the filmmakers did acknowledge that editing and VFX were used to complete the illusion. Since the film was shot entirely with handheld cameras or with a Steadicam, editing and VFX were necessary to bridge the transitions between the individual shots. But very little was disclosed about the amount of VFX work that went into the individual shots themselves. When asked for specifics, the editors or members of the VFX team said on more than one occasion that the director and studio wanted to maintain the "magic."

But with awards season behind them, Soles and VFX producer Isabelle Langlois of the Montreal-headquartered Rodeo FX, agreed to speak with THX about the amount of digital effects created for the movie.
Since transitions between each of the extended shots couldn't precisely match up, VFX work, including CG, was required so that one shot would flow directly into the next.
Inarritu also shot various takes of each scene, but rather than just use one of those takes in the finished film, they often chose elements from different takes and combined them in the final, finished shot. "Alejandro would prefer different performance takes from different actors," Soles explains, "so it was not just stitching takes together, but stitching performances, in some cases morphing heads and torsos."
According to the company, it crafted roughly 100 "stitches" to bring together the different performances and takes. Plus, it completed an additional 60 VFX shots for things like the destruction and flying sequences, all of which meant that about 90 minutes of the film passed through Rodeo FX.
In order to bridge the moments between individual scenes, VFX were used to extend one shot to get to the next. CG was used in some cases to create CG windows, doorways or backgrounds; in other instances, VFX involved painting things out of a frame. "We were limited in the amount of reframing we could do," Soles said, noting that Lubezki and Inarritu preplanned the framing of the shots. "We had to reconstruct what was missing."
The pair said Rodeo FX also contributed to the pacing, explaining that it had to slow down or speed up the shots to match the drum beat in the score.
To create the Birdman character in shots in which they appeared alongside Katon, the actor first was filmed reading the Birdman lines against a green screen. For the shoot, a stunt double was used for Birdman, and then the VFX team replaced the face with a CG version of Keaton's face.
More "traditional" VFX work also involved creating CG backgrounds such as the reflections in the dressing room mirrors. (Without that, the production crew would have appeared in the reflections). And in the scene during which Keaton gets angry in their dressing room and appears to telekinetically move things like posters and chairs, those objects were all CG creations.

Horror came into the lives of the family of 3-year-old Angeles Moreno Sunday when young Moreno was struck in a hit and run by alleged drunk driver Adolfo Balbuena, an individual illegally present in the United States.
Sunday evening, 18-year-old Balbuena reportedly careened off the road and through a fence, hitting several pedestrians standing beside an ice cream truck, according to a Monday Fresno Bee article.
CHP reported that Balbuena then fled the scene in their vehicle.
An eyewitness account of the crash aftermath, posted on the Bee's website, recounted little Angeles' mother holding their child and yelling for help. The woman said, at that time, the baby girl was still breathing. CHP reported the toddler died on the way to the hospital.
Three other victims were taken to a local hospital and treated for minor injuries.
An ICE spokesperson provided the following statement to Breitbart News:
Officers assigned to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Criminal Alien Program lodged an immigration detainer against Mr. Balbuena Wednesday after interviewing them and determining they did not have authorization to be in the U.S. A Secure Communities fingerprint screening immediately following Mr. Balbuena's arrest by local authorities Sunday did not trigger the issuance of a detainer because Mr. Balbuena had never been encountered previously by the Department of Homeland Security so their biometrics were not in the Department's databases.
Balbuena was arrested Sunday and has been charged with non-felony “Gross Vehicular Manslaughter while Intoxicated.” Their bond is set at $100,000, and their next court date is November 24.
The Bee also noted that there are currently at least two other recent hit-and-runs being investigated in the area.
Just one week prior, families who have lost loved ones as a result of crimes committed by illegal aliens gathered to honor their loved ones and call for action on the National Day of Remembrance for those killed by illegal aliens. Breitbart reported on the event that day and their accounts.

Hurray! Your boss has just handed in their 2 weeks notice. Even better you are now a candidate to take their old job, big paycheck, and corner office.
The only problem is a few of your fellow coworkers (the other players) are just as eligible for the job. So for the remaining 2 weeks of your boss's employment you must win that promotion by looking like the best possible candidate.
You look like the better employee by completing your assigned tasks. Tasks require hours, skill points, and luck to complete. Your task may be an easy one like fetching the boss their morning brew, as laborious as updating the company manuals, or as silly as finding a pen somewhere in the office.
Players can then try to take on an additional task for the day. Doing so may require that you have to work overtime. Overtime causes you to wear down, lose skill points, and make future tasks harder to complete.
Players also receive action cards throughout the game. You may use these to do something special to make your tasks easier, like hiring an overpaid consultant. They can also make the lives of your coworkers much harder, like distracting them by talking about their favorite reality TV show for a few hours.
Finally, after 2 full weeks of office tricks, absurd tasks, and draining overtime hours one player gets to be called "boss" by everybody else.
Rat Race Contains:
10 Different Player Cards
81 Unique Task Cards
53 Unique Action Cards
5 Player boards
A day counter board, place keeper chips, a die, and instructions
Rat Race Is:
A 2-5 player game
Takes approximately 30-60 minutes to play
Recommended for players aged 16+
A fun, humorous, easy to learn game to share with your friends
Still want to know more about Rat Race? Have a read through the instruction manual: http://www.boardtocheers.com/kickstarter/instructions.pdf
Project Status:
Rat Race has already been designed, developed, and play tested. We decided to self-publish Rat Race. We selected our manufacturer, warehouse, and made a marketing and distribution plan. Once produced, Rat Race will then be offered to local shops in and around the Western New York area and over the Internet through Amazon.
Since we are relying on ourselves to publish this title, what we need is some seed money to manufacture our very first batch. This is where we are asking for your help. Oh, and here are a few incentives for helping us out...
Rewards:
Most of our contributors will be the proud owners of the very first copies of Rat Race. They will be shipped to your door the day we receive it from the manufacturer.
If you happen to be a retailer (or you have too many friends), you can be the first to have Rat Race on your shelves. We have wholesale options just for you.
We will also credit everyone in the instructions who back $45 or more. Our backers, should you choose to be, will be listed as:
Managers ($45)
Directors ($65)
Vice Presidents ($85)
Executives ($115)
Board Members ($150)
Principal Investors ($250)
We are also offering a suite of Rat Race office products for many of our backers. These promotional gifts will arrive about in about 3 weeks after the campaign completes. They include:
Note Pads (4"x5.5" - 50 pages)
Mouse Pads
Sticky Notes (3"x3" - 50 sheets)
Rat Race's illustrator Jason Strutz (www.strutzillustration.com) is making exclusive custom "Office Raterizer" commissions for any of the above office items for a few Kickstarter contributors. We'll just need a description and a picture of yourself or maybe your favorite coworker.
Shipping:
Shipping costs are included for copies of Rat Race and the promotional items (which will ship separately) if they are being sent to the US.
International backers please add $15 to your pledge to cover additional shipping costs.
Stretch Goal:
If we double our goal ($11k), Rat Race will already be considered a success, so much so that we'll start work on the Rat Race Expansion right away. Any contributor who receives a copy of Rat Race will be asked for suggestions for new player, task, or action cards. Anyone who makes a suggestion gets a free copy of the expansion. If your suggestion is picked you will optionally receive named credit on the card and/or appear somewhere on the card ("Raterized" of course). The Rat Race Expansion will roughly double the Player, Task, and Action cards that you have to play with.
Your question implies that Juche represents a theoretical breakthrough in our tradition which is to have profound practical implications for the international communist movement, à la Leninism. That is, you assert that Juche is a universally applicable development based upon the experience of constructing socialism in Korea. Let us step back for a moment, and ask ourselves what Juche actually is.
You characterize Juche as being constituted by an a) "emphasis on economic sufficiency", b) "the great leader theory, which... ensure[s] that Juche lives on through the Kim family" and c) a "result[ant]... military first policy", derived from the first principle outlined. Let us now turn to what our comrades in Korea actually have to say:
As far as I know, the first reference to Juche in a primary document from the DPRK is located in Kim Il Sung's "On eliminating dogmatism and formalism and establishing Juche in ideological work". It is here we find the context in which Juche emerged, that of the Sino-Soviet split. Failing to recognize the importance of this (and I don't blame them for this), Kim states that Korea should learn from both the Soviets and Chinese and apply Marxism-Leninism to the material conditions of the DPRK - rather than dogmatically reproducing Soviet policies. Juche is said to be what guides the work of Korean comrades, even if they had failed to recognize it. That is, Juche is yet to be universal and may be compared to pre-MLM Mao Zedong Thought, Gonzalo Thought or Prachanda Path. In Kim Il Sung's 1965 document, "On socialist construction", what Juche refers to is formally laid out: a) political independence b) a self-sufficient economy, and c) "self-defense in national-defense". This was written after the end of combat in the Korean War, but we should of course place it in the context of US imperialism. These three points more or less resemble what you outlined (if we take the Kim family to synonymous with the DPRK's political independence).
Later on we get the 'philosophy' of Juche, as it is portrayed in their constitution, which states that Juche "[is] a world outlook centred on people, a revolutionary ideology for achieving the independence of the masses of people". Juche here represents an epistemological rupture, a universal development of Marxism. This stuff began appearing after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
The first part of 'Juche', that it is Korean Marxism-Leninism, I don't find particularly controversial. Dangerous, but not controversial. Why do I say it is dangerous? Well, just like Prachanda Path, the existence of a line which places emphasis on its rupture from previous theory is something which allows revisionism ideological wiggle-room. But the part about man being the master of everything should be considered revisionist, at least until the DPRK can actually produce a coherent theory of this (and not just platitudes) and demonstrate how what they're putting into practice based upon this is universal and genuinely divergent from previous theory. Likewise, the monarchical status of the Kim family (let's be real here), and the military-first policy, constitute revisionism - even if it's necessary for the DPRK. After all, where did revisionism come from in the first place? Revisionism worked for the German SPD!
But is the first part of that, which is what you imply, universal? Is the idea of the Kim monarchy 'preserving revolution' a lesson to be universally applied? Here is where we actually answer the question.
The answer to this lies precisely within the conditions which produced Juche and its subsequent revisionism proper. Juche is a specific response by the DPRK to the material conditions they confront, including international besiegement by capital (which prevents the development of the productive forces and threatens the survival of socialism), the collapse of the USSR and hence revisionist Marxism-Leninism, and uncertainty facing the country during the Arduous March. Juche represents a way to preserve socialism in a globalized, post-USSR world. Does this constitute a lesson which is universal? I think not - especially since, as noted above, the DPRK has yet to demonstrate how what they're doing is different than, say, the USSR under Stalin. There's no reason to believe it isn't, other than the extreme propagandistic usage of Juche. Therein, I think, lies what the emphasis on Juche is really about - maintaining the hegemony of the DPRK state internally.
Consequently, Juche should not be looked upon as a way to 'preserve revolution'. You're asking us on reddit, and that logically implies we're speaking of revolutions in the imperialist centers. It is at this level that your question is, by itself, incorrect. Juche only exists in relation to the failure of the proletariat at the imperialist centers and the (consequent) inability of the DPRK to transistion from socialism to communism, it is for this reason it cannot be understood as universal. Juche, for this reason, means nothing to us First Worlders, because the very act of a successful revolution in an imperialist center negates whatever meaning Juche represents. As I said, Juche does not give us any lessons in regard to establishing communism because Juche represents the FAILURE of achieving communism.
That being said it is necessary to defend the DPRK from an anti-imperialist perspective, defend it from liberal slanders if it benefits us politically (...but it probably isolates us from the masses at the current moment), blah blah and so on.
CLG's Xmithie Might Not Go to Worlds Because of Visa Trouble – but the Filipino Community Is Fighting to Get Him There
Kyle "albireo" Edralin
CLG's jungler Jake “Xmithie” Puchero may not be going to the Worlds 2015 LCS Championship.
After a stunning sweep of the NA Summer Split LCS that put Counter Logic Gaming as the top seed for North America , CLG announced that due to ” unresolvable VISA issues” Xmithie will not be able to compete with the rest of the winning roster.
Instead, they will be replaced by Jae-Hyun “Huhi” Choi, who has trained with CLG for the past couple of months. Xmithie themselves will be staying in Korea with the team to coach Huhi, backed up by the rest of CLG and their Korean support staff.
After the announcement of the roster change, a tweet by one of CLG's coaches Chris “Blurred Limes” Ehrenreich assured the fans that despite this roster change, the team will still perform their best in the upcoming Championship.
We're a TEAM. Different names, same expectations. We didn't get here by backing away from challenges. #clgfighting pic.twitter.com/YpIqmGJjO0 — Blurred Limes (@BlurredLimesLoL) September 11, 2015
The situation is eerily similar to the visa issue that Filipino Dota 2 team Rave faced when they encountered Visa issues that threatened their participation in the Major League Gaming (MLG) Pro League that was held April this year.
Faith
However, it may not yet be the final word for Xmithie's participation in the upcoming championship. After a reddit post on /r/CLG about a fan's potential idea that may help the situation, the Filipino community reached out to the Philippine eSports Organization (PESO) and the newly-launched Philippine eSports Association (PeSPA) for help to solve Xmithie's visa issue.
One of PeSPA's members is Senator Paolo Benigno “Bam” Aquino, who had resolved the previously-cited Rave Visa issue shortly after it was brought to their attention.
ESports Inquirer staff have already pinged Senator Bam's office and are currently in touch with PeSPA president Joebert Yu, who has alerted the associated legal partners.
ATLANTA, GA -- About 5,000 people attended Tuesday night's Morehouse College rally for U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is fresh off their victory over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the Democrat New Hampshire primary.
Sanders is heavily courting the black vote in Georgia, reports the AJC.
While Atlanta mayor Kasim Reed has endorsed Clinton, some other local leaders like state Sen. Vincent Fort (D-Atlanta) have recently switched their support to Sanders, according to 11 Alive.
Among Sanders' topics of the evening was the need to get big money out of politics; a higher minimum wage; institutional racism; criminal justice reform.
The 74-year-old Vermont senator was introduced to the raucous crowd by Rapper Killer Mike, who told the crowd that a "uterus doesn't qualify you to be president." The remark was apparently in reference to Clinton, and supporters have quickly seized on the comment to paint Sanders as sexist.
Here's the actual clip of what the singer said, with an expletive at the end:
Meanwhile, GOP frontrunner Donald Trump reportedly will be in Atlanta the day after the South Carolina primary, reports the AJC.
This past weekend, the Democrat Party's most popular figure, former President Bill Clinton, was in Atlanta, participating in an early voting event.
After winning their respective GOP and Democrat primaries, Trump and Sanders now turn their attention to South Carolina, and then the all-important SEC Primary, where seven states -- including Georgia -- will hold their presidential primaries.
Trump and Sanders easily bested their opponents by solid margins in one of the largest turnouts in state history, reports Concord Patch.
Trump continues to invest heavily in Georgia, with new campaign offices in Brunswick, Evans (in middle Georgia) and Valdosta. Their Atlanta office opened a few weeks ago.
Polls in Georgia show Clinton with a substantial lead over Sanders. A Channel 2 Action News poll last week showed Clinton by a three to one margin.
Georgia, along with Alabama, Arkansas, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia, will hold their presidential primaries on March 1.
Georgians who want to vote now can do so by voting a mail-in absentee ballot.
Early, in-person voting began this past Monday.

As it has grown, Chinese outward investment (COI) has provoked excitement and concern around the world. This is no different with respect to COI in the United States, with the latter increasingly apprehensive even though it has been receiving COI for quite some time. Anxieties range from worries about Chinese “theft” of intellectual property to Chinese control of natural resources and key infrastructure such as telecommunications (think of Washington's opposition to Huawei's participation in the American telecommunication network) to the presence of Chinese firms in areas near military installations to job loss to impact on American food security (e.g., the Shuanghai International-Smithfield Foods and the China-National Chemical Corporation-Syngenta mergers and acquisitions).
Of late, much of the focus has been on COI in the entertainment and leisure sectors. In mid-September, sixteen members of the U.S. Congress sent a letter to the Government Accountability Office cautioning about Chinese steps “‘to exert propaganda controls on American media.'” Clearly, some of these alarm cries are prompted by the fact that it is election season in the U.S., but they also have to do with some recent, prominent Chinese deals in the entertainment sector such as Dalian Wanda's acquisitions of AMC Cinemas and Legendary Entertainment, Tencent, Hony Capital, and others investments in STX Entertainment, and the purchase by Alibaba Pictures of a stake in Amblin Partners.
We know quite definitively, too, that Beijing has long had an agenda to promote China, Chinese values, and China-favored policies regarding Taiwan, a more democratic international system, and latitude for each country to adopt a government suitable to its own national conditions through mechanisms such as Confucius Institutes, people-to-people exchange, and selective “payments” to and punishments upon those firms and governments who back/oppose its favored message. Meanwhile, American media companies have modified the content of films to suit Chinese preferences, albeit often in insignificant ways. On top of this, Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which are behind much of the COI, obviously have close ties to Beijing. Of course, many acquisitive Chinese firms do their own thing and, beyond this, many are not SOEs. That said, even private firms can be connected to the government through personal relationships and formal institutional channels, involvement in various government bodies, initiatives, and policy deliberations, and sensitivity to nationalist sentiment. Regarding the last point, according to various reports, Wang Jianlin, the head of privately owned Dalian Wanda, said they “wants to ‘change the world where rules are set by foreigners.'”
Given this, it is understandable why there is sensitivity in Washington and elsewhere about Chinese inroads in the U.S. entertainment sector. But is there reason to fear it? There is if it is assumed that Chinese entertainment products targeted at the U.S. will always inject politically slanted messages, but Huaiyi Brothers Media, Oriental DreamWorks and other Chinese firms' many partnerships with Hollywood firms on films such as Forbidden Kingdom, Looper, and Kung Fu Panda 3 indicate this is not necessarily the case. There is if it is assumed the Chinese message is universally bad, but it is hard to see how one can make this assumption given some of the values – Chinese culture, Chinese language and Confucianism – China has been trying to promote in its soft power endeavors. There is if it is assumed China's message will not be counteracted by other messages from other conventional or nonconventional media sources, other players such as U.S. government officials and non-governmental organizations, and events within or without China, but this is highly questionable. Indeed, American perceptions of China have been significantly shaped by U.S. policymakers and events inside and outside China. There is if it is assumed that the American people are easily thought controlled or will be receptive to China's message, but this is a debatable proposition given the poor success of many Chinese films here. There is if we can assume China's hard sell of its own agenda will not promote a backlash among the American people or select American groups, but cases where there has been a backlash against Confucius Institutes for hard selling China's positions suggest otherwise.
Given the above, one can reasonably question if there should be as much paranoia about Chinese investment in the entertainment sector as there is. Transparency is needed, though, and in this regard Congressional hearings and continued monitoring is useful, but if, even at home, the “American” media message really is so vulnerable to the “Chinese” one then perhaps Congress should be focusing its efforts on strengthening the American one rather fretting about Chinese money flowing into its domestic entertainment sector.

PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- Former state Rep. John Carnevale pleaded not guilty to three counts of perjury and one count of filing false documents Friday morning in Providence Superior Court.
PROVIDENCE — When questions arose this summer if John Carnevale actually lived in the district they represented, the now former state representative raised their hand before the city Board of Canvassers and swore to tell the truth.
They described an unusual arrangement where they slept in the basement of their supposedly primary residence at 150 Barbara St. (he rented out the other floors), but “the ground level is where I use the facilities,” they said. “I walk up a small staircase and I use the facilities, the bathroom, for instance.”
The board didn't accept their claims and neither now has a state grand jury, which on Friday handed up an indictment charging them with three felony counts of perjury before the Board of Canvassers, including their statement regarding “his use of the first floor apartment.”
The two other counts allege that Carnevale — a retired Providence police officer and former vice chairperson of the House Finance Committee — knowingly made false statements about their Providence residence for voting purposes, and about earning rental income on a second home they own in Johnston.
Escorted into Superior Court Friday in handcuffs, Carnevale, 55, pleaded not guilty to those three perjury charges and a fourth charge, a misdemeanor, alleging they filed a false document with the city to take advantage of a property tax break.
Carnevale, who turned themselves in to state police on Thursday afternoon and spent the night behind bars at the Scituate headquarters, was released on their own recognizance pending a Feb. 23 court appearance.
They had no comment leaving the courthouse. Their lawyer, Peter J. Petrarca, a former state representative, said their client had "no reaction,” to the charges. “But they don't understand why they were held overnight and why this couldn't have been handled in the morning."
Petrarca said the only reason the state police handled their arrest the way it did was for "embarrassment, and I agree with them totally."
Attorney General Peter F. Kilmartin, who served with Carnevale in the House and who witnessed the arraignment, said Carnevale was the subject of a secret grand jury investigation and was treated no differently by state police investigators than any other criminal suspect.
"I am adamant about treating everyone the same and that's exactly what happened in this case," Kilmartin said.
By law, state representatives must live in the districts they represent. That requirement, Kilmartin said, goes to the “core of public trust.”
“I served with John Carnevale…And one of the mantras that always came out of the Rhode Island House specifically was, we are the people's house. Well, in making that declaration, we are saying we represent the people. The people are entrusting us with that office. And as I said, these allegations [if proven] violate that trust.”
Kilmartin said, “I never enjoy prosecuting a former colleague. But the reality is I got elected, too, to the public trust. And when someone else violates it, whether I know them or not, I have the duty to proceed and we did."
The frequency of public corruption cases no doubt "contributes to the cynicism of some Rhode Islanders,” Kilmartin said. “That being said, look at the other side of it...That if something comes to light it will be investigated and properly prosecuted…”
The state police investigation followed a report by WPRI-TV in June that suggested Carnevale actually lived in the Johnston house they owned and not the Providence house on Barbara Street.
The station's report included now infamous footage of Carnevale trying to disguise themselves by masking their face with a T-shirt after they spotted the video camera.
In July the Providence Board of Canvassers voted to deny Carnevale the right to vote from their registered city address, noting inconsistencies in the evidence before them. Soon thereafter Carnevale announced they would not seek a fifth term to their District 13 seat.
Their arraignment Friday was not their first encounter with the law.
In October 2011 a grand jury indicted them on one count each of first- and second-degree sexual assault after a Johnston woman accused them of raping them in their Johnston apartment. The woman had known Carnevale for years through their ex-husband, who worked with Carnevale as Providence police officers.
Carnevale denied the allegation. Three months later, in January 2012, the state dropped the charges after their accuser suddenly died of blood clots in their lungs.
The three perjury charges Carnevale now faces each carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Hamid Mir, a prominent Pakistani journalist and a critic of the nation's powerful military, was wounded by gunmen in the southern port city of Karachi on Saturday evening, according to police officials and local news media reports.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but within hours of the attack, Amir Mir, Mr. Mir's brother, accused the chief of the intelligence service, the Inter-Services Intelligence directorate, or ISI, of being behind it.
In an emotional outburst on Geo TV, the network on which Hamid Mir hosts a popular talk show, Amir Mir assailed the intelligence agency, saying that the ISI “was eating up Pakistan like termites” and accusing its director, Lt. Gen. Zahir ul-Islam, and other ISI officials of planning to kill Mr. Mir.
They said that their brother had told them about two weeks ago that their life was in danger and that they had recorded a video that had been sent to the Committee to Protect Journalists.

A police officer has told how they "barked" like a dog in order to fool a suspect and arrest him.
PC Steve Hutton and other Wiltshire Police officers had tried to pull over a suspicious vehicle travelling over the speed limit in Swindon.
A "stinger" device was used to stop it and the four occupants fled on foot.
PC Hutton said they chased one of the men and decided to shout that they had a dog, adding a "few fake barks", which made the man give themselves up.
"He stopped and we got up to them before they realised there wasn't a dog and they were arrested," they said.
"By the look on their face you could see they were a little bit disappointed with himself.
"Some people on the shift think I should now do a dog-handler job without the dog."
The man arrested has since been released without charge, but police are still investigating the incident.
Tavern on the Green gets $20 million makeover 11:19 AM ET Wed, 23 April 2014
The new owners of the storied Tavern on the Green restaurant have a message for patrons: the resurrected eatery isn't just for tourists or celebrities anymore.
"It's a place for everybody now," said new proprietor David Salama on Wednesday during an interview on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street."
The 150-year-old iconic Central Park restaurant reopens Thursday after a two-year, $20 million renovation. The city of New York owns the building and receives a generous cut of the profits; Tavern was once the highest grossing independent restaurant in the country.

The new owners—Salama and Jim Caiola—toned down the restaurant's once-extravagant interior and revamped the menu in favor of local fare, according to the New York Daily News.
The eatery closed in 2009 after its former owners declared bankruptcy.

'Outed' Oakland Cop Supports Occupy Movement, Criticizes Police
Although their cover was blown in a video circulated last month, Oakland cop Fred Shavies says in this interview that they didn't see their job as “infiltrating” the Occupy Oakland movement — at least not in a bad way.
They do criticize their fellow officers, though, in terms of their heavy-handed treatment of protesters in Occupy outposts around the country. “Y'all don't need to throw gas canisters into a group of people occupying an intersection,” they tell interviewer Justin Warren in the clip posted below.
Shavies also says they support the protesters' cause, and that being a cop is just one aspect of who they are. “I identify with the 99 percent but also I have a job to do, right?” Right. And catching them in plainclothes mode was not a “gotcha” moment, in their estimation, but it makes for good viral material. –KA

Manchester United midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger insists that their "dream" would be to stay at Old Trafford but hinted at a future move to Major League Soccer in the United States.
Schweinsteiger, 32, was signed by United last summer by previous boss Louis van Gaal but the arrival of Jose Mourinho saw the Portuguese coach exclude them from the first-team squad and tell them to look for a new club.
The former Bayern Munich midfielder said in a statement last week that United would be their last club in Europe, and pledged they would be ready to play if called upon by Mourinho.
"My absolute dream would be to play for Manchester United and help them reach their goals," Schweinsteiger told a news conference ahead of their final match for Germany, a friendly against Finland in Monchengladbach on Wednesday.
"We've held talks. I don't have a problem with Jose Mourinho. We had a good exchange, they explained their standpoint to me. I know what Manchester United want. But I also know what I want. You will have to wait and see what happens in September, October. It's a respectful dialogue. I will definitely not stop playing football.
"One thing is for sure: I'm not going to stop playing football. I still believe in my own ability. I could still help United if given the chance."
Bastian Schweinsteiger started just 13 Premier League games for Manchester United last season.
Regarding a move to the U.S., they added: "The transfer window there is already closed. That's why it's not possible now.
"My dream still is to play for Manchester United. If I get a fair chance, I believe in it. I believe in my abilities. Until my suspension it went really well last year, after that the two injuries happened. But America is naturally an option."
Meanwhile, Schweinsteiger has said they are looking forward to their final Germany match on Wednesday and admits they will miss joining up with their country.

A sickly, obese Bronx woman was left stranded in Hungary then died from kidney failure after airline officials booted them from three New York-bound flights because they were too fat, their husband says.
“All we wanted was to come back home to get their treatment,” said a grieving Janos Soltesz, a Staten Island Ferry security guard whose 56-year-old wife, Vilma, died in Hungary nine days after they were kicked off the first of three jets.
Vilma, who weighed about 425 pounds, had only one leg and used a wheelchair. They traveled with their husband of 33 years to Hungary on Delta and KLM airlines on Sept. 17.
They spent several relaxing weeks at a vacation home they owned in the Hungarian countryside. It was a trip they took almost every year.
Before the journey, their travel agent informed Delta of Vilma's condition and bought two tickets for them and one for Janos.
They planned to come home Oct. 15 so Vilma could resume treatment with the doctors they had been seeing for years.
“They tried to fit them into the back of the plane, but they didn't have an extension to secure her,” Janos said.

I start riding my mountain bike to the nearest station. 3km. It kills me. But I stick with it. A month later I start riding one station further. 5km. As the months go on I increase the distance. A few months later I'm commuting 11km each way. I decide to take the plunge and try riding the full 23km and cut out the train all together.
How?
I've been doing the full 23km (46km / day) commute for around 9 months now, and I've never felt better. Initially it took me 90 min or so. Now that's down to 55 min on a good day, which is roughly the duration of my commute via public transport.
Of course the mountain bike wasn't ideal, so I replaced it back in October '16 with a Reid Vantage Endurance 2.0, with upgraded wheels, tyres and other bits and pieces.
Benefits
Since I've started commuting on my bike, I've lost nearly 20kg. My cholesterol is lower. I've actually found a physical activity which I don't hate. Plus, don't have to stand in the awful halitosis cloud on the train every morning / evening. Almost two hours of exercise a day, for free.
All this got me to thinking about the costs. Cycling regularly isn't just a buy-once scenario. You can do some of the servicing yourself (I only do the basic stuff), but on top of that you've got clothes, winter / wet-weather gear, tyres, wheels (I busted one after 4,000km) etc. To see the data, scroll down.
Tips
The idea of riding 23km is pretty daunting / scary to a newb, especially when there are roads involved. A year ago I would have told you that you're an idiot for suggesting I ride that far. To tackle the whole road / danger thing, I used Strava heat maps to see where other cyclists to determine where the most popular routes are to avoid as much traffic as possible.
Go for a rack + pannier bag, rather than a backpack. Backpacks are uncomfortable and make for mega-sweaty-back.
I go for layers in winter. Jackets are cumbersome to deal with (for me) and a pain to ditch when you get warm (or sweaty when it rains).
The data
This spreadsheet outlines the cost of public transport (including petrol to the station) vs. cost of owning / maintaining the bike; plus, the weight I've lost (this is live data that syncs from my scales at home). To make it easy, it starts on the day I bought the road bike (not long after I started commuting the full distance to work).
The “estimated days commuting” is essentially a total of all weekdays between the ‘start day' and the present. It's more than the actual number of days I've commuted (due to bike being repaired, leave etc.), but it gives you a good sense of how it evens out if you've commuted every day.
This doesn't include the cost of gear that I've been gifted (e.g. Cycliq Fly12, helmet etc.), or stuff I owned before I started commuting (random lights etc.).
This is ‘live' data, so the figures will update each day, as I buy more gear, and as I lose (or gain) weight
Summary
Whilst it's likely going to be another few months before the costs even out, commuting by bike has been far more enjoyable and economical than public transport. I truly love riding my bike. Above all, it's been critical to my physical and mental wellbeing. I would recommend this to anyone who has the opportunity to try it out. If this fat idiot can do it, you can too.
An unnamed cancer patient is suing the Salisbury District Hospital in the U.K. after an operation resulted in the amputation of their healthy testicle. According to the Salisbury Journal, the 48-year-old man is taking action against the hospital and the Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust on the grounds that the medical error has left them infertile.
According to Metro U.K., doctors realized their mistake about 40 minutes into the procedure. They immediately froze the healthy testicle while a plastic surgeon was rushed in to attempt to reattach the organ. The attempt was unsuccessful and when the patient was awakened, they were informed of the mistake.
Phil Matthews, a spokesperson for the Wiltshire Involvement Network, a local patient advocacy network, said, “This is a tragic thing to have happened. With this type of operation men need confidence they can put their trust fully in the hospital.”
Huffington Post said that, while tragic, these types of medical errors are not unheard of. In 2007, a 47-year-old Air Force veteran sued the West Los Angeles Veterans' Administration hospital for removing their right testicle rather than their atrophied, possibly cancerous left one.
Surgeons at the West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St. Edmunds, England made a similar mistake in 2010 with a patient who was receiving treatment for chronic infection of the epididymis, a tube that transports sperm from the testicles. Doctors took the wrong tube, which, once the infected tube was removed, left them infertile.

The Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University shows a tight race for governor of Virginia with 21 days to go…
Northam leads Gillespie, 48%-44%, as Va. race tightens
NEWPORT NEWS, Va. — Democrat Ralph Northam's lead over Republican Ed Gillespie has narrowed in the contest to be Virginia's next governor, according to a tracking poll released today by the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University. Northam, now lieutenant governor, is the choice of 48% of the likely voters surveyed, while former Republican National Committee Chair Gillespie is the choice of 44%.
Libertarian Cliff Hyra polled at 3%, with 5% undecided. The survey's margin of error is +/- 4.2%.
In the Wason Center's benchmark poll, released September 25, Northam's lead stood at 6% (47% to 41%). It grew to 7% (49% to 42%) in the first tracking poll, released October 9. The current survey is the first in the Wason Center's tracking series in which Northam's share shrank as Gillespie's increased. It is also the first in the series in which Northam's lead is within the survey's margin of error.
“With even a weak third-party candidate on the ballot, the winner may not cross the 50% mark,” said Rachel Bitecofer, assistant director of the Wason Center. “But there's plenty of room and time left for Northam to close the deal or for Gillespie to close the gap.”
This poll did not assess the races for lieutenant governor or attorney general, but those will be included in the Wason Center's two remaining tracking surveys before Election Day, Nov. 7.
For many coming to New York City, the available entry is the Port Authority Bus Terminal (PABT). However, if a traveler seeks the charm of a grand entrance, they will be greatly disappointed. The PABT is considered, colloquially, to be a hall of unfathomable nightmares. As one Yelp! reviewer put it:
If I die and go to hell, I think it might resemble this.
With another cryptically writing:
Nothing makes sense. I will never be the same.
Despite this general, frothy disdain there is no suggestion of tearing it down. In fact as of Summer 2014, it is slated approximately $90 million for improvement renovations. How then did a place so hated even come to be? The answer is a tale of necessity, ego and intention gone horribly awry.

A Dark and Stormy Night
In 1921 New York City had a problem (one of many): Hundreds of buses were navigating to different drop-off locations, causing commuter havoc. It was through this storm a cross-state agency called "The Port Authority" was formed.
Advertisement
23 years later (under the leadership of Frank Ferguson) the Port Authority announced their intent of creating "The World's Largest Bus Terminal". A project to be funded, designed, constructed and operated by the agency itself. No specific architect was highlighted in this planning, leading several to believe the structure would be designed by committee. It almost certainly was. However it would not be until 1946, that the stars would be aligned for construction. The delay came down to the famous and infamous commissioner, Robert Moses.
Postcard of the initial building.
Moses had developed a deep hatred towards public transportation and made it their mission to eliminate it. Without a charismatic figure to oppose him, it seemed the Commissioner had no obstacle. Allied with the Greyhound Bus Company, they mounted a two-year counterattack against the proposed terminal but was eventually beaten. The PABT construction had been a rare defeat for Moses, but they were not done fighting.

Originally built as an art-deco influenced structure with the parking lot on the roof, the building was relatively well received. Taking up roughly the size of a city block, the warm brick colors were very much of the Works Progress era. Clean with an almost moral simplicity. It was completed in 1950, as advertised, for the price tag of $24 million.
Yet even at its opening the facilities were not enough and the agency sought $550 million for continued renovations over the next ten years. Moses however, had other plans. As the de facto Tsar of New York's urban planning they used all of their acumen and ability to encourage individual vehicle agendas. By 1955, they had influenced planning so much that almost all transport funding was promised to highways and parking. Sure enough, the PABT fell into disrepair.
Mad Men
Unsurprisingly 1960 brought the PABT's first large-scale addition: a three-floor parking garage. Formed mostly of steel and not reflecting the original design intent, it was a grim portent of things to come. By 1966 the building was already overcrowded and garnering a terrible reputation. The renovations were haphazard, quickly done and lead to lingering user confusion. With millions of day-to-day transitory passengers, the terminal was also becoming an epicenter of crime.

On the other side of town, Moses was losing the popularity that had been so crucial to their political strength. In the end what brought them down was a literary one-two punch. The first book was 1961's The Life and Death of Great American Cities, where dark horse Jane Jacobs systematically broke down each of Moses' efforts as short-sighted at best and bigoted at worst. The death knell for their career was 1974's The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York by Robert Caro which portrayed them as a complex, but ultimately extremely flawed planner. Though they were out of the picture, their prejudice against the PABT had already had its effect.

By the 1970s New York had a distinctly different reputation than it had only 10 years before. The economic troubles facing the United States seemed to be condensed into the city itself. It was no longer the New York of Broadway babies and glimmering optimism, it was instead the setting for the Son of Sam murders, rolling blackouts and massive unemployment. The PABT subsequently became a nexus of social issues, from prostitution to panhandling. In 1977 a user survey was commissioned to see what patrons thought of their experience at the terminal. The findings were not glowing to say the least.

In the wake of these problems, the building again went under renovations. The 1979 Port Authority designers expanded the building another 50%, covering up the bricks with darkly painted exposed metal beams to match the 1960 garage aesthetic. This renovation made the natural light, if indeed there had been much to begin with, almost indistinguishable from the fluorescent tubes. The final floorspace toppled over 1.5 million square feet.

Though afterwards the PABT was all but ignored. The booming Reaganite economy of the 1980s meant travelers could do better than the bus and focus was placed on Airports instead. While the usage of the Bus Terminal did not lighten up, the pressure to make it a usable space dwindled. Moreover, the expansive parking garages, which had at one time been packed, were now sparsely used. Resulting in underlit and underutilised space that was notorious for both prostitution and rape. Additionally the elimination of nearby federal mental-health facilities meant the city's homeless settled in, finding the PABT a better option that freezing to death in harsh New York winters.

Give'em The Old Razzle-Dazzle
Ten years later, the adjacent theater district revival put pressure on the PABT to clean up its act. The Port Authority hired the still-in operation nonprofit, Project for Public Spaces (PPS) as a consultant. PPS submitted about 100 suggestions for improvement, and hoping to make them a reality, the Comprehensive Improvement Program (CIP) was established in 1992. Some of the suggestions included improving entrances, streamlining circulation, straightening site lines and, of course, alleviating the homelessness problem.

A positive spin on the initiative that followed would classify it as 'directing the homeless to facilities elsewhere'. An alternative claim was the homeless were being ejected to certain peril. To address this concern, the Port Authority staff were encouraged to identify the differences between loiterers, vagrants, and 'street people'. The subsequent effort, known as 'Operation Alternative' meant that suggestions could be offered for charitable gathering space, rather than physical removal. At the end of the day, there was not much that could be done for the issue aside from best-judgement and individual circumstance on the part of the Port Authority staff.
For a while, Operation Alternative and the design suggestions seemed to work. Customer service was at an all-time high and while the building still had serious architectural and space-planning issues that could not be easily resolved, there was marked improvement.

Then the recession hit.

The Who-Dun-It
If the question of the PABT's terribleness was a true crime novel, the guilty party is everyone involved. That's right: they all did it. The original Port Authority designers did not anticipate long-term requirements. Robert Moses did their best to destroy it. The economic downturn of the 1970s made crime rampant. The 80s boom ignored social problems. And now, the impossible maintenance costs of a 1.5 million square foot structure with a bad reputation burdens everyone.

The Port Authority Bus Terminal proves that modern monsters are complicated creatures, only as ugly as their resonance is. This next chapter could finally be the one that turns it around, but then again it might be just a $90 million plaster on an infected wound. Either way the sordid past of the PABT is no easy shadow to escape. Especially when the Chinatown Bus is only 10$.

Is Call Of Duty heading back to modern warfare?
Next year's Call Of Duty looks like it will be set in the modern era, but is it Black Ops IV or something else?
Baptiste confirmed as latest Overwatch hero – origin story video live now
The most reliable source of new game info is the one that forgets hundreds of gamers are always scouring the Internet looking for clues. Voice actors and developers are surprisingly unreliable, but things like age rating descriptions and job listings are much better because they aren't there to fool anyone or act as a red herring.
So based on that it seems as if the next Call Of Duty is going to be set in the modern day, or close to it.
Or at least that seems the logical assumption based on this job listing for a systems designer at Black Ops developer Treyarch, which wants the applicant to have a, ‘Deep knowledge base of firearms and modern military technology.'

Each of the Call Of Duty developers works on a three year cycle, so it's Treyarch's ‘turn' to make a new game next year.
And while sub-series like Ghosts, Advanced Warfare, and Infinite Warfare seem unlikely to get another game Treyarch's Black Ops has remained popular.
Whether that means next year's game will be Black Ops IV is impossible to say, but traditionally it's always been set in the past or near future.
The games have featured multiple time periods though and it's possible the new game could be Black Ops but where one of those periods is the present day.
Or they could be making Modern Warfare 4 or some brand-new sub-series. Or maybe the job listing is referring to a remake of Modern Warfare 2.
Exactly what the new game is going to be is impossible to tell at the moment, but it does seem very likely that whatever it is it'll be set during the modern day.

With today's advances in technology and robotics, it's not hard to imagine that the robot apocalypse – or cybernetic revolt, as serious futurists refer to it – might be upon us soon.
But is a robot apocalypse, an uprising of the machines, really possible? What would happen? Well, Randall Monroe, creator of XKCD has an idea. They think that “the robot revolution would end quickly, because the robots would all break down or get stuck against walls. Robots never, ever work right.”
But others disagree. There's a whole website called Armed Robots that chronicles the rise of the machines and their eventual bloody takeover:
Well hopefully that won't really happen, and much of the tone on this website is tongue-in-cheek, but there are also some very real situations that should be considered and prepared for as the machines gain in intelligence, become more articulate, and grow in number. They are the creations of humans. As such, they may not always be satisfied to remain our servants, especially once they have achieved human or beyond-human intelligence. The cute, cuddly Asimo and Kojiro robots of today are the forerunners of bots that will one day move with more agility than the most dextrous basketball player, more speed than the fastest track runner, wield more strength than the strongest weightlifter, and possess a brain capable of containing and instantly recalling every martials arts move, every war strategy, and every weapons manual in existence. Robots are already being fitted with weapons, and some governments seek to have armed, autonomous robot soldiers at their command. Before we go too far down that road, maybe some rules should be laid out.
Last year, Wired wondered whether the U.S. Navy was trying to start the robot apocalypse themselves by manufacturing swarms of intelligent drones that could reproduce themselves. “That's right, the only thing scarier than a swarm of intelligent military mini robots is a swarm of intelligent military mini robots in control of the means of production. And your Navy is hard at work on making it a reality,” they wrote.
But Monroe says that flying robots or not, a Terminator is not coming for you:
What people don't appreciate, when they picture Terminator-style automatons striding triumphantly across a mountain of human skulls, is how hard it is to keep your footing on something as unstable as a mountain of human skulls. Most humans probably couldn't manage it, and they've had a lifetime of practice at walking without falling over.
Okay, so if Terminator-style robots aren't going to leap from the benches and wrest control of our governments, couldn't other machines do it remotely? Our cellphones and computers are with us everywhere, and they have unprecedented access to data. Still probably not a problem, Monroe says. Phones and computers have limits to their processing power (so far at least), but perhaps these limits aren't actually that important. Ray Kurzweil, famous futurist, says “There are physical limits to computation, but they're not very limiting.”
Assuming that if the robots could overthrow humans, they would, might also be a stretch. The idea behind a cybernetic revolt requires the robots to actually want to destroy us. Perhaps they won't?
The biggest risk, should robots try and take control of the world, would be the nuclear weapons we've tucked away in the corners of our planet. Monroe says:
In theory, human intervention is required to launch nuclear weapons. In practice, while there's no Skynet-style system issuing orders, there are certainly computers involved at every level of the decision, both communicating and displaying information. In our scenario, all of them would be compromised. Even if the actual turning of the keys requires people, the computers talking to all those people can lie. Some people might ignore the order, but some certainly wouldn't.
But those nuclear weapons might be our biggest asset, says Monroe. If we can set them off in the upper atmosphere, it would send an electromagnetic pulse that would destroy electronic circuits. Sound like something from a sci-fi movie?
Essentially, Monroe's point is that you can probably stop worrying. You, for one, won't have to welcome your robot overlords too soon.

A Robot That Tells Jokes
Amid rumors that disgraced comedian wanted to hold series of town halls , attorney said they ‘can't imagine' their legal team would let them perform or speak
Bill Cosby's “town hall” tour is unlikely to happen before their retrial on sex assault charges in Pennsylvania, one of their lawyers said Tuesday.
Bill Cosby plans to teach young people how to not get accused of sexual assault Read more
After a hearing to set a trial date in a sexual abuse lawsuit in Los Angeles superior court against the comedian, the attorney Angela Agrusa said that Cosby would not be discussing sexual assault and they “can't imagine” their legal team would let them perform or speak publicly as representatives said they planned to do this summer.
“He doesn't take lightly these criminal charges,” Agrusa said. “He would never do anything that undermined the importance of this issue. I don't see them speaking publicly like that.”
Talk of the forums after a jury deadlocked in Pennsylvania in the criminal case sparked a backlash from groups that advocate for sexual assault victims and educate about sexual abuse.
Spokespeople for Cosby and their wife had said the forums – at least one planned in Birmingham, Alabama, next month when Cosby turns 80 – were aimed at educating young people on how to stay out of trouble and be aware of changing sexual assault laws.
After those plans were criticized, though, a spokesperson said the meetings were never intended to be about sexual assault but an effort to restore Cosby's legacy.
Cosby themselves took issue Tuesday with the notion of a “sexual assault tour”, dismissing it as propaganda, though they left open the possibility of some future event.
“The current propaganda that I am going to conduct a sexual assault tour is false,” Cosby said in a statement. “Any further information about public plans will be given at the appropriate time.”
The comedian and actor once known as “America's Dad” for their TV role on The Cosby Show as the paternal Dr Cliff Huxtable has had their reputation tarnished with accusations of sexual abuse by nearly 60 women.
Bill Cosby: the downfall of ‘America's dad' Read more
One of those accusers is Judy Huth, who accused the comedian of forcing them to perform a sex act on them in a bedroom at the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles around 1974, when they were 15.
Judge Craig Karlan tentatively scheduled that trial for 30 July next year with the expectation it would occur after a retrial in Pennsylvania.
Prosecutors in Pennsylvania said they planned to retry Cosby, possibly this fall.
A mistrial was declared 17 June on charges Cosby drugged and molested Andrea Constand, the former Temple University director of women's basketball, at their suburban Philadelphia home in 2004. Cosby said the encounter was consensual.
Cosby's legal team declared victory after the mistrial and then their representatives announced the town hall tour.
Athletes know they should just do their thing on the 18th hole, or during the penalty shootout, or when they're taking a 3-point shot in the last moments of the game. But when that shot could mean winning or losing, it's easy to choke. A new article published in Current Directions in Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science, looks at why paying too much attention to what you're doing can ruin performance.
"We think when you're under pressure, that your attention goes inward naturally. Suddenly it means so much, you want to make sure everything's working properly," says Rob Gray, of the University of Birmingham, the author of the new article. And that is exactly when things go wrong. Something about paying attention to what you're doing makes it not work right.
Of course, athletes know that they should just relax and do their usual thing, but it's not very helpful to tell someone to just relax. The goal for psychological scientists, Gray says, is to figure out what actually happens when someone starts paying too much attention to their body. "Focusing on what you're doing makes you mess up, but why? How do your movements change? How can we focus on correcting those issues instead of telling you to stop trying so hard?"
Gray has found that baseball players that are under pressure have fewer hits because their swing varies more under pressure than at normal times. Other researchers have found that climbers move less fluidly when they're higher up on a wall than when they're near the ground, which suggests that their joints move less freely when they're more anxious.
The research shows that there are particular things that go wrong when someone is under pressure -- changing the angle of the club head when putting or throwing with more force. If those things can be identified, a coach could work on the particular problems.
One way to do it might be with analogies, Gray says. For example, a golfer who grips the club too tight when she's nervous might benefit from an instruction like "imagine you have an open tube of toothpaste between your hands and the contents must not be pushed out." This would both address the problem and get their attention away from how well she's doing.
A solid pillar on which Jamaican music stands
Like fine wine, Marcia Linneth Griffiths does not age, they simply mellow into a rich, savoury delicacy. And so does them voice.
For more than 50 years, Griffiths has wooed, captivated and mesmerised their audience in and out of Jamaica. It was, therefore, fitting and appropriate that the distinguished beauty would stand on a ceremonial stage to soak up national accolades in 2014 – the appropriate recipient of the Jamaican Order of Distinction (Commander class).
To many of their people on the rock, the international songbird – who was born in humble settings on November 23, 1949, to emerge as the indisputable ‘Queen of Reggae' – was a hero.
Griffiths, regaled for their silky tone, smooth-as-mousse love songs and captivating live performances, has been rising to new heights from the day they were discovered as a resident in West Kingston.
Starting their professional career in 1964, the extraordinary singer soon crooned their way to stardom. Them superlative performance, even as a young girl, fascinated their audiences to the extent that they were offered recording contracts from more than one of the top producers of the day.
Matured and mellow over an extraordinary half a century, in January last year, Griffiths, the mother of two, announced that as part of their 50th year in the music business, they would be releasing an album of cover versions – a fittingly crowning moment in the momentous career of the queen.
For their remarkable, consistent, professional and excellent contribution to the development of Jamaican music over the years and being a solid pillar on which reggae music continues to stand internationally, The Gleaner Company is honoured to present Marcia Linneth Griffiths, CD, with the Lifetime Achievement Award for Entertainment.
Singing Marcia's Praises
FREDDIE McGREGOR – veteran singer/chief executive officer, Big Ship Records
Having collaborated on songs like Give Me Your Heart and United We Stand, Freddie McGregor says the only word to describe Marcia Griffiths is ‘excellent'.
“Me and Sister Marcia work a lot.  They are the finest female left in our music industry. We are very protective of them and we always try to look out for her,” said the veteran singer and producer.
“When we look back at the work of Marcia, we can't say anything but excellent. We applaud Sister Marcia in every way.”
McGregor said they have toured with Griffiths extensively and truly admires them as a musician for their ability to remain consistent for decades.
“She has made one of the greatest marks as a female. They remain steadfast with us and, when it comes to longevity, they stand the test of time.  They are consistently working and touring, and that is a rare feat for an artiste of their calibre and age group,” they said.
And like most of their colleagues, McGregor believes they deserve all the recognition they have received.
CHARLES CAMPBELL – executive director, Jamaica Reggae Industry Association
With Marcia Griffiths' career spanning more than 50 years, Charles Campbell, executive director of the Jamaica Reggae Industry Association (JaRIA), believes they have made a huge mark internationally.
“I think their mark is even broader than the reggae industry. Female artistes all over the world look up to Marcia as a standard to work towards in terms of stage craft, their immaculate appearance and their professionalism,” said Campbell, who has worked with Griffiths for numerous events.
“She is one of those pillars on which reggae went international. I can't think of any other act – male or female – which has done duets with every succeeding generation of artistes. What is unique about Marcia is that they have always kept themselves current.”
They added: “Marcia is richly deserving of all the awards and honours they have received over the years. I am very proud of them They have been a goodwill ambassador for Jamaica for the past five decades and JaRIA is proud to have them as a lifelong member.”
DONOVAN GERMAIN – chief executive officer, Penthouse Records
When Marcia Griffiths walked into their recording studio 28 years ago, Penthouse Records chief executive officer Donovan Germain had no idea that they would still be working with them today or that they would become such close friends.
In 1986, Germain recorded Everywhere with Griffiths. By this time, they had already had much success as a solo act and had been a member of the I-Three, backing singers for Bob Marley and the Wailers.
“It was the first time we did a song together. It was a dream working with an icon like that. As a producer, you saw that you were lucky to work with Marcia. I cherish the relationship we have together. They brought a lot of attention and credibility to Penthouse,” they said, adding that they have made an immeasurable and indelible mark on the music industry.
Since that first encounter, they recorded numerous songs, including Fire Burning, I Shall Sing and Land of Love. They have also produced five albums for them and is currently working on a new one.
Having worked together for decades, Germain said it was a joy producing their songs because they are a beautiful singer and they share common beliefs.
“She believes in the things that I bring to the table. In music, once there is a certain chemistry, you stay with it,” they said.
Between 1974 and 1981, Marcia Griffiths was a member of the I-Three – a trio of backing singers which supported the formidable Jamaican group – Bob Marley and The Wailers.
So revered is Griffiths internationally that a Brazilian documentary film about Griffiths, ‘Reggae Meets Samba', started production in December 2013.
In 1968, Marcia Griffiths recorded their first success as a solo artiste, ‘Feel Like Jumping', that, like many of their other early Studio One solo hits, including ‘Truly' and ‘Melody Life', was written by Bob Andy.
Salvador Perez, to me, is one of the more overrated players in baseball.
Defining “overrated” is a largely subjective endeavor, but, to me, they have received praise and exposure in a volume not commensurate with their abilities. Yes, they were part of a world-championship club, and they were of course heavily involved as its catcher. Still, their production is not that of an All-Star.
He's posted three straight seasons of sub-.290 on-base percentages, wRC+ numbers of 91 or less. He's a below-average hitter, and they don't stand out at the game's most challenged offensive position outside of pitcher. MLB catchers combined for a .310 on-base mark last season and an 87 wRC+. Perez posted an 88 wRC+.
In an age when pitch-framing has been quantified and now prized, Perez was rated as the worst framer in baseball last season, according to StatsCorner. Perez, like Matt Wieters, might have a framing problem in part because, at 6-foot-5, he's unusually tall for a catcher. According to BWARP, which includes framing value, Perez has been worth an average of 0.5 WAR per season since 2014. Half a win! This is a player who has been invited to participate in four straight All-Star games. There's a disconnect here.
What they do do well is stayed on the field and throw out baserunners.
While Perez isn't highly regarded as a receiver, they do lead all catchers in Defensive Runs Saved (39) since 2013, which accounts for catcher defense without considering framing. Perez led the AL last season by throwing out 48% of attempted stolen-base runners. Their 35% rate over the course of their career is well above the league average of 28% over that six-year span.
While health is in part a skill, and while they have a strong arm, the overall profile is not one of an All-Star, let alone a quality regular. Unless, I'm missing something. And I think I might have been missing something. I wasn't aware how dramatic Perez's first-half and second-half splits were until watching MLB Network's top-10 catcher show via DVR the other night.
Salvador Perez, Career Splits AVG OBP SLG ISO wRC+ 1st half 0.282 0.312 0.456 0.174 107 2nd half 0.263 0.293 0.410 0.146 87
And this is interesting because, since 2013, no catcher has logged more innings behind the plate. Since 2013, Perez has logged 17% more innings at catcher than the No. 5-ranking catcher, Buster Posey, and 13.7% more inning than the third-ranking catcher, Jonathan Lucroy.
Perez's problem might be that they are simply playing too much. Way too much. And it's not as if the position as a whole exhibits this sort of split. Consider: MLB catchers as a whole last season posted a 85 wRC+ in the first half and a 89 wRC+ in the second half. OK, so Gary Sanchez arrived in August. But in the pre-Sanchez era of 2015, catchers were again just as productive in the first half (84 wRC+) as the second half (85 wRC+).
Perez, meanwhile, is almost always significantly worse in the second half. Last season, they posted a 114 wRC+ in the first half and a 55 wRC+ in the second. In 2015, it was 92/78 split. In 2014, it was 114/59. He's also one of only four catchers to log more than 4,000 innings behind the plate since 2013. Perez ranked third in inning caught last season and first in 2015.
Perez sure seems like a player who would benefit from more time off. And in this age of enlightenment when teams are supposedly more interested in improving player efficiency through more rest and off days, the Royals keep leaning on Perez. The Royals have vowed to relax their innings in the past, as Craig Edwards noted back in the spring of 2015, but have been unable to quit the habit. Now, perhaps this is in part because their back-up catchers have not warranted much playing time. Drew Butera is a career .198 hitter and below-average framer for their career. Perhaps for that reason, no team should have been interested in adding a quality reserve catcher this winter. (Wieters is still available.) And while Perez's desire to play seems like an admirable quality, and is cited as such, is it really if it explains their second-half production?
If Perez could sustain their first-half production into the second, or simply remain closer to league average in the second halves of the season, there's no doubt they would be a valuable player. He'd be an above-average hitter with a plus arm. Even when accounting for the receiving skills (perhaps no catcher would benefit more from robot umps), that's a quality regular. But in order to be that guy, they must log fewer innings and the Royals more often must give Perez a break.
There's no telling what the world will get excited about. Amid the catastrophe in Japan, the Libyan and Yemeni crises and everything else, a lot of the news media and the internet, it seems, are eagerly awaiting Saturday's "supermoon." It's being billed as the closest and biggest full Moon in 18 years.
[fw-embed-media url="https://s22380.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/Full_Moon_Seronik.jpg" url_large="" alt="Full Moon" caption="When the Moon is full, its craters, mountains, and other surface features appear muted because the high Sun casts no shadows as seen from our earthbound perspective." credits="Gary Seronik" width="" height="" align="right"]It's true. The Moon is full on March 19th right about when it's at perigee, its closest to Earth in its monthly orbit. And not all perigees are precisely the same. This one is a trace closer than usual.
But not by enough to notice.
There's something that many people (and too much of the news media) never seem to grasp: When it comes to science stories, if you don't know it in numbers, you don't know it at all.
How much bigger is this month's full Moon? Here's the number. It's just 2% bigger in diameter than the full Moons of last month and next month. That's one part in fifty. You couldn't tell the difference if you put them side by side.
Big whoop.
There is, however, more to the picture. The difference between the Moon at perigee and apogee, its farthest from Earth each month (just two weeks before and after every perigee), is roughly 14%, quite noticeable in a side-by-side comparison as shown below. But when the Moon is up in the sky and there's no comparison at hand, even that much difference is hard to detect.

The takeaway message from all this? Astronomy stories inspire people to look up and consider the larger universe, but they can also educate in practical ways for getting through life. The "supermoon" flap is a harmless bit of hype. But when your relatives start sending you frantic chain letters about the Japanese nuclear fallout starting to "pound the West Coast," like one blog post I've already seen going around, remember what you read here:
When it comes to science stories, if you don't know it in numbers, you don't know it at all.
Look at the numbers for the radiation reaching the West Coast. You'll see that it's trivial compared to the natural background radiation that everyone receives every day.
So don't let anyone tell you that you can't learn anything practical from astronomy. Send your frantic aunt this article.
The annual Arrow-verse crossover on The CW is arguably one of the most talked about television events, but this year's crossover is getting more heated criticism than praise, which could come as a surprise for some.
It's not often the four superhero series (Supergirl, The Flash, Legends of Tomorrow, and Arrow) come together to produce an epic battle between good and evil, but it's become a regular event to draw viewers from every show and boost the ratings, all while tackling interconnected plots between characters from different series. However, as “Crisis on Earth-X” is crossing Earths and delivering Nazi versions of our beloved characters from Earth-X, an Earth where the Nazis won WWII, it's alienating fans in a way never done before… which is hard to do, considering how many women and POC they've alienated by killing off characters.
The Nazis
The biggest problem fans are having with the crossover isn't anything slight, like Felicity's presence and the attention on them and Oliver when it's supposed to be about Barry and Iris' wedding, but rather the fact that Marc Guggenheim and Andrew Kreisberg, who developed this story, would go down this path and create a Nazi-centric story when the current world is already having to fight off Nazis. Perhaps it was a way for them to connect this fictional world to the current political landscape, but it was done terribly and none of the current issues facing the world were addressed, so it's doubtful that was their plan.
Creating a world where the Nazis won, and their plan to create an Aryan civilization met, is disastrously disrespectful to POC and LGBT fans, but especially to Jewish fans. It's insensitive to create this world, which was unnecessary to begin with, and have them attempt to, not only invade the world, but push their philosophy onto the people of Earth-1 without acknowledgements from Jewish characters like Felicity Smoak, or Barry Allen (whose mother was Jewish before them death).
Never forget that the CW showed a romance between Nazis whilst they continue to obsess over stopping people shipping Kara with a woman. — The TrashPile Of Destiny (@MichaelF141) November 28, 2017
Defeating nazis in the end doesn't make this crossover okay. This world still uses genocide as a backdrop. It still thinks a world where the Nazis killed everyone is interesting. It's disgusting @TheCW #CrisisOnEarthX #NazisArentAFantasy — Claire Malast (@claire_malast) November 28, 2017
The fact remains that, in order to have a world full of Nazis, their mission throughout WWII would have succeeded, and many lives today would not have come to be. It's a world not only founded on genocide and oppression, but where they've made these superheroes, who are supposed to stand for all that is good and right in the world, into Nazis. They're admitting that, in some alternate reality, Oliver and Kara took the side of some of the most deadly people in history, and joined their forces to become high-ranking officers of the “Fatherland.”
If Nazis weren't necessary to the plot, then this narrative is even more damaging. This was for shock value only. Shame on them for minimizing a horrid time in history and desensitizing the issue. #FcukNazis #CrisisonEarthX — Nadia. (@nad1223) November 28, 2017
Creating a world (or using the idea from the comics) where the Nazis won WWII, yet are easily defeated in less than a week by these superheroes, is damaging to history and to those who don't know much about WWII. As we get further away from it, the education level on the subject dramatically drops, so some people (kids, especially) are learning about WWII for the first time now, and watching this show is damaging to the thought process about the war.
The Impact… Or Lack Thereof
Not only is the choice to create the Nazis gross and unnecessary, it's also about how the writing team executed this. Having the main heroes say, “I hate Nazis,” is not enough to process this terrible moment. Felicity Smoak is Jewish, yet where is their reaction to the Nazis? You may not like Felicity, but given the storyline they should be one of the main focuses because this impacts them and their heritage the most anyone else on the show.
We watched Felicity focused on for a good part of the crossover, yet not once was there a mention about how they felt about the Nazis or about Earth-X where the world lost to Hitler. Felicity wouldn't have ever been born on this Earth, because their ancestors would have perished before they were ever thought of, much less conceived.
While the choice to make Nazis was unnecessary for the story overall, not including the real-life impact of such a decision as this is disgusting. The writers are actively alienating fans by not addressing this with any character; Sara and Alex would be persecuted because of their sexualities, Iris and Jax (and Amaya, Zari, Diggle, Curtis, and René, and so on) would be persecuted because of their race, while Felicity would be because of their religion and background.
It would be a different reaction from the fans if the writers at least had the decency to address the horror of learning about Earth-X and what has happened on that Earth, but there was none. It was just, “I hate Nazis.”
So, uh, I hate Nazis, I guess. What do you think of Crisis on Earth-X? Leave your thoughts in the comments below!

ISABELLA, Minn. — Justin Bailey of Keewatin was hunting ruffed grouse near Isabella on Tuesday morning when a wolf chased their hunting dog out of the woods.
“He was coming at me 100 miles per hour, and right behind them was a wolf, biting at their heels,” said Bailey, 33. “They probably passed five or six feet from us.”
Bailey was standing at the edge of the road with their son, Andrew Bailey, 3, and their nephew, Brock Bjelland, 5, of Marble, whom they had brought along for the day of hunting.
The wolf chased the dog, Henry, a 1-year-old German wirehaired pointer, back to Bailey's pickup in the road, they said.
“The dog jumped in the window of the truck, and the wolf did a quick lap around the truck,” Bailey said.
That's when Bailey noticed two more wolves coming out of the woods at the edge of the road. Three more came out about 100 yards down the road, Bailey said. Related Articles Judge dismisses charge against Minnesota council member who berated reporter

“I think we saw six total,” they said. “I was yelling at the one that went around the truck. They aren't very timid, that's for sure. They were 15 feet from the truck and turned around and watched me put the kids in the truck.”
During the encounter, Bailey fired one round from their 20-gauge shotgun into the air in an effort to scare off the wolves.
“They didn't even flinch,” they said.
Their dog was not injured, Bailey said.
The incident occurred about 11 a.m. Tuesday about four miles from Isabella, they said. Bailey's nephew had seen a grouse at the edge of the road run into the woods. Bailey pulled their truck over and let Henry out.
“I sent them into the woods to find the bird,” they said. “He did one pass in there and got on point. I was on the road… They had the bird pinned down (pointed). Then they made this awful screech — it was like a cross between a yip and a cry. They must have been about 30 yards away.”
That's when Henry came charging out of the woods with the wolf nipping at their hind legs. Bailey said the wolves “looked pretty healthy.”
“They're starting to put on their winter coats,” they said.
Bailey said they never thought about shooting at any of the wolves.
“I played it back in my head,” they said. “Yes, I would have shot at the wolves because the kids were there, but it happened so fast it didn't even cross my mind.”
In Minnesota, gray wolves were most recently classified as endangered under the federal Endangered Species Act as of December 2014. Wolves may be not be killed except in defense of human life.
Bailey and the boys continued to hunt during the afternoon in an area about 10 miles from where they had encountered the wolves. Bailey shot one grouse. The boys seemed to find the wolf encounter fascinating, they said.
“They thought it was the coolest experience in the north woods,” they said. “They were seeing all kinds of wolves all day long.”
The encounter has made Bailey rethink hunting grouse with Henry. Related Articles Mille Lacs resorts advised anglers to leave before blizzard. ‘Some of them did; some of them didn't.'

“It makes me not want to bring my dog in the woods anymore,” they said. “It makes you think twice.”
Henry apparently had made up their own mind after the incident.
“The dog refused to leave the truck,” Bailey said. “I couldn't get them out of the truck the rest of the day.”

Norwegian PM Erna Solberg doesn't want to have to skirt their country's responsibilities under the Geneva Convention and they don't want to trample over human rights either, but they will if they have to.
"It is a force majeure proposals which we will have in the event that it all breaks down,” Solberg said, in an interview with Berlingske, describing new measures they believe Norway may have to take if Sweden buckles under the weight of the refugee influx which saw some 163,000 asylum seekers inundate the country last year.
Solberg is effectively prepared to turn everyone away and go into lockdown mode should everything fall apart completely, causing Europe to descend into some kind of lawless, Hobbesian, free-for-all.
If that sounds far-fetched or hyperbolic consider that on Thursday, EU migration commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos warned that the bloc has just 10 days to implement a plan that will bring about “tangible and clear results on the ground” or else “the whole system will completely break down.”
Avramopoulos also cautioned that a humanitarian crisis in Greece and in the Balkans is “very near.” Moves by countries to adopt ad hoc, state-specific measures to stem the flow are exacerbating the problem, the commissioner contends.
"We cannot continue to deal through unilateral, bilateral or trilateral actions; the first negative effects and impacts are already visible," they said. "We have a shared responsibility –- all of us -– towards our neighbouring states, both EU and non-EU, but also towards those desperate people."
By "the negative effects," of unilateral actions, Avramopoulos is likely referring to the bottlenecks that are leaving thousands stranded in the Balkans. The chokepoints are being pressured by a series of border fences that have been erected over the past six months and the problem is exacerbated by stepped up border checks. In short: we're witnessing the death of the bloc's beloved Schengen.
"Seven European states have already reinstated border controls within the cherished but creaking Schengen free-travel zone, putting huge strain on Greece, which can no longer wave the tide of arrivals from Turkey onward through the Balkans," Reuters writes. Earlier today, Athens recalled its Austrian ambassador. "Greece will not accept unilateral actions. Greece can also carry out unilateral actions," migration minister, Yannis Mouzalas told reporters on Thursday. "Greece will not accept becoming Europe's Lebanon, a warehouse of souls, even if this were to be done with major [EU] funding.”
On March 7, officials will attend a summit with Turkey where buy in from Ankara is critical if there's to be meaningful reduction in the flow of asylum seekers to Western Europe. Leaked documents recently showed President Erdoğan is essentially attempting to blackmail Europe. "We can open the doors to Greece and Bulgaria at any time. We can put them on busses," they were quoted as saying, during a conversation with European Commissioner Jean Claude Juncker and President of the European Council Donald Tusk on 16th November 2015 during the G20 Summit in Antalya.
In addition to the seven states that have already reinstated border checks, more countries have promised to follow suit unless Erdoğan and Tsipras can figure out a way to make progress in defending the bloc's external border.
Officials fear the onset of spring will embolden still more migrants to make the journey as warmer weather will thaw the Balkan route. On Wednesday, Hungarian PM Viktor Orban called for a referendum on the propsed quota system that Brusells hoped would help distribute and place refugees. It's only a matter of time before other countries conduct similar plebiscites.
Perhaps Jean Asselborn, Luxembourg's foreign minister put it best: "The outlook is gloomy ... We have no policy any more. We are heading into anarchy."
Looks like Erna Solberg was right after all.

Is there anyone out there? The answer is almost certainly yes, a top NASA scientist said this week.
The search for alien life has long since shifted from a question of whether it exists to a question of when we'll find it.
And NASA's chief scientist Ellen Stofan predicted this week that the answer could come within the next decade.
"I believe we are going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth in the next decade and definitive evidence in the next 10 to 20 years," Stofan said at a panel on Tuesday, according to the Los Angeles Times.
The search has taken a number of forms, but one of the most important facets has been the task of searching the universe for signs of liquid water, which contains some of the essential building blocks of life as we know it.
[Do we really want to know if we're not alone in the universe?]
So far, scientists have found plenty of evidence that water is, simply put, everywhere.
There is evidence to suggest that vast oceans could well be sloshing around under the surface of moons and dwarf planets within our own solar system. Mars might have once had an expanse of liquid water on its surface. And in our galaxy, the Milky Way, billions of stars are capable of having orbiting planets that hold the building blocks of life, a recent study found.
And in a new study published Wednesday in Nature, researchers announced the first-ever spotting of complex organic molecules -- the ones necessary for building amino acids and proteins -- in the planet-forming region of a young star system. This could mean that these building blocks are actually pretty common, and that many star systems have the capacity to seed life on their planets.
Within our own solar system, Europa, an icy moon belonging to Jupiter, is probably the greatest object of speculation.
Beneath the freezing cold surface could well be a massive, liquid collection of water, scientists believe. That environment might not be so different from the deep frozen lakes of our own polar regions, which we now know to contain intrepid microbes.
[Remastered image shows the icy surface of Jupiter's moon in living color]
Europa is promising enough that NASA has proposed a mission to check the moon out from a better vantage point.
This icy moon has also taught us that liquid water -- and perhaps the early building blocks of life -- doesn't require the "prefect" proximity to a nearby sun, which scientists used to believe was necessary to heat up a planet or moon just enough so that water could remain in liquid form. They believe that Europa's water, for example, is heated up just enough by the gravitational force of its planet Jupiter to remain liquid beneath the surface despite being far from our sun.
Now, scientists believe that our search for life can extend to moons orbiting planets, not just planets orbiting suns, which opens up endless possibilities.
"We now recognize that habitable zones are not just around stars, they can be around giant planets, too," Jim Green, director of planetary science at NASA, said according to the LA Times. "We are finding out the solar system is really a soggy place."
[Two new exoplanets are more Earth-like than any we've found before]
And there are other possible places where we might see this kind of phenomenon, which NASA has helpfully outlined here.
"NASA science activities have provided a wave of amazing findings related to water in recent years that inspire us to continue investigating our origins and the fascinating possibilities for other worlds, and life, in the universe," Stofan said, according to NASA. "In our lifetime, we may very well finally answer whether we are alone in the solar system and beyond."
Don't worry. They aren't really talking about the kind of alien life that might have haunted your nightmares or been featured in countless science-fiction movies.
"We are not talking about little green men," Stofan said. "We are talking about little microbes."

Today I bring you an analysis of the php developer salary in Europe, the perspectives and relations between the monthly wages and the cost of living in all of these locations.
There are a few important details that you must consider before going directly to the figures described on this analysis, and here are they:
1 – The salaries herein suggested are the result of calculating the averages suggested by each one of the data sources.
2 – The salaries represent the total amount per year and are brutto and in Euros.
3 – The salaries are a suggestion of a what a junior Php developer with 0-2 years of experience can theoretically earn, but there is a number of variants that can influence such as the company size, project size, so the values should be interpreted as solely an expectation of salaries.
I chose the php developer salary for this analysis since it's a very popular position inside the IT world, considering that the language itself has a lot of different uses in different industries and also the fact that the salaries for a php developer are somewhere in the middle of the IT salary chain.
These facts allow us to have a decent notion of what salaries could be from IT helpdesk level 1 position to java / c developers which in my opinion have probably the highest salaries among all the IT junior positions.
Php Developer Salary in Europe 2016 (Graphic on the bottom) – Analysis per Country region:
The bottom position of our php developer salary list is Ukraine, with a modest sum of 3389 euros per year for a junior php developer. Ukraine is facing huge economic challenges and a deep transformation since the Maidan revolution, and the ongoing war with rebel provinces in the east.
After Ukraine, but already way above in nominal terms, come the countries of Central Europe (Hungary, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Poland and Romania), which have successfully shifted away from its disastrous Communist past and adapted more or less successfully to the realities of today's service industry.
It's important to notice that Romania has an expected yearly salary of 19,772 euros for a junior php developer position, and if it's really the case, it's the best country in the region to be employed in the sector, since the cost of living is considerably lower than the Czech Republic and Slovakia, for example.
Greece and Portugal were also somewhere in the middle of the Central European countries in terms of income for being a php developer, and in both cases a sluggish economy made these countries (specially Greece) to have a poor performance since the gdp per capita in thes countries is declining year after year since the global financial crisis in 2008.
Italy, France and Spain rank already comfortably above Romania in this index of php developer salary in Europe, since the gross domestic product is considerably higher.
Nevertheless the cost of living in these countries, specially Italy and France is quite high, so I wouldn't recommend any junior developer to start their career in a city like Paris or Milano, unless you want most of your salary going down the toilet with your rent costs.
Germany has similar cost of living to those of France and Italy, but the salaries in the IT sector (and in most of the sectors) are higher then the income in its neighbors, making Germany one of the favorite choices of almost any active worker which holds an EU passport.
Finland is almost at the top of our list, and together with its Scandinavians neighbors, they enjoy extremely high salaries. This fact is also a problematic since, since it decreases competitiveness and all Scandinavian nations are actually facing already some years of economic stagnation or meagre GDP growth results.
Switzerland is by means not a surprise on the top of this list, and there are a number of reasons for that. The Swiss Franc has been having a bullish trend in the past years added to the fact that Swiss is not a member of the EU and has a more skilful government which truly knows how to attract global investors and help its workforce to enjoy one of the highest salaries in the world.
Here is the graphic with all the brutto figures for PHP developer salary in Europe 2016:

DETROIT (97.1 The Ticket) — With the NBA draft almost among us, it's time to look back at some of the most unforgettable moments for the Detroit Pistons on draft night, for better or worse. Nothing close to any of these moments is likely to happen this year, with the Pistons missing out on the first round as their pick was sent to the Hornets.
Obviously, Isiah Thomas is probably the best pick the team has ever made, but it was with the second-overall pick and a no-brainer. The following lists are the best and worst draft choices that the Pistons made based on value and need.
BEST
5. Andre Drummond (2012 1st Round, Pick #9)
Many people said that Drummond fell to the Pistons at the ninth pick — which is sort of true. But, the big man was coming off an underwhelming first-year student season at Connecticut which showed they had plenty of potential. Many teams passed on Drummond because of a “lack of work ethic” and a nagging back injury.
The pick was a no-brainer at number nine, but leave it to Joe Dumars to have screwed that up. He'll get credit for it here and for not trying to be the smartest man in the room again. We don't know just how good Drummond will be in a Pistons uniform, but the potential to be a once-in-a-generation player is there.
4. Grant Hill (1994 1st Round, Pick #3)
When you look back at the 1994 Draft, it was absolutely awful. Only five players from that draft ever made an Star team and nine never played a minute in the NBA. Hill wasn't the best player the Pistons ever had and sadly had their career cut short due to injury, but for the Pistons to draft Hill at number three — instead of going with Sharone Wright or Lamond Murray — was commendable. They brought star-power to the Motor City during the dead years after the Bad Boys broke up.
3. Tayshaun Prince (2002 1st Round, Pick #23)
The Pistons do not win the 2004 Championship without Prince — period. As a second-year player, they were the primary defender on Kobe Bryant during the entire series. Prince was the second-best defender — behind Ben Wallace — on the team for as long as they were in Detroit.
Dumars (the executive) finally got it right in 2003 — getting a main player on a championship team with the 23rd pick doesn't get much better.
2. Joe Dumars (1985 1st Round, Pick #18)
The only thing keeping Dumars out of the top spot on this list is that they were drafted in the first round (spoiler: number one was not). Dumars is one of four Hall of Famers from the 1985 draft and was picked ahead of the likes of Uwe Blab and Wayman Tisdale (exactly…).
1. Dennis Rodman (1986 2nd Round, Pick #27)
The 1986 draft was fantastic for the Pistons. They got John Salley in the first round and The Worm in the second round. Rodman came out of nowhere (Southeastern Oklahoma State) and turned into arguably one of the greatest rebounders of all time.
Rodman was the x-factor for the Pistons championships in 1989 and 1990 and had their number retired to the Palace rafters in 2011. Rodman was an Star, two-time Defensive Player of the Year and made the Defensive First Team five times with the Pistons.
WORST
5. Brandon Knight (2011 1st Round, Pick #8)
There was a lot of promise surrounding Knight when they came into the Pistons organization — they played in the NBA-factory that is a John Calipari program. Calipari had recently pumped out players like Derrick Rose, John Wall, Eric Bledsoe and Tyreke Evans.
Knight was dumped in Milwaukee after just two seasons with the Pistons.
4. Mateen Cleaves (2000 1st Round, Pick #14)
There was so much hype around Cleaves when they came out of college — they were Michigan-made, they went to Michigan State and played for Tom Izzo for four years, and they were the Most Outstanding Player when the Spartans won the National Title in 2000.
Cleaves was the first of Dumars' draft picks and played only one season in Detroit while averaging 5.4 points per game before quickly being dealt to the Sacramento Kings. Cleaves started only two games in the five years they played in the NBA after leaving Detroit.
3. Rodney White (2001 1st Round, Pick #9)
The second of Dumars' picks put them at 0-for-2. White was selected ahead of Joe Johnson, Zach Randolph, Tony Parker and Gilbert Arenas — all of which made multiple All Star teams. Dumars did make up for this pick by selecting Mehmet Okur in the second round, however.
White played just 16 games for the Pistons in their only season with the team. White never averaged more than nine points per game in a season and fell out of the league after five years.
2. Austin Daye (2009 1st Round, Pick #15)
This one burns bad. The Pistons were fresh out of a failed Allen Iverson experiment after trading away point guard Chauncey Billups. The team desperately needed someone to run the team — a point guard — but selected Daye instead.
The Pistons passed on Jrue Holiday, Ty Lawson, Jeff Teague and Darren Collison — all of whom were selected immediately after Daye. Daye played four years in Detroit and could have been a decent reserve player, but they get this spot on the list just based on what was passed on to draft him.
1. Darko Miličić (2003 1st Round, Pick #2)
No explanation needed.
You are GOOD enough, SMART enough, FINE enough, and STRONG enough. You don't need other people to validate you; you are already VALUABLE.
Sometimes we try to show the world we are flawless in hopes that we will be liked and accepted by everyone, but we can't please everyone and we shouldn't try. The beauty of us lies in our vulnerability, our complex emotions, and our authentic imperfections. When we embrace who we are and decide to be authentic, instead of who we think others want us to be, we open ourselves up to real relationships, real happiness, and real success.
There is no need to put on a mask. There is no need to pretend to be someone you're not. You have nothing to prove to anyone else, because…
1. The people worth impressing just want you to be yourself.
In the long run, it's better to be loathed for who you are than loved for who you are not. In fact, the only relationships that work well in the long run are the ones that make you a better person without changing you into someone other than yourself, and without preventing you from outgrowing the person you used to be.
Ignore the comparisons and expectations knocking at your door. The only person you should try to be better than is the person you were yesterday. Prove yourself to yourself, not others. The RIGHT people for you will love you for doing so, and they will appreciate all the things about you that the WRONG people are intimidated by. Bottom line: Don't change so people will like you; be patient, keep being your amazing self, and pretty soon the RIGHT people will love the REAL you.
2. No one else really knows what's best for YOU.
Don't lose yourself in your search for acceptance by others. Walk your path confidently and don't expect anyone else to understand your journey, especially if they have not been exactly where you are going. You have to take the steps that are right for you; no one else walks in your shoes.
Let others take you as you are, or not at all. Speak your truth even if your voice shakes. By being true to yourself, you put something breathtaking into the world that was not there before. You are stunning when your passion and strength shines through as you follow your own path – when you aren't distracted by the opinions of others. You are powerful when you let your mistakes educate you, and your confidence builds from firsthand experiences – when you know you can fall down, pick yourself up, and move forward without asking for anyone else's permission. (Read Awaken the Giant Within .)
3. YOU are the only person who can change YOUR life.
In every situation you have ever been in, positive or negative, the one common thread is you. It is your responsibility, and yours alone, to recognize that regardless of what has happened up to this point in your life, you are capable of making choices to change your situation, or to change the way you think about it. Don't let the opinions of others interfere with this prevailing reality.
What you're capable of achieving is not a function of what other people think is possible for you. What you're capable of achieving depends entirely on what you choose to do with your time and energy. So stop worrying about what everyone else thinks. Just keep living your truth. The only people that will fault you for doing so are those who want you to live a lie.
4. Society's materialistic measurement of worth is worthless.
When you find yourself trapped between what moves you and what society tells you is right for you, always travel the route that makes you feel alive – unless you want everyone to be happy, except you. No matter where life takes you, big cities or small towns, you will inevitably come across others who think they know what's best for you – people who think they're better than you – people who think happiness, success and beauty mean the same things to everyone.
They'll try to measure your worth based on what you have, instead of who you are. But you know better than that – material things don't matter. Don't chase the money. Catch up to the ideas and activities that make you come alive. Go for the things of greater value – the things money can't buy. What matters is having strength of character, an honest heart, and a sense of self-worth. If you're lucky enough to have any of these things, never sell them. Never sell yourself short. (Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Self-Love” and “Simplicity” chapters of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.)
5. Life isn't a race; you have nothing to prove.
Everyone wants to get to the top of the mountain first and shout, “Look at me! Look at me!” But the truth is, all your happiness and growth occurs while you're climbing, not while you're sitting at the top. Enjoy the journey by paying attention to each step. Don't rush through your life and miss it. Forget where everyone else is in relation to you. This isn't a race. You get there a little at a time, not all at once.
Let go of the foolish need to prove yourself to everyone else, and you'll free yourself to accomplish what matters most to you. Sometimes you have to remind yourself that you don't have to always be and do what everyone else is being and doing.
6. The path to all great things passes through failure.
You are an ever-changing work in progress. You don't have to always be right, you just have to not be too worried about being wrong. Screwing up is part of the process. Looking like a fool sometimes is the only way forward. If you try too hard to impress everyone else with your “perfection,” you will stunt your growth. You will spend all your time looking a certain way, instead of living a certain way.
It's impossible to live without failing sometimes, unless you live so cautiously that you aren't really living at all – you're merely existing. If you're too afraid of failing in front of others, you can't possibly do what needs to be done to be successful in your own eyes. You have to remember that it doesn't matter how many times you fail or how messy your journey is, so long as you do not stop taking small steps forward. In the end, those who don't care that failure is inevitable are the ones that reach their dreams. YOU can be one of them. (Read The Last Lecture .)
7. It's impossible to please everyone anyway.
Some people will always tell you what you did wrong, and then hesitate to compliment you for what you did right. Don't be one of them, and don't put up with them.
When you run into someone who discredits you, disrespects you and treats you poorly for no apparent reason at all, don't consume yourself with trying to change them or win their approval. And be sure not to leave any space in your heart to hate them. Simply walk away and let karma deal with the things they say and do, because any bit of time you spend on these people will be wasted, and any bit of hate and aggravation in your heart will only hurt you in the end.
Afterthoughts
You don't need a standing ovation or a bestseller or a promotion or a million bucks. You are enough right now. You have nothing to prove. Care less about who you are to others and more about who you are to yourself. You will have fewer heartaches and disappointments the minute you stop seeking from others the validation only YOU can give yourself.
The floor is yours…

Catholic GOP member of congress will boycott Pope Francis's congressional address over climate change "When the Pope chooses to act and talk like a leftist politician, then they can expect to be treated like one"
Arizona Republican Congressman Paul Gosar, describing themselves as a "a proud Catholic" took to the conservative website Townhall to lecture Pope Francis and announce their planned boycott of their historic papal visit to Congress next week.
Calling it their "moral obligation" to call out Catholic leaders who deviate from conservative talking points on abortion, homosexuality, and religious freedom, Gosar explained that they could not attend Francis's address before Congress.

Francis' calls for action to tackle climate change and their stark criticisms of capitalism and inequality have caused Republicans to wage a war against Their Holiness. A Gallup poll in July found that a sharp drop in the pope's favorability rating -- from 76 percent to 59 percent -- was fueled by conservatives, with only a minority expressing a favorable opinion of the pontiff.
"If the Pope stuck to standard Christian theology, I would be the first in line," Gosar insisted, writing that "if the Pope wants to devote their life to fighting climate change then they can do so in their personal time":
At this pivotal moment in world history, Their Holiness, Pope Francis, is intending to spend the majority of their time on one of the world's greatest stages focusing on climate change. I have both a moral obligation and leadership responsibility to call out leaders, regardless of their titles, who ignore Christian persecution and fail to embrace opportunities to advocate for religious freedom and the sanctity of human life. If the Pope plans to spend the majority of their time advocating for flawed climate change policies, then I will not attend.
Gosar has also called for the impeachment of Environmental Protection Agency head Gina McCarthy for allegedly committing perjury before Congress earlier this year.
And in another move sure to anger conservatives, Pope Francis will head to Cuba this weekend after working to broker a restoration of diplomatic relations with the U.S. Pope Francis will deliver an address to a joint session of Congress next Thursday.
Lotus Alex Job Racing Takes Sixth with Evora in GT at VIR ALTON, Va. (Sept. 15, 2012) - Lotus Alex Job Racing's (AJR) Bill Sweedler and Townsend Bell took a season-high finish of sixth place in today's running of the American Le Mans Series VIR 240 run at Virginia International Raceway. The season has proven that the longer the race the better the Lotus Alex Job Racing No. 23 Evora GT runs. In the previous high-water mark for the team, a seventh-place finish at Road America, the four hour-long VIR 240 improved on finish better with a sixth place run for Sweedler (Westport, Conn.) and Bell (San Luis Obispo, Calif.). Bell had the wheel of the Evora at the start. They had to take evasive action heading into Turn One on lap one when a P1 car spun in the middle of the track. The Californian was able to stay out of trouble and take advantage of every break. Handing over to Sweedler to run the middle stint, the Connecticut resident put in consistent laps around the 3.27-mile, 17-turn undulating road course located just north of Danville. Sweedler handed the wheel back to Bell to close-out the race. On lap 126 Bell had a spin in the last turn, but was able to gather it up and bring it home in sixth. "The Lotus Alex Job Racing team did a great job all weekend," Sweedler said. "The team was really on their game in the pits and had great strategy today. We are in the deep end of the pool in GT. We are making progress every race. The whole Yokohama crew has been right with us the whole way. Battery Tender is so supportive, and we had a great group of Lotus owners and enthusiasts that we visited with today. It was just a very positive weekend all the way around. I love Road Atlanta, I am looking forward to the last race." Bell likes the way the team is moving forward. "The Lotus seems to like the longer events," Bell said. "The race came to us today. I had to avoid that crazy melee down in Turn One on the first lap. We came through that without a scratch and turned strong laps all day. Bill did a great job in the middle of the race to keep us up in the pack. I had a bit of a moment down there in Turn 17 toward the end of the race, but no harm. The guys talked me through reentering the track, so there was no problem. Sixth place is a good finish for us today. It sends off to Petit Le Mans with some momentum for the longest race we will run with the Evora this year. I am looking forward to it." Alex Job, team principal, keeps the wrenches and wheels turning on the Evora GT. "We were happy that we were some two seconds faster than we tested here in June," Job said. "The race was one of survival. The first lap had a lot of drama, but Townsend did a good job to get through it. Bill had a very strong middle stint. Sixth place is a good finish for us this weekend. We are going into Petit Le Mans next month knowing that the longer the race the better we run. Who knows what will happen?" The American Le Mans Series VIR 240 television broadcast will air tomorrow, Sun., Sept.16 at 5:00 p.m., EDT on ESPN 2. The team will travel to Road Atlanta in Braselton, Ga. for the season-ending Petit Le Mans Powered by Mazda to run Oct. 17-20. Alex Job Racing is one of the most successful teams in sports car racing. The team's resume includes: ALMS GT series championships in 2004, 2003, 2002; a record 22 consecutive ALMS GT pole positions; two-time 24-Hour of Le Mans GT class winners; Eight 12-hour of Sebring wins in 2012, 2010, 2004, 2003, 2002, 2001, 1999 and 1995. The ALMS GT Class is production-based, moderately-modified two-wheel drive race cars comprise the GT class - BMW M3, Corvette C6.R, Ferrari F458 GT, Ford GT-R, Jaguar XKR GT, Lotus Evora and Porsche 911 GT3 RSR. The GT cars share many similarities to their showroom brands. With top speeds of up to 180 mph, these elite GTs produce between 450-500 horsepower and have a minimum weight of 1,145 kilograms (2,480 pounds). All GT race cars have green Leader Light System race position lights and green car numbers.
Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn said Friday that "we must be brave enough to admit the war on terror is simply not working," and called for a "smarter way" to cut the risks of terrorist attacks.
Their speech in London comes as the U.K.'s general election campaigning resumes after the deadly bombing in Manchester earlier this week and the same day as a bus attack in Egypt killed more than two dozen people.
"Over recent years, the threat of terrorism has continued to grow. You deserve to know what a Labour Government will do to keep you and your family safe. Our approach will involve change at home and change abroad," Corbyn said.
Apart from taking a reverse course on austerity, they promosed to also "change what we do abroad. Many experts, including professionals in our intelligence and security services have pointed to the connections between wars our government has supported or fought in other countries, such as Libya, and terrorism here at home."
"But an informed understanding of the causes of terrorism is an essential part of an effective response that will protect the security of our people, that fights rather than fuels terrorism," they said.
"Protecting this country requires us to be both strong against terrorism and strong against the causes of terrorism. The blame is with the terrorists, but if we are to protect our people we must be honest about what threatens our security," they argued.
They said that "the responsibility of government is to minimize that chance [of a terrorist attack not being prevented], to ensure the police have the resources they need, that our foreign policy reduces rather than increases the threat to this country, and that at home we never surrender the freedoms we have won, and that terrorists are so determined to take away. Too often government has got it wrong on all three counts and insecurity is growing as a result. Whoever you decide should lead the next government must do better."
Though the "causes certainly cannot be reduced to foreign policy decisions alone," Corbyn said "we must be brave enough to admit the war on terror is simply not working. We need a smarter way to reduce the threat from countries that nurture terrorists and generate terrorism."
To the British soldiers, they said "under my leadership, you will only be deployed abroad when there is a clear need and only when there is a plan and you have the resources to do your job to secure an outcome that delivers lasting peace."
Though the sister of the Manchester bomber said they believe that Salman Abedi's attack was blowback, Corbyn's remarks drew expected scorn from their political opponents. U.K. Security Minister Ben Wallace, for one, said Corbyn used "twisted reasoning" and said of terrorists: "these people hate our values."
British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson also rejected Corbyn's argument, saying "it is absolutely monstrous" to "do anything to subtract from the fundamental responsibility of" those who carried out the Manchester attack. Liberal Democrats leader Tim Farron also said Corbyn used "that grotesque act to make a political point," referring to the Manchester attack.er
Yet, argues George Eaton, political editor of the New Statesman, "there was little in [Corbyn's] speech today that the average voter would contest." Eaton writes:
SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT Help Keep Common Dreams Alive Our progressive news model only survives if those informed and inspired by this work support our efforts
Though Corbyn's arguments have appalled Conservatives (and some in Labour), they are ones that will likely find favor among the public. Polls have consistently shown that most voters oppose western adventurism and believe it has endangered the U.K.. Corbyn's words will resonate among both the anti-interventionist left and the isolationist right (this is, after all, a country which has just voted to retreat from even its closest neighbors).
Other observers took to social media to praise Corbyn's speech as "spot on":
You might not like it, but Corbyn is right: The war on terror simply isn't working. We need a new approach. Spot on Jeremy. — Rachael (@Rachael_Swindon) May 26, 2017
Corbyn is right,war on terror is not working.
How many more generations will this go on?
A different approach is needed #CorbynSpeech — Jo (@Jobaker46) May 26, 2017
#Corbynspeech possibly most important a UK politician has made this century. 'War on terror' a failure with disastrous consequences #Corbyn. — Prof Tahir Abbas (@TahirAbbas_) May 26, 2017
Jeremy Corbyn's speech was a patriotic speech about defending this country from those who want to maim, kill and terrorise. — Owen Jones (@OwenJones84) May 26, 2017
Once again, Jeremy Corbyn is being smeared for stating the inconvenient truth. Mock imperialist outrage: https://t.co/rZRj12NvST — Max Blumenthal (@MaxBlumenthal) May 25, 2017
It's obvious there's a link between foreign policy and terrorism. Those of us who opposed Iraq War warned about it 15 yrs ago. #Corbyn — Nick Dearden (@nickdearden75) May 26, 2017
Corbyn's speech also comes as a new YouGov survey for The Times shows that Labour has narrowed British Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative lead to five points.
The Independent writes Friday: "While all opinions polls published during the campaign have signaled that the Conservatives are on track for a majority, Jeremy Corbyn's party has consistently cut the Conservatives' lead since the leaking of their party's manifesto."
Voters head to the polls June 8.
Mozilla is set to remove Google from its lofty seat atop Firefox browsers, for Russian language users at least, in favor of rival Russian search engine Yandex. Now the default search provider for the Russian version of Firefox 3.1 (due in a matter of weeks), the move is a big win for Yandex, and a loss for Google in the Russian market.
Harvey Anderson, Mozilla General Counsel, wrote that after research efforts were conducted that Mozilla came, "to the conclusion that our Russian users really wanted direct access to the Yandex search services in official Firefox RU builds. As a result, we're planning on setting Yandex as the default search provider for the Firefox 3.1 Russian locale builds (these changes should go into the current beta for testing). This means that, upon download and launch, the Firefox Start Page for RU locale builds will use Yandex for search queries, and the search bar will default to Yandex."
The Google-Mozilla relationship is essential to both parties: it gives Google massive distribution, and provides Mozilla with most of its revenue. And yet the Yandex move, plus Google's debut of Firefox competitor Chrome, must surely cause a little friction in this mutually beneficial relationship.

A woman was arrested after their 14-year-son told authorities they escaped from a home where he'd been kept for 4 1/2 years, spending most of their time locked in a bedroom closet, police said Monday.
A security guard at a National Guard facility in Oklahoma City called police on Friday after the teen showed up malnourished and with numerous scars and other signs of abuse, police Sgt. Gary Knight said.
"He was hungry. They were dirty. They had numerous scars on their body," Knight said. "It was very sad."
The boy was taken to a hospital to be examined and then turned over to the custody of the Department of Human Services, Knight said.
After police interviews, officers on Saturday arrested the boy's mother, 37-year-old LaRhonda Marie McCall, and a friend, 38-year-old Steve Vern Hamilton, on 20 complaints each of child abuse and child neglect. Formal charges have not been filed, and both were being held on $400,000 bond, according to jail records.
Jail officials were not sure wheter either had retained an attorney, and no one answered the phone at McCall's home. A police report listed McCall as a pharmaceutical company employee and Hamilton as a cab driver.
The teen, wearing only a pair of oversized shorts held up by a belt, walked up to a security guard at the Guard facility around 5 p.m. Friday and asked where a police station was located so they could report being abused, according to a police report.
They told police that scars on their stomach and torso were from where alcohol had been poured on them and set on fire. Other scars were from being tied up, hit with an extension cord and choked, the boy told police.
"He had scars covering most of their body," Knight said. "They were basically from head to foot."
The teen told police they moved to the Oklahoma City area from New Jersey about 4 1/2 years ago after their mother was released from jail. Since arriving in Oklahoma, they said, they had never been to school and spent most of their time locked in a bedroom closet.
They told police the closet door was mostly blocked with a stepladder or a bed and that they managed to push the door open enough to escape and leave the house.
Knight said six other children living at the home were taken into DHS custody, but none showed signs of abuse. McCall had lived at several different addresses in the Oklahoma City area, they said.
A DHS spokesperson said they could not discuss specific cases but generally an investigation would be conducted before any of the children are returned to the home or placed with other family members.
"There may be family members, but we do a diligent search, and we're very careful about placing kids in a safe environment," DHS spokesperson Beth Scott said.
I'm sure you're probably thinking, ‘What the heck is arancini?' Great question.
Arancini is an Italian dish consisting of rice balls stuffed with cheese, coated in bread crumbs, and deep fried. The result is a crispy, savory ball of goodness with a cheesy center, perfect for dipping into marinara sauce.
Pretty awesome, right? I thought so, too. Which is precisely why I wanted to experience them for myself.
To the experimental vegan kitchen we go!
This recipe starts with cauliflower. Did you know this cruciferous veg can be made into rice? So cool.
I wanted to use cauliflower rice as the base to keep this dish lighter and healthier. Spoiler alert: It totally worked.
The flavor in this 10-ingredient dish comes from vegan parmesan cheese (my trusty kitchen companion), sun-dried tomatoes, fresh basil, and garlic. Panko bread crumbs create the perfect coating for browning and crisping the edges.
What do they taste like? Little bites of Italian food heaven. They're:
Savory
Flavorful
Tender on the inside
Crispy on the outside
Satisfying
& Surprisingly healthy
Think Italian vegan “meatball,” but only more tender and somehow more delicious.
These make the perfect side dish or appetizer for Italian night or when you want a hearty snack. I would bet money that kids would gobble these down without guessing they were eating mostly cauliflower. Sneaky vegetable placement for the win.
If you try this recipe, let us know! Leave a comment, rate it, and don't forget to take a picture and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram. We'd love to see what you come up with. Cheers, friends!

Curious about how exactly Apple's smart home will work? Wonder no longer: Apple has finally provided some much-needed answers with an updated HomeKit support page, which outlines some specific, practical information about how to use the system.
Apple has touted its HomeKit smart-home framework since last year, promising that people will soon be able to use their iPhones and iPads to control home appliances—everything from lights and thermostats to coffeemakers. But the promise has remained vague, primarily because Apple has stayed relatively mum about this initiative in the public eye. That has left some folks to wonder if the company underestimated the complexities involved in building its own smart-home system.
While the support page is not exactly a heartfelt or glossy commercial, at least it explains how Apple sees users controlling the action. Accompanying the site update, the company also provided some live hands-on product demos this week and pledged to educate consumers on to run an Apple smart home.
Going Home(Kit)
Here's how Apple currently envisions HomeKit working: To begin controlling HomeKit-compatible devices, you download the gadget's iOS app from the App Store, then you pair your device to an iPhone or iPad.
From there, you simply fire up the Siri voice assistant on those mobile devices and talk to it to command your home. You can tell Siri to turn the lamp on or off, dim the lights or turn on other appliances. The HomeKit system can also sort connected gadgets by room (bedroom, dining room, living room, etc.), so you can control groups of devices or create more complicated commands.
A notable inclusion: If you have a third-generation Apple TV or later, you can issue HomeKit commands remotely.
Rumors ran high that Apple would integrate HomeKit into its next Apple TV, and this essentially cements it. With the Apple TV sitting in the house, it acts as command central, so you can control things remotely. While you're on the go, you just speak into your phone, and the set-top box carries out the commands for you back home.
Apple May Bring It Home For The Holidays
Though it appears to be ramping up, Apple has still not issued an official timeline for HomeKit. The company featured it prominently at its Worldwide Developers Conference last year, but a year hence, and WWDC earlier this month was mostly devoid of HomeKit announcements.
That belies what must be furious activity going on behind the scenes. The company has been pushing hard, not just on software development (and presumably Apple TV hardware development), but also to further partner initiatives. HomeKit's device line-up covers Philips Hue smart lightbulbs, Schlage Bluetooth door locks, iDevices Switch and others, including iHome, Elgato, Ecobee, Insteon and Lutron. (The latter just released the Caséta lighting kit as the first HomeKit compatible product on the market.)
These factors all seem to point to a big coming-out party for HomeKit in the near future, probably at its fall press event.
The timing works on a number of levels: It would give the company a couple of more months to work out the kinks before the big consumer push, and offer up yet another exciting Apple announcement to flesh out its fall presentation (beyond what may be incrementally updated iPhone 6S devices, that is).
Perhaps most importantly, it could also offer shoppers some intriguing new possibilities—like giving the gift of an Apple smart home for the holidays.
