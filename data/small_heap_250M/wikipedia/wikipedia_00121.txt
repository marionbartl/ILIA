MV Coral (formerly Triton, Sunward II, Cunard Adventurer) was a cruise ship in service for Louis Cruises until 2011. She was a Cunard Line cruise ship that operated from 1971 to 1977. She was the first of the company's vessels in the 20th century to bear a name that did not end in "ia" or begin with "Queen."
Sold in 1977, Cunard Adventurer became Sunward II for Norwegian Cruise Line. During her refit, her QE2 style funnel was removed and replaced by a NCL style funnel. In April 2005 she was sold at auction to Louis Cruises.
As Coral she sailed in the Mediterranean Sea and Greek islands until 2011.
Louis announced in May 2013 that for the 2014 season, Coral was to be renamed Louis Rhea, to reflect the company's Hellenic heritage. However, in December the plans were cancelled and she was reported to have been sold to a scrap firm in Aliağa, Turkey and subsequently to Alang, India. She arrived in Alang for breaking on 30 January 2014.

The 1991–92 Philadelphia Flyers season was the team's 25th season in the National Hockey League (NHL). The Flyers hosted the 43rd NHL All-Star Game. They missed the Stanley Cup playoffs for the third consecutive season.
Regular season
Prior to the 1991–92 season, the Flyers acquired Rod Brind'Amour and Dan Quinn from the St. Louis Blues in exchange for Murray Baron and Flyers captain Ron Sutter. Brind'Amour led the Flyers in goals (33), assists (44) and points (77) in his first season with the club. Rick Tocchet was named team captain to replace Sutter. As the Flyers continued to flounder, Paul Holmgren was fired in December and replaced by Bill Dineen, father of Flyer Kevin Dineen. On February 19, the Flyers and the Pittsburgh Penguins made a major five-player deal which featured Tocchet – who never grew comfortably into the role of captain – heading to Pittsburgh and Mark Recchi coming to Philadelphia. Recchi recorded 27 points in his first 22 games as a Flyer, but the team missed the playoffs for the third consecutive year, due in large part to an awful road record (10–26–4).
With Brind'Amour and Quinn in the fold to create more offense, plus a healthy Hextall in net, the Flyers still got off to an 0–3–1 start. After a 4–2 win over New Jersey, the club awakened, trading roughly two wins for every loss and climbing to 8–8–1 following back-to-back 3–1 wins over the Edmonton Oilers and Montreal Canadiens in mid-November.
From there, injuries and poor play from regulars began to doom Paul Holmgren's tenure behind the bench. An eight-game winless streak (0–7–1) effectively put an end to his tenure. Murray Craven was traded to the Hartford Whalers in exchange for the younger Dineen during the run, which included blow-out home losses to the Whalers (7–3 on November 27) and the Penguins (9–3 on November 29). In both home games, the Spectrum crowd loudly chanted "Paul Must Go" during multiple stoppages in play. Flyer fans received their wish on December 4, with the Flyers at 8–14–2, as Bill Dineen took the helm.
The team began his tenure at 4–1–5, but still slipped into last place by late January. A 7–1–2 string brought the club within striking distance of a playoff spot by mid-February, but an inability to win on the road within the division sabotaged their comeback effort. After the three-way deal between the Flyers, Penguins and Kings was completed, the club had an infusion of scoring with Recchi, but it was too late to make up ground in the standings.
A five-game win streak from March 12–22 yielded a 7–6 comeback win over the Capitals in Landover, in which the Flyers scored four times in the third period - but the momentum didn't last as a 2–5–0 finish, compounded by a 12-day National Hockey League Players' Association strike, sent the club into the Patrick Division basement for the second time in three years.
The Flyers struggled on the power play in the regular season, finishing 22nd in power play percentage with 16.55% (68 for 411).

is an action video game developed and published by Namco Bandai Games for the Wii through the WiiWare service. It was released in Japan in 2009 and in North America and PAL regions in 2010. Players control one of seven different bodybuilders and try to catch a thief that has stolen their bodybuilding friends' tub of protein powder. Its gameplay is similar to Hole In The Wall, where players use the Wiimote and Nunchuck to perform specific bodybuilder poses to pass through corresponding holes in walls left by the thief.
Muscle March is based on an unreleased arcade game of the same name, where players used a set of dual joysticks to make a character perform various poses. The arcade version was developed by a team of newcomers to the company and was canceled due to it being too similar to "another arcade game at the time". Company veteran Hideo Yoshizawa suggested porting Muscle March to the Wii as he believed its motion controls worked well with the game. Critics highlighted its bizarre nature and camp style, which they compared to games such as Katamari Damacy, though its gameplay was criticized for being too simplistic and suffering from unresponsive controls.
Gameplay
Muscle March is an action game in which players control a bodybuilder trying to stop a thief that has stolen their bodybuilding friends' tub of protein powder. Players can select one of seven different flamboyant characters, which include the Russian Radimov; the top hat-wearing Spaniard, Mr. Pedroso; and a Norwegian polar bear. The differences between each character are cosmetic, and do not affect the gameplay itself depending on which one is chosen.
The gameplay is similar to Hole In The Wall; the thief will crash through walls, leaving holes in the shape of bodybuilding poses, and players use the Wiimote and Nunchuck to match the pose. Failing to match the pose in time will remove a heart from the players' stamina meter. If the meter is fully depleted, the game is over. Players begin at the end of a single-file line of computer-controlled bodybuilders, which one by one are knocked out of play. Once the thief is the only character remaining, players must shake the controllers to catch up and tackle him. The main gamemode is "Arcade", where players complete a series of six stages that increase in difficulty. There is also a time attack mode where the objective is to get as far as possible before a life is lost.
Development
Muscle March was created by Namco Bandai Games, a company formed through the merger of Namco and Bandai in 2006. It was originally intended as an arcade game where players used a set of dual joysticks for control. The arcade version was created in 2006 by a team of newcomer employees for the company, who were given exactly one month to make it as a learning experience. They came up with a game where players use the joysticks to make the character perform different poses. Though the prototype was completed and later demonstrated at an arcade tradeshow in Tokyo, it was canceled before its test marketing due to it being too similar to "another arcade game at the time".
The same year the arcade version of Muscle March was canceled, Nintendo released the Wii, a home game console that utilized motion controls. Hideo Yoshizawa, a long-time veteran of Namco Bandai and the producer of its Klonoa series, suggested releasing Muscle March for the Wii, as it was his belief the motion controls would work well with the game. Yoshizawa showed the game to Nintendo, who reportedly liked its concept. The Wii version was produced by newcomer Shinya Satake. Muscle Marchs characters, setting, and plot rarely attempt any semblance of realism, in a manner similar to Katamari Damacy (2004) and Noby Noby Boy (2009). This design choice was based on Satake wanting to make games with a comedic tone.
Namco Bandai released Muscle March in Japan on May 26, 2009 through the WiiWare service. Though news outlets believed its heavily-stylized and bizarre design made an international version unlikely, Namco Bandai announced a Western release in December. Namco Bandai's North American division worked to promote the game using strange and eccentric advertisements, which generated considerable attention. Muscle March was released in North America on January 10, 2010, and later for PAL regions on March 19.
Reception
Muscle March received mixed reviews upon release, holding a 62/100 on the review aggregator website Metacritic. IGN reviewer Daemon Hatfield considered Muscle March "more fun to watch than it is to play". Reviewers were primarily critical of its controls, which they claimed became unresponsive in later portions of the game. Kotaku writer Michael McWhertor expressed his frustration with the game not being able to recognize controller movements at high speeds, making later levels unnecessarily difficult. Nathan Meunier of GamesRadar+, though not as critical as McWhertor, felt the controls required time getting used to, and listed it as being one of Muscle Marchs the weakest aspects. The short length and lack of content were also criticized. Writing for Meristation, Ramon Mendez though the game was too short and lacked a proper challenge, and wrote Muscle March was "nothing more than a curiosity".
Critics were drawn to the camp style and bizarre premise. Hardcore Gaming 101s Neil Foster described the game as being "a homoerotic Simon Says." Its lack of attempt at realism was compared to games such as Cho Aniki and Katamari Damacy, which similarly used abstract characters and outlandish premises. Mendez and McWhertor both suggested playing the game with friends for the same reason. Foster complained the graphics were on-par with budget-priced Dreamcast games, while Hatfield felt it added to its charm. The gameplay itself left reviewers indifferent; where as some stated it was too simplistic, others believed it was part of what made it appealing. Eurogamers Ellie Gibson said its simplicity and strangeness were its biggest strengths, and ultimately made it worth the purchase: "Muscle March is shallow, stupid, short, repetitive and crude. It's also the best WiiWare game."

Axel Bauer (born 7 April 1961) is a French singer, composer, guitarist, and actor, born in Paris. A figure of the French rock scene, he was discovered in 1983 with the song "Cargo". Several times awarded a gold record, he has sold three million records and performed nearly 700 concerts in France and Europe.
Music career
"Cargo"
He submitted his demos to Philippe Missir, artistic director of Mondio Music, who accompanied him in the elaboration of the "Cargo" demo on which Michel Eli, the director of the label immediately signed Bauer. The song came out at the end of 1983 with Manu Katche on drums and Bauer on guitar. Michel Eli, who wrote the lyrics, was inspired by film Pépé le Moko with Jean Gabin. The cover of the single refers to the poster of the film Querelle by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. "Cargo" sold more than a million copies, earning a Gold record for Bauer.
Bauer chose to work with the director Jean Baptiste Mondino on a video for the song. The video was shot in black and white, populated by muscular sailors in engine rooms and a nude girl dancing, inspired by Francis Ford Coppola's film Rumble Fish and Fritz Lang's film Metropolis. "Cargo" was the first French video to be broadcast on MTV.
"Éteins la lumière"
The following year, he became the first French artist to sign at EMI international. He settled in London and began recording his debut album with director Dave Bascomb, producer of Tears for Fears. The album Les nouveaux Seigneurs was released in 1987.
After a few years spent in the UK, Axel left EMI, returned to Paris and signed with Mercury (Universal). In 1990, Sentinelles was released, produced by Ben Rogan (Polnareff, Daho, Sade). It was considered an unpolished blending of disparate genres such as rock and electro with multiple collaborations, with the song "Éteins la lumière" becoming a success and being certified gold record. The song remains notable for its guitar riff. Axel then left for a long tour with musicians such as bassist Phil Spalding, on guitar Pierre Jaconelli or drummer Mathieu Rabaté.
Simple mortel
Simple mortel, his third album, was released in 1998. However, Bauer's record company found the album to be out of format, with the songs too long for the radio and although having received a good reception in the press, they did not promote it.
"À ma place"
Axel worked with his guitarist Juan Tamayo on "Mens moi" and the bassist Arnaud Giroud of Emigrates for his next album.
After listening to some demos with French artist Zazie, they got really deep by writing a song called "À ma place". Zazie wrote the lyrics, Axel composed the music and both sung. A song with compelling energy and emotion that won an enormous success, selling nearly 600,000 copies, was nominated for the Victoires de la musique and won an NRJ music Award. The album became a golden record with 170,000 copies sold.
À ma place" was not included on Zazie's studio album, but only on Bauer's Personne n'est parfait on which it appears in an extended version, then on Bauer's best of La Désintégrale (2003).
In 2003, the live version performed during Zazie's tour was added on her live album Ze live!! and in the collector edition of La Désintégrale. The song, as well as the music video (on the DVD), were also available on Zazie's 2008 greatest hits Zest Of.
Invited by Zazie, he joined the troupe of the "Restos du cœur". Triumphing at the Olympia in 2002, he created the surprise entering the stage with a string orchestra and electro-rock musicians.
Bad Cowboy
In 2003 released his first best of, La désintégrale.
In 2006 he signed with Polydor, worked on Bad Cowboy produced by Dan Presley (The Breeders). With Franck Pilant on guitar with whom he started the album's composition and pre-production, Drummer Geoff Dugmore (Killing Joke, Johnny Hallyday), bassist and former boxer Gabriel Barry. The album was recorded live in Ireland at Grouse Lodge Studios. For the video of "Tu me Tues" Axel, Gabriel and Franck incarnated a band of urban cowboys penetrating the city on horseback in search of their alter egos.
At the same time, he left Universal and became producer. In 2010, he participated in the opera rock Dracula composing the single "in trance ... ylvanie" with singer of BB Brunes, Adrien Gallo. End of 2010, again with Zazie, they perform a new duet: Double Axel.
Peaux de serpent
In 2013, Axel Bauer launched Peaux de serpent.
Live à Ferber
Live à Ferber is a live album released in June 2017 recorded live at the Ferber Studio in Paris. The album includes some of his greatest hits started in 2013. The videos of the recordings were released on Bauer's YouTube channel.
On the side
Sahara desert
Having become a star at a young age, Axel feels the need to refocus and find himself. In the early 1990s, with his friend and bassist Laurent Griffon, they went to the Sahara desert to experience an ascetic life. an immersion in the Tuaregs of the Ténéré world. In the school of life, lost in the immensity of the desert, he realizes that there is nothing in this world where one is very small.
Upon his return, he composed "Nomade" and "00 Zen", and works with director Steve Forward.
GAM - IAO
Mid 2000s he identified a real need to put artists at the center of negotiations with producers. Together with Kent, Issam Krimi and Suzanne Combeaud they set up the GAM (the guild of the artists of the music) of which he is made president. Many artists respond to the call. He then participates actively in the Lescure and Pheline missions and the GAM will be a signatory of the Schwartz agreements. In 2015, the GAM is at the initiative of a worldwide organisation called IAO (International artist organisation)

In 2014, Consumer Cellular was introduced in Target stores, and in 2018 became available at select U.S. Best Buy stores. In 2013, the company introduced a smartphone financing program called EasyPay that is available to consumers purchasing smartphones that cost $200 and up. That same year, the company partnered with SquareTrade to begin providing cellphone protection plans.
In February 2013, in celebration of its one millionth customer, Consumer Cellular donated $1 million: $100,000 to each of five non-profit partners, and the remainder to its employees.

Robert V. Barron (born Robert V. Nemiroff; December 26, 1932 – December 1, 2000) was an American TV and film director, producer, screenwriter and actor. He was best known for his role as the voice of Admiral Donald Hayes in the 1980s animated TV series Robotech, of which he also served as the producer. He is also well known for playing Abraham Lincoln in the 1989 comedy film Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure.
Career
Barron attended Morris Harvey College in Charleston, West Virginia, and UCLA. He subsequently trained at American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City, and at Max Reinhardt Workshop in Los Angeles.
He got his entertainment start in radio, co-producing a two-hour Saturday morning radio program, the "Bop Shop," which aired for two years on radio station WGKV-AM (later WHMS and WXIT, now WSWW (AM)) in his hometown of Charleston, West Virginia.
Before permanently moving to California and beginning his Hollywood work, he spent several years in regional theater across the U.S. He built an impressive resumé of glowing reviews of his performances in such roles as Cyrano de Bergerac, Abe Lincoln In Illinois, Sir Thomas More in A Man For All Seasons, Henry Drummond in Inherit The Wind, Richard III, but was never offered major roles in films or television.
In Hollywood, he made acting appearances in television shows such as Quantum Leap, Get a Life, Father Dowling Mysteries, and movies such as The Spring and A Dangerous Place. He also wrote episodes of the NBC television western series Bonanza and the CBS-TV western/spy series Wild, Wild West. Perhaps his best-remembered television script was his first, a lighthearted comedy episode of Bonanza, "Hoss and The Leprechauns."
As a writer, Barron drifted into adapting English dubbing scripts of foreign films. American producers began buying successful Japanese animated series and dubbing them in English, and Barron was a pioneer in that industry, which grew rapidly and enormously. He became executive director and story editor for Saban Productions, which in five years became one of the world's largest producers of children's programming, with such shows as X-Men (1992) and Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers (1993).
He also made appearances on TV series such as Bonanza, Mannix, Love American Style and Night Court, and played a pool player in an episode of CBS-TV's Dukes of Hazzard.
He also co-wrote the standard song "Cindy, Oh Cindy" with Bert Long.
Death
Barron died in Salinas, California, and was interred in Salinas's Garden of Memories Memorial Park.

Iraq competed at the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 7 to 18 September 2016.
Disability classifications
Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.
Archery
Jawad Al-Musawi earned Iraq a spot at the Rio Games following his performance at the 2015 World Archery Para Championships in the men's recurve open. He had an upset win against Italy's Roberto Airoldi on his way to earning his spot.

There are four programs in the University, leading to the Doctor of Medicine (MD) with a specialization in Pediatrics, Doctor of Medicine (MD), Doctor of Dental Medicine (DDM), and Master in Clinical Psychology degrees. Postgraduate training, providing the opportunity to get a PhD, is also available.
History
St. Petersburg State Pediatric Medical University (SPbSPMU), formerly known as Leningrad Pediatric Medical Institute (LPMI) is the oldest independent pediatric university in the world. It was founded in 1925 as the Institute for Protection of Maternity and Infancy. The main building of University was settled on the territory of City Children's Hospital, which had been founded in 1905. The Children's Hospital was built as a series of separated pavilions to prevent spreading of infectious diseases. There were 650 beds in the hospital which had a staff consisting of 28 physicians, 2 paramedics, 56 sisters of mercy, 232 nurses and a number of other staff.
During the period of Russian Civil War(1918–1920) the hospital was neglected, but the large number of orphaned children after the war led authorities to provide more funding, and on January 7, 1925, the Scientific-Practical Institute of Maternity and Infancy Protection, named after Clara Zetkin, opened. The structure of the institute was remodeled and included 11 clinical departments, a baby house, an infant house, the department to qualify children conditions, 3 clinics with up to 500 beds in each of them, an outpatient clinic, a children consulting center, and milk stations. From the year of 1925 until 1949, the institute was headed by Yulia Aronovna Mendeleeva.
In 1928, the scientific work began in the institute. Later, the institute became the Scientific Research Institute of Maternity and Infancy Protection
and kept this status till 1932. The newly created departments of Physiology, Social Hygiene of Woman and Child, Hygiene and Nutrition Science Early Ages, Pathology of Children, Roentgenology, Child Phthisiatry, Acute Child Infections got involved in intensive teaching and research activities.
In 1932 the institute was transformed into the higher medical educational institution- "the clinic-med school". The country struggled with getting enough qualified medical specialists, and the child mortality still remained high. The government had to expand a net of clinical and preventive institutions and to establish health care in houses and correctional institutions for orphans.
Soon, the whole department of maternity and infancy protection with professors and students of the First Leningrad Medical Institute was transferred to the Pediatric Institute. 82 students were registered for the fall semester of their first year. In 1935 "the clinic-med school" was reorganized into Leningrad Pediatric Medical Institute (LPMI), the first in the world specialized medical school for pediatricians training. There was the first graduate class of 51 children doctors in 1936. Upon the beginning of WWII, the institute trained 530 and improved training of 300 physicians.
There were somatic, surgical, infectious, neurological, tuberculosis, venereal, obstetric, gynecological departments in the institute. Special attention was paid to prevention of infectious diseases. The quantity of beds in the hospital approached 1215 in 1940.
Throughout all years of World War II, the institute continued clinical, research, educational and organizational work. The majority of faculty and clinical staff remained in Leningrad, surrounded by German troops. On the German military maps, the pediatric institute had a specific number of 708 and had to be vanished. On the territory of institute, surgical and infectious hospitals were opened to treat soldiers and citizens. The Siege of Leningrad captured more than 400 thousand children, interrupting their evacuation.
In the 50s, the institute increased quantity of applicants up to 600. According to the order of Ministry of Healthcare, the institute became Saint-Petersburg Pediatric Medical Institute in 1992 and then received a status of academy in 1994. In 2012 received a status of university.
Currently, the University has 70 departments.
To the year of 2000, more than 25000 physicians graduated from SpbSPMU, including 2000 physicians from foreign countries. The training of foreign students started in 1949.
Scientists of the University have influenced the development of basic science studies and clinical pediatric studies.
There are several scientific schools in the University, and they continue to develop:
Pathology of young children of M.S.Maslov

Song meaning
The song uses the main subject matter of Shannon Hoon's 1963 Ford Galaxie to also explore the deeper themes of his first love and break-up. He had originally bought this car used in New Orleans, for rather cheap, as the doors wouldn't even open. The original title for the song was called "I'm a Freak," but Shannon hated the original lyrics and refused to sing them. During the recording sessions Shannon would get frustrated and drive around the city in the car. Glenn Graham believes it was during one of these drives that Shannon came up with the final lyrics to the song. Shannon never confirmed this claim.
Music video
The music video for "Galaxie" featured a cameo by Timothy Leary, and revolves around a 1967 Ford Galaxie, fitting the lyrics. The video is considered a haunting premonition of Hoon's overdose later in 1995: Hoon was on drugs while filming the video, and featured such an erratic behaviour that scared the rest of the band - guitarist Christopher Thorn was quoted saying "I get nauseous when I see that video, just watching Shannon just disintegrate in front of your eyes...".

Strategic Communications Wing 1 (STRATCOMWING ONE) is a nuclear command and control wing of the United States Navy. Its TACAMO ("Take Charge and Move Out") mission provides airborne communications links to nuclear missile units of United States Strategic Command. It is located at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma.
The two operational squadrons, VQ-3 and VQ-4, prepared to move from their former Atlantic and Pacific bases in 1992-1993 and the wing was formally established on 29 May 1992. Captain Andy Riddile, first commander ("Commodore") of the wing, arrived in April 1992. A separate Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS), VQ-7, was later established at Tinker AFB with EC-18 and TC-18 aircraft.
The wing consists of three squadrons and a wing staff, and employs over 1,300 active-duty sailors and 100 contractors to provide maintenance, security, operations, administration, training and logistic support for the E-6 Mercury aircraft fleet. The E-6B Mercury enables the President of the United States and the Secretary of Defense to directly contact submarines, bombers and missile silos enforcing the country's national security through nuclear deterrence.
The Wing provides a secure communications link designed to for use in the event of nuclear war or other major incident in order to maintain communications between the decision makers comprising the National Command Authority (NCA) and the triad of U.S. strategic nuclear weapon delivery systems, i.e., manned bombers, land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs).
The wing's primary mission is to receive, verify and retransmit Emergency Action Messages (EAMs) to US strategic forces. With the retirement of the USAF EC-135 Looking Glass airframe, the E-6 Mercury upgraded with the Airborne Launch Control System (ALCS) have also assumed the airborne command post mission for the United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM). OC-ALC airframe artisans perform depot work on the Navy's E-6 Mercury aircraft, which are based on the Boeing 707 airframe. The wing's Navy sailors perform organizational and field level maintenance work, with the former integrated at the flying squadron level while the latter is performed at the wing's aircraft intermediate maintenance department (AIMD) level. The wing also operates alert facilities for E-6B aircraft at Travis AFB, California and Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland.
STRATCOMWING ONE's subordinate squadrons include:
Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron THREE (VQ-3) (E-6B)
Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron FOUR (VQ-4) (E-6B)
Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron SEVEN (VQ-7)
Previous Commanders:
Retired Rear Admiral Margaret D. Klein who served under Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel.
Captain Heather Cole who was removed from command in early 2015, Captain Cole was removed in connection to reported "cultural issues."

Benjamin Gerritszoon Cuyp (December 1612 – 28 August 1652) was a Dutch Golden Age landscape painter.
Biography
Cuyp was born and died in Dordrecht, in the Dutch Republic. According to Arnold Houbraken, he was a pupil of his uncle (Jacob Gerritsz Cuyp) who taught him together with his son, (Benjamin's cousin) Aelbert Cuyp. Houbraken felt Aelbert had neater brush strokes and Benjamin showed the rough approach of his teacher.
However according to the Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie (RKD), Houbraken was mistaken about the family; where in actuality Benjamin and Jacob were both born in Dordrecht as the sons of a glasspainter from Venlo named Gerrit Gerritsz Cuyp. Benjamin learned to paint from his older half-brother, Jacob Cuyp. He was therefore the uncle, not the cousin, of the much more famous Aelbert Cuyp. He is known for allegorical pieces, genre works, beach scenes, military scenes, and landscapes. He influenced Barent van Kalraet, and was followed by Maerten Fransz van der Hulst. While his Baroque painting styles seems to have been influenced by Rembrandt's dramatic use of chiaroscuro.

Saint Joseph Seeks a Lodging at Bethlehem is an opaque watercolor painting over graphite by James Tissot. The painting was created between 1886-1894, near the end of James Tissot's Career. This style of painting is also known as Gouache.
The painting depicts Mary and her husband, Joseph, looking for a room for the night. Because of the Census of Caesar Augustus (also known as the Census of Quirinius), the town is overcrowded and there is no room to be had. So they are being turned away at every door. In the picture itself, Joseph pleads with an innkeeper to give them a place to rest, while the weary Mary waits on the donkey with quiet resignation. The painting "strikes a realistic note" depicting Mary as a veiled woman in a narrow alley of an Eastern town.
The painting is currently being displayed at the Brooklyn Museum and is available for download and print.

William Fraser Tytler of Balnain FRSE (10 September 1777–4 September 1853) was a 19th-century Scottish lawyer and historian.
Life
He was born at Campbells Close on the Grassmarket in Edinburgh on 10 September 1777 the son of Anne Fraser of Balnain and Alexander Fraser Tytler. He was the grandson of William Tytler of Woodhouselee.
He trained as a lawyer and qualified as an advocate in 1799. He set up practice at 65 Princes Street in Edinburgh. In 1801 he succeeded his father as Professor of Constitutional and Universal History at the University of Edinburgh. He then moved to 7 South Castle Street.
He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1807. His proposers were Thomas Charles Hope, Sir James Hall and John Playfair.
In 1810 he was appointed Sheriff of Inverness. This was possibly pre-empted by his inheriting his mother's family home: Balnain House near Inverness. However, he frequently returned to Edinburgh (to continue his professorial duties) staying with his mother at 108 Princes Street. He was heavily criticised for his lack of attendance at the University of Edinburgh and eventually relinquished his position in 1821. In Inverness he worshipped at St John's Episcopal Church.
In December 1846 Fraser Tytler alerted the authorities in Edinburgh to the famine developing in the Western Isles as a result of the loss of the potato crop to blight. This resulted in an investigation by the Army Commissariat and the dispatch of the gunboat Firefly to Barra with a relief supply of barley-meal. Eight men from Berneray sent for trial in Inverness for taking barrels of flour from the wreck of the cargo ship Superb which had run aground off the coast of North Uist were released by Fraser Tytler after being admonished, and returned home at his expense.
Fraser Tytler died at Great Malvern on 4 September 1853, aged 75.
Family
In 1801 he married Margaret Cussans Grant, and together they had at least ten children. Their sons served in the Indian army or East India Company.
His brothers were James Fraser Tytler and Patrick Fraser Tytler.

Ploy () is a 2007 Thai film written and directed by Pen-Ek Ratanaruang. The film premiered during the Directors' Fortnight at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival.
The drama film stars Thai actress Lalita Panyopas in a story of a middle-aged married couple who question their relationship after seven years. Ananda Everingham is featured in a supporting role as a bartender.
The film contained sex scenes that were shown at Cannes, but due to censorship concerns had to be re-edited by the director so the film could be shown in cinemas in Thailand when it opened there on June 7, 2007. The uncensored version of the film was shown in Thailand at the 2007 Bangkok International Film Festival.
Plot
The death of a relative brings a Thai-American couple, Wit and Dang, back to Bangkok for the first time in many years. Arriving at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport at around 5 a.m., they check into a hotel in the city. Suffering from jet lag, Dang wants to sleep, but her husband Wit is restless and heads down to the hotel bar to buy some cigarettes. While unpacking their luggage, Dang finds a small paper with a phone number of a woman named Noy, and she is immediately suspicious.
In the hotel bar, Wit meets Ploy, a young woman who says she is waiting for her mother to arrive from Stockholm. The two bond over coffee and cigarettes, and Wit then invites Ploy to come up to the hotel room, where she can take a shower and rest while she awaits her mother. Up at the room, Dang opens the door and sees Ploy. To the girl, Dang is pleasant and friendly, but to her husband, she is seething with anger and jealousy. She has bouts of suspicion, followed by hallucinations / nightmares. Fitfully, the three people try to sleep. Dang and Wit discuss their seven-year marriage, and wonder why the love has gone out of it.
Meanwhile, a hotel maid, Tum, has stolen a guest's suit from the hotel's dry cleaners. She takes it up to room 609 and hangs it in the closet. Nut, the silent, weary bartender, enters the room and puts on the suit. He then finds Tum hiding in the shower, and proceeds to kiss her and caress her, and the couple starts having a sexual relationship.
Back in Wit and Dang's room, Dang becomes more upset, and decides to leave. Wit wakes up to find Dang gone, and then he and Ploy sit and smoke cigarettes and talk about love and relationships. They discuss how married life begins to lose its sheen eventually and think of options to keep the flame lit. At one point, Ploy mentions that she had a dream about the entire episode of the hotel maid and the bartender, which makes the viewer realize it was only a dream.
Ploy eventually leaves the hotel room, when Wit falls asleep. Out of curiosity, she examines the room in which she drempt that the maid and the bartender had sex.
Dang finds a coffee shop, where she takes a seat with a cup of coffee and pours some vodka in it from a small bottle she took from her hotel room's mini-bar. She is noticed by Moo, who is using his laptop computer. He recognizes Dang from her days as a famous television soap opera actress and invites her back to his home for some more drinks. Dang, who has already had quite a bit to drink, eventually throws up. Moo, spikes her last drink and tries to get closer to her. When Dang turns down his advances, he attacks and rapes her, although she puts up a fight. When Dang's life is in danger, they end up playing a game of hide and seek that would end with one of them dead. Given the previous storyline that turned out to be a dream, the viewer is left with uncertainty about what is a dream, and what is reality.
The movie shifts to a scene with Wit and Dang at the funeral, and viewers are left to adjust their view as they surmise that Wit had only dreamed this hostile plot line. The film ends with Wit and Dang leaving Thailand, as Dang says nothing about her ugly encounter with the rapist, Moo; when Wit sees her back at the hotel, he is happy to have Dang back with him. He places his hand over Dang's in the taxi, and sincerely tells her he loves her, which she had earlier expressed longing to hear. Dang smiles, and rests her head on Wit's shoulder lovingly as they exit Thailand to return to their home in the United States.

Production
Origins
Director Pen-Ek Ratanaruang said he was inspired to write the screenplay after talking with a relative who had returned to Bangkok after some years in the United States. "My cousin had a restaurant in the U.S. and one day she came back to Thailand for a funeral," Pen-Ek said. "But she didn't have a home here, so she had to stay in a hotel. I met her at the funeral and it struck me as rather odd that this Thai person had to stay in a hotel room when she came to Thailand. It inspired me to start writing a script about a Thai couple in a hotel room."
The film's proposal was submitted in 2006 to the Pusan Promotion Plan at the Pusan International Film Festival. Budgeted at around US$2 million, principal photography began in February 2007 in Bangkok. The locations included hotels and restaurants along Sukhumvit Road, as well as Suvarnabhumi Airport, making Ploy the first Thai feature film to feature Bangkok's new international airport. "Most of the action takes place in a hotel room. So we built our own room on the rooftop of a hotel, and it looks exactly like a real hotel room," Pen-Ek said in the film's production notes.
In March 2007, the Hong Kong/Amsterdam-based film financing and distribution company, Fortissimo Films, announced it would be executive producer of the film along with Thailand's Five-Star Production. Fortissimo takes care of international sales for the film, while Five Star handles distribution in Thailand.
From the start, producers sought to make Ploy a smaller-scale film than Pen-Ek's previous two films, Last Life in the Universe and Invisible Waves, which "were high-budget productions with international collaboration," said executive producer Chareon Iamphungporn. The previous two films had also been scripted or co-scripted by Thai writer Prabda Yoon. Chareon said he wanted Pen-Ek to return to his screenwriter-director roots and "come up with a project that had the personal warmth of his early films like 6ixtynin9 and Monrak Transistor."
The film reunited Pen-Ek with Thai cinematographer Chankit Chamnivikaipong, who had photographed his first three films, Fun Bar Karaoke, 6ixtynin9 and Monrak Transistor, before Pen-Ek collaborated with Christopher Doyle on Last Life in the Universe and Invisible Waves.
Casting
Ploy was a reunion for Pen-Ek and actress Lalita Panyopas, who is well known in Thailand for her roles in soap operas and a string of films in the 1980s. She starred in Pen-Ek's 1999 crime comedy-drama 6ixtynin9.
Pornwut Sarasin, who portrays the husband Wit, was a first-time actor. Forty-eight years old at the time of shooting, he is a vice president for Thai Namthip, the distributor of Coca-Cola in Thailand, and is well known in Thai high-society circles.
Ananda Everingham, who plays Nut the bartender, had worked with Pen-ek on a short film Twelve Twenty, commissioned for the 2006 Jeonju International Film Festival. He shares erotic scenes with model-actress Porntip Papanai, who plays the maid, Tum. She had a major role in Pen-ek's 2001 musical-comedy, Monrak Transistor, portraying the singer, Dao.
For the title character, Ploy, Pen-Ek chose Apinya Sakulcharoensuk, who was 16 years old at the time of shooting. "She's a godsend," the director said of the actress. "It's as if I could sense that the Ploy character is out there somewhere in the real world, and then she materializes in the form of this girl. Apinya was born to be Ploy."
Apinya had her hair styled into an Afro, a decision made by costume designer Visa Khongka, to make the character of Ploy look older and unique.
Reception
The film premiered on May 21, 2007 during the Directors' Fortnight at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. Critical reaction was mixed. Russell Edwards, writing for the film industry trade publication Variety, was negative, criticizing the film for its "glacial pace" and saying it was "too flimsy and false to truly engage."
Lee Marshall, writing for another trade journal, Screen Daily, was positive, mentioning The Seven Year Itch and calling Ploy "a tasty slice of cinema, by turns oneiric, erotic, funny and emotionally perceptive."
"Ploy imposes its own unhurried rhythm but then rewards its viewers for their indulgence, and within the arthouse niche that it will inevitably inhabit this could turn out to be a strong seller," Marshall wrote.
In an interview at Cannes, Pen-Ek reacted to the Variety and Screen Daily reviews, saying, "One is so bad and one is so good. They're equally not true."
Todd Brown, writing from Cannes for the website Twitchfilm.net, said Ploy is a logical step in the director's evolution, continuing on themes that were explored in Last Life in the Universe and Invisible Waves. "Ploy is essentially a lucid dream, a film that takes place in that odd in-between state when you cannot be sure whether you are sleeping or awake and there are seemingly sure pointers that would have you believe both. It is a film about people dislocated and relationships formed while others are breaking down badly," Brown wrote. "Ploy is a beautiful, thoughtful, meditative film, one that requires more effort from its audience than does Last Life in the Universe but one that the patient will find no less rewarding."
Kong Rithdee, critic for the Bangkok Post, said "Ploy is a finely tuned, mature piece of filmmaking that discusses adult themes with honesty and amused attention to the tiny details that define the shifting phases of a marriage. Ploy takes us closer to the characters than the director did in his last two outings ... and despite its dreamy episodes of hot-breath lovemaking, the movie is anchored in the sense of social realities more than his non-fans might care to observe."
Censorship issues
The version of Ploy that was shown at Cannes featured some extended scenes of nudity and sex between the bartender (Ananda Everingham) and the maid (Porntip Papanai). This is uncommon for Thai films because the industry is subjected to a censorship code that prohibits such depictions.
Pen-Ek said he didn't like directing the sex scenes. "It's not fun at all. I don't know how to direct two people making love! And it's not a good experience when they had to do it over and over again for 12 hours."
In describing the scenes in his review, Russell Edwards of Variety called them "compellingly erotic", but sarcastically added that the scenes "indicate that cinema's gain has truly been pornography's loss."
Todd Brown of Twitchfilm.net said the sex scenes might harm the film's chances in Thailand, saying "Thailand is notorious for the uneven application of its censorship laws but graphic nudity is pretty much always frowned upon."
Ahead of the film's opening in Thailand, the country's Board of Censorship ordered eight cuts for scenes it deemed obscene and inappropriate, mostly the lovemaking scenes. The director re-edited the film, cutting some scenes and adding others not included in the Cannes version, so the length is unchanged. The version shown in Cannes is unlikely to be seen in Thailand.
"Once again a good movie has been butchered by the powers-that-be, who believe their judgment is superior to ours," Bangkok Post film critic Kong Rithdee said in his review, referring to another film that had run afoul of Thai censors earlier in the year, Syndromes and a Century, by Apichatpong Weerasethakul. That film was pulled from release by the director, who refused to make the cuts ordered.
For Ploy, the cuts have little effect on the film as whole, Rithdee said, though the contrast is less stark between the bartender's and maid's steamy sex scenes and the chilly arguments of the married couple.
The uncensored version of the film was screened in the main competition at the 2007 Bangkok International Film Festival.
Box office
Ploy was released in Thailand cinemas on June 7, 2007, but proved to be no match for the Thai comedy film, Nhong Teng kon maha hia, which was released the previous weekend and even topped a Hollywood release, Ocean's Thirteen.
In its opening weekend, Ploy earned six million baht (about US$171,000) in Bangkok cinemas, compared to the $2.28 million after two weeks of earnings by Nhong Teng kon maha hia.
Five-Star Production had hoped the film would do better, based on the popularity of leading actress Lalita Panyopas, positive reviews from Cannes and word-of-mouth buzz.
"We expected a little more with Ploy," Co-producer Aphiradee Iamphungphorn was quoted as saying by Variety. "It is difficult to predict the market these days. Some people may have second thoughts whether they should see the film with the name Pen-Ek Ratanaruang as a director. Many still have this image that he only makes difficult movies."

Production
After directing the war film La colomba non deve volare, director Sergio Garrone began work on a horror film. After contacting the Italian distributor named Sabatini, he was introduced to the Rome-based Turkish producer Şakir V. Sözen. Sözen had previously produced Frank Agrama's crime film L'amico del padrino and offered the location of a huge villa and proposed casting the Turkish actor Ayhan Işık who had co-starred in L'amico del padrino. According to Garrone, Sözen suggested instead of making one film in six weeks, that they should make two films in eight weeks. This led to the production of both Le amanti del mostro and The Hand That Feeds the Dead.
Garrone described the general idea for the film as a variation on a "Frankenstein story" The film was shot in Istanbul and Elios Studios in Rome. The special effects for the surgical scenes in the film were provided by Carlo Rambaldi.
Release
The Hand That Feeds the Dead was released in Italy on 29 April 1974. The Turkish version of the film was not released until 1986 after actor and producer Yilmaz Duru bought the negatives from Sözen and released it as Ölümün Nefesi (). Duru re-edited the film and added music by Arif Melikov. Ölümün Nefesi was released on home video for Turkish and German home video markets and broadcast on Turkish television. The Turkish version was shown at the 2001 Ankara Film Festival.

Adel Souto (born November 29, 1969), who took the stage name "Adel 156" in 1990, is an American writer and musician. He is best known for his fanzine-turned-website Feast of Hate and Fear and the metalcore outfit Timescape Zero.
Early life
Adel Souto was born in Havana, Cuba, in 1969, to Mariaestela and Arsenio Souto. After his birth, his parents moved back to Spain until Francisco Franco left power in 1975, at which time the family moved to the United States. Souto went to high school at Hialeah-Miami Lakes Senior High. He attended some college courses at Miami-Dade Community College, but quickly dropped out.
Creative work
Music
In 1985, Souto formed Gangbangang (no releases), playing bass, and later joined Mourning Breath (no releases), still on bass, while in Miami. Adel replaced the original vocalist in Miami's first straight edge band, Violent Deed, in 1987 (one cassette demo, one live demo). In 1991, he began an experimental noise project in Denver named Dääb-Soul Destruction (one cassette demo). Upon returning to Miami, he replaced the vocalist for Hangman, in 1992, changing their name to Timescape Zero (two cassette demos, one split 7-inch, and two LPs).
He formed Shroud in 1992 as an improvisational jazz-doom-punk outfit (one cassette demo / repressed on CD, and one bootleg 7"). He joined metalcore sludge band None Dare Call It Treason, on vocals, in 2001 (one CDr demo). He began Martini Kulture as an experimental tape collage project in 2003 (one CDr demo). Souto joined Sound 4 Sound from 2003 to 2007, and again in 2009 (three CDr demos). He has contributed vocals to a track on DNME's Last of A Dying Breed LP, and played drums on The Goslings' Grandeur of Hair LP and Hunter's Moon EP.
Adel currently plays in the industrial junkyard outfit 156 (one CD EP, four cassette EPs), which released a 10" EP in 2016, titled Memento Mori, where the music was made entirely out of human bones, such as skulls, femur, and Tibetan kangling.

WHNE-LD, virtual and VHF digital channel 3, is a low-powered television station licensed to Detroit, Michigan, United States. The station is owned by Tait Broadcasting. The station's transmitter and studio offices are located in Oak Park, Michigan.
History
Early history
The station was originally owned by P&P Cable Holdings as W52CU and was licensed to Pinconning. P&P sold many of its stations and construction permits to NTN Saginaw, W52CU was one of these. W52CU never signed on in Pinconning.
In late 2005, Tait Broadcasting acquired W52CU and relocated the station to Flint, where it signed on as WHNE-LP on channel 32.
The WHNE calls were originally used on radio in the Detroit area; first from 1973 to 1978 on what is now WCSX (94.7 FM).
Until May 2006, WHNE was affiliated with Urban America Television; WHNE switched to America One after UATV suspended operations.
Tower relocation to Holly, digital operations
In 2010, the station relocated to a digital signal on channel 26, as WHNE-LD, now located at its new tower location. The directional antenna was designed to protect low-power WLPC-LP operating on channel 26 in Detroit. WLPC-LP had a construction permit to move to digital channel 40. After receiving the construction permit for its new tower site on channel 26, the station applied for additional power, which was granted after approval from the FCC and its Canadian counterpart, the CRTC.
On December 28, 2011, the station returned to the air, broadcasting from a transmitter tower near Holly at the East Holly Road and Interstate 75 (Exit 98) interchange, on UHF 26, and with a PSIP of 26.1 along with four sub channels. The transmitter had a directional antenna pattern mainly to the northwest towards Flint and the southeast towards Pontiac, with its reception area covering both cities.
Move to Detroit
Coincidentally, shortly after the station was nearly ready to transmit with increased power, the CRTC switched CHWI-DT-60 in Windsor, Ontario to channel 26. This left WHNE no other choice but to apply for a different channel to avoid any co-channel interference with CHWI.
The only channel found to use was UHF 20, which was previously occupied by the analog signal of WMYD in Detroit, which switched to digital on UHF channel 21. So WHNE filed an application to relocate its transmitter to WMYD's tower in Oak Park and to broadcast on channel 20, focusing on the Metro Detroit area, changing its city of license to Detroit. On March 27, 2012, the station was granted a construction permit to move to UHF channel 20 in Oak Park at 15 kW. In order to avoid a potential PSIP/virtual channel conflict with CHWI-DT-60, the station applied to the FCC to use 14 for its virtual channel, on April 30, 2014.
On September 21, 2014, the station returned to the air for testing at its new Oak Park facility, transmitting signal which covered much of the Metro Detroit area and nearby portions of Windsor and Essex County.
From September 21, 2014 until sometime in 2015, WHNE-LD was an affiliate of Soul of the South Network on 14.1. However, it was removed from the station when the network filed for bankruptcy in 2015 and couldn't pay most of its affiliates.
On November 22, 2015, the station added SonLife to 14.5. Until then, subchannel 14.5 was an affiliate of both Corner Store TV and Jewelry TV. In April 2016, the station launched a website and added LATV to 14.1, becoming Detroit's only over-the-air non-English television station since WUDL-LD dropped the TBN Enlace USA service on that station's 47.5 subchannel along with all other Trinity Broadcasting Network-related networks on other subchannels of that station after Regal Media sold it to King Forward, Inc. in 2015. In May 2017, LATV was replaced with infomercials. Light TV was added to 14.1 on August 24, 2017.
The move to low VHF
May 25, 2018 saw WHNE-LD receive its post-repack channel frequency: VHF 3, with an effective radiated power of 3 kW.
Signals on the low VHF band (channels 2 thru 6) travel better than signals on other bands, but require longer antennas (approximately 8 feet long) to receive due to the longer wavelength, and are especially prone to interference from electrical appliances and, especially in the case of metro Detroit, industrial noise. Interference had very little, if any, effect on analog signals, but can obliterate digital signals, which is compounded by WHNE's low power. As a result, the required move was met with negative backlash before it even happened.
WHNE-LD would sign off from channel 20 for the final time on March 13, 2020, vacating the frequency for Detroit Public Television. The station was delayed from signing back on at VHF 3 due to its new antenna being delayed during shipping due to the COVID-19 pandemic temporarily closing the ports in Italy, where the antenna parts were purchased from, as detailed in their station's Facebook page. The station managed to find an alternate source for its antenna parts by March 20, however, and planned to resume broadcasting by April 3 or 4, 2020, with a new station branding as TV-3 (with a PSIP of 3.x), but actually ended up returning on April 1.

A villanelle, also known as villanesque, is a nineteen-line poetic form consisting of five tercets followed by a quatrain. There are two refrains and two repeating rhymes, with the first and third line of the first tercet repeated alternately at the end of each subsequent stanza until the last stanza, which includes both repeated lines. The villanelle is an example of a fixed verse form. The word derives from Latin, then Italian, and is related to the initial subject of the form being the pastoral.
The form started as a simple ballad-like song with no fixed form; this fixed quality would only come much later, from the poem "Villanelle (J'ay perdu ma Tourterelle)" (1606) by Jean Passerat. From this point, its evolution into the "fixed form" used in the present day is debated. Despite its French origins, the majority of villanelles have been written in English, a trend which began in the late nineteenth century. The villanelle has been noted as a form that frequently treats the subject of obsessions, and one which appeals to outsiders; its defining feature of repetition prevents it from having a conventional tone.
Etymology
The word villanelle derives from the Italian villanella, referring to a rustic song or dance, and which comes from villano, meaning peasant or villein. Villano derives from the Medieval Latin , meaning a "farmhand". The etymology of the word relates to the fact that the form's initial distinguishing feature was the pastoral subject.
History
The villanelle originated as a simple ballad-like song—in imitation of peasant songs of an oral tradition—with no fixed poetic form. These poems were often of a rustic or pastoral subject matter and contained refrains.
Prior to the nineteenth century, the term would have simply meant country song, with no particular form implied—a meaning it retains in the vocabulary of early music. According to Julie Kane, the refrain in each stanza indicates that the form descended from a "choral dance song" wherein a vocal soloist—frequently female—semi-improvised the "unique" lyrics of each stanza, while a ring of dancers—all female, or male and female mixed—chimed in with the repetitive words of the refrain as they danced around her in a circle."
The fixed-form villanelle, containing the nineteen-line dual-refrain, derives from Jean Passerat's poem "Villanelle (J'ay perdu ma Tourterelle)", published in 1606. The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics (1993) suggests that this became the standard "villanelle" when prosodists such as César-Pierre Richelet based their definitions of the form on that poem. This conclusion is refuted by Kane, however, who argues that it was instead Pierre-Charles Berthelin's additions to Richelet's Dictionnaire de rimes that first fixed the form, followed a century later by the poet Théodore de Banville; his creation of a parody to Passerat's "J'ay perdu ..." would lead Wilhelm Ténint and others to think that the villanelle was an antique form.
Despite its classification and origin as a French poetic form, by far the majority of villanelles have been written in English. Subsequent to the publication of Théodore de Banville's treatise on prosody "Petit traité de poésie française" (1872), the form became popularised in England through Edmund Gosse and Austin Dobson. Gosse, Dobson, Oscar Wilde, Andrew Lang and John Payne were among the first English practitioners—theirs and other works were published in Gleeson White's Ballades and Rondeaus, Chants Royal, Sestinas, Villanelles, &c. Selected (1887), which contained thirty-two English-language villanelles composed by nineteen poets.
Most modernists disdained the villanelle, which became associated with the overwrought formal aestheticism of the 1890s, i.e., the decadent movement in England. In his 1914 novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, James Joyce includes a villanelle written by his protagonist Stephen Dedalus. William Empson revived the villanelle more seriously in the 1930s, and his contemporaries and friends W. H. Auden and Dylan Thomas also picked up the form. Dylan Thomas's "Do not go gentle into that good night" is perhaps the most renowned villanelle of all. Theodore Roethke and Sylvia Plath wrote villanelles in the 1950s and 1960s, and Elizabeth Bishop wrote a particularly famous and influential villanelle, "One Art," in 1976. The villanelle reached an unprecedented level of popularity in the 1980s and 1990s with the rise of the New Formalism. Since then, many contemporary poets have written villanelles, and they have often varied the form in innovative ways; in their anthology of villanelles (Villanelles), Annie Finch and Marie-Elizabeth Mali devote a section entitled "Variations on the Villanelle" to such innovations.
Form
The villanelle consists of five stanzas of three lines (tercets) followed by a single stanza of four lines (a quatrain) for a total of nineteen lines. It is structured by two repeating rhymes and two refrains: the first line of the first stanza serves as the last line of the second and fourth stanzas, and the third line of the first stanza serves as the last line of the third and fifth stanzas. The rhyme-and-refrain pattern of the villanelle can be schematized as A1bA2 abA1 abA2 abA1 abA2 abA1A2. Here, "a" and "A" lines rhyme, and A1 and A2 indicate two different refrains which are repeated exactly.
The villanelle has no established meter, although most 19th-century villanelles have used trimeter or tetrameter and most 20th-century villanelles have used pentameter. Slight alteration of the refrain line is permissible.
Effect
With reference to the form's repetition of lines, Philip K. Jason suggests that the "villanelle is often used, and properly used, to deal with one or another degree of obsession" citing Sylvia Plath's "Mad Girl's Love Song" amongst other examples. He notes the possibility for the form to evoke, through the relationship between the repeated lines, a feeling of dislocation and a "paradigm for schizophrenia". This repetition of lines has been considered to prevent villanelles from possessing a "conventional tone" and that instead they are closer in form to a song or lyric poetry. Stephen Fry opines that the villanelle "is a form that seems to appeal to outsiders, or those who might have cause to consider themselves as such", having a "playful artifice" which suits "rueful, ironic reiteration of pain or fatalism". (In spite of this, the villanelle has also often been used for light verse, as for instance Louis Untermeyer's "Lugubrious Villanelle of Platitudes".)
On the relationship between form and content, Anne Ridler notes in an introduction to her own poem "Villanelle for the Middle of the Way" a point made by T. S. Eliot, that "to use very strict form is a help, because you concentrate on the technical difficulties of mastering the form, and allow the content of the poem a more unconscious and freer release". In an introduction to his own take on the form, entitled "Missing Dates", William Empson suggests that while the villanelle is a "very rigid form", nonetheless W. H. Auden—in his long poem The Sea and the Mirror—had "made it sound absolutely natural like the innocent girl talking".

KOIT (96.5 FM) is a commercial adult contemporary radio station licensed to San Francisco, California. The station has studios along Junipero Serra Boulevard in Daly City, and transmits from Sutro Tower in San Francisco, with a power output of 24,000 watts effective radiated power. The signal can be received throughout the Bay Area with relative ease. There is also a booster station in Martinez, California called KOIT-3 that improves the coverage in the Diablo Valley area.
KOIT is owned by Salt Lake City-based Bonneville International. From 2007 through 2017, the station was owned by Entercom. As part of its merger with CBS Radio, the company was required to divest four of its radio stations in San Francisco in order stay within ownership caps. KOIT was placed in a trust and was subsequently reacquired by Bonneville, which had owned the station from 1975 until the sale to Entercom.
KOIT broadcasts in HD.
History
The station signed on the air July 1, 1947, under the callsign KRON-FM. It was owned by the deYoung family, and was co-owned with KRON-TV and the San Francisco Chronicle newspaper. The station had a limited broadcast schedule (airing only during the evening hours). The station shut down on December 31, 1954; when it returned to the air as non-commercial station in 1957, KRON-FM began carrying an evening-only program schedule devoted to classical music. During the 1960s, KRON-FM devoted a full hour (7 to 8 p.m.) to a complete Broadway show album. Since the station had no commercials, no underwriters, and no on-air fund drives, the Chronicle operated the station as a public service. Staff announcers delivered short newscasts on the station's evening broadcasts. In December 1970, KRON-FM began simulcasting a Spanish-language newscast from KRON-TV by Terry Lowry.
In 1975, the deYoung's Chronicle Publishing Company, which was the then-parent of KRON-TV and the Chronicle, sold KRON-FM to Bonneville International, who changed the station's callsign to KOIT. On December 13, 1983, Bonneville purchased KYA (1260 AM) from KING Broadcasting, changing the call letters to KOIT with 96.5 going to KOIT-FM per FCC convention. The KYA call letters remained in service at KYA-FM (93.3, now KRZZ) and went into retirement in 1993. In 1983, KOIT was playing a lot of instrumental music, sort of like the "elevator music" that was being played at KBAY (then at 100.3 FM) in San Jose. The majority of the station's playlist consisted of instrumentals, but also contained some vocals. In late 1985, KOIT changed their music format to soft adult contemporary by dropping all instrumentals, and started playing music from the 1950's, 1960's, 1970s and 1980s. KOIT called their music "Light Rock". For the first 8 years of the adult contemporary format, the station was heavy on oldies. In 1995, KOIT updated their playlist by dropping the 1950s and 1960s songs, and added more recent and current music. As recently as 2009, KOIT was playing approximately one song from every decade in order in 3 song-sets. In 2009, KOIT started playing more recent hits from the late 2000s and early 2010s. Since 2003, KOIT has switched to Christmas Music every year, generally the Friday before Thanksgiving at 12:00 PM, and brands itself as "The Bay Area's Official Christmas Music Station."
On January 18, 2007, Bonneville announced a station swap with Entercom, with KOIT and Bonneville's other San Francisco area FM radio holdings going to Entercom in return for three of Entercom's stations in Seattle, Washington and Entercom's entire radio cluster in Cincinnati, Ohio. This trade marked Entercom's re-entry into the country's fourth largest radio market. Entercom officially took over KOIT-FM via a local marketing agreement on February 26, 2007, and Entercom and Bonneville officially closed on the deal on March 14, 2008, with KOIT and the other San Francisco FM stations formerly owned by Bonneville becoming owned by Entercom outright. KOIT's AM sister station was concurrently sold to Immaculate Heart Radio, and became KSFB in December 2007; however, KOIT-FM did not drop the "-FM" suffix until September 2010.
On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced that it would merge with Entercom. To comply with FCC ownership limits, it was announced that KOIT, along with sister stations KBLX and KUFX, CBS-owned KMVQ, and a cluster in Sacramento, would be divested. Under a local marketing agreement with the Entercom Divestiture Trust, Bonneville once again assumed operations of the station following the completion of the merger on November 17. On August 3, 2018, Bonneville announced that it would acquire all of the divested Entercom stations it had been operating for $141 million; the sale was completed on September 21, 2018.
In 2020, KOIT, along with the other Bonneville stations, moved their studios from the SoMa district in San Francisco into a newly-built studio along Junipero Serra Boulevard in Daly City.
Booster
KOIT is rebroadcast on the following FM booster:
HD Radio
On December 28, 2018, KOIT's HD2 subchannel changed their format from 1970s' hits (which moved to KUFX's HD2 subchannel) to adult album alternative, branded as "96.5 HD2". In early September 2020, the format was changed to rock, branded as "Highway 1".

Timothy Ugbedo Omaji (born 9 September 1987), better known by his stage name Timomatic, is a Nigerian-born Australian singer-songwriter and dancer. Omaji rose to fame as a contestant on So You Think You Can Dance (Australia) in 2009 and placed seventh in the competition. In 2011, he appeared as a contestant on the fifth season of Australia's Got Talent and was placed third. This led to his most recent rise in fame by sparking the now infamous Facebook page "Timomatic was robbed on Australia's Got Talent", a Facebook page dedicated to the victimisation that Tim was forced to undergo on 'Australia's Got Talent'. Later that year, Omaji signed with Sony Music Australia and released his first single, "Set It Off", in November 2011, which peaked at number two on the ARIA Singles Chart and was certified four times platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association.
Biography
Early life
Timothy Ugbedo Omaji was born in Kaduna, Nigeria, on 9 September 1987. He emigrated to Australia with his family when he was 10 months old. His father was an academic and was sent to different positions around Australia. Omaji has an older brother and sister, and a younger sister. He came from a musical family, with his father often playing guitar and the rest of his family displaying their passion for singing and dancing. At the age of nine, Omaji formed a band with his family and he was the percussionist for that band. During the intermission of their shows, Omaji would go on stage mimicking Michael Jackson's singing and dancing skills. His parents have now moved back to Nigeria. He spent part of his life in Darwin, Northern Territory where he taught a break dancing class. He left Darwin in 2003 and moved to Canberra.
At the age of 15, he was nicknamed "Timomatic" by his friends, because of his hip-hop dancing skills. He also secured a part-time position as artistic director and choreographer of dance company Kulture Break in Canberra. He represented Kulture Break in overseas performances, including the United States, China and Singapore. Timomatic finished Year 12 at Narrabundah College and then spent six months at University of Canberra before dropping out. In 2008, he attended music school JMC Academy for a year and got a diploma in entertainment, majoring in vocal training. Omaji stated: "I did this because I wanted to get my vocals and music up to scratch; that was me paying attention and focusing on my music."
2009–12: Reality shows, Welcome and Timomatic
In 2009, Omaji appeared as a finalist on the second season of So You Think You Can Dance Australia and reached the top eight. In 2010, he went on to play the role of Tyrone Jackson in the Australian version of Fame the Musical. Omaji later withdrew from his role in the musical due to a back injury. This led to him focussing more on producing music. Omaji then began writing songs with DJ Poet, the official DJ for The Black Eyed Peas. In 2011, Omaji appeared as a contestant on the fifth season of Australia's Got Talent. He chose to audition for the show to prove that he was more than just a dancer, and chose Australia's Got Talent over The X Factor because it gave him full control over what he did, from music to styling. Omaji placed third in the competition, with Jack Vidgen announced as the winner.
On 12 May 2011, Omaji released his independent debut studio album, Welcome, which he began working on during his time in Fame. "Save the Dancefloor" was released as a promotional single from the album on 1 August 2011. In October 2011, Omaji was as a supporting act for American rapper Flo Rida's Australian tour. On 17 November 2011, it was announced that Omaji had signed a recording contract with Sony Music Australia. On 24 November, he was a supporting act for American hip hop group Salt-n-Pepa's Australian concert at the Enmore Theatre in Sydney. Omaji's debut single "Set It Off" was released on 25 November. It peaked at number two on the ARIA Singles Chart and was certified four times platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association, denoting sales of 280,000 copies. "Set It Off" peaked at number 14 on the New Zealand Singles Chart and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand, denoting sales of 7,500 copies.
On 12 January 2012, it was announced that Omaji had signed a global publishing deal with EMI. His second single "If Looks Could Kill" was released on 23 March 2012. It peaked at number eight on the ARIA Singles Chart and was certified double platinum, denoting sales of 140,000 copies. In May 2012, Omaji was a supporting act for Nicki Minaj's Australian leg of her Pink Friday Tour. His third single "Can You Feel It" was released on 22 June 2012. It peaked at number 18 on the ARIA Singles Chart and was certified platinum, denoting sales of 70,000 copies. In August 2012, Omaji was a supporting act, alongside Havana Brown and Taio Cruz, for Pitbull's Australian leg of his Planet Pit World Tour. His self-titled second album was released on 24 August 2012, which debuted at number three on the ARIA Albums Chart. On 3 October 2012, Omaji received his first ARIA Music Award nomination for Song of the Year for "Set It Off". Omaji received more international exposure at the Miss Universe 2012 beauty pageant, where he performed in front of a huge global audience.
2013–2016: Subsequent releases, return to Australia's Got Talent, and name change

Brian Sodeman (born 7 April 1942) is a former Australian politician who was a Liberal Party member of the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia from 1974 to 1983, representing the seat of Pilbara.
Sodeman was born in Perth, and moved to the North West in the 1960s to work as an engineer. He was elected to parliament at the 1974 state election, defeating the sitting Labor member, Arthur Bickerton. He was the first non-Labor member for Pilbara since Frank Welsh's defeat at the 1939 election. Sodeman increased his margin slightly at the 1977 election, defeating the Labor candidate Norm Marlborough with 52.8 percent of the two-party-preferred vote. This decreased to 51.6 percent at the 1980 election, making it one of the most marginal seats in the state. However, Sodeman chose not to contest the 1983 election, retiring from politics after a little less than nine years in office. The seat of Pilbara was won by the Labor candidate, Pam Buchanan, with a large margin.

Verona station was a station on the Caldwell Branch of the Erie Railroad in Verona, New Jersey. The station was originally constructed in 1891 at the intersection of Depot Street and Personette Street by the Caldwell Railway, which was soon merged into the Erie Railroad system. The station burned down twice: the 1891 station depot burned down in 1905, and the second station survived until April 1, 1962, when arsonists destroyed it.
However, the freight station built in 1891, a one-room shed, remained standing between both burnings, and although passenger service on the Caldwell Branch ended on October 3, 1966 (and the tracks removed in 1979), the freight station in Verona is the only remaining structure left of the entire line. In 2010, the town of Verona proposed to restore the old freight shed, which stands along the right-of-way as a one-room museum. Also that year, the shed was added as the first of Verona's local landmarks by its historical commission.
History
Early starts for Verona (1891–1905)
The first station at Verona was built in 1891 as one of the original stations on the Caldwell Railway, a short branch line off the New York and Greenwood Lake Railroad. When the rail line opened on August 3, 1891, the line served Verona along with Overbrook Hospital (at that point also in Verona) and the neighboring borough of Caldwell. The service on the Caldwell Railway was taken over by the New York & Greenwood Lake in 1896, which was leased by the Erie Railroad a year later. The first station building burned down fourteen years later. The freight station nearby avoided catching fire and did remain in service. When neighboring Caldwell got a new station depot built by the Erie, a team of horses carted the old 1891 station depot through the snow to Verona and installed it as the new station. The relocated station building was a one-story wooden batten depot.
The end of the Caldwell Branch (1966–1979)
Change remained slim from 1905 to 1960 in Verona with the daily commuter services from Essex Fells to Jersey City's Pavonia Terminal. On April 1, 1962, the station depot moved from Caldwell in 1905 was burned down by arsonists. Rather than building a third station depot, the Erie Railroad, which was experiencing major financial difficulties, put up a three-sided metal shelter for commuters. Once again, the 1891 freight shed survived the passenger station catching fire. By 1962, the station saw only two commuter trains to the new terminus, Hoboken Terminal in Hoboken, New Jersey. To add to the problem, the station lost all passenger service under the new Erie-Lackawanna Railroad on September 30, 1966 after the Interstate Commerce Commission approved services could be cut on the branches losing money. After serving passengers of Cedar Grove, Verona, Caldwell and Essex Fells for 75 years, the Caldwell Branch was reduced to a costly freight service for companies in Cedar Grove and Verona.
In the summer of 1975, a major storm washed away the usability of the tracks of the Caldwell Branch, and although the New Jersey Department of Transportation was willing to put in money for a grant to get the tracks rehabilitated, a lack of interested corporations ended the investment. It ended up the branch would not be absorbed into the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) in 1975, unlike most of the Erie Lackawanna system. On April 1, 1976, the Erie Lackawanna system was absorbed into Conrail. In June 1979, the dormant tracks of the Caldwell Branch were removed from Essex Fells to Great Notch.
Freight station restoration (2010–present)
On July 12, 2010, the Verona township council named the former freight house the township's first historical landmark. There are plans by the Verona Historical Society to turn the freight house, the sole surviving structure of the Caldwell Branch, into a single room museum and possibly move the shed to a more accessible part of Verona. (The bridge over Runneymede Lane in Essex Fells was demolished in 2000). According to the historical society, the station is in good structural shape.

Currently Sparks is part of the touring band for the Japanese rock group B'z, and has also contributed to many of their albums and singles.
History
Barry Sparks first began to make a name for himself as the bass player for former MCA recording artist Guy Mann-Dude with whom he toured and recorded the 1991 "Mannic Distortion" release. This led to Sparks landing the bass gig with Swedish guitar virtuoso Yngwie Malmsteen in time for The Seventh Sign tour in 1994, followed by a 4-year on-and-off stint with German guitar legend Michael Schenker, starting with the 1996 Written in the Sand album.
In 1997, Sparks and Michael Schenker Group drummer Shane Gaalaas teamed up with guitarist Jeff Kollman to form the all-instrumental fusion trio Cosmosquad with whom Sparks recorded 3 albums before exiting. The trio also backed vocalist John West on his 1998 sophomore release, Permanent Mark. In 1998, Sparks became a touring musician with pop singer Billie Myers of "Kiss the Rain" fame, doing TV and radio station appearances and playing worldwide, including Good Morning America, Top of the Pops in England. They also supported tours with Bob Dylan in Europe, Savage Garden and many others.
In the late 1990s Sparks also guested on albums by former Loudness vocalist Michael Vescera and then Helloween guitarist Roland Grapow, toured with future UFO bandmate Vinnie Moore, and recorded and toured with ex-Scorpions guitar legend Uli Jon Roth.
In 2001, Sparks released his acoustic guitar based solo debut album, Glimmer of Hope, on his own Moonbeam Music label. A second album, Can't Look Back, with special guest appearances by ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons (on "Breathe") and Ted Nugent (on "Liberty"), followed in 2004. Sparks began working with Nugent on the "Beer Drinkers & Hell Raisers" U.S. summer tour of 2003.
In 2001, Sparks became the bass player for Dokken, an affiliation that lasted until 2010 and produced 4 studio albums. During this time, Sparks and Dokken drummer Mick Brown also played with Ted Nugent, documented on the 2008 live release Sweden Rocks.
In 2004, Sparks was called to record bass tracks for the Scorpions' Unbreakable album. That same year, Sparks filled in for one of his all-time bass heroes, Pete Way of UFO, on the Are Here U.S. tour. He last toured with the group in 2011.
After previously touring with the band in 2003 for their Big Machine album, Sparks was again recruited by Japanese superstars B'z for their 2008 "Glory Days" tour, re-teaming with his former Yngwie Malmsteen, MSG and Cosmosquad rhythm partner, drummer Shane Gaalaas. He remained a touring member through 2019 during which time he also recorded many albums and singles with the band.
In 2013, Sparks re-connected with his former Yngwie Malmsteen band mate, vocalist Mike Vescera, in Riot On Mars. The project released their debut album, First Wave, on Zain Records in Japan in 2015. Guest musicians on the album include drummers BJ Zampa and Shane Gaalaas as well as vocalist Dan McCafferty of Nazareth fame who contributes vocals on a cover of the Nazareth classic, "Beggars Day".

Spencer County is a county located in the U.S. state of Indiana. As of the 2010 census, the population was 20,952. The county seat is Rockport.
History
Spencer County was formed in 1818 from parts of Warrick County and Perry County. It was named for Captain Spier Spencer, killed at the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811. He was also the namesake for Spencer, Indiana, the county seat of Owen County.
Abraham Lincoln lived in Spencer County from 1816 to 1830, between the ages of seven and twenty-one. Originally, the area his family settled in was in Perry County with Spencer County being formed almost two years later. His family moved to Illinois in 1830. The Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial is located at the site of the Lincoln family farm. In addition, the graves of his mother Nancy Lincoln and sister Sarah Lincoln Grigsby are located in Spencer County.
On December 16, 1900, two African-American men, Bud Rowlands and Jim Henderson, were lynched by the county courthouse in Rockport after being arrested as suspects in the brutal robbery and killing of a white barber at 2 am the night before. A mob estimated at 1,500 broke open the jail and took them out, hanging them from a tree by the courthouse, and shooting their bodies numerous times. John Rolla was accused by Rowlands as a suspect and also lynched. This was the second-highest number of lynchings in the state, though it pales in comparison to lynchings in Southern states.
The current Spencer County courthouse was built in 1921. It is the fifth courthouse to serve the county.
County attractions include the town of Santa Claus, Holiday World & Splashin' Safari, and Santa's Candy Castle.
Saint Meinrad Archabbey is located at the northeastern corner of Spencer County.

The ICP Vimana is a single engine, two seats, high wing, light aircraft with STOL capability. Designed and built in Italy by ICP srl, it was introduced in 2006.
Design and development
The Vimana (Vimana is a Sanskrit word, the meanings of which include flying machine) is a conventionally arranged single engine high wing light aircraft, designed to have STOL performance. It seats two side-by-side. The Vimana is mostly constructed from riveted aluminium sheet.
The Vinama's wing is tapered, mostly on the trailing edge, and carries 2° of dihedral. On each side a single, forward leaning strut links the wing to the lower fuselage, assisted by a short intermediate strut at its wing connection. More than half the trailing edge carries inboard double slotted Fowler flaps with a maximum deflection of 40°; the rest of the trailing edge is fitted with conventional ailerons. The leading edge is fitted with electrically operated slats.
The Vimana is normally powered by a Rotax 912 ULS flat four driving a three-bladed propeller, though the Turbo version of this engine is an option. It has a standard tricycle undercarriage with faired wheels, fitted with brakes and mounted on spring cantilever legs to the fuselage at the base of the wing spar. The faired nosewheel is steerable. A lightweight version of the Vimana has smaller wheels, as well as lighter instrumentation and cabin furnishings; overall, is cut from the empty weight. Access to the cabin is via fully transparent, upward opening doors. There is a small flight accessible compartment for about 20 kg of luggage behind the seats. The underside of the fuselage tapers upwards to the tail, where all surfaces are straight-tapered. The fin and large rudder are swept, with a small fillet. The tailplane is low mounted and the separate elevators, also large, are horn balanced.
Take-off and landing runs (ground roll) are respectively. The corresponding overall distances to clear are .
The design is an accepted Federal Aviation Administration special light-sport aircraft, as the Skykits Rampage.
Operational history
The Vimana first appeared in public at the Cielo e Volo show at Ozzano in June 2006. A second machine was produced in 2007 and became the North American demonstrator, flown by Skykits of Alberta, Canada, who market the Vimana as the Rampage.
As of mid-2010, there were 5 Vimanas on European registers in addition to the prototype.

Baliapur is a community development block that forms an administrative division in Dhanbad Sadar subdivision of Dhanbad district, Jharkhand state, India.
Overview
Dhanbad district forms a part of the Chota Nagpur Plateau, but it is more of an upland than a plateau. The district has two broad physical divisions – the southern part is a coal mining area with mining and industrial towns, and the northern part has villages scattered around hills. The landscape of the southern part is undulating and monotonous, with some scars of subsidence caused by underground mining. One of the many spurs of Parashnath Hills (1,365.50 m), in neighbouring Giridih district, passes through the Topchanchi and Tundi areas of the district. The spur attains a height of 457.29 m but there is no peak as such. The Dhangi Hills (the highest peak 385.57 m) run from Pradhan Khunta to Gobindpur. While the main river Damodar flows along the southern boundary, its tributary, the Barakar, flows along the northern boundary. DVC has built two dams across the rivers. The Panchet Dam is across the Damodar and the Maithon Dam is across the Barakar.

Kengtung Township (, ; also spelled Kyaingtong, Kengtong, or Mueang Chiang Tung) is a township of Kengtung District in the Shan State of Myanmar. The principal town is Kengtung. It lies almost entirely east of the Salween River and its area is over . It is bounded on the north by the states of Mang Lon, Mong Lem and Keng Hung (Hsip Hsawng Pannh); east by the Mekong River, south by the Siamese Shan States, and west in a general way by the Salween River, though it overlaps it in some places. The state is known to the Chinese as Mhng Khng, and was frequently called by the Burmese the 32 cities of the Gn (HkOn). The classical name of the state is Khemarata or Khemarata Tungkapuri.
History
By the 14th Century Keng Tung was a sovereign state.
The present sawbwa () or "prince" received his patent from the British government on the February 9, 1897. The early history of Keng Tung is very obscure, but Burmese influence seems to have been maintained since the latter half, at any rate, of the 16th century. The Chinese made several attempts to subdue the state, and appear to have taken the capital in 1765–66, but were driven out by the united Shan and Burmese troops. The same fate seems to have attended the first Siamese invasion of 1804. The second and third Siamese invasions, in 1852 and 1854, resulted in great disaster to the invaders, though the capital was invested for a time.
Demographics
The Tai here call themselves Khün; their speech contains many variations from the western Shan, and their script is a version of the Lanna script.
Most of the Khuns would adopt Thai names and in the wats of Kengtong one would find the monks chanting their daily prayers in a similar manner as in Northern Thailand. Historically Thai rulers have laid a claim to the Kengtung area as Saharat Thai Doem, part of their old country.
The population of the state in 1901 was 190,698. In 1897-98, of the various tribes of Shans, the Hkn and Lu contribute about 36,000 each, the western Shans 32,000, the Lern and Lao Shans about 7000, and the Chinese Shans about 5000. Of the hill tribes, the Kaw or Aka are the most homogeneous with 22,000, but probably the Wa (or Vu), disguised under various tribal names, are at least equally numerous. Nominal Buddhists make up a total of 133,400, and the remainder are classed as animists. Spirit-worship is, however, very conspicuously prevalent amongst all classes even of the Shans.
Geography and Climate
Kengtung is the largest, most mountainous, most easterly, and culturally the farthest from the Burmese, of all the Shan States. Geography makes approach to it from the rest of Myanmar difficult for it lies not only beyond the Salween across which no bridge has been built and whose eastern tributaries have cut no easy routes through the serried north-south ridges of the Daen Lao Range, but nearer again to the Mekong than to the Salween.
About 63% of the area lies in the basin of the Mekong River and 37% in the Salween drainage area. The watershed is a high and generally continuous range. Some of its peaks rise to over ., and the elevation is nowhere much below . Parallel to this successive hill ranges run north and south with mountainous country predominating.
The chief rivers, tributaries of the Salween, are the Nam Hka, the Hwe Long, Nam Pu, and the Nam Hsim, the first and last being of considerable size. The Nam Hka rises in the Wa States, the Nam Hsim on the watershed range in the centre of the state. Rocks and rapids make both unnavigable, but much timber goes down the Nam Hsim. The lower part of both rivers forms the boundary of Keng Tiling state.
The chief tributaries of the Mekong are the Nam Nga, the Nam Lwe, the Nam Yawng, Nam Lin, Nam Hok and Nam Kok. Of these the chief is the Nam Lwe, which is navigable in the interior of the state, but enters the Mekong by a gorge broken up by rocks. The Nam Lin and the Nam Kok are also considerable streams. The lower course of the latter passes by Chiang Rai in Siamese territory. The lower Nam Ruak or Maenam Ruak forms the boundary with Siam.
Kengtung, the capital, is situated towards the southern end of a valley about long and with an average breadth of . The town is surrounded by a brick wall and moat about round. Only the central and northern portions are much built over. In the dry season crowds attend the market held according to Shan custom every five days, and numerous caravans come from China. The plain in which the capital stands have an altitude of .
Climate
The rainfall probably averages between 50 and for the year. The temperature seems to rise to nearly . during hot weather, falling to or less during the night. In cold weather a temperature of or a few degrees more or less appears to be the lowest experienced.
Economics
The existence of minerals was reported by the sawbwa, or chief, to Francis Garnier in 1867, but none is worked or located. Gold is washed in most of the streams. Teak forests exist in Mong Pu and Mong Hsat, and the sawbwa works them as government contracts. One-third of the price realized from the sale of the logs at Moulmein is retained as the government royalty. There are teak forests also in the Mekong drainage area in the south of the state, but there is only a local market for the timber. Rice, as elsewhere in the Shan States, is the chief crop. Next to it is sugarcane, grown both as a field crop and in gardens. Eai-th-nuts and, tobacco are the only other field crops in the valleys. On the hills, besides rice, cotton, poppy and tea are the chief crops. The tea is carelessly grown, badly prepared, and only consumed locally. A great deal of garden produce is raised in the valleys, especially near the capital. The state is rich in cattle, and exports them to the country west of the Salween. Cotton and opium are exported in large quantities, the former entirely to China, a good deal of the latter to northern Thailand, which also takes shoes and sandals. Tea is carried through westwards from Keng Hung, and silk from the Siamese Shan States. Cotton and silk weaving are dying out as industries. Large quantities of shoes and sandals are made of buffalo and bullock hide, with Chinese felt uppers. There is a good deal of pottery work. The chief work in iron is the manufacture of guns, which has been carried on for many years in certain villages of the Sam Tao district.

Pierre de Murat de Cros, O.S.B., ( 1320 – 1388) was a French monk of aristocratic origins who became a cardinal of the Avignon Obedience during the Great Schism, as well as the Archbishop of Arles and the Chamberlain of the Apostolic Camera (Latin: Camerarius Apostolicus). Refusing from the day of his election to support Bartolomeo Prignano (Pope Urban VI, the former head of the rival Apostolic Chancellery) after the Papal Conclave of 1378, de Cros played a critical role in delivering a considerable portion of the Roman Curia to the rival claimant Robert of Geneva, who took the name Clement VII. Historian Daniel Williman calls Murat de Cros's actions a "counter-coup".
Early life
Pierre was born in La Chaul in the ancient Province of Limousin. He was the son of Aymar de Murat de Cros, a nobleman of Auvergnat extraction, and of Marie de Montclar. He entered the Order of Saint Benedict in his youth, and after living in several French monasteries became Bishop of Saint-Papoul in July 1362. On 9 June 1370 he was transferred to the Metropolitan See of Bourges.
Pierre was the brother of Jean de Murat de Cros, who became the Bishop of Limoges, and both were cousins of Pope Gregory XI and thus favored by him in the administration of the Curia, after his election in 1370. Jean was named a cardinal-nephew and one of the first cardinals of Gregory XI upon his ascension to the papacy. Pierre, already the Bishop of Bourges and a staff member of the Camera, was named Papal Chamberlain that same year, succeeding the deceased Arnaud Aubert (d. 1371). In 1374, he was given the wealthy Archbishopric of Arles.
Chamberlain of the Camera
Under Gregory XI
Pierre de Cros was the "most important and powerful courtier" of the pope, and their bedchambers were joined by a secret staircase. According to Williman, "it is no exaggeration to say that his powers and functions combined those of a minister of finance, a chief justice and a secretary of state, as well as major-domo of the papal household". He accompanied Gregory XI in the last year of his reign to Anagni from 16 May to 7 November 1377, when the pope relied on him for his "most important correspondence" rather than the Chancellery. De Cros grew suspicious of the intrigues of Bartolommeo Prignano, the acting-head of the Chancellery, hearing that he was attending the meetings of the bandaresi. Senator Gui de Prohins, named as military governor of Rome by Gregory XI, was not a party to their intrigues, being loyal to the Pope.
Pierre de Cros also controlled the Apostolic Camera (established 1361), the judicial wing of the Camera, which had "absolute and final" jurisdiction over any case affecting the interests of the Camera, even if already pending in front of other ecclesiastical courts, and even if they involved issues of theology. This court was not burdened by the ordo iudiciarius, the slow and formalistic rules of the papal courts, but rather gave expedited and summary rulings.
It was in no small part due to the unwillingness of Murat to coerce the extreme taxation ordered by Gregory XI, that the pontiff found himself bankrupt by his wars against the Visconti and ultimately by the War of the Eight Saints, fought against a coalition of Italy city states led by the Republic of Florence, which instigated rebellion in the Papal States. While Gregory XI was forced to borrow from the Duke of Anjou, Murat excelled at diplomacy, convincing Bologna to relent in exchange for a lifting of the interdict.
De Cros drafted and persuaded his cousin Gregory XI to adopt Futuris peculis on March 19, modifying the laws of the papal conclave. He also persuaded Gregory XI to make Pierre Rostaing, the castellan of Castel Sant'Angelo to swear not to turn over the fortress to any papal claimant without the assent of the six cardinals remaining in the Comtat Venaissin. Fearing for his own life, he moved into the fortress and prepared it for a long siege. Rather than guarding the conclave personally (as he would later do at Fondi), Murat de Cros deputized the Bishop of Valence and Die to perform the task.
During the Western Schism
De Cros did not accept the election of Prignano as Urban VI, and sheltered in Castel Sant'Angelo a group of like-minded cardinals, which included his brother. He met the bardaresi, carrying a battleaxe and followed by a heavily armed entourage, refusing to allow him to escort the cardinals back for a papal coronation ("That fool thinks he's pope? I surely don't consider him pope"). Later in the day Murat de Cros and the other cardinals went to pay homage to Urban VI although he feigned illness to avoid the coronation. He carried on his duties as chamberlain as if Gregory XI were still in power and Urban VI did not exist, refusing to date his letters according to the latter's election.
As Chamberlain of the Camera (Camerlengo), de Cros held a curial office which was one of the few that did not expire during a sede vacante, as established by the bull Ubi periculum (1274). He persuaded the entire College of Cardinals to convene in Anagni, himself leaving Castel Sant'Angelo between 25 June and 1 July. He issued a formal summons to Prignano to appear before a cameral tribunal in Anagni, and sometime before 10 July declared him excommunicated and deprived of his Archbishopric of Bari. Also under the judicial power of the Apostolic Camera, Murat de Cros received the cardinals on 2 August, and after hearing accounts of the conclave, declared it null and void and the church to continue in sede vacante. This meeting was neither a consistory nor a conclave but a tribunal with Murat de Cros presiding as an ordinary judge.
De Cros worked to arrange a meeting of the College of Cardinals at Fondi on 20 September 1378 which elected Robert of Geneva as Clement VII. According to Williman, "de Cros used his huge discretionary powers to make himself virtually a regent or protector, a keeper of the papal power sede vacante". It was at this point that Murat de Cros appointed a new procurator and registrar for the Camera, and assisted Clement VII in turning out copious amounts of official-looking documents.
Cardinal
On 23 December 1383 Clement VII of the Avignon Obedience named him cardinal-priest of the Basilica of Santi Nereo e Achilleo. On the following day he resigned as Camerlengo, but retained the Archbishopric of Arles until January 1388. From that time he was known as Cardinalis Arelatensis, the "Cardinal of Arles". In April 1385 he was legate of Clement VII to Queen Maria of Naples in Villeneuve-lès-Avignon. He died at Avignon on 16 November 1388.
Sources
Dee Cros recounted his version of the outbreak of the Schism in Avignon to the ambassadors of John I of Castile on 30 May 1380. His deposition was edited and published by J. M. H. Albanes in his Gallia christiana novissima (1669).
Legacy
According to Williman, de Cros was instrumental in beginning the Western Schism, and creating a true split in the Western Church without precedent among the antipopes of preceding centuries, who had wielded little popular or international support:
"The Western Schism had its roots within the papal Curia. Even before there were two international obediences, or two popes, even before two legal opinions began to be argued about the validity of the April election, and before the ultramontane cardinals and Urban VI had gone to their separate summer refuges of Anagni and Tivoli, the nucleus of the Curia was split in interest and policy between two ministers, the heads of the Chancery and of the Camera, Bartolomeo Prignano and Pierre de Cros."

Warren and Char Bolthouse, founders of Family Life Radio, produced the program in a studio in the basement of their home on Jericho Road near the Kibby Road studio of WIBM. WIBM-FM had begun broadcasting in 1955, but was simulcasting WIBM-AM and had very few listeners.
Soon Warren and Char Bolthouse convinced Booth Broadcasting, the owners of WIBM, to allow them to program the station full-time. Since few people had FM radios in the mid-1960s, they agreed and Family Life Radio began programming the station from the studio in the middle of the Bolthouse basement. Listenership grew as churches in the Jackson area began to encourage their members to purchase an FM radio and tune in to the broadcasts.
As FM radio sales increased, Booth told Family Life Radio that he would resume control of the station programming. Family Life Radio looked to Mason, Michigan, half-way between Lansing and Jackson for the location of its first station. WUNN was founded in the late 1960s as a 1,000 watt daytime only AM station.
Family Life Radio began looking into the possibility of adding an FM station in the Jackson area so they could get better coverage in the area and provide programming during the night hours. Otis Meyer donated a piece of property to the station near Albion next to the I-94 freeway. A station license was purchased from WALM-FM who then built a new WALM-FM (now WBXX) on 104.9 in nearby Marshall, Michigan. Soon the tower of WUFN rose on the property and the station began operation in 1971 at 96.7 MHz from a trailer parked on the site. The trailer continued to be used until it was replaced by a Colonial style building in 1991. In December 2003 WUFN increased power from 1,500 watts to 3,200 watts. In 2005 a 36-watt translator began operating on 95.1 in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
After trying a Southern Gospel format on WUNN, it was decided to no longer provide separate programming and WUNN began simulcasting WUFN in 2006.
WUNN and WUFN were the first two stations in the Family Life Radio network that now includes 41 stations in Michigan, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida, Kansas, and California. Other Michigan stations are WUGN 99.7 MHz Midland, Michigan and WUFL 1030 kHz in Detroit. WUFN is also simulcasting on WBFN 1400 AM in Battle Creek, which is currently in Clear Channel Communications' Aloha Station Trust and is being gifted to Family Life Radio.
Translators
In addition to the main station, WUFN is relayed by an additional two translators to widen its broadcast area.
NOTE: W260BX lists WUNN-AM 1110 as its primary operating station.

The 1979 Fort Lauderdale Strikers season was part of the club's twelfth season in professional soccer.
Background
This was not the first instance of the Strikers playing indoors. Their first ever match, indoor or out, was an exhibition match played on February 27, 1977, versus their arch-rival, Tampa Bay Rowdies at the Bayfront Center. In January 1978 they played the Washington Diplomats indoors at the D.C. Armory on back-to-back days. The Strikers lost all three of these matches.
Review
In January 1979 four NASL teams participated in the Budweiser Indoor Soccer Invitational at the Bayfront Center in St. Petersburg, Florida. The teams were the Dallas Tornado, Ft. Lauderdale Strikers, Tulsa Roughnecks, and the host, Tampa Bay Rowdies. The event was held over two days. The Strikers finished the tournament in fourth place. The team wore a very basic, green and white, adidas uniform for the invitational. It was very similar to the away kit that the West German national team wore during that era, except that the Strikers's numbers on the backs were red and there was no team crest of any kind on the front of the jerseys.

The 1995 Seville City Council election, also the 1995 Seville municipal election, was held on Sunday, 28 May 1995, to elect the 5th City Council of the municipality of Seville. All 33 seats in the City Council were up for election. The election was held simultaneously with regional elections in thirteen autonomous communities and local elections all throughout Spain.
Electoral system
The City Council of Seville () was the top-tier administrative and governing body of the municipality of Seville, composed of the mayor, the government council and the elected plenary assembly. Elections to the local councils in Spain were fixed for the fourth Sunday of May every four years.
Voting for the local assembly was on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprised all nationals over 18 years of age, registered in the municipality of Seville and in full enjoyment of their political rights, as well as resident non-nationals whose country of origin allowed Spanish nationals to vote in their own elections by virtue of a treaty. Local councillors were elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with an electoral threshold of five percent of valid votes—which included blank ballots—being applied in each local council. Councillors were allocated to municipal councils based on the following scale:
The mayor was indirectly elected by the plenary assembly. A legal clause required that mayoral candidates earned the vote of an absolute majority of councillors, or else the candidate of the most-voted party in the assembly was to be automatically appointed to the post. In the event of a tie, the appointee would be determined by lot.
The electoral law allowed for parties and federations registered in the interior ministry, coalitions and groupings of electors to present lists of candidates. Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election call, whereas groupings of electors needed to secure the signature of a determined amount of the electors registered in the municipality for which they were seeking election, disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates. For the case of Seville, as its population was between 300,001 and 1,000,000, at least 5,000 signatures were required.
Opinion polls
The table below lists voting intention estimates in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first and using the dates when the survey fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication. Where the fieldwork dates are unknown, the date of publication is given instead. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed with its background shaded in the leading party's colour. If a tie ensues, this is applied to the figures with the highest percentages. The "Lead" column on the right shows the percentage-point difference between the parties with the highest percentages in a poll. When available, seat projections determined by the polling organisations are displayed below (or in place of) the percentages in a smaller font; 17 seats were required for an absolute majority in the City Council of Seville.

Winterton Dunes is an extensive dune system on the east coast of Norfolk, England, which has been designated as a National Nature Reserve of 109 ha. Winterton Dunes is within the Norfolk Coast AONB.
The site is unusual in that it shows greater ecological similarities to the dune systems of the Baltic - which support acidic plant communities - rather than the dunes on the North Norfolk Coast - where the sand is calcareous.
The site supports well developed areas of dune heath, wet 'slacks' between dunes and dune grassland which grades into grazing marsh and birch woodland.
Fauna
Natterjack toads breed in shallow pools within the site. The site, along with the adjoining Horsey Dunes, hosts the largest colonies of dark green fritillary and grayling butterflies in Norfolk. Other butterflies recorded from here in numbers include small copper and common blue.
The ponds among the dunes are home to many dragonflies including the common hawker - which is rare in Norfolk.
Winterton Dunes is also known as the first site in Britain where the southern emerald damselfly occurred (Nobes 2003).
After a count in 2014 by the RSPB they found that the dunes are the home to more than 300 pairs of the little tern making it the UK's largest colony.

A spoken language is a language produced by articulate sounds, as opposed to a written language. An oral language or vocal language is a language produced with the vocal tract, as opposed to a sign language, which is produced with the hands and face.
Definition
The term "spoken language" is sometimes used to mean only vocal languages, especially by linguists, excluding sign languages and making the terms 'spoken', 'oral', 'vocal language' synonymous. Others refer to sign language as "spoken", especially in contrast to written transcriptions of signs.
Context
In spoken language, much of a speaker's meaning is determined by the context. That contrasts with written language in which more of the meaning is provided directly by the text. In spoken language, the truth of a proposition is determined by common-sense reference to experience, but in written language, a greater emphasis is placed on logical and coherent argument. Similarly, the spoken language tends to convey subjective information, including the relationship between the speaker and the audience. (Conversation, in formal or informal settings is an example.) Written language, on the other hand, is the common mode used to convey objective information.
Both vocal and sign languages are composed of words. In vocal languages, words are made up from a limited set of vowels and consonants, and often tone. In sign languages, words are made up from a limited set of shapes, orientations, locations movements of the hands, and often facial expressions; in both cases, the building blocks are called phonemes. In both vocal and sign languages, words are grammatically and prosodically linked into phrases, clauses, and larger units of discourse.
Relation between spoken and written language
The relationship between spoken language and written language is complex. Within the fields of linguistics, the current consensus is that speech is an innate human capability, and written language is a cultural invention. However, some linguists, such as those of the Prague school, argue that written and spoken language possess distinct qualities which would argue against written language being dependent on spoken language for its existence.
Acquiring spoken language
Hearing children acquire as their first language the language that is used around them, whether vocal, cued (if they are sighted), or signed. Deaf children can do the same with Cued Speech or sign language if either visual communication system is used around them. Vocal language are traditionally taught to them in the same way that written language must be taught to hearing children. (See oralism.) Teachers give particular emphasis on spoken language with children who speak a different primary language outside of the school. For the child it is considered important, socially and educationally, to have the opportunity to understand multiple languages.

Burgdorf Castle () is a castle in the municipality of Burgdorf in the canton of Bern in Switzerland. It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance.
History
During the High Middle Ages the land that would become Burgdorf was owned by the Kingdom of Burgundy and then after 1080 by the Dukes of Zähringen. Either the kings or the dukes built a castle on the left bank of the Emme river, this castle was first mentioned in 1080 as castellum Bertoldi ducis. In 1077 and 1084, a fortification on the Emme was mentioned, but the specific castle was not named, but it may have referred to Burgdorf. In 1139 it was mentioned as the Upper Castle which implies that there was a Lower Castle nearby. In 1210 it was called castello Burgdorf.
In 1090, the Zähringens inherited the lands of Rheinfelder family when the last male heir died. In 1127, Duke Konrad of Zähringen received the Rectorate over much of Burgundy from Emperor Lothair III. With this authority, they began to accumulate lands and power. During this time the Zähringens founded a number of cities including Burgdorf. Under Duke Berthold V, in 1200, Burgdorf Castle was expanded. The old castle consisted of a gatehouse and attached wall. Berthold V added a tower, donjon and a hall that connected the two. The old market and town was north of the castle at the foot of the hill.
After the extinction of Zähringen line, Burgdorf passed to the Counts of Kyburg. Under the Kyburg or Neu-Kyburg Counts, Burgdorf Castle was the capital of the county, and the counts were the mayors of Burgdorf town. Under the Kyburgs, additional fortifications were added to the castle. The northern curtain wall was extended and two half-round towers were added. The eastern end and the western hall were built up and expanded. When the Kyburg line died out in 1264, the castle passed to Eberhard of Habsburg, who was married to Anna of Kyburg. Eberhard then became the Count of Neu-Kyburg.
In the 14th century, the Neu-Kyburgs became increasingly indebted. On 11 November 1382, Count Rudolf II of Neu-Kyburg launched a raid against the city of Solothurn to try to force the city to forgive his debts. For the city of Bern, this attack on an allied city represented an excellent opportunity for the city to break its ties with the Neu-Kyburgs. In March 1383 the Bernese-Solothurn army marched on Burgdorf. The army besieged the city for 45 days, but was unsuccessful. However, on 5 April 1384 the Neu-Kyburg counts were forced to sell the towns and castles of Burgdorf and Thun to Bern for 37,800 guilders in exchange for peace.
After the Burgdorf war, the castle became the seat of the Bernese administrator. Under the Bernese administrator, the castle was again modified. The Kyburg additions to the large hall were demolished in 1540. A new gatehouse was built on the old foundations in 1559. A small stair tower was added in 1580 to the donjon. A new wing was added east of the courtyard in 1729, which contained both apartments and a granary.
During the 1798 French invasion and the creation of the Helvetic Republic, the last Bernese administrator, Rudolf of Erlach, worried that the castle would be plundered or burned. He moved all the government records to a nearby church. The castle was spared and the documents remained safe. Under the Helvetic Republic, the castle served, first, as a military hospital. Then, in 1800, the famous educator Heinrich Pestalozzi established a school in the castle. Only four years later, the cantonal administration took over the castle and converted it into government offices. In 1886 the castle was renovated and the Castle Museum opened in the so-called Knight's Hall.

Peter Kaufmann is a Canadian businessman and former municipal politician in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. He has been a city councillor and school trustee, and has campaigned for Mayor of Winnipeg on two occasions.
Early life and career
Kaufmann was born in 1947 on the Danish island of Fejø. His father Ivan left Denmark for Sweden before World War II, because his last name was Jewish, and he feared persecution from the Nazis. His father later returned and fought against the Nazis with the Danish resistance movement. Kaufmann moved to rural Manitoba with his family in 1954, and later settled in Winnipeg. He is the founder of the local grocery franchise Kaufmann Foods, the first branch of which was set up in 1979 in St. Vital. In 1993, Kaufmann said that his intent was to provide service for areas neglected by major supermarket chains.
Trustee and councillor
Kaufmann was elected to the St. Vital school board in 1983, and served for three years before his defeat in 1986. His support for a sex-education program that was opposed by some local groups probably contributed to his loss. He was later elected to city council in the 1989 municipal election for Seine Valley. He supported efforts to keep the Winnipeg Jets hockey franchise in the city. In 1991, he brought forward a motion requiring cyclists in Winnipeg to wear helmets. His ward was eliminated for the 1992 municipal election, and he did not seek election elsewhere.
In early 1995, Kaufmann represented a group of local businessmen in their effort to build a new arena next to the Winnipeg Convention Centre, with the intent of keeping the Jets in the city. This was a rival proposal to that offered by the Manitoba Entertainment Complex (MEC). The plan was unsuccessful.
1995 mayoral campaign
Kaufmann first campaigned for Mayor of Winnipeg in the 1995 municipal election. He pledged to eliminate the business tax over ten years, shift school taxes from property to income, cut city staff and budgets, and restructure city council to dissolve the board of commissioners. He supported an apprentice program for at-risk youth and opposed the sale of Winnipeg Hydro to the private sector, although he favoured contracting out various municipal services. Kaufmann said that he would spend up to $10 million to refurbish Winnipeg's existing arena, but would not support construction of a new arena in the near future.
He also said that he would move to shut down the Winnipeg's food banks, describing them as an unfair drain on local groceries and suggesting that his pro-business platform would eliminate the need for such outlets. He later qualified this statement by indicating that he not shut down food banks immediately, and acknowledging that many Winnipeg residents depended on them.
Kaufmann described himself as an "outsider" candidate against both incumbent Susan Thompson and challenger Terry Duguid, whom he identified as the candidates of "big business" and "big unions" respectively. Kaufmann said that he was a candidate of "the people", and likened his candidacy to those of Ross Perot, Ralph Klein and Mike Harris. Some in the local media criticized his platform as simplistic, and as privileging business interests over social concerns. Generally portrayed as a right-wing candidate, Kaufmann nonetheless expressed support for some left-wing positions such as a guaranteed income. His supporters included Al Golden and John Prystanski.
Initially considered the third-ranked candidate, Kaufmann gained momentum in the campaign's final weeks and finished a surprisingly strong second behind Thompson. He remained active in municipal affairs after the election, and spoke against tax increases introduced by the Thompson administration. There was very little surprise when he decided to campaign for mayor a second time again in the 1998 municipal election.
1998 mayoral campaign
Kaufmann highlighted many of the same themes as in 1995, and was primarily focused on tax reduction. The dynamic of the contest, however, was quite different. Susan Thompson did not run for re-election, and Kaufmann's primary opponent was Glen Murray, a popular centre-left councillor who soon emerged as the frontrunning candidate. Kaufmann again highlighted his "outsider" status, and worked as his own campaign manager. Both candidates promised tax cuts and government efficiency, leading some in the media to conclude that there was little practical difference between their campaigns.
Kaufmann promised to reduce property taxes by 21.4% over five years, cut up to 2,500 city jobs, and impose user fees for some services. Unlike in the 1995 campaign, he promised to sell Winnipeg Hydro and put the revenues toward debt reduction and lower taxes. Murray argued the sale would pose long-term dangers for the city. Kaufmann, in return, argued that Murray was insincere in his pledge to reduce taxes.
Despite an endorsement from the Winnipeg Free Press newspaper, Kaufmann narrowly lost to Murray on election day. He later acknowledged that his proposal to cut municipal jobs was a mistake.
After 1998
Kaufmann turned over the day-to-day operations of Kaufmann Foods to his brother after the election, and began working for Flanders Real Estate Ltd. He later joined CB Richard Ellis Chartier & Associates. He was barred from running in the 2002 municipal election after he failed to submit an audited list of election expenses (he indicated that he had no intention of running anyway). He wrote a guest editorial for the Winnipeg Free Press in 2006, arguing that high school taxes have been responsible for Winnipeg's urban decline.
Kaufmann has recently supported left-leaning candidates for mayor. During the 2002 contest, he said that Glen Murray had done a good job and deserved to be re-elected. He later supported MaryAnn Mihychuk in a 2004 by-election, after Murray resigned to run for the House of Commons of Canada.
Kaufmann supports the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba, and was a supporter of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada until he joined the Canadian Alliance in 2000. Somewhat improbably, he has listed Margaret Thatcher and Stanley Knowles as his political heroes.

Notorious is the second book in The It Girl series, released in 2006. It was written by a ghostwriter with suggestions from Cecily von Ziegesar. Aimed toward young adults, it is a spin-off from the bestselling Gossip Girl series.
Synopsis
After a long summer, Tinsley Carmichael returns to Waverly Academy, hoping to regain her place as the "It Girl". However, she receives a rude shock when she discovers that Jenny Humphrey is living in her old room, and upon their introduction, Tinsley immediately dislikes her. Despite her hopes, her friendship with Callie Vernon and Brett Messerschmidt is no longer what it used to be.
Tinsley hears rumors about Brett and the young new teacher Eric Dalton, and decides to meet him. She seduces him almost immediately. She also starts a new "club", called Cafe Society, of which Brett and Jenny are, at first, a part of. Tinsley soon kicks Jenny out because of rumors of her and Easy Walsh, which Jenny denies, but Tinsley then confirms when she sees them sneaking around together. She also kicks Brett out, because she believes she is a traitor in siding with Jenny, and also because she enjoys taunting Brett.
Torn between a relationship with Easy and school popularity, Jenny kisses a pizza delivery boy, Angelo, at a Cafe Society meeting to fit in with the other members. Ultimately, she chooses Easy, which generates ire from Callie. However, early in the relationship Easy hears rumors about Jenny's infidelity, causing him to end the relationship before it really begins.
Callie is still having problems coping with her now-dead relationship with Easy. She suspects Jenny has feelings for him as well, and may be trying to steal him. This causes a major strain on her newly formed, tentative friendship with Jenny. Callie easily picks up her old friendship with Tinsley after a few awkward days and a couple of much-needed explanations. After Easy breaks up with Callie in favour of Jenny, she and Tinsely vow revenge on the new couple.
Brett gains a new best friend in Jenny, as well as a new enemy in her old friend Tinsley. She becomes heartbroken when Eric breaks up with her, and is furious when she finds out he is now in a relationship with Tinsley. With Easy's assistance, she takes Dalton down by getting him fired for accounts of drug possession. Eventually, she gets back with Jeremiah, her ex-boyfriend from St. Lucius, after Jenny leaves a message on his phone about how much Brett is still in love with him.
Jeremiah plays the message for Easy when they are at a Cafe Society overnight trip in Boston, and both of them leave immediately for their girls back home at Waverly.
Brandon Buchanan still has feelings for Callie and thinks he has a chance when Easy breaks up with her. However, Callie doesn't want to be with him, even if she (drunkenly) kissed him good night on the way to her dorm. He drags along to the Boston trip to keep an eye on her and she loudly and drunkenly tells him off in front of everyone.
The perpetually horny Heath Ferro gets caught with Tinsley and Callie, the three almost naked, on the balcony of their Boston hotel room by the dean of Waverly, who is in the next room over with his equally married coworker. An awkward conversation ensues, in which the dean tells the three to get back to Waverly in two hours or else.
When Callie and Tinsley arrive late, thanks to Callie's hungover vomiting attack, Dean Marymount decides to split up the girls of Dumbarton 303, moving Tinsley and her ex-best friend Brett downstairs and keeping Callie and her most hated enemy Jenny in their current room.

Caroline Carmichael McIntosh Fillmore (October 21, 1813 – August 11, 1881) was the second wife of 13th U.S. President Millard Fillmore. They were married in 1858, five years after he left office.
Life
Caroline Carmichael was born October 21, 1813, in Morristown, New Jersey, the daughter of Charles Carmichael and Temperance Blachley Carmichael. She married her first husband, widower Ezekiel C. McIntosh (1806–1855), a prosperous Troy, New York, merchant and president of the Schenectady and Troy Railroad, in November 1832. They had no children, and McIntosh's death at age 49 left her very wealthy.
She married Millard Fillmore on February 10, 1858, in Albany, New York. At the time of their marriage, Caroline required Fillmore to sign a prenuptial agreement. The couple purchased a mansion on Niagara Square in Buffalo, where they settled. They are believed to have had a happy marriage, and Caroline greatly enjoyed her newfound status as the wife of a former President, though her mental and physical health began to decline in the 1860s. Her husband's sudden death in 1874 (he had enjoyed relatively good health—especially when compared to hers—until just shortly before his fatal stroke) only succeeded in making her more infirm, eccentric, and temperamental.
In her final years she frequently changed her will, and upon her death on August 11, 1881, aged 67, suits were initiated by various members of the Fillmore family contesting her directives.
Resting place
She is buried in the Fillmore family plot at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Buffalo.

Harray (pronounced ) (; ) is a parish on Mainland, Orkney, Scotland. It has the unique distinction of being the only parish without a coastline, instead being landlocked and sitting next to a freshwater loch. Harray is surrounded by almost all the other parishes of the west mainland, extending southward from Birsay until it reaches the A965.
Harray is mostly flat and swampy, and has many mounds or 'howes' (from the Old Norse word Haugr meaning mound or hill). Excavations have revealed a burial cist in the largest mound as well as a Bronze Age building nearby.

Wang Hao (Chinese: 王皓; born 30 January 1993 in Fushun) is a Chinese football player who plays as a versatile defender, midfielder or striker for Kunshan.
Club career
Wang Hao would play for the Liaoning Whowin youth team and was promoted to train with the senior team during the 2011 league season. In the training sessions he would impress the Head coach Ma Lin who decided to promote him to the senior team. Wang Hao would officially start his professional football career when Liaoning Whowin included him in their 2012 Chinese Super League squad. He would eventually make his league debut for Liaoning on 17 March 2012 in a game against Guizhou Renhe, coming on as a substitute for Yang Xu in the 84th minute. Initially Wang started as forward within the team, however by the time he scored his first goal for the club on 11 May 2016 in a Chinese FA Cup game against Chengdu Qbao he had often been used as a utility player. His versatility would be highlighted on 3 March 2017 in a league game against Guizhou Hengfeng when the team's goalkeeper Shi Xiaotian was sent off in the 65th minute and Wang had to replace him for the remainder of the game that ended in a 1-1 draw. While Wang may have established himself as a regular within the team due to his versatility, the team was relegated at the end of the 2017 Chinese Super League. On 28 February 2020, Wang joined newly promoted Qingdao Huanghai for the start of the 2020 Chinese Super League.

Design impact measures are measures used to qualify projects for various environmental rating systems and to guide both design and regulatory decisions from beginning to end. Some systems, like the greenhouse gas inventory, are required globally for all business decisions. Some are project-specific, like the LEED point rating system which is used only for its own ratings, and its qualifications do not correspond to much beyond physical measurements. Others like the Athena life-cycle impact assessment tool attempt to add up all the kinds of measurable impacts of all parts of a building throughout its life and are quite rigorous and complex.
The general field involves tying together environmental impact assessment and environmental accounting with systems ecology, cost estimation models, and cost–benefit analysis.
Though sustainable design has existed since 2008, the number and types of methods and resources that have become available since then has grown significantly. Many of these tools are preliminary guides to thinking about the complex processes of sustainable design in projects. As designers confront the impact of construction projects on the larger scale of human interaction with the earth, the problem of sustainable physical design grows increasingly complex and difficult.
Design impact measures are often used in DPSIR indicator models. As described in following sections of this page, there are many tools which help with data collection and impact measurements; however, without a framework within which to use these metrics, it is often difficult to make sense of them. The DPSIR indicator model provides this framework, which enables the proper presentation of the indicators required for various decision making or policy making. Establishing a proper and accurate DPSIR framework for specific environmental systems is a complex task.
Simple Online Calculators
Simple online calculators allow users to estimate their individual environmental impact. The use of these calculators contribute to three main goals:
Increase awareness about individual environmental impact
Promote changes in behavior to reduce environmental impact
Facilitate discussions around sustainability
There exist various types of online calculators that assess impacts related to Materials, Energy, Greenhouse Gas, Water, Solid Waste, Ecosystem, Pollutants, and more. The generally accepted way that these online tools calculate the impacts is:
Request user input data
Use the data provided in conjunction with Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) data to generate the impact results
Compile and share the results with the user
The Energy Star building energy calculator and targeting tool is based on data from the United States International Energy Agency (US IEA) and Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS), which records long-term US nationwide energy use. Projects seeking for a Green Globes rating would use this calculator.
Another simple calculator that is available online is the "Build Carbon Neutral" calculator and, for UK users, the "Footprinter". These tools estimate a building's total carbon footprint by calculating easily visible parts, namely total surface area, building height, and ecoregion.
Design Impact Measures for Buildings
Recently, there has been a transition to focus on the environmental impacts of buildings. Green Building is described by the US EPA as "Green building is the practice of creating structures and using processes that are environmentally responsible and resource-efficient throughout a building's life-cycle from siting to design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation and deconstruction. This practice expands and complements the classical building design concerns of economy, utility, durability, and comfort.". The role of design impact measures for buildings is to assess the impacts of a building and identify opportunities for improvement. Simulation tools exist to optimize building systems. Some common impact measure categories are:
Energy Consumption
Water Consumption
Material Use
Recyclability of Materials
Air Quality
Water Quality
Land and Soil Quality
Virgin Resource Depletion
Biodiversity and Habitat Loss
Occupant and Worker Health
Longevity of Building
These metrics categories assess the impacts of buildings and allow the identification of areas for improvement. Metrics are used in Ratings Systems, Standards, and Building Codes; some common ones are:
Rating Systems
Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) - developed by the United States Green Building Council (USGBC)
Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM)
Living Building Challenge (LBC)
Passive House Institute United States (PHIUS)
SITES
WELL
Standards
American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE)
American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
ASTM International
Building Codes
International Building Code (IBC)
International Green Construction Code (IGCC)
The common strategies for success across rating systems, standards, and building codes are:
Reduce Building Demand
Harvest Site Energy
Maximize Building Efficiency and Resiliency
Optimize Building Commissioning
Optimize ongoing Operations and Maintenance
Other than the rating systems, standards, and building codes listed above, software platforms have been developed to facility the measurement, collection and aggregation, and comparison of these metrics. These platforms aid companies, within the building industry, track impact data and communicate goals and achievements. Some of these platforms are:
"Athena Eco-Calculator": this calculator is an advanced and thorough life-cycle impact assessment tool for buildings
"Arc Skoru Tool": this LEED-specific tool enables users to streamline data collection, generate impact scores, assess/improve impacts using modeling, and communicate key performance indicators
"Measurabl": this ESG platform is an easily accessible all-in-one sustainability hub that enables users to measure, manage, disclose, and act on sustainability data
Advanced Impact and Energy Analysis Tools
The United States Department of Energy (USDOE) offers a list of building energy tools for designers. While it is extensive, it may still be incomplete as new innovative tools are created. However, it contains a lot of resources for designers to begin with.
Other advanced analysis tools include:
The "Greenhouse gas protocol": this is an intergovernmental data service used by the major international bodies for organizing the greenhouse gas data and reporting requirements. The protocols are organized by industry.
The "EcoFootprint": this is a method of measuring a building's total use of productive land, or its ecological footprint. It uses data from studies indicating that human burden on renewable resources is significantly greater than the Earth's regenerative capacities. The results may not measure uncertainty, but it offers a comparable dimension
Recently, existing and emerging design and engineering software packages are also incorporating energy impact tools and climate modeling tools into their software. Many of them rely on the move to Building information modeling (BIM) data models that allow many consultants to work on the same building or urban design scheme at once.

knls, Kibera Community Library is one of the 64 branches in the Kenya National Library Service network, it is located in Kibera which is one of the biggest impoverished settlements in Nairobi, Kenya. It is home to an estimated one million people covering an area of 2.5 square kilometres. The library was set up in 2012 by the Kenya National Library Service (knls) in partnership with Practical Action (an NGO) and Berkley Foundation (UK). Kibera Community Library is surrounded by over 25 primary schools, 4 secondary schools and a tertiary college.
The Library, which receives over 500 visitors daily, is an invaluable resource for schools when it comes to implementing the Social Pillars of the Kenya. One of the key projects offered by the Kibera Community Library is “Kids on the Tab” project which was started in 2012. The main objective of the project was to meet and stimulate the desire for education among the younger population of the slum area and to match opportunities for children from poor families to interact with technology to advance their learning and improve school performance. The library also often holds reading campaigns for children within the slum area.

Tactics is a board wargame published in 1954. Primitive by modern standards, it was nonetheless the birth of modern wargaming for the commercial market, and generally credited as being the first commercially successful printed (ie. board) wargame.
History
Tactics was designed by Charles S. Roberts in 1953, and self-published in 1954 under the company name of The Avalon Game Company. Roberts sold the game on a mail order basis from his home in Catonsville (outside Baltimore) for the next six years, selling 2,000 copies and barely breaking even. The design was similar to other wargames published in England and elsewhere over the previous half-century. It was unique as a self-contained printed product for the commercial market not requiring miniatures or building a map.
Tactics II is a revised version published by Avalon Hill in 1958, then reissued in 1961 and 1973. It is nearly identical in all respects, albeit with a slightly revised map and more detailed unit counters. In 1972, the game was discontinued due to rising costs, but was redesigned in 1973 with less costly components and used as a loss leader as it was an introductory wargame. In 1983, Avalon Hill released a 25th anniversary edition of the original Tactics, although with a different (new) map.
Play
Tactics pioneered many game mechanics which became standard in the board wargame industry, including the odds-ratio combat results table and variable movement costs for entering squares (later hexes) containing different types of terrain. It also evolved the use of cardboard counters which had been previously introduced with the 1911 "invasion literature" genre game War Tactics or Can Great Britain Be Invaded?. Pieces include the armored units, headquarters units, regular infantry units, and specialized units consisting of mountaineers, paratroopers, and amphibious units.
Reception
In his 1977 book The Comprehensive Guide to Board Wargaming, Nicholas Palmer called Tactics II a "Respectable but dull abstract introductory game [...] readers of this book looking for an easy starting game would probably enjoy a simulation of an actual battle more."

Jalal Chandio () was a Sindhi folk singer. He was born in 1944 in the village of Harpal Jo Hat, near Phul Naushahro Feroze District. He was the only expert of yaktara & chapri at the time, and his singing style made him popular among Sindh and all of Pakistan. He died on 10 January 2001 due to kidney failure.
Early life
Jalal Chandio was born to Haji Faiz Muhammad Chandio, who owned a large number of cattle. Jalal Chandio was not interested in academics and thus remained a shepherd during his younger days.
Singing career
Chandio was fond of singing since childhood, but his parents sent him to the village of Nawan Jatoi to learn the profession of tailoring instead. Disheartened, he left tailoring to start singing. His teacher was Fakir Ali Gul Mahar, who accompanied Chandio to almost all of his singing concerts. In 1973, Chandio began solo performances after receiving permission from his mentor.
He was an expert of yaktara & chapri (musical instruments). His singing style made him popular among his fans. He promoted the yaktara and chapri in Pakistani folk music.
Jalal Chandio (movie)
A film Jalal Chandio was made in his lifetime in which Chandio played his own character.
Credits
It is believed that Jalal Chandio released a thousand audio cassettes as well as ten thousand songs during his lifetime. Since he was unschooled, he would often memorize his own songs. He was known as the king of Sindhi singers because he promoted Sindhi songs worldwide when media was not common. He had possessed enormous qualities and most importantly generosity. It was reported that he gave his buffalo to an old lady whose buffalo was stolen.
Spiritual affiliation
Chandio was a spiritual disciple of Mahdi Shah of Shahpur Jehanian. He used to sing on Urs for almost all the saints out of his fondness for them.
He had an affiliation with the famous Sindhi Poet Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai and therefore he performed on his many of his urs.
Awards
He received several awards in his country and beyond. In 1999, the provincial Government of Sindh's Department of Culture and Tourism recognized Jalal's contribution to singing and awarded him the 'Latif Award'. Among the many awards that Jalal received, one came from the local Sindhi music maestro Ustad Manzoor Ali Khan, for his dedication to the profession.
Death
During the beginning of 2000, Chandio became ill due to kidney failure and was admitted to Liaqat National Hospital Karachi before being discargched after one month of treatment. During his admission to the hospital, the then Culture Secretary Hameed Akhond supported him and provided a TV for watching cricket in his hospital room. In December 2000, he felt pain again in his kidney and was shifted to Hyderabad and then later to SIUT Karachi for proper medical treatment. Doctors advised that he was suffering last stage kidney failure and that he needed blood on a daily basis. He died on 10 January 2001 at about 1030 hours at SIUT Karachi.

The cone-shape distribution function, also known as the Zhao–Atlas–Marks time-frequency distribution, (acronymized as the ZAM distribution or ZAMD), is one of the members of Cohen's class distribution function. It was first proposed by Yunxin Zhao, Les E. Atlas, and Robert J. Marks II in 1990. The distribution's name stems from the twin cone shape of the distribution's kernel function on the plane. The advantage of the cone kernel function is that it can completely remove the cross-term between two components having the same center frequency. Cross-term results from components with the same time center, however, cannot be completely removed by the cone-shaped kernel.
Mathematical definition
The definition of the cone-shape distribution function is:
where
and the kernel function is
The kernel function in domain is defined as:
Following are the magnitude distribution of the kernel function in domain.
Following are the magnitude distribution of the kernel function in domain with different values.
As is seen in the figure above, a properly chosen kernel of cone-shape distribution function can filter out the interference on the axis in the domain, or the ambiguity domain. Therefore, unlike the Choi-Williams distribution function, the cone-shape distribution function can effectively reduce the cross-term results from two component with same center frequency. However, the cross-terms on the axis are still preserved.
The cone-shape distribution function is in the MATLAB Time-Frequency Toolbox and National Instruments' LabVIEW Tools for Time-Frequency, Time-Series, and Wavelet Analysis

The Browne Medals (also known as the Sir William Browne's Medals) are gold medals which since 1774 have been awarded for annual competitions in Latin and Greek poetry at the University of Cambridge.
Sir William Browne, who had been president of the College of Physicians, died in 1774. His will left an endowment to the university:
The endowment, invested as a trust fund called the Browne Fund, is still used to encourage classical study at the university.
List of winners
This list is incomplete. Many of the earlier names of this list have been drawn from Classical Turns. The winners of the prize are published in the Cambridge University Reporter.

Windmill Hill is an area of Gravesend, Kent. It is named for its erstwhile windmills, offers extensive views across the Thames, and was a popular spot for Victorian visitors to the town, because of the Camera obscura installed in the old mill and for its tea gardens and other amusements. The hill was the site of a beacon in 1377, which was instituted by Richard II, and still in use 200 years later at the time of the Spanish Armada, although the hill was then known as "Rouge Hill". A modern beacon was erected and lit, by then-Mayor Peter Hart, during 1988, for the 400th anniversary of the defeat of the Spanish Armada.
During the reign of Elizabeth I the first windmill was placed on top the highest point in Gravesend, 179 ft (55 m) above the high watermark of the river. One mill burnt down in 1763, but was replaced the following year and was demolished, having become derelict, in 1894 - the last surviving windmill on the hill. The adjacent public house was destroyed by fire during Mafeking Night celebrations in 1900.
In August 1606 King James, Anne of Denmark, her brother Christian IV of Denmark, and Prince Henry came to Upnor Castle. They had dinner aboard the Elizabeth Jonas. After dinner they took coaches to Windmill Hill to watch naval cannon salutes.
During World War I a German airship passed over Windmill Hill and dropped bombs on it. Today there are three markers indicating where these bombs struck.
Windmill Hill is one of Graveshams 24 conservation areas. The 'Windmill Hill Association' looks after matters related to the area and holds regular meetings to discuss local issues.

Léonard De Cuyper (1 January 1813 – 18 February 1870) was a Belgian sculptor.
Biography
De Cuyper, the youngest brother of three sculptors, was born in Antwerp on 1 January 1813. He was a student of his brother Jean-Baptiste De Cuyper. He continued his studies at the Academy in Antwerp. He was a sculptor at the Russian Court for some time. Back in Belgium, he had the Cuypershof residence with a detached studio built in Klein-Antwerpen (the house was demolished in 1928 and replaced by a new building. Today Résidence Isabelle stands there). In 1854 the Kunstverbond was founded under Cuypers' leadership, which was later also called the Nederlandsch Kunstverbond to distinguish it from the French-speaking Cercle Artistique.

Hornets (insects in the genus Vespa) are the largest of the eusocial wasps, and are similar in appearance to their close relatives yellowjackets. Some species can reach up to in length. They are distinguished from other vespine wasps by the relatively large top margin of the head. Worldwide, 22 species of Vespa are recognized. Most species only occur in the tropics of Asia, though the European hornet (V. crabro), is widely distributed throughout Europe, Russia, North America, and north-eastern Asia. Wasps native to North America in the genus Dolichovespula are commonly referred to as hornets (e.g., baldfaced hornets), but are actually yellowjackets.
Like other social wasps, hornets build communal nests by chewing wood to make a papery pulp. Each nest has one queen, which lays eggs and is attended by workers that, while genetically female, cannot lay fertile eggs. Most species make exposed nests in trees and shrubs, but some (such as Vespa orientalis) build their nests underground or in other cavities. In the tropics, these nests may last year-round, but in temperate areas, the nest dies over the winter, with lone queens hibernating in leaf litter or other insulative material until the spring. Male hornets are docile and do not have stingers.
Hornets are often considered pests, as they aggressively guard their nesting sites when threatened and their stings can be more dangerous than those of bees.
Classification
While taxonomically well defined, some confusion may remain about the differences between hornets and other wasps of the family Vespidae, specifically the yellowjackets, which are members of the same subfamily. Also, a related genus of Asian nocturnal vespines, Provespa, is referred to as "night wasps" or "night hornets", though they are not true hornets.
Some other large wasps are sometimes referred to as hornets, most notably the bald-faced hornet (Dolichovespula maculata) found in North America. It is set apart by its black and ivory coloration. The name "hornet" is used for this species primarily because of its habit of making aerial nests (similar to some of the true hornets) rather than subterranean nests. Another example is the Australian hornet (Abispa ephippium), which is actually a species of potter wasp.
Distribution
Hornets are found mainly in the Northern Hemisphere. The common European hornet (V. crabro) is the best-known species, widely distributed in Europe (but is never found north of the 63rd parallel), Ukraine, and European Russia (except in extreme northern areas). In the east, the species' distribution area stretches over the Ural Mountains to western Siberia (found in the vicinity of Khanty-Mansiysk). In Asia, the common European hornet is found in southern Siberia, as well as in eastern China. The common European hornet was accidentally introduced to eastern North America about the middle of the 19th century and has lived there since at about the same latitudes as in Europe. However, it has never been found in western North America.
The Asian giant hornet (V. mandarinia) lives in the Primorsky Krai, Khabarovsky Krai (southern part), and Jewish AO regions of Russia, and China, Korea, Taiwan, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Indochina, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, but is most commonly found in the mountains of Japan, where they are commonly known as the giant sparrow bee.
The Oriental hornet (V. orientalis) occurs in semidry, subtropical areas of central Asia (Armenia, Dagestan in Russia, Iran, Afghanistan, Oman, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrghyzstan, southern Kazakhstan), and southern Europe (Italy, Malta, Albania, Romania, Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, Cyprus).
The Asian hornet (V. velutina) has been introduced to France, Spain, Portugal, and Italy.
Stings
Hornets have stingers used to kill prey and defend nests. Hornet stings are more painful to humans than typical wasp stings because hornet venom contains a large amount (5%) of acetylcholine. Individual hornets can sting repeatedly; unlike honey bees, hornets do not die after stinging because their stingers are very finely barbed (only visible under high magnification) and can easily be withdrawn, so are not pulled out of their bodies when disengaging.
The toxicity of hornet stings varies according to hornet species; some deliver just a typical insect sting, while others are among the most venomous known insects. Single hornet stings are not in themselves fatal, except sometimes to allergic victims. Multiple stings by hornets (other than V. crabro) may be fatal because of highly toxic species-specific components of their venom.
The stings of the Asian giant hornet (V. mandarinia) are among the most venomous known, and are thought to cause 30–50 human deaths annually in Japan. Between July and September 2013, hornet stings caused the death of 42 people in China. Asian giant hornet's venom can cause allergic reactions and multiple organ failure leading to death, though dialysis can be used to remove the toxins from the bloodstream.
People who are allergic to wasp venom may also be allergic to hornet stings. Allergic reactions are commonly treated with epinephrine (adrenaline) injection using a device such as an epinephrine autoinjector, with prompt follow-up treatment in a hospital. In severe cases, allergic individuals may go into anaphylactic shock and die unless treated promptly. In general, Vespa stings induce the release of histamine due to the various mastoparans that they contain. However V. orientalis mastoparan is the interesting exception because it does not induce histamine increase in victim tissue - because it does not cause mast cell degranulation - and is not immunogenic.
Attack pheromone
Hornets, like many social wasps, can mobilize the entire nest to sting in defense, which is highly dangerous to humans and other animals. The attack pheromone is released in case of threat to the nest. In the case of the Asian giant hornet (V. mandarinia), this is also used to mobilize many workers at once when attacking colonies of their prey, honey bees and other Vespa species. Three biologically active chemicals, 2-pentanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, and 1-methylbutyl 3-methylbutanoate, have been identified for this species. In field tests, 2-pentanol alone triggered mild alarm and defensive behavior, but adding the other two compounds increased aggressiveness in a synergistic effect. In the European hornet (V. crabro) the major compound of the alarm pheromone is 2-methyl-3-butene-2-ol.
If a hornet is killed near a nest, it may release pheromones that can cause the other hornets to attack. Materials that come into contact with these pheromones, such as clothes, skin, and dead prey or hornets, can also trigger an attack, as can certain food flavorings, such as banana and apple flavorings, and fragrances that contain C5 alcohols and C10 esters.
Life cycle
In V. crabro, the nest is founded in spring by a fertilized female known as the queen. She generally selects sheltered places such as dark, hollow tree trunks. She first builds a series of cells (up to 50) out of chewed tree bark. The cells are arranged in horizontal layers named combs, each cell being vertical and closed at the top. An egg is then laid in each cell. After 5–8 days, the egg hatches. Over the following two weeks, the larva progresses through five stages of development. During this time, the queen feeds it a protein-rich diet of insects. Then, the larva spins a silk cap over the cell's opening, and during the next two weeks, transforms into an adult, a process called metamorphosis. The adult then eats its way through the silk cap. This first generation of workers, invariably females, now gradually undertakes all the tasks formerly carried out by the queen (foraging, nest building, taking care of the brood, etc.) with the exception of egg-laying, which remains exclusive to the queen.
As the colony size grows, new combs are added, and an envelope is built around the cell layers until the nest is entirely covered, with the exception of an entry hole. To be able to build cells in total darkness, they apparently use gravity to aid them. At the peak of its population, which occurs in late summer, the colony can reach a size of 700 workers.
At this time, the queen starts producing the first reproductive individuals. Fertilized eggs develop into females (called "gynes" by entomologists), and unfertilized ones develop into males (sometimes called "drones" as with honeybee drones). Adult males do not participate in nest maintenance, foraging, or caretaking of the larvae. In early to mid-autumn, they leave the nest and mate during "nuptial flights".
Other temperate species (e.g., the yellow hornet, V. simillima, or the Oriental hornet, V. orientalis) have similar cycles. In the case of tropical species (e.g., V. tropica), life histories may well differ, and in species with both tropical and temperate distributions (such as the Asian giant hornet, V. mandarinia), the cycle likely depends on latitude.
Diet and feeding
Adult hornets and their relatives (e.g., yellowjackets) feed themselves with nectar and sugar-rich plant foods. Thus, they can often be found feeding on the sap of oak trees, rotting sweet fruits, honey, and any sugar-containing foodstuffs. Hornets frequently fly into orchards to feed on overripe fruit, and tend to gnaw a hole in fruit to become totally immersed in its pulp. A person who accidentally picks fruit with a feeding hornet can be attacked by the disturbed insect.
The adults also attack various insects, which they kill with stings and jaws. Due to their size and the power of their venom, hornets are able to kill large insects such as honey bees, grasshoppers, locusts, and katydids without difficulty. The victim is fully masticated and then fed to the larvae developing in the nest, rather than consumed by the adult hornets. Given that some of their prey are considered pests, hornets may be considered beneficial under some circumstances.
The larvae of hornets produce a sweet secretion containing sugars and amino acids that is consumed by the workers and queens.
Predatory strategies
Hornets' ability to prey upon honey bees is favored by a number of adaptations. Vespa has a larger body size compared to their prey, a heavy exoskeleton to resist bee attacks, and strong mandibles and venomous sting. As concerns hornet hunting strategies, it has been demonstrated that some species such as V. tropica and V. velutina, can use both visual and olfactory cues for the long-range detection of honey bee colonies. Foragers of V. tropica can readily associate color and shape with potential food sources and exhibit color generalization. V. velutina foragers visually distinguish between bee dummy bait and cotton ball dummy bait, both treated with bee odors, preferring bee dummies. Foraging hornets are also selectively attracted to honey bee colony odors, in particular honey and pollen, as well as honey bee pheromones, which may signal a high prey density. In laboratory assays, workers of V. velutina oriented especially towards geraniol, a component of the honey bee worker aggregation pheromone, that could therefore represent an honest signal for hornets. Behavioral, chemical and electrophysiological analyses have also demonstrated that Vespa bicolor is attracted to (Z)-11-eicosen-1-ol, which is major compound in the alarm pheromones of both Asian (Apis cerana) and European (Apis mellifera) honey bees, and its antennae respond to this compound. Intriguingly, this hornet attraction to honey bee pheromone is also exploited by the orchid Dendrobium christyanum, which mimics the honey bee alarm pheromone in its flowers' scent to attract hornets that visit and pollinate the flowers. It is therefore likely that bee-hunting hornets visit the non-rewarding flowers in search of prey.

While a history of recognizing subspecies exists within many of the Vespa species, the most recent taxonomic revision of the genus treats all subspecific names in the genus Vespa as synonyms, effectively relegating them to no more than informal names for regional color forms.

Controversy
In 2018, former Vice Principal Jennifer Cho of Carlmont High School was investigated by the district for inappropriate relationships with male students. During this investigation, spurred by a Change.org petition signed by thousands of Carlmont High School students, Cho was placed on administrative leave before being relocated elsewhere in the district.
On August 3, 2020, the Sequoia District Teachers Association announced a vote of no-confidence in Sequoia Union High School District Superintendent Mary Streshly's leadership, and asked for her removal from office. In the letter, teachers and administrators accused Streshly of mishandling the district's Covid-19 response. Along with this, it cited her inability to make and communicate plans and her dismissal of racial tensions in the district. The resolution received 200 staff signatures in the first 24 hours and 300 in total, accounting for roughly 60% of the union staff. In September of 2020, Streshly resigned from her post and was succeeded by Crystal Leach who served as interim superintendent for the remainder of the school year while the district searched for a replacement.

Passive transport is a type of membrane transport that does not require energy to move substances across cell membranes. Instead of using cellular energy, like active transport, passive transport relies on the second law of thermodynamics to drive the movement of substances across cell membranes. Fundamentally, substances follow Fick's first law, and move from an area of high concentration to one of low concentration because this movement increases the entropy of the overall system. The rate of passive transport depends on the permeability of the cell membrane, which, in turn, depends on the organization and characteristics of the membrane lipids and proteins. The four main kinds of passive transport are simple diffusion, facilitated diffusion, filtration, and/or osmosis.
Passive transport follows Fick's first law and the second law of thermodynamics.
Diffusion
Diffusion is the net movement of material from an area of high concentration to an area with lower concentration. The difference of concentration between the two areas is often termed as the concentration gradient, and diffusion will continue until this gradient has been eliminated. Since diffusion moves materials from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration, it is described as moving solutes "down the concentration gradient" (compared with active transport, which often moves material from area of low concentration to area of higher concentration, and therefore referred to as moving the material "against the concentration gradient").
However, in many cases (e.g. passive drug transport) the driving force of passive transport can not be simplified to the concentration gradient. If there are different solutions at the two sides of the membrane with different equilibrium solubility of the drug, the difference in the degree of saturation is the driving force of passive membrane transport. It is also true for supersaturated solutions which are more and more important owing to the spreading of the application of amorphous solid dispersions for drug bioavailability enhancement.
Simple diffusion and osmosis are in some ways similar. Simple diffusion is the passive movement of solute from a high concentration to a lower concentration until the concentration of the solute is uniform throughout and reaches equilibrium. Osmosis is much like simple diffusion but it specifically describes the movement of water (not the solute) across a selectively permeable membrane until there is an equal concentration of water and solute on both sides of the membrane. Simple diffusion and osmosis are both forms of passive transport and require none of the cell's ATP energy.
Example of diffusion: Gas Exchange
A biological example of diffusion is the gas exchange that occurs during respiration within the human body. Upon inhalation, oxygen is brought into the lungs and quickly diffuses across the membrane of alveoli and enters the circulatory system by diffusing across the membrane of the pulmonary capillaries. Simultaneously, carbon dioxide moves in the opposite direction, diffusing across the membrane of the capillaries and entering into the alveoli, where it can be exhaled. The process of moving oxygen into the cells, and carbon dioxide out, occurs because of the concentration gradient of these substances, each moving away from their respective areas of higher concentration toward areas of lower concentration. Cellular respiration is the cause of the low concentration of oxygen and high concentration of carbon dioxide within the blood which creates the concentration gradient. Because the gasses are small and uncharged, they are able to pass directly through the cell membrane without any special membrane proteins. No energy is required because the movement of the gasses follows Fick's first law and the second law of thermodynamics.
Facilitated diffusion
Facilitated diffusion, also called carrier-mediated osmosis, is the movement of molecules across the cell membrane via special transport proteins that are embedded in the plasma membrane by actively taking up or excluding ions. Active transport of protons by H+ ATPases alters membrane potential allowing for facilitated passive transport of particular ions such as potassium down their charge gradient through high affinity transporters and channels.
Example of facilitated diffusion: GLUT2
An example of facilitated diffusion is when glucose is absorbed into cells through Glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) in the human body. There are many other types of glucose transport proteins, some that do require energy, and are therefore not examples of passive transport. Since glucose is a large molecule, it requires a specific channel to facilitate its entry across plasma membranes and into cells. When diffusing into a cell through GLUT2, the driving force that moves glucose into the cell is still the concentration gradient. The main difference between simple diffusion and facilitated diffusion is that facilitated diffusion requires a transport protein to 'facilitate' or assist the substance through the membrane. After a meal, the cell is signaled to move GLUT2 into membranes of the cells lining the intestines called enterocytes. With GLUT2 in place after a meal and the relative high concentration of glucose outside of these cells as compared to within them, the concentration gradient drives glucose across the cell membrane through GLUT2.
Filtration
Filtration is movement of water and solute molecules across the cell membrane due to hydrostatic pressure generated by the cardiovascular system. Depending on the size of the membrane pores, only solutes of a certain size may pass through it. For example, the membrane pores of the Bowman's capsule in the kidneys are very small, and only albumins, the smallest of the proteins, have any chance of being filtered through. On the other hand, the membrane pores of liver cells are extremely large, but not forgetting cells are extremely small to allow a variety of solutes to pass through and be metabolized.
Osmosis
Osmosis is the movement of water molecules across a selectively permeable membrane. The net movement of water molecules through a partially permeable membrane from a solution of high water potential to an area of low water potential. A cell with a less negative water potential will draw in water but this depends on other factors as well such as solute potential (pressure in the cell e.g. solute molecules) and pressure potential (external pressure e.g. cell wall). There are three types of Osmosis solutions: the isotonic solution, hypotonic solution, and hypertonic solution. Isotonic solution is when the extracellular solute concentration is balanced with the concentration inside the cell. In the Isotonic solution, the water molecules still move between the solutions, but the rates are the same from both directions, thus the water movement is balanced between the inside of the cell and the outside of the cell. A hypotonic solution is when the solute concentration outside the cell is lower than the concentration inside the cell. In hypotonic solutions, the water moves into the cell, down its concentration gradient (from higher to lower water concentrations). That can cause the cell to swell. Cells that don't have a cell wall, such as animal cells, could burst in this solution. A hypertonic solution is when the solute concentration is higher (think of hyper - as high) than the concentration inside the cell. In hypertonic solution, the water will move out, causing the cell to shrink.

William Albert Amiet (3 June 1890 – 13 April 1959) was an Australian writer and barrister.
Amiet was born at Murgheboluc near Geelong to farmer Edward William Amiet and Mary Ann, née Begley. He attended state school before studying at the University of Melbourne, from which he received a Bachelor of Arts in 1911 and a Master of Arts in 1913. He settled in Queensland, organising concerts by the Young Men's Christian Association for railway workers and teaching at Maryborough Grammar School, Queensland. In 1915 he moved to Brisbane, and having acquired legal qualifications became a barrister in 1915. He enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 2 May 1916 and set sail for England in October, seeing active service in France from June 1917. Commissioned on 1 August 1918, he was wounded at Bellicourt in October and mentioned in despatches.
After the war Amiet studied at King's College London for a short time before he returned to Brisbane on the termination of his appointment on 30 December 1919. On 17 December 1923 he married Agnes May Hurley at Mackay, where he was in a legal partnership with Vincent Macrossan. He ran unsuccessfully for Herbert as a Nationalist in the 1929 federal election. He wrote sporadically for the Mackay Daily Mercury for many years and in 1932 published Literature by Languages: A Roll Call, a survey of world literature. His later publications included A Shakespeare or Two (1935), The Practice of Literary History (1936), Courses in Literary History (1938), Scrambled Scrutinies (1949), and Metrical Diversions of a Sexagenarian (1952). Amiet's diverse interests included astronomy and Australian literature. He opposed the White Australia policy during the 1930s and gave his support to recruitment drives during World War II. An agnostic, he died in 1959 at Mater Hospital, Mackay, of cardiorenal failure. The Amiet Memorial Library in Mackay is named for him.

Confucius Temple is a 7,081-foot-elevation (2,158 meter) summit located in the Grand Canyon, in Coconino County of northern Arizona, US. It is situated 1.5 mile southeast of Point Sublime, four miles west-northwest of Shiva Temple, and three miles northwest of Tower of Ra, where it rises over 3,200 feet (1,130 meters) above Hindu Amphitheater. Confucius Temple is named for Confucius (551–479 BC), the Chinese philosopher. This name was applied by Clarence Dutton, who began the tradition of naming geographical features in the Grand Canyon after mythological deities. Confucius Temple is one of the Twin Buttes in the Grand Canyon, the other being Mencius Temple (7,001 ft), which is named for Mencius, considered the second-most famous sage, after only Confucius himself. This mountain's name was officially adopted in 1906 by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. According to the Köppen climate classification system, Confucius Temple has a Cold semi-arid climate.
Geology
The top cupola of Confucius Temple is composed of the basal layer of Permian Kaibab Limestone, upon a similar-thickness unit of slope-forming Toroweap Formation, overlaying cream-colored, cliff-forming, Permian Coconino Sandstone. The sandstone, which is the third-youngest of the strata in the Grand Canyon, was deposited 265 million years ago as sand dunes. Below the Coconino Sandstone is reddish, slope-forming, Permian Hermit Formation, which in turn overlays the Pennsylvanian-Permian Supai Group. Further down are strata of the conspicuous cliff-forming Mississippian Redwall Limestone, the Cambrian Tonto Group, and finally granite of the Paleoproterozoic Vishnu Basement Rocks at Colorado River level. Precipitation runoff from Confucius Temple drains west to Tuna Creek, and east to Crystal Creek, both north tributaries of the Colorado River.

Jason Allen Fowler (born January 21, 1971) is an American Christian musician, who plays a Christian pop, Christian rock and Christian country style of contemporary worship and gospel music. He has released two studio albums, Letters from the Inside (2014) and I Fall In (2016).
Early and personal life
Fowler was born, Jason Allen Fowler, on January 21, 1971, in Atlanta, Georgia, to parents Terrel and Jeanne Fowler, where he was raised with a younger brother, Chad, while he was born exactly a year later than Fowler, and he has a younger sister, Cara. His wife is Tiffany, and together they have three sons. Jason has been a recovering alcoholic and drug addict since checking himself into a Christian-based rehab facility in 2005. He became a Christian and now travels all over singing his songs and telling his story of redemption through the gift of music.
Music career
Jason has been playing music most of his life and landed a record deal with his band Ultraphonic in 2001. After recording their label debut at the legendary Muscle Shoals Sound with Producer Johnny Sandlin (Allman Brothers Band), the band was set for stardom. With an album ready to go, the band had some unfortunate news. The record label was sold to another company and the album was shelved. Fowler found himself lost and broken. The label dreams were falling apart, the band was falling apart, and he was falling apart. With addiction and alcohol driving the train, Jason ended up a train wreck and eventually homeless. After being kicked out of a drug dealers house with nowhere else to go, Fowler found himself at the bottom. This is where everything changed. It's where he changed. Jason cried out for help. This is where he found God...at the end of himself. After almost 2 years of rehab in the Georgia Music City of Athens, Jason came home and started a new life. It took more than three years for Jason to start playing music again, but he couldn't hide the fact that the music was in his blood. Jason started writing songs about his recovery and his new found faith. His Christian music recording career started in 2014, with his first studio album, Letters from the Inside, on May 13, 2014, from Black Cat Studios. He released his second album, I Fall In, on May 13, 2016, with RCity Records.
Jason is currently finishing up his third solo album with Grammy Nominated and Dove Award-winning producer Ian Eskelin expected to release late 2021.

Garrison was a post-hardcore/punk band based in Boston, Massachusetts from 1996-2004. Their sound was largely influenced by early post-hardcore, most notably Drive Like Jehu, and also incorporated components of post punk, shoegaze, and emo. In their eight years, Garrison released two full-length albums, both on Revelation Records, and three EPs, two split EPs, and one early single released as a 7" vinyl record.
History
Ed McNamara and Joe Grillo began songwriting for what would become Garrison in 1996, recruiting drummer Guy D'Annolfo to record a three song demo cassette recorded with Kurt Ballou. Ed, Joe, and future bass player Andy White were involved in the Worcester Artists Group/The Space with additional connections made between Andy and Joe by the lovely smelling Kurt Ballou, resulting in Andy joining Garrison in 1998. The initial group of Ed, Joe, Guy, and Andy began rehearsing and songwriting at The Space, released an initial 7" on Espo Records, and toured extensively in the US. They signed with Revelation Records and recorded The Bend Before The Break with Brian McTernan at Fort Apache in Boston, MA. Following the release of the Bend Before the Break, Garrison again toured extensively throughout the US while working on their first full length, A Mile in Cold Water with the consistently pleasant smelling Kurt Ballou.
After the release of A Mile In Cold Water and subsequent touring, Andy and Guy left Garrison to return to graduate school, while Ed and Joe recruited Jason Carlin, Matt LaVonture, J. Morrissette, Ethan Dussault, and John Ledoux to continue the development of Garrison.
After playing 353 shows, Garrison officially disbanded in 2004, members of Garrison went on to play with Judas Knife, Rules, Leafminer, The Many Mansions, Pointillist, Neutria, Instruction, Fires, The Fly Seville, Gay for Johnny Depp, Campaign for Real-Time, The Rise Park, Placer, and Kill Verona.
In 2021. Iodine records re-released The Bend Before the Break on vinyl, digital, and cassette with remastered audio, and updated art from Dan McCarthy.

Notes
Although never an official member, Mike Ushinski played drums with Garrison during several tours
Garrison's final shows were performed on a 2003 tour of Japan. This tour is often missing from official accounts due to its unusual lineup which excluded Grillo entirely and found J. Morrissette on bass. The lineup was: Ed McNamara (guitar and vocal), J. Morrissette (bass), Mike Ushinski (drums), Taylor Bearfoot (guitar). Due to this unusual final set of performance, McNamara is the only member of Garrison to play every show.

USS Spitfire was a bomb ketch converted from a sloop that served the U.S. Navy during the early years of the republic. She carried ammunition for the U.S. Navy warships in the Mediterranean in their battles with the Barbary pirates, and was later involved in the Little Belt affair prior to the War of 1812.
Service history
The second ship to be so named by the Navy, Spitfire—a merchant sloop built in Connecticut in 1803—was purchased by the Navy at Boston, Massachusetts, on 25 April 1805; was commissioned the same day; and converted to a bomb ketch by the Boston Navy Yard. Commanded by Midshipman Daniel McNeill, Jr., Spitfire sailed for the Mediterranean on 23 June 1805 and reached Gibraltar on 1 August. The bomb ketch operated in the Mediterranean supporting American operations against the Barbary powers until sailing for home on 3 June 1806. She arrived at Charleston, South Carolina, on 19 July and was placed in ordinary at Norfolk, Virginia, on 3 August 1806.
The ship reactivated in July 1807 under command of Midshipman F. Cornelius de Kroff but remained at Norfolk until laid up again in December. On 1 May 1811, Spitfire was stopped by the fifth-rate off New Jersey's Sandy Hook. Guerriere impressed the apprentice sailing master of Spitfire, John Diggio, a citizen of Maine. This incident led to a confrontation fifteen days later between the frigates and (mistaken for the Guerriere), as President attempted to recover Diggio. The ensuing Little Belt affair provoked a diplomatic furor between the United States and Great Britain, and contributed to the tense atmosphere between the two powers prior to the War of 1812. Spitfire was broken up at the Norfolk Navy Yard in 1820.

An executioner's sword is a sword designed specifically for decapitation of condemned criminals (as opposed to combat). These swords were intended for two-handed use, but were lacking a point, so that their overall blade length was typically that of a single-handed sword (ca. ). The quillons were quite short, and mainly straight, and the pommel was often pear-shaped or faceted.
In the Middle Ages, decapitations were executed with regular swords, and the earliest known specifically designed executioner's sword dates to ca. 1540.
They were in wide use in 17th-century Europe, but fell out of use quite suddenly in the early 18th century. The last executions by sword in Europe were carried out in Switzerland in 1867 and 1868, when Niklaus Emmenegger in Lucerne and Héli Freymond in Moudon were beheaded for murder. Swords known as a sulthan are used to carry out executions in Saudi Arabia (see Capital punishment in Saudi Arabia).
The blades of executioner's swords were often decorated with symbolic designs. When no longer used for executions, an executioner's sword sometimes continued to be used as a ceremonial sword of justice, a symbol of judicial power.

Baron Sir Thomas Street, MP, KB, JP (1625 – 8 March 1696) was an English judge and politician who became a Baron of the Exchequer in 1681. He represented Worcester in the House of Commons between 1659 and 1679. In 1667, he became the Mayor of Worcester, as his father had been before him. In 1677, he became the Chief Justice of Brecknock, Glamorgan and Radnor.
Following Monmouth's Rebellion in 1685, the Catholic King James II took to contravening the Test Act and began filling the military high-command with Catholics, leading to a confrontation with Parliament which took shape as the case of Godden v. Hales (1686), to be settled by the King's Bench where Sir Thomas was by then residing. Of the ten judges who composed the last King's Bench before the Glorious Revolution of 1688, Sir Thomas was the only one to rule against King James II's contravention of the Test Act in 1687, giving rise to his reputation and the Street family motto: Fideli Cum Fidelis ("Faithful Among the Faithless").
Biography
Street was born in Worcester in 1625. His father George Street (1594-1643) was the Mayor of Worcester, his grandfather John Street (d. 1622) was an alderman of Worcester, and his great-grandfather Francis Streate (d. 1607) was the Member of Parliament for Worcester. His father George was a cousin of the John Street (1584-1633) who in 1605 killed two of the Gunpowder Plot conspirators and was rewarded with a pension "for that extraordinary service performed in killing those two traitors, Piercie and Catesbie, with two bulletts at one shott out of his muskett." Street matriculated at Lincoln College, Oxford on 22 April 1642, aged 16. He went on to enter Inner Temple in November 1646 and was called to the Bar on 24 November 1653. He was a member of the Oxford Circuit. He had his children by Lady Penelope Berkeley before dying in 1696, aged 70.
Career
In 1659, Street was elected Member of Parliament for Worcester in the Third Protectorate Parliament. Street was re-elected MP for Worcester in 1660 for the Convention Parliament. He was appointed JP for Worcestershire on 10 July 1660. In 1661 he was re-elected MP for Worcester in the Cavalier Parliament and sat until 1679. An active member of parliament, Street was appointed to 175 committees, in twelve of which he took the chair, made sixteen recorded speeches, and three times acted as teller. From 1667 to 1677 he was Puisne judge of great sessions and ex officio JP for Brecknock, Glamorgan and Radnor. He became a Bencher of his Inn on 7 November 1669 but was fined £100 for refusing to come up to the bench when called. He became Serjeant at law on 3 July 1677 and was Chief Justice for Brecknock, Glamorgan and Radnor from 1677 to 1681. He became King's Sergeant on 23 October 1678. He was knighted on 8 June 1681 and was a Baron of the Exchequer from April 1681 to 1684. In 1682 he was recorder of Worcester and 1683 recorder of Droitwich 1683.

67 contestants participated. The winners were Dana Bennett (age 13 of Denver) and Sandra Owen (age 14 of Navarre, Ohio), declared co-champions after the word list was exhausted. The final word was schappe, which both failed to correctly spell. The competition lasts 37 rounds, the last 14 with only the final two contestants. At one point Owen was overcome with tears, and Bennett became nauseated, leading to a 10-minute recess. Each winner received a $1000 prize and trip to New York. Owen had been the runner-up in the prior year's competition. This was the second-ever tie in the competition, the first occurring at the 1950 bee. The winners got to meet Vice President Richard Nixon on June 9.
Third place went to Mary Gilliland, 13, of Fort Worth, Texas ($250 prize), who failed to properly spell eudaemonic in the 23rd round. Jolitta Schlehuber placed fourth, but returned to win the next year.
The competition lasted from 9 am until 6:55 pm, and was the longest in the competition's history. The competition moved to a two-day format for the first time the following year.

Summer Roberts is a fictional character on the FOX television series The O.C., portrayed by Rachel Bilson.
Production history
Summer was originally intended as a small supporting character, only there as an object of fantasy for Seth Cohen (Adam Brody) and a friend for Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton), while Ryan Atwood (Ben McKenzie) and Marissa were the lead couple. However, due to Bilson's performance, Summer became an increasingly important character. Series creator Josh Schwartz said: "She was adorable, funny and smart, which was a really fresh way to go with that character. And the more we gave her to do in the first couple of episodes, the more she kept nailing. Finally, in the episode with the Tijuana road trip, we watched a scene between her and Seth in the diner and knew: This girl is amazing. Let's make her a series regular."
Character
Summer Roberts grew up in Newport Beach, California, with her wealthy father, Dr. Neil Roberts (Michael Nouri). For much of the series, she also lived with a stepmother, named Gloria (unseen character), whom she never refers to by name, instead calling the latter "what's her name" or "the stepmonster" due to her mood swings and various addictive pills. She was often paired in scenes with her best friend, Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton), who was the leading female of the series until her death. Summer became the female lead character of the show's fourth season. During this all, she had a long lasting relationship with Seth Cohen. In a flash forward in the series finale, "The End's Not Near, It's Here", she finally marries Seth. Her character was only scheduled to appear in a few episodes, but was considered a hit, and ended up being in each of the series.
Spoiled by her divorced father, Summer considers him to be her best friend, and his opinion matters as much, if not more than her own.
Summer was unusual in combining the qualities of a conventionally attractive and desirable character with a tough, outspoken, "take-charge" attitude. She is portrayed as highly sexualised and initially appears unintelligent; however it is revealed that she has maintained strong academic performance throughout high school when she is accepted into Brown University, where she nurtures a passion for environmental activism.
In season 4 Summer adopts a pet rabbit and names her Pancakes. It is revealed in the season finale that Pancakes had been pregnant, after Seth and Summer discover Pancakes' babies living under her bed. Ryan adopted one of the bunnies, naming it Flapjacks.
Storyline
Season 1
In the first season of The O.C., Summer was portrayed as a spoiled rich girl who looks down on people from middle and working class backgrounds. Her elitism is on display in the first episode, where she is at first attracted to newcomer Ryan Atwooduntil she learns he is from Chino, prompting her response, "Chino, ew." Her attraction to him continues afterwards. However, different sides to her character have been shown as she has developed. Before choosing Summer (after her finally showing her feelings for Seth) Seth picks Anna Stern (Samaire Armstrong), who exhibits a similarly strong personality and shares his sarcastic sense of humor and love of comic books, the first go around. For the few episodes, they have a "will they or won't they" type of relationship, but they eventually begin dating and fall in love. In the process of their characters' relationship, Summer and Seth experience many struggles because Summer thinks it will affect her popularity at their high school.
As the season progresses, Summer is affected by their relationship and is often jealous of Seth, since he seems to be enjoying Anna's company so much. As a result, Summer gets angry and starts dating a classmate named Danny (Bret Harrison), but that relationship doesn't last long, and she finds that she still has feelings for Seth. Midway through the end of the first season, Anna breaks up with Seth because it is obvious he is still in love with Summer. Seth and Summer become a couple, and announce their romance at a school kissing booth, after which they become very close. Summer and Seth lose their virginity to each other. When Ryan moves away, however, Seth, missing his adopted brother, moves away as well at the end of the season, leaving behind a heartbroken Summer.
Season 2
Summer has a new boyfriend, Zach Stevens (Michael Cassidy). Zach is starting to become friends with Seth, whom he met shortly before Zach and Summer started dating, yet their friendship is a little mixed since they both have feelings for Summer. Summer seems committed to putting Seth behind her, although at times it becomes clear that she still has feelings for him. This inevitably causes problems for her relationship with Zach, who suspected they still held feelings for each other. This is further complicated when Summer also becomes professionally involved with Seth and Zach as they develop their comic book, Atomic County, for publication. This relationship proves inextricably linked with the personal feelings all have for each other, and resulted in a bad meeting with a media executive that effectively killed their partnership.
Summer was about to go on an overseas trip to Italy with Zach and his family, when the feelings she still had for Seth prevented her from doing so and she left her heartbroken Zach at the airport, going back to Seth. Zach returned later on in the season however, and this along with Zach and Seth once again going into a partnership for a comic book strained her relationship with Seth. Zach also somewhat subtly exploited this to weaken Seth and Summer's relationship and restart his relationship with her, causing something of a love triangle. The introduction of Reed, a female attractive, older comic book executive who Seth was not initially truthful about also caused difficulties. This was eventually resolved when on the day of the Junior Prom they flipped a coin as to who would go to the prom with Summer and who would meet George Lucas for a comic book project meeting, with Zach winning the date with Summer.
However at the Prom both Summer and Zach seemed unhappy with their choices, and at the last minute Seth arrived at the prom to receive the Prom Queen/King award with Summer and reconciled their relationship. Zach apparently succeeded in impressing Lucas and it has been rumored he was given an internship and moved away from Newport as a result, explaining his absence for season 3.
Towards the end of the season Summer also becomes worried about her best friend Marissa's behaviour, unexplained bruises and a tension with her boyfriend Ryan and his brother Trey. She confronts Marissa and Marissa confesses that Trey had attempted to rape her. Summer consults Seth about this, who feels obliged to tell Ryan and as a result the tragic events of Trey's shooting happen, with Seth and Summer arriving at the aftermath of the shooting.
Season 3
Summer is adjusting to her senior year at Harbor School, with the year starting with her best friend Marissa Cooper expelled from Harbor as a result of her involvement in the shooting of Trey Atwood (Logan Marshall-Green). As a result, Summer reluctantly seeks a more involved role in student politics, gaining a new rival in fellow student Taylor Townsend (Autumn Reeser). They have since become friends, particularly when Taylor helped her get Marissa back in by organizing a petition. Summer is initially insecure about her relationship with Seth, because she often felt that he was smarter than her and she feared that he would break up with her for someone more like him. However, when Summer gets a very high SAT score, it gives her the ambition to change, and she begins to focus on school.
Also, her relationship with Seth is closer than it was during much of the previous year, and the couple's post-graduation future is one that she finds harder to ignore. They have trouble earlier in the season deciding what colleges to go to and how it would affect their future together, but eventually they agree on going to Brown University, which is more feasible after Summer gets a high SAT score. Summer cares a lot about Seth and when he starts smoking pot, she becomes worried about him and forgives him if he promises to stop. When Summer finds out that Seth is still smoking pot, she is upset, but Seth apologizes with a letter on a napkin, admitting his lies and mistakes, and tells Summer that if he messes up again, she can show it to his parents. Summer forgives Seth. Shortly before they get their college acceptance letters, Summer says that if should she get into Brown and not Seth, she will not go. When they get their letters, to Seth's dismay this happens. Seth, not wanting to be responsible for Summer turning down a major educational and life opportunity, says he does not want to go to Brown anymore. As a result, they break up, with Seth stating when confronted by Summer that he does not love her anymore. While their future as a couple seems uncertain at this point (and is complicated by the return of Seth's ex-girlfriend Anna Stern), Summer takes a Korean pop star as date for the prom. Upon seeing Seth with Anna, Summer feels hurt. When Summer falls off the stage after being announced Prom Queen for the second time in a row, Seth runs to her and tells her the truth about Brown and they reconcile. They have resigned themselves to going to school in Rhode Island, albeit at different schools.
Summer has also dealt with several changes in her home life, such as her stepmother, an unseen character, leaving and divorcing her father. Also more recently she has had to deal with her father dating her best friend's mother, Julie Cooper (Melinda Clarke). She eventually accepted the relationship and recently announced engagement, however, seeing the happiness it had brought her father despite her own reservations about Julie.
Season 4
Summer is adjusting to life in college without Seth and Marissa in an unexpected fashion. She tries to separate herself from Orange County and her former materialistic lifestyle. During the final season, she and Taylor go from being rivals to best friends.
Whilst attending college she befriends another college freshman, Che (Chris Pratt), an environmentalist, and Summer becomes one as well in an attempt to take her mind off Marissa's recent death. She attends protests, stops shaving her legs and rearranges her dorm to fit her new lifestyle. After some time, she tries to return to her old lifestyle, but realizes that she prefers having a purpose in life to her former comfortable, but shallow, existence. She decides to find a balance between the two extremes, but her environmental activism occasionally creates trouble for her, such as when she and Che release lab rabbits from a science lab. When Brown officials investigate the incident, she remains truthful aside for not naming her accomplice. Unfortunately, Che puts the blame on her, which results in her year-long expulsion. Summer moves back into her old Newport house with the Coopers and Taylor. Upon hearing of her expulsion, Seth decides to put off college until the following fall so they could return to Providence together. Close to New Year's Eve, Summer has a pregnancy scare, and Seth proposes to her. Although Summer finds out she is not pregnant after all, she and Seth decide to move ahead with their engagement.
In "The French Connection", Summer meets up with former best friend Holly Fischer (Ashley Hartman) to find out what life is like as a "Newpsie-wed". Summer realizes that she has changed and no longer belongs in her old world; she fears that she does not know who she truly is, and breaks off the engagement with Seth in order to find herself. She slowly works toward this as she and Seth re-connect.
Later, Summer helps rescue a groundhog in a political protest in which Seth and Che are arrested. Also, in "The Case of the Franks" Summer gets offered a job at GEORGE (Global Environmental Organisation Regarding Greenhouse Emissions) travelling around the country speaking to children in high school. She believes that this is one part of her destiny, while Seth is the other.
She challenges Seth to make stock film after he criticizes the films at GEORGE's art show. As a joke, he films an inflatable orca and shark in his backyard swimming pool for six hours. Summer is not amused, however, and says that he should stop being lazy and actually do something with his life. During his second attempt, which consists of various adventures of the family, he overhears a conversation between Summer and Kirsten, in which the former says that she just wants Seth to be excited about something that he loves. During a trip to rent An Inconvenient Truth, an earthquake hits Newport. Summer and Seth safely get out of Ryan's Jeep when a light pole falls onto it.
Series finale
Six months later, Seth and Summer fall into a rut after the earthquake, and spend hours watching Briefcase or No Briefcase (a television game show take-off of Deal or No Deal). Seth tells her that she must join GEORGE, and they will always be together. Summer leaves Seth to help the environment and they say farewell. Summer attends protests and works to save the environment and educate students on environmental issues for a year. She appears in newspaper articles as an environmentalist. In a flash-forward sequence, Summer ends up marrying Seth.

In May 2021, it was announced that the sixth would be its final season, which premiered on January 4, 2022.
Series overview
The series follows the lives of siblings Kevin, Kate, and Randall (known as the "Big Three"), and their parents Jack and Rebecca Pearson. It takes place mainly in the present, but uses flashbacks and flashforwards to show other significant moments in the family's history. Kevin and Kate are the two surviving members of triplets, born six weeks premature on Jack's 36th birthday in 1980; their brother Kyle was stillborn. Believing they were meant to have three children, Jack and Rebecca decide to adopt Randall, an African-American child born earlier that day and brought to the same hospital after his biological father William Hill abandoned him at a fire station. Jack dies when his children are 17. Rebecca later marries Jack's best friend Miguel.
Randall becomes a successful finance professional and marries college classmate Beth; they raise two daughters (Tess and Annie) and adopt a third, Deja. Kevin becomes a successful actor while struggling to be taken seriously. After lacking direction much of her life, Kate meets and marries Toby, pursues a career in music, gets a degree and becomes a mom.
Most episodes feature a storyline taking place in the present (2016–2022, contemporaneous with airing) and a storyline taking place at a set time in the past. Some episodes are set in one time period, or use multiple flashback time periods. Flashbacks often focus on Jack and Rebecca c. 1980, both before and after their babies' birth, or on the family when the Big Three are children or adolescents, and are played by two sets of younger actors; these scenes usually take place in Pittsburgh, where the Big Three and their parents are born and raised.
As adults, their homes vary more widely: Kate lives in Los Angeles; Randall and his family are in New Jersey and later Philadelphia; and Kevin relocates from Los Angeles to New York City and back again, with a brief return to western Pennsylvania along the way. Various other time periods and locations have also served as settings. Some episodes have focused on the earlier experiences of other characters, including Randall's family members William, Deja, and Beth. Beginning in the second season, the show also uses flashforwards to show a later time period, when Randall's daughter Tess is an adult and an elderly Rebecca is on her deathbed.

Development
This is Us originally began as an 80-page movie script that Dan Fogelman was developing while working for ABC Studios in the spring of 2015. The story line, which Fogelman admitted to not having a definite direction, revolved around the lives of eight adults who, as it would be revealed, were octuplets. After moving to an eight-figure deal with 20th Century Fox Television, Fogelman made the decision to develop a television series from the characters of his original script, cutting a few characters and shortening the script to 45 pages before bringing it to the studio. Jennifer Salke, president at NBC, commented on the conception of a title for the series, saying "The title didn't come easy...but This Is Us tapped into everything, and the show's about us." It has been revealed that other ideas for the title included 36, Happy Birthday, and The Story of Us.
Despite positive reviews from both 20th Century Fox Television and its sister company, Fox, there were concerns regarding risk of attracting an audience, and Fox sold it to NBC. Fox did so because NBC promised to use the high volume of viewers from The Voice and the Summer Olympics to bring additional viewers to the series, and Fox wanted to solidify the reputation of its studio among writers and directors as placing shows where they are most likely to succeed, even if it is not Fox.
On September 27, 2016, NBC picked up the series for a full season of 18 episodes. In January 2017, NBC renewed the series for two additional seasons of 18 episodes each. The second season premiered on September 26, 2017. The third season premiered on September 25, 2018. In May 2019, NBC renewed the series for three additional seasons. The fourth season premiered on September 24, 2019. The fifth season premiered on October 27, 2020. On May 12, 2021, it was announced that the series would conclude with the sixth season. Production wrapped on May 3, 2022.
Filming locations
In addition to filming in Los Angeles, the series shot a few scenes on location in New York City, Philadelphia, and one in Memphis.
Commitment to diversity
Fogelman intentionally recruited behind-the-scenes talent that would reflect the diversity of his cast, with the goal of bringing greater authenticity to the dialog and storylines. These include black directors Regina King and George Tillman Jr., and black female writers Kay Oyegun and Jas Waters (they were part of a 30% black core writing staff; far outpacing the industry standard of 5%). In addition, Fogelman's sister Deborah, whose struggles with weight inspired one element of the show, serves as a consultant.
Release
In May 2017, Hulu acquired the SVOD rights to new and past episodes of the series to air exclusively on Hulu, in addition to NBC.com and the NBC app.

Season 4 received a 91% approval rating from Rotten Tomatoes based on 11 reviews, with an average of 7.3/10 The site's consensus reads: "This Is Us reaffirms that it is more than just a mystery box in its fourth season, pressing on with some of its most central questions answered – but its emotional power intact."
Entertainment Weekly gave the show a grade B, calling it "a refreshing respite from the relational violence and pessimism that marks the other buzz soaps that have bubbled forth from a culture of divisiveness". Moreover, they praised all the actors, specifically Sterling K. Brown, for being able to navigate "his scenes with such intelligence, authenticity, and charisma".

Gun drills (through coolant drill) are straight fluted drills which allow cutting fluid (either compressed air or a suitable liquid) to be injected through the drill's hollow body to the cutting face. They are used for deep hole drilling—a depth-to-diameter ratio of 300:1 or more is possible. Gun barrels are the obvious example; hence the name. Other uses include moldmaking, diemaking, and the manufacture of combustion engine parts such as crankcase, cylinder head, and woodwind musical instruments, such as uilleann pipes, as gun drills can drill long straight holes in metal, wood, and some plastics. The coolant provides lubrication and cooling to the cutting edges and removes the swarf or chips from the hole. Modern gun drills use carbide tips to prolong life and reduce total cost when compared with steel tips. Speed of drilling depends on the material being drilled, rotational speed, and the drill diameter; a high speed drill can cut a hole in P20 steel at 30 inches per minute.
Gun drilling can be done on several kinds of machine tools. On lathes, it is generally practical with hole depths of less than 50 diameters. There are also purpose-built gun drilling machines, where longer aspect ratios can be drilled.
Requirement
With a standard twist drill, it is difficult to drill a straight and accurately sized hole of a depth more than about 5 times the diameter. This is a problem in many manufacturing processes, especially the firearms industry: the barrel of a gun must be very straight and accurately sized. Gun barrels are far longer than their inside diameter; as an example, the caliber barrel of the M16 rifle is long, nearly 90 times the diameter of the bore. The gun drill was developed to drill such long, straight holes.
Gun drilling is possible over a range of depths and diameters. For diameters between , gun drilling can be performed successfully with special equipment. It is a common process between in diameter. It is also possible for the range, however less efficient than BTA deep hole drilling.
Types
There are three basic types of deep hole drilling. Processes are categorized by how the cutting coolant flushes heat and chips from the cutting face. The three types of deep drilling are:
Gun drilling - The cutting tool is a fluted solid rod that has a hole bored down the center. Coolant is pumped through a hole in the inside of the drill. It flows back outside the drill, through the flute, bringing the chips with it.
BTA / STS (Boring and Trepanning Association / Single Tube System) - The cutting tool is a tube. Coolant is pumped in around the outside of the cutting tool and carries chips out through the center tube. For the tube to be strong enough and have an inner diameter large enough to carry chips away, the hole must be more than in diameter.
Ejector system - The cutting tool is a tube with another tube nested inside. Coolant flows through the smaller tube to the cutting face and then coolant and chips flow back through the larger tube. This is only an acceptable technology for holes of over in diameter.

Mizraim ( ; cf. Arabic مصر, Miṣr) is the Hebrew and Aramaic name for the land of Egypt, with the dual suffix -āyim, perhaps referring to the "two Egypts": Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt. Mizraim is the dual form of matzor, meaning a "mound" or "fortress," the name of a people descended from Ham. It was the name generally given by the Hebrews to the land of Egypt and its people.
Neo-Babylonian texts use the term Mizraim for Egypt. The name was, for instance, inscribed on the Ishtar Gate of Babylon. Ugaritic inscriptions refer to Egypt as Mṣrm, in the 14th century B.C. Amarna tablets it is called Misri, and Assyrian records called Egypt Mu-ṣur. The Classical Arabic word for Egypt is Miṣr / Miṣru, the name that refers to Egypt in the Quran, though the word is pronounced as Maṣr in Egyptian colloquial Arabic. Some Ancient Egyptian inscriptions at the time of Pharaoh Amenhotep IV refer to Egypt as Masara and to Egyptians as Masrawi.
According to Genesis 10, Mizraim son of Ham was the younger brother of Cush and elder brother of Phut whose families together made up the Hamite branch of Noah's descendants. Mizraim's sons were Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim, Pathrusim, Casluhim , and Caphtorim.
In the Book of Exodus, it is considered the house of bondage. Regarding the passover, Moses says to the sons of Israel, "Remember this day, in which ye came out from Mizraim, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this place; there shall no leavened bread be eaten."
The book of Deuteronomy forbids the sons of Israel from abhoring a Mizri, an Egyptian, "because you were a stranger in his land."
According to Eusebius's Chronicon, Manetho had suggested that the great age of antiquity of which the later Egyptians boasted had actually preceded the Great Flood and that they were really descended from Mizraim, who settled there anew. A similar story is related by medieval Islamic historians, such as Sibt ibn al-Jawzi, the Egyptian Ibn 'Abd al-Hakam, and the Persians al-Tabari and Muhammad Khwandamir, stating that the pyramids, etc. had been built by the wicked races before the Deluge but that Noah's descendant Mizraim (Masar or Mesr) was later entrusted with reoccupying the region. The Islamic accounts also make Masar the son of a Bansar or Beisar and grandson of Ham, rather than a direct son of Ham, and add that he lived to the age of 700. Some scholars think it likely that Mizraim is a dual form of the word Misr meaning "land" and was translated literally into Ancient Egyptian as Ta-Wy (the Two Lands) by early pharaohs at Thebes, who later founded the Middle Kingdom.
However, according to George Syncellus, the Book of Sothis, attributed to Manetho, identified Mizraim with the legendary first Pharaoh Menes, who is said to have unified the Old Kingdom and built Memphis. Mizraim also seems to correspond to Misor, who is said in Phoenician mythology to have been the father of Taautus, who was given Egypt, and later scholars noticed that it also recalls Menes, whose son or successor was said to be Athothis.
However, the author David Rohl has suggested a different interpretation:

Origen the Pagan (; fl. early 3rd century) was a Platonist philosopher who lived in Alexandria. He was a student of Ammonius Saccas and a contemporary of Plotinus in Ammonius's philosophy school in Alexandria.
Origen is mentioned three times in Porphyry's Life of Plotinus, where he is treated much more kindly than the Christian Origen, whom Porphyry disliked. He is also mentioned several times by Proclus, and it is clear that Origen's fellow students Plotinus and Longinus treated him with respect.
The only aspect of his philosophical views which are known is that he did not make the first principle of reality the One beyond intellect and being as Plotinus did, but rather the first principle was the supreme intellect and primary being, which suggests that his views were that of traditional Middle Platonism, rather than the Neoplatonism of Plotinus.

Sudeten Provincial Park is a former provincial park in British Columbia, Canada. Ownership of the five-hectare park was transferred from the provincial government to local government for park purposes in 2006. It is now known as Sudeten Heritage Park and operated by Tomslake & District Recreation Commission.
Historical significance
Sudetenland is the historical German name given to certain border regions of the former Czechoslovakia that were inhabited primarily by Sudeten Germans.
In 1939, following the Munich Agreement which assigned the Sudetenland to Nazi Germany, Canada announced it would permit approximately 3,000 Sudeten German (notably Jewish and Socialist) refugees entry to become farmers.
Of the 1000 refugees who settled in Canada, half were settled in the Tomslake region of northern British Columbia and the rest in Saskatchewan
To commemorate these hardy settlers, many of whom had no experience farming, who fled persecution in their homeland, this park was established.

Personal fulfillment is achievement of life goals which are important to an individual, in contrast to the goals of society, family and other collective obligations.
Personal fulfillment is an ongoing journey for a human individual. It commences when an individual starts becoming conscious of oneself and one's surroundings. It is then that one's exploration begins to realize what one is capable of. Like the tentative steps of a child that invariably lead to a few falls followed by seeking for some help from people around. Then the joy of achievement when one can successfully take a few steps without falling. The appreciation of people around is a key component of achieving personal fulfillment. It is invariably followed by a sense of habituality (i.e., being able to perform any act, such as walking, habitually). Then boredom. Followed by a yearning for the next horizon, whatever it may be for an individual.
Key components then of personal fulfilment are:
Consciousness - of oneself and the environment
Consciousness - of people around oneself
Exploration - of something new that one may be capable of
Initial failure - as one's initial attempts at exploration leads to stumbles and falls
Trying - again and again till such time that one does not stumble and fall
Experiencing joy - of having tried and achieved something new
Commendation and applause - of those around, especially of the ones that the individual values
Boredom - as one performs the 'not so new anymore' task as a matter of habit
Then back to step three for something new to explore
The cycle continuing throughout one's life as the individual grows and expands into newer and unexplored dimensions of personal fulfilment
Consciousness is the quality or state of being aware of an external object or something within oneself. It has been defined as sentience, awareness, subjectivity, the ability to experience or to feel wakefulness, having a sense of selfhood, and the executive control system of the mind.
Consciousness of the self is a complex experience for an individual being. A prime aspect of consciousness and awareness of the self is the awakening to one's capabilities and potential.
The awakening to one's capabilities and potential is a continuous process throughout the period of existence of a being - from the birth of the physical being through the expiration of the same. Inherent to this process of being is a drive or a force that seems to be part and parcel of being in the physical being on earth. This drive manifests itself from the start of one's being - like a child crying as soon as it is born. It is the awakening of the child to its capabilities of exercising its vocal cords. The drive continues through the life of one's being (albeit in varying degrees of forcefulness and momentum at various points in time) through to death of the physical being as we know.
This drive is primal and is the single force that leads to exploration.

Beef or is a French dish of a piece of beef braised in stock and wine with carrots and onions.
In French recipes, the preferred cut is the pointe de culotte, the rump cap. In older recipes, it is invariably larded. Most recipes start by marinating the meat in wine. It is first browned in fat then braised in a liquid composed primarily of stock or broth and red or white wine with carrots, onions, and herbs. Modern recipes often include celery. Some recipes add tomatoes, while others add brandy or other distilled spirits. Most French recipes include a boned calf's foot to add gelatin to the braising liquid, which serves to thicken the resulting sauce.
To finish the dish, the braised beef is removed and set aside to rest. Meanwhile, the braising liquid is strained and reduced to a sauce. The beef is sliced and served with this sauce. In simple versions à la ménagère 'housewife style', the vegetables from the braising liquid are served as the garnish. In more elaborate versions à la bourgeoise 'classy style', the vegetables that have cooked with the meat are strained out, and freshly cooked carrots and onions are added.
The braising liquid varies from all-stock, to about 1:3 wine to stock, to all wine. One American recipe from 1896 uses just water.
History
In English, the dish was formerly called both "beef à la mode" and "à la mode beef" (sometimes spelled "alamode"). In French, it is now often called boeuf mode.

Gymnosporangium clavariiforme (Tongues of Fire) is a species of rust fungus which alternately infects Juniperus and hawthorns.
In junipers, the primary hosts, G. clavariiforme produces a set of orange tentacle-like spore tubes called telial horns. These horns expand and have a jelly like consistency when wet. The spores are released and travel on the wind until they infect a hawthorn tree.
On the secondary hosts, the fungus produces yellowish depressions on the leaves. It also infects the fruit, which grows whitish tubes like a Medusa head. These are the spore tubes. The spores must then infect a juniper to complete the life cycle.
The fungus does not cause serious damage to junipers, but hawthorns can suffer serious loss of haw production due to the effects of the fungus.

Frederick II of Hesse-Homburg (), also known as the Prince of Homburg (30 March 1633 – 24 January 1708) was Landgrave of Hesse-Homburg. He was also a successful and experienced general for the crowns of both Sweden and of Brandenburg, but is best remembered as the eponymous hero of Heinrich von Kleist's play Der Prinz von Homburg.
Life
Childhood and youth
Frederick was born in Homburg (the present Bad Homburg vor der Höhe), the seventh and youngest child of Landgrave Frederick I of Hesse-Homburg, who died in 1638, leaving the children to be brought up under the care of their mother, Margaret Elisabeth of Leiningen-Westerburg.
At his mother's wish Frederick was educated by private tutors together with the sons of his cousin, George II, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt, in Marburg. In 1648 he broke his leg and spent some time convalescing in Bad Pfäfers.
When Field-Marshal Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne, appeared in the vicinity, Frederick was sent by his mother to conduct negotiations for the safety of Homburg. Turenne found the prince so engaging that he wanted to take him straight away into his army and to pay for his military education. Frederick's mother however opposed the idea, and it came to nothing.
At the age of 16 he made the Grand Tour through Italy and France, and was then signed up as a student at the University of Geneva, although he did not follow a real course of academic study: he learned dancing, riding and fencing, and polished his knowledge of the French language.
Military career
Since his elder brothers preceded him in the succession, he decided on a military career and in 1654 became a colonel in the army of the King of Sweden, Charles X Gustav.
In 1659 during the storming of Copenhagen during the Northern Wars Frederick was so seriously wounded that his lower right leg had to be amputated. He was promoted to major-general (Generalmajor) and from then on had a wooden leg. Frederick was chosen by Charles X as the Statthalter of Livonia, but after the king's death things changed considerably, and Frederick left Swedish service in 1661.
In the same year he married Margareta Brahe, a wealthy Swedish widow, who died in 1669. With her wealth he bought estates in Brandenburg and became a friend of the Elector Friedrich Wilhelm I of Brandenburg. In 1670 Frederick married the Elector's niece Princess Luise Elisabeth von Kurland, after moving from the Lutheran to the Reformed church and entering the service of Brandenburg as a general. In 1672 he received the command of all the forces of Brandenburg.
In 1672 and 1674 he fought in the Dutch War, among other places in Alsace against the French army commanded by Turenne. As commander of the Brandenburg cavalry, during the Swedish invasion, on 28 June 1675 in the Battle of Fehrbellin he attacked the Swedish army without orders to do so, causing them heavy losses. In the event this move contributed decisively to the victory of Brandenburg but also to the displeasure of the Elector. In the years 1676-1678 he took part in the campaigns in Pomerania and Prussia and negotiated on behalf of the Elector of Brandenburg the Treaty of Saint-Germain of 1679.
Landgrave of Hesse-Homburg
After leaving military service he lived as a Junker in Brandenburg. After the death of Georg Christian, his second eldest brother, who had mortgaged to Hesse-Darmstadt the landgraviate of Hesse-Homburg and the town of Homburg, Frederick redeemed them, and took up residence there himself. In 1681, after the death of his brother Landgrave Wilhelm Christoph of Hesse-Homburg, Frederick took over the governance of the territory as Frederick II. He was however forced to return the territory of Bingenheim, which Wilhelm Christoph had occupied, to Hesse-Darmstadt, in exchange for financial compensation.
He had the Baroque Schloss Bad Homburg constructed, and involved himself, with little success, in the local economy with the establishment of a glasswork and a salination plant. More successful was the settlement of Huguenot and Waldensian refugees from France, in Friedrichsdorf and Dornholzhausen. His court alchemist, Paul Andrich, made him a prosthetic leg with springs and silver mounts - whence his nickname "the Landgrave with the silver leg".
In 1690 his wife died, having borne him 12 children. At the age of 59 Frederick married for a third time: the widow Sophie Sybille von Leiningen-Westerburg, a connection of his mother's family, who bore him three more children.
Frederick died in 1708 in Homburg, apparently from pneumonia, after a last journey to Leipzig to meet Charles XII, King of Sweden.

Frederick II was married three times: in 1661 to Countess Margarethe Brahe (1603–1669); in 1670 to Princess Louise Elisabeth of Courland (1646–1690); and in 1691 to Countess Sophie Sybille of Leiningen-Westerburg (1656–1724).

Literary references
Frederick is the eponymous hero of the well-known German drama Prinz Friedrich von Homburg (in full, Prinz Friedrich von Homburg oder die Schlacht bei Fehrbellin) by Heinrich von Kleist (written 1809–1810, first published 1821). The character of the prince in the play however has little apart from the name in common with the historical personage.
The drama in its turn has inspired an opera, Der Prinz von Homburg, by Hans Werner Henze (written 1958, performed 1960) and a number of films, including Marco Bellochio's Il Principe di Homburg, released in 1997.

The Sunbury Earth Rings (Bora Rings) are prehistoric Aboriginal sites located on the hills to the west of Jacksons Creek near Sunbury, Victoria, Australia.
Description and identification
Sometimes referred to as Bora rings, they were formed by scraping off grass and topsoil, and piling it in a circular ridge around the outside. They measure between 10 – 25 m diameter. Three of the rings are in close proximity and two others several kilometres away. All are on gently sloping sites. They are somewhat different from the Bora Rings found in New South Wales and southeast Queensland, which tend to be located in hidden, flat sites, and in connected pairs. The Sunbury Earth Rings first came to public attention, and first were investigated and described in the early 1970s, when archaeologist Dr. David Frankel undertook a test excavation on one of the rings to determine their origin. Excavations revealed the remains of two small stone cairns, one in the centre and one on the edge of the circle, and a number of sharp stone plades or knives, which may have been used in ritual scarification or circumcision ceremonies.
Interpretation
The rings have been interpreted as Aboriginal ceremonial sites, although there are no historical or ethnographic accounts of them being used as such. Members of the Wurundjeri Tribe Council have suggested the rings may be more than 1000 years old, based on the results of archaeological investigations, and that the group of three may have related to separate male and female ceremonies and initiation rituals. However, elder Auntie Annette Xibberas acknowledged that the Aboriginal people of the Melbourne area, "...lost a lot of our knowledge with European colonisation, we only found out about these (rings) about 30 years ago".
Management and conservation
Some of the Rings have been put under the management of the Wurundjeri Tribe Land and Compensation Cultural Heritage Council, and have also been included on the Register of the National Estate.
There are ongoing pressures on the sites from development. As a result of housing development along Reservoir Road, one ring in Fullwood Drive is now encircled by the back fences of adjoining houses, while another is subject to residential subdivision plans which will also see it surrounded by roads. A past proposal even considered incorporating one of the rings in the middle of a traffic round-about. The Canterbury Hills housing estate has submitted plans for residential development around the Riddells Road ring. In October 2009, the Sunbury Maribyrnong Valley Green Wedge Defenders made a Submission to the Parliamentary, Legislative Council regarding their inquiry into the impact of the state government's decision to change the Urban Growth Boundary, citing the Aboriginal ring as a significant element of the threatened Bundanoon woodlands and grasslands, which was being encroached upon by housing.

Kenneth Cecil Gandar-Dower (31 August 1908 – 12 February 1944) was a leading English sportsman, aviator, explorer and author.
Born at his parents' home in Regent's Park, London, Gandar-Dower was the fourth and youngest son of independently wealthy Joseph Wilson Gandar-Dower and his wife Amelia Frances Germaine. Two of his elder brothers, Eric and Alan Gandar Dower, served as Conservative Members of Parliament. Other brothers include Ronald, Leonard and Howard. All used different versions of their surname: Gandar-Dower, Gandar Dower and Dower respectively.
Education
Gandar-Dower was educated at Windlesham House School and Harrow School, where he played cricket, association football, Eton Fives and rackets and, with Terence Rattigan, wrote for The Harrovian. He then received a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge in 1927 to read History, gaining an upper second. There, he won athletic blues in billiards, tennis and real tennis, Rugby Fives, Eton Fives and rackets. In addition, Gandar-Dower edited Granta magazine and chaired the Trinity debating society.
Sporting career
Gandar-Dower became a leading tennis player, competing in a number of tournaments throughout the 1930s, including Wimbledon and the French Championships. He was nicknamed "The Undying Retriever" for his ability to run large distances during matches.
At the 1932 Queen's Club Championship in London Gandar-Dower had his greatest tennis success when he defeated Harry Hopman in three sets. Newspaper reports stated that he "had Hopman perplexed with his unorthodox game and the number of astonishingly low volleys from apparently impossible positions."
Gandar-Dower also won the British Amateur Squash championships in 1938 and continued to play cricket competitively throughout the 1930s.
Gandar-Dower twice won the principal trophy in Eton Fives – the Kinnaird Cup – in 1929 and 1932, and was in the defeated pair in the 1931 final.
Gandar-Dower caused a reputation for himself in real tennis through his tactic of getting to the net as quickly as possible and volleying everything in sight. This was frowned upon by traditionalists and it was considered that Gandar-Dower "disrupted the game for a while".
Aviator
In June 1932, with minimal flying experience, Gandar-Dower entered the King's Cup Air Race and "soon became one of the most colourful aviators of his era", making one of the first flights from England to India.
Explorer
In 1934 Gandar-Dower led an expedition to Mount Kenya and the Aberdare Range in an attempt to capture a marozi, a spotted lion rumoured to exist. While he failed to capture or photograph a marozi (which remains undiscovered), Gandar-Dower did find three sets of tracks which he believed to be marozi and discovered that locals differentiated marozi from lions or leopards. In 1937, Gandar-Dower authored a book on the subject, The Spotted Lion.
He spent 1935 and 1936 in the Belgian Congo and Kenya, where he climbed active volcanoes and produced a definitive map of Mount Sattima.
Cheetah racing
Gandar-Dower returned to England in 1937 with twelve cheetahs with the intention of introducing cheetah racing to Great Britain. After six months' quarantine and six months' adapting themselves to the changed climatic conditions at Harringay and Staines stadia, the cheetahs first raced at Romford Greyhound Stadium on Saturday 11 December 1937. Specially timed trials had taken place where the cheetahs clipped seconds off almost every greyhound record. On 13 December a cheetah by the name of Helen covered the distance of 265 yards in a record time of 15.86sec but in the second race won by Gussie the second cheetah James stopped and refused to chase the hare. Helen had previously covered 355 yards in 19.8secs.
However the cheetah racing failed after just one more attempt because they were not competitive and had no interest in pursuing the hare and could not negotiate tight bends. Gandar-Dower also caused uproar at the Queen's Club when he brought a male cheetah into the bar on a leash.
Writing career
Gandar-Dower was also a successful author, writing about his adventures. His titles include:
Amateur Adventure, based on his flight to India, was published in 1934. In a contemporary book review, Flight Magazine wrote that Gandar-Dower "produced an amusing record of his adventures ... that nearly everyone will recommend their friends to read."
Into Madagascar, published in 1943, is a history/travelogue, in which he reports that the nineteenth century Malagasy monarch Queen Ranavalona I had "a passion for sewing her subjects up in sacks and making use of the first-class facilities offered by her capital in the matter of vertical drops."
The Spotted Lion, published in 1937, recorded Gandar-Dower's search for the marozi through Kenya. The Spotted Lion has been credited with bringing the marozi to the attention of the world.
Abyssinian patchwork: an anthology, written in the mid-1930s but not released until 1949, covered the mistreatment of Ethiopians under Italian Fascism.
Inside Britain and Outside Britain were co-written in 1938 with James Riddell. Satires, they are described as having "much gentle irony and are occasionally clairvoyant in their political speculation."
World War II
At the outbreak of World War II Gandar-Dower was in the Belgian Congo photographing gorillas. Returning to England, he then worked on the Mass-Observation project with Tom Harrisson before being hired by the Government of Kenya to improve its public relations with the native inhabitants, producing a number of works that the government considered "excellent". Later he acted as a war correspondent, covering campaigns in Abyssinia and Madagascar, travelling vast distances by bicycle and canoe. During the unresisted assault on Tamatave in eastern Madagascar he leapt from an amphibious vessel wearing a bowler hat, carrying a camera in one hand and typewriter in the other.
On 6 February 1944 Gandar-Dower boarded the SS Khedive Ismail at Kilindini Harbour at Mombasa, bound for Colombo. While approaching Addu Atoll in the Maldives, on 12 February 1944, the vessel was attacked by Japanese submarine I-27. Struck by two torpedoes, the Khedive Ismail sank in two minutes, with a death toll of 1297, Gandar-Dower among them.
Gandar-Dower's obituary in Wisden stated that "he was one of the most versatile player of games of any period." A wealthy man, Gandar-Dower left over £75,000 in his will.

The Great Southern Railways (GSR) Class 280 were 0-4-0T locomotives built by Sentinel in 1927.
Design
The design consisted of a vertical boiler inside the cab surrounded by the coal bunker and water tanks and the cylinders mounted vertically between the axles. The design was similar to others Sentinel has provided to other companies. The LNER Class Y3 and GWR No. 12 are examples of a broadly similar design.
Service
The locomotive design had a low cost operating cost and suited to shunting and tight radius curve. Initially allocated to Cork and Tralee by 1932 both had moved to Limerick and worked the market siding. Following the closure of the market siding in 1940 they lay idle until disposal in 1940.
Railcars
A similar power unit was also used in four GSR Railcars introduced in 1932.

The Brian McCarthy Memorial Moosehead Award is a grant issued to Australian comedians wishing to premiere new works as part of the Melbourne International Comedy Festival. It is named after Brian McCarthy, a young comedian and comedy producer killed in a car accident in 1987.
Each year benefit performances are held in Melbourne (as part of the Comedy Festival) and Sydney, and the money raised is used to produce new shows by successful applicants, who are thus free to try out a new and exciting idea without worrying whether it will be "commercially viable". The Award is substantial, but rather than providing funds directly, the Moosehead association produces the show, organising everything from Festival registration to venue and equipment hire and marketing. It also provides access to professional photographers, publicists, directors and other resources typically too expensive for comedians.
The award is known as the "Moosehead" award as Moosehead beer was Brian McCarthy's favorite. His favorite song, I Heard It Through the Grapevine, is traditionally performed by the closing act of every Moosehead Award benefit show.
In recent years the Award has also received sponsorship from The Comedy Channel.

The Waeclingas (Old English Wæclingas) were a tribe or clan of Anglo-Saxon England. Their territory or regio was based in the modern city of St Albans, whose name is recorded as Wæclingaceaster ("the former Roman fortification of the Wæclingas") in the writings of Bede in the early 8th century, and in an early 10th century Anglo-Saxon charter. Before the territory came under Mercian control around 660 it may have formed part of the province of the Middle Saxons, or it may have fallen under the influence of the Kingdom of Essex – neither is certain.
The name of the tribe comes from a personal name, meaning "the people of Wæcla". The tribe gave their name to Watling Street, the former Roman road from London to St Albans. The small town of Watlington in South Oxfordshire is also said to derive its name from the Waeclingas.
The tribal territory of the Waeclingas may have corresponded to the territory of the municipium of Verulamium, the Romano-British town that preceded St Albans. Together with the Brahhingas and the Hicce the Waeclingas were one of the most important tribes of the area that would later become the county of Hertfordshire, and its territory would evolve into some of the structures that would form the county's administrative framework.

Pekka Janhunen is a space physicist, astrobiologist, and inventor. Janhunen, Ph.D., is a Research Manager at Finnish Meteorological Institute's Space and Earth Observation Centre, and a visiting professor at University of Tartu, Estonia. He is also senior technical advisor at Aurora Propulsion Technologies, a startup company, operating in space sector. He studied theoretical physics at the University of Helsinki, and made his PhD on space plasma physics simulations in 1994. He has also published a theory on the origin of multicellular life. He is best known for his Electric Solar Wind Sail invention.
Research
The Electric Sail
The Electric Sail could enable travelling at speeds up to 100 km/s in space without any fuel consumption. With no major problems in any of the technical fields thus far, the planning of the first test mission has started, according to an article by Sciencedaily. In the same article, Sciencedaily wrote that "the electric solar wind sail developed by Dr. Pekka Janhunen might revolutionise travelling in space." Janhunen received funding for his electric solar wind sail research from Runar Bäckström foundation in 2005.
Steam balloons as rocket launch pads
Janhunen has proposed that steam balloons could be used to launch rockets and satellites from higher altitudes. According to Janhunen Steam balloons are a cost-effective way of lifting a rocket into the stratosphere. The method is considered to be safe as well as reducing the carbon footprint of future rocket launches, where as in the past the emissions alone had terrible implications for the climate.
Natural illumination solution for rotating space settlements
Janhunen has proposed a lighting solution for an O'Neill Cylinder. In Janhunen's concept sunlight is concentrated by cylindrical paraboloid concentrators and reflected by semi-toroidal and conical reflectors and controlled by local blinders to simulate earthlike diurnal and seasonal illumination cycles. The rural wall living cylinder is divided into 20 z-directed valleys which are in different phases of the light cycles. No moving parts are needed other than numerous and easily accessible local blinders that regulate light input into the valleys. The settlement rotates as a rigid body and the mass distribution is such that the rotation is passively stable.
Shielded Dumbbell L5 Settlement
A two-sphere dumbbell configuration design of a rotating settlement for a first-generation in-space habitat settlement. According to Janhunen the two-sphere configuration is chosen to minimize the radiation shielding mass which dominates the mass budget.
Ceres Space Station
Built in the orbit of dwarf planet Ceres, Janhunen's megasatellite structure would consist of many cylinders, each many kilometers in size. They would be mounted on a disc that is lit from above and below by sun mirrors. Ceres would supply the materials for the construction. According to Janhunen Ceres is best suited for such a project, because the surface of the dwarf planet contains nitrogen, which is needed it to create an Earth-like atmosphere. Such settlement could also be realized elsewhere, for example in the orbit of Mars, where its smaller moon Deimos would offer itself as a quarry. Or near Earth and Earth's moon, at Lagrange point L5.
Other research
Pekka Janhunen has mainly focused on planetary science. Some of the advances he has made in the field include "A three-dimensional stabilization mechanism for the auroral Farley-Buneman instability" and the suggestion to use electromagnetic ionosphere in global magnetohydrodynamic simulations

Sir Thomas Adams, 1st Baronet (1586 – 24 February 1667/1668) was the Lord Mayor of the City of London and a Member of Parliament for the City of London from 1654 to 1655 and 1656–1658.
Adams was born in 1586, at Wem, Shropshire, educated at Shrewsbury School and admitted as a sizar to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge University in 1600. He received his BA in 1605–6, and became a draper in London.
Civic career
In 1640, he was elected as sheriff, giving up his business, and applying himself to public affairs. He then served as Master of the Drapers' Company, sat as an alderman on the City of London Corporation, and was president of St Thomas' Hospital, which he probably saved from ruin, by discovering the frauds of a dishonest steward. In 1642 he became Colonel of the Blue Regiment, London Trained Bands. In 1645, he was elected Lord Mayor of the City of London, showing unusual disinterestedness, declining the financial advantages usually made by the sale of places which become vacant.
His loyalty to Charles I was so well known that at the start of the English Civil War his house was searched by parliamentary supporters, hoping to find the king there. The next year he was committed to the Tower, and detained for some time. However, at length he became the oldest alderman upon the bench, and was consequently dignified with the honourable title of father of the city. Sir Thomas sat as an MP for London from 1654 to 1655 and 1656–1658.
His affection for the king was such that during the exile of Charles II, he remitted him £10,000. On the restoration of the King Sir Thomas, then 74 years of age, was deputed by the city to accompany General Monck to Breda in the Netherlands, to accompany the king home. For his services the king knighted him at The Hague; and soon after the restoration advanced him to the dignity of a baronet, on 13 June 1661.
Later life
In his latter years he was afflicted with kidney stones, which hastened his death. After his death a stone was taken from his body, weighing 25 ounces (1.5 lb, or 0.7 kg), which is preserved in a laboratory at Cambridge. He seemed perfectly prepared for death, often saying "Solum mihi superest sepulchrum" ("All my business is to fit me for the grave"). His funeral sermon was preached by Dr. Hardy, at St Katherine Cree Church, before his children and many of his relations. He was buried in a barrel vault excavated under the altar of St Mary and St Margaret Church, Sprowston, Norfolk, and a large marble monument was erected above it. His descendants enjoyed the title down to Sir Thomas Adams, the sixth baronet, who died a captain in the Royal Navy in 1770.
Legacy
Renowned as a public benefactor, in his lifetime Sir Thomas gave his house at Wem as a free-school (Thomas Adams School) to the town, and endowed it; he founded an Arabic professorship at Cambridge in 1643, and paid for the printing of the Gospels in Persian, and for sending them into the east. Despite suffering great losses in his estate, he left legacies to the poor of many parishes, to hospitals, and ministers' widows in his will.
His title and Sprowston estate passed to his eldest son William (1634–1687). His second son Richard is remembered for a collection of verse.

Rhegmatorhina is a genus of insectivorous passerine birds in the antbird family, Thamnophilidae.
The genus was introduced by the American ornithologist Robert Ridgway in 1888 with the bare-eyed antbird (Rhegmatorhina gymnops) as the type species. The name of the genus combines the Ancient Greek words rhēgma, rhēgmatos for "fissure" or "cleft" and rhis, rhinos for "nostril".
The genus contains the following species:
Bare-eyed antbird (Rhegmatorhina gymnops)
Harlequin antbird (Rhegmatorhina berlepschi)
White-breasted antbird (Rhegmatorhina hoffmannsi)
Chestnut-crested antbird (Rhegmatorhina cristata)
Hairy-crested antbird (Rhegmatorhina melanosticta)
These species are specialist ant-followers that depend upon swarms of army ants to flush insects and other arthropods out of the leaf litter.

Thamoddarit ( ; ; 76 – 152) was the legendary founder of Pagan Dynasty of Burma (Myanmar), who supposedly reigned from 107 to 152 CE. He was proclaimed as the founder of Pagan for the first time by Hmannan Yazawin, the Royal Chronicle of Konbaung Dynasty in 1832. The introduction of Thamoddarit, whose lineage Hmannan traces to the Sakya clan of the Buddha as the founder of Pagan, was part of the early Konbaung kings' efforts to move away from then prevailing pre-Buddhist origin narrative of the monarchy. Burmese chronicles down to the 18th century had traced to another legendary figure Pyusawhti, a descendant of a solar spirit and a dragon princess.
Legend
Out of Sri Ksetra
According to Hmannan, Thamoddarit was a nephew of Thupyinnya, the last king of Sri Ksetra Kingdom. In 94 CE, a civil war broke out between the Pyu and the Kanyan, two of the three main ethnic groups of the kingdom. (The Mranma (Burmans) were the third.) The Pyu initially emerged victorious over the Kanyan. But the victors soon broke into three rival groups, and a second round of war ensued. Taking advantage of the confusion, a fourth group, the Mon of Lower Burma drove all indigenous groups out of Sri Ksetra.
Wandering years
Thamoddarit led one of the refugee groups out of Sri Ksetra, and wandered on along the Irrawaddy for over a dozen years. They spent three years at Taungnyo near Sri Ksetra before they were driven out by the Mon. They spent another six years at Pantaung but the Kanyan drove them out. They then went to Mindon for another three years, and in 107 CE, finally stopped at the location of Pagan (Bagan). He incorporated nineteen villages in the area, and founded the city of Pagan. His dynasty became known as the Pagan Dynasty.
Reign
Thamoddarit had a long reign at Pagan. In the 22nd year of his reign, in 149 CE, a young man by the name of Pyusawhti became famous by performing daring feats. According to Hmannan, Pyusawhti was a descendant of the Second Tagaung Dynasty, ultimately from the first (mythical) Buddhist king of the world, Maha Sammata. But prior Burmese chronicles had identified him as a descendant of a solar spirit and a dragon princess. Thamoddarit married his daughter Thiri Sanda Dewi to Pyusawhti, and made him the heir apparent. He died three years later in 152 CE at the age of 76. Pyusawhti refused to take the throne; instead he gave the throne to his tutor Yathekyaung, who ruled until 167 CE.

Jean de Hangest, seigneur d'Yvoy, was a Protestant Huguenot military commander during the French Wars of Religion.
For the period between the death of his elder brother, Francois de Hangest Sieur de Genlis & d'Abbecourt, in 1569 and his own death in 1572, texts often refer to Jean as simply Genlis, as he assumed his brother's title. Confusingly, many texts use the name Genlis for the actions of first François and then Jean, without distinction.
A member of the Protestant Huguenot party, he became a principal lieutenant of Admiral de Coligny.
In 1562 defended town of Bourges for 20 days. However, the town was lost, causing the Prince Conde to lack confidence in both Jean and his brother François.
In 1570, Jean took Valenciennes for the Huguenots.
Encouraged by the King of France, Charles IX, to take the Protestant fight to the Netherlands, in 1572, Jean took 7,000 men to relieve the Spanish Siege of Mons, where he was taken captive, moved to Antwerp, and there he was strangled in his bed (11 July 1572).
As the family was heavily in debt, and they had to sell the lands and title Genlis to Pierre Brûlart.

Akuapim-Mampong is a town in the Akuapim North district of the Eastern Region of Ghana. It shares boundaries with Mamfe .It is famous for being the first place cocoa was planted in Ghana by Tetteh Quarshie
History
A 1772 Dutch report included the name Mampo (Mampong) in their records. This indicates that Mampong had been founded before 1772. The name Mampong might have been taken from the Shai village, Mankpon. Another tradition indicated that early settlers, after defeating an invading Asante army moved from an old settlement to a new one – the Damti shrine neighborhood. In jubilation, they uttered the Akan words "Yɛabedu ha yi de, yɛapɔn" Meaning, so far so good! Constant use of that phrase evolved to become Mampong.
The third probable reason for the name is the connection Mampong-Akuapem has with her Asante counterpart.
Mampong became famous when Tetteh Quarshie planted in 1879 some cocoa seeds in the town. He had brought them from Fernando Po. A plantation was set up in the 1890s to teach farmers the correct methods of raising the cocoa plant and other crops. Farmers of Mampong became the pioneers of the cocoa industry in Ghana.
July 7, 2017 Dr. Obadele Kambon, celebrated linguist, scholar, and professor at the University of Ghana at Legon, was enstooled as the Banmuhene Kyidɔmhene of Akuapem Mampɔn, (spelled as "Akuapim Mampong" throughout the rest of the article). He is the Banmuhene's king of the rear-guard for the Akuapem Mampɔn traditional area. He is the first person from the African diaspora to be given this prestigious honor. It's both a warrior title/role and a spiritual one.
Festival
The People of Mampong celebrate Ohum and this ceremony is usually held in September/October. Ohum is one of Ghana's many festivals that see attendance from people from all walks of life including the diaspora.
For many decades, the Ohum Festival has been a staple of Ghana's colourful, vibrant and diverse cultural expression, bringing together people from all walks of life to celebrate themes of victory, gratitude and harvest, in unity. However, even before Odwira became a part of Ghana's cultural landscape it had long been celebrated by the people of Abiriw, Dawu and Awukugua in the Eastern Region.
The Ohum festival is celebrated to mark the beginning of harvesting new farm crops, just like the Homowo of the Gas, Ahoboa and Bakatue of the Ahantas, and Aboakyere of the Awutus and Afutus, Kundum of the Fantes, Adaekese of the Ashantis, Hogbotsotso of Anlo (Ewes), Dambaa of the Dagombas, and Appoo of Brong-Ahafo.
Ohum is an ancient traditional festival of the people of Akuapem, particularly the Larteh and Okere people including Abiriw who are Guans.

Hoensbroek () is a Dutch town in the municipality of Heerlen. It is situated in the southeast of Limburg, a province in the southeast of the Netherlands. Until 1982, Hoensbroek was a separate municipality.
Hoensbroek is known for its medieval castle, Kasteel Hoensbroek, named after Knight Hoen, a member of the Hoen Family. It dates from around 1250.
Hoensbroek is also known for the fair on Ascension Day (Hemelvaartsdag). The fair brings as many as 100,000 people to the town, every year.
In medieval times, the town was known under the name of Gebrook, meaning as much as "Swampy Landscape", and belonged to the Family Hoen. Their family name eventually mingled with the original one, resulting in the name Hoensbroeck for the location and Van Hoensbroeck as the family name. The spoken dialect, Gerbrooker Plat, refers to the ancient name of Gebrook.
Recent history
Coal mining
The town remained modest until the early 20th century, when several mines were opened (including the Emma), caused a substantial increase in population. This necessitated the construction of new residential areas, with the result that Heerlen & Hoensbroek grew closer to each other.
Today
Hoensbroek & Heerlen now form a contiguous and built-up area. Only the tip, the former Oranje Nassau III mine, currently designed as a park, represents a kind of barrier between the towns. The mines in the area are now all closed, but many of the workers before landscaped areas still exist.
Transport
Railway station: Hoensbroek. The town can also be reached from Heerlen railway station and Sittard railway station.
Bus: The town can be reached by bus, in this city there are public buses from Veolia Transport(Limburg)

For the first time in the history of the South Korean football system, teams from professional leagues K League 1 and K League 2 were allowed to create reserve teams set to play in the K4 League, in order to give academy players and/or other registered players more playing time. The main condition for them is to have at least seven out of eleven players in the starting formation aged 23 or younger. At the end of January 2021, it was announced that Gangwon FC would be the first club to take advantage of this new rule, having founded a reserve team that was officially allowed to take part in the 2021 edition of K4 League.
Competition format
The 2021 K4 League is contested by sixteen teams, with no relegation system in place. Each team competes home and away, playing 30 games. The top two teams get promoted to the K3 League, while the third and the fourth placed teams qualify for the promotion play-off.

Giles Scott-Smith (born 1968, in High Wycombe, United Kingdom) is Dutch-British academic. He is a professor of transnational relations and new diplomatic history at Leiden University and serves as the dean of Leiden University College The Hague.
Previously, he was a Senior Researcher at the Roosevelt Study Center in Middelburg and was appointed as the Ernst van der Beugel Chair in the Diplomatic History of Atlantic Cooperation since World War II at the Leiden University.
Early life and education
Professor Scott-Smith holds both Dutch and British passports. After pursuing higher education in Britain, he moved to the Netherlands where he resides since 1996. Giles Scott-Smith received his BA in European and Asian studies from the University of Ulster in 1991, with a dissertation on the economic and political relations between the European Community and Japan, and he received an MA in international relations at Sussex University in 1993, with a dissertation on the concept of globalization in Sociology and International Relations. He then moved to Lancaster University for a PhD in international relations, where he wrote his dissertation "The Politics of Apolitical Culture: The United States, Western Europe, and the Post-War 'Culture of Hegemony', graduating in 1998. Since then he has been researching and teaching International Relations and Cold War History.
Career
After having received his PhD, Giles Scott-Smith was appointed as a lecturer at the International Relations Department of Webster University in Leiden, and at the Amsterdam School for International Relations (ASIR). He then joined the Roosevelt Study Center in Middelburg in January 2002 as a Post-Doctoral Researcher, working on the topic of the US State Department's Foreign Leader Program in Western Europe between the 1950s and the 1970s. In 2005 he became Senior Researcher at the Roosevelt Study Center, and in 2008 he joined the former Roosevelt Academy (today's University College Roosevelt), a small, undergraduate liberal arts college in Middelburg, where he served as Associate Professor of International Relations up to 2012. In 2009 he was awarded the Ernst van der Beugel Chair in the History of Transatlantic Diplomatic Relations since World War II, at Leiden University. In the past few years he has been particularly active both in collaborative research projects and in publishing, also serving as the convener of numerous conferences, workshops and seminars for PhD students.
Giles Scott Smith is the founder of the website "The Holland Bureau", established in December 2009 to provide commentary on the Dutch role in global affairs. He is also a regular columnist at the website DutchNews.nl
Work and research interests
Giles Scott-Smith's research interests involve an exploration of the 'Transnational Transatlantic' - tracking the governmental and non-governmental linkages that have bound North America and Europe since World War II. This has branched out in many directions over the years, including political communication and linkages between ideas, ideology and power, the 'cultural Cold War' US foreign policy, the Atlantic Community, public diplomacy, the role of private individuals and institutions and their connections with the state in domestic and transatlantic foreign affairs. More precisely, Giles Scott-Smith's work has delved into:
The political, economic, and cultural dimensions of transatlantic relations during and after the Cold War;
The role of NGOs and 'informal diplomacy' in international affairs;
The CIA, The Congress for Cultural Freedom (CCF), the 'cultural Cold War' between the East and the West, and the History of Intelligence.
The theory and practice of public diplomacy, particularly exchange programs;
Anti-Communist networks and the importance of transnational organizations and elites in global governance.

The music was composed by Bappi Lahiri. The song "Chidiya Chon Chon" is based on "Marianne" by Roaring Lion. The song "Thoda Resham Lagta Hai" had fallen into obscurity for over two decades, but gained national attention in 2002 when it was sampled by American producer DJ Quik for the Truth Hurts song "Addictive" which led to a legal dispute that was ultimately resolved. Shortly thereafter, the original song was remixed by Indian composer Harry Anand as "Kaliyon Ka Chaman", sung by Assamese singer Shaswati Phukan.

Antiprion drugs are drugs that work against prions. The discovery of antiprion drugs is a priority because prion diseases are untreatable and fatal. Therefore, it is a therapeutic priority to find effective anti-prion drugs.
Mechanism of action
The disease progression in prion diseases is probably due to the conformational change of the prion protein (PrP). PrP changes from alpha-helical conformation to a disease-associated, mainly beta-sheeted scrapie isoform (PrPSc), which forms amyloid aggregates. The drugs that contain N′-benzylidene-benzohydrazide core structure are likely to slow down this progression. Drugs that target PrPC, the normal prion isoform, are also hypothesized to delay the progression of prion diseases.

A number of historic communities in Buchanan County once appeared on state maps, but no longer exist. Hamerville was located east of Brandon at the intersection of Highway 150. Today, the site is the location of three farmhouses. Vista, once located between Brandon and Independence, appeared on maps frequently until the 1950s. This site is not even accessed by paved road. Kier, between Fairbank and Littleton, appeared on many maps in the 19th century and early 20th century. The area is now settled by Amish. Several towns named Middlefield existed southeast of Winthrop, but none are populated today. Newtonville was located a few miles south of Monti. The houses at Castleville were later moved to Aurora. Wise, once located between Independence and Jesup just north of Highway 939, was a train-stop between the 1920s and the 1950s. Little remains at the site. Kiene was founded in 1911 between Quasqueton and Monti, but was empty by 1955. Few or even no houses remain at any of these sites.

Iceland competed at the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 7 September to 18 September 2016. Jón Margeir Sverrisson earned the top placement of the team with a fourth place in men's 200 m freestyle S14.
Disability classifications
Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.

The German–Armenian Society (Armenian: Գերմանահայկական Հասարակություն, Germanahaykakan Hasarakut'yun; German: Deutsch-Armenische Gesellschaft, DAG) is a German–Armenian association, which is active above all in the promotion of the mutual understanding between Germans and Armenians and the keeping of the interests of Armenians living in Germany. The society also supports the rights and interests of Armenian minorities in Turkey and other countries of the Near East.
History
The German–Armenian Society was created 1914 by Johannes Lepsius, Paul Rohrbach and Avetik Isahakyan in Berlin. Lepsius was a first chairman of the association. The initiative for its establishment was the worsening situation of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire; one year later the Armenian genocide would begin. The society pursued the goal of independence and/or autonomy for the Armenian people. After the death of the later chairman Paul Rohrbach in 1956, the society was dissolved. In 1972 the society was revived in Frankfurt am Main. Today the society includes 274 members.
Since 1973 the association has published the quarterly magazine Armenisch-Deutsche Korrespondenz ("Armenian-German Correspondence"). The society has also published a number of books, including: 75 Years of the German-Armenian Society (Mainz, 1989), Phoenix From the Ashes: Armenia 80 Years After the Genocide (Frankfurt am Main, 1996), Armenia: History and Survival in a Difficult Environment (Frankfurt am Main, 1998), and Regarding Some Political and Legal Aspects of the Nagorno-Karabakh Problem (Frankfurt am Main, 1999).
The German–Armenian Society organizes various conferences and lectures and is member of the Association for the Study of Nationalities in the United States and the Institut für Auslandsbeziehungen in Stuttgart. The present chairman is Dr. Raffi Kantian.

Ernesto Rossi (27 March 1827 – 4 June 1896) was an Italian actor and playwright.
Early life and career
Rossi was born in Livorno to a middle-class family and was intending to study at the university there when he substituted for an actor in the Calloud theatre company who had become ill. After his successful performance, he continued performing with the company until it was dissolved in 1848. In 1852 he joined the Reale Sarda theatre company and became its leading actor. He toured Italy and Paris with Adelaide Ristori until personal differences led to the end of their theatrical partnership, and Majeroni became her leading man. Rossi went on to perform throughout Europe, including London, Vienna, Lisbon, and Moscow. He was particularly admired for his Shakespearean roles as Macbeth, King Lear, Romeo and Hamlet. Rossi also wrote several plays, the first of which, Adele, premiered with Adelaide Ristori in the title role.
In May 1896 he was playing King Lear in Odessa when he fell ill and was brought back to Italy, where he died a few weeks later in Pescara.

John Munroe (1796 – 26 April 1861) was a United States soldier who was military governor of New Mexico between 1849 and 1851.
Early career
John Munroe was born in Scotland about 1796. He graduated from West Point in 1814, and was assigned to the artillery. He served in the War of 1812 and Seminole Wars.
Munroe was chief of artillery under General Zachary Taylor in the Mexican–American War of 1846–1847. During the occupation of Mexico City he became an original member of the Aztec Club of 1847.
By order of 26 May 1849, Brevet Colonel John Munroe was ordered to Santa Fe to relieve Brevet Lieutenant Colonel John M. Washington.
Munroe became military governor of New Mexico in October 1849.
Governor of New Mexico
Munroe was out of his depth as governor of New Mexico, and ran into severe administrative problems.
New Mexico had been under military rule since it was occupied by the United States in 1846.
By 1850, although there were strongly opposed political factions in New Mexico, most were united in opposing the continued military government. Munroe convened a constitutional assembly in May, which ratified a constitution by 6,771 votes to 39.
The constitution envisaged New Mexico as being a State. On 18 July 1850 the U.S. Senate received a copy of Munroe's report dated 13 May 1850 telling them that the elections had been held and he was optimistic about the outcome of the convention.
On 7 June 1850 Henry Clay (who had not yet heard of these events) spoke in the Senate on the subject of the Texas territorial claims in New Mexico.
Towards the end of his speech he said of Munroe, "... who now holds in his hands perhaps the destinies of Santa Fe and New Mexico. He looks on wholly indifferent, and is neutral in the struggle about to arise of the people of Santa Fe, composed, I understand, of American citizens, Mexicans and Spaniards, this side of the Rio del Norte, and the authorities of Texas. And this neutrality is to be kept by ... the lieutenant colonel, who has the dealing out of civil commissions, acting ... as if he were the Autocrat of the Russias."
The constitution, modelled on other recently formed states, included a clause that prohibited slavery.
It was adopted on 20 June 1850, and state officers were elected.
Henry Connelly was elected Governor and Manuel Alvarez Lieutenant-governor.
Since Connelley was absent in the States, Alvarez assumed the position of Acting Governor.
However, Colonel Munroe forbade the assumption of civil power by the elected officials.
The result was a deadlock that lasted for several months.
On 9 September 1850 the U.S. Senate passed a compromise bill that included an act to organize a government for New Mexico as a territory, and this overrode the state legislature.
James S. Calhoun was appointed governor with effect as of 3 March 1851, succeeding John Munroe.
Later years
John Munroe continued serving in the Army until his death on 26 April 1861 in New Brunswick, New Jersey.

Barrett Gibson Lyon (born March 18, 1978) is an American Internet entrepreneur.
Early life and education
The son of a lawyer, Lyon was raised in Auburn, California. Although he initially struggled in school due to dyslexia, in middle school he became fascinated with computers. He soon found that the methods he used to overcome dyslexia allowed him to quickly gain an expert knowledge of computers. While in high school, he set up Linux servers to host webpages for friends and also managed his school's computer network. In 1995, while investigating a possible vulnerability in Network Solutions he accidentally caused AOL's website to go down for three days. After high school, Lyon enrolled at California State University, Sacramento and studied philosophy and photography. He has a wife named Simone Lyon and a daughter named Isabella Lyon.
Opte Project
Lyon is the creator of the Opte Project, which is an Internet mapping project that seeks to make an accurate representation of the extent of the Internet using visual graphics. The project was started in October 2003 in an effort to provide a useful Internet map with open source code. The project has gathered support worldwide and is part of the catalogs of the Boston Museum of Science and The Museum of Modern Art.
Prolexic
While working part-time in college for a small network security company, Lyon worked on defending websites against Denial of Service attacks. He soon decided to start Prolexic Technologies to specifically focus on defending websites against such attacks. His initial customers were online casinos which were facing extortionist threats from operators of Denial of Service attacks. After helping bring a Russian hacker to justice, Lyon's publicity allowed him to gain many new clients from outside of the gambling industry. He soon began giving talks about botnets and DoS attacks at industry meetings. Lyon eventually left Prolexic to start BitGravity. Prolexic was later sold to Akamai Technologies, a Content Delivery Network based in the Boston for $370 million.
DoS investigation
Lyon has been called a hero for his work tracking Russian denial of service attack extortion groups. His work has been featured around the globe and is featured in the book Fatal System Error. He provided details and helped coordinate with multinational law enforcement groups which resulted in the capture of Ivan Maksakov, Alexander Petrov, and Denis Stepanov. The three men were at the heart of an extortion ring which was extorting money from banks, Internet casinos, and other web based businesses. Reported damages caused by Maksakov, Petrov, and Stenanov range in the tens of millions of dollars. On October 8, 2007, Maksakov, Petrov, Stenanov were found guilty and sentenced to eight years in prison in the Russian Federation with a 100,000 ruble penalties.
Business interests
After leaving Prolexic, Lyon co-founded of BitGravity, a content delivery network and served as its chief technology officer. BitGravity focuses on providing content delivery for rich media sources. While at BitGravity, to lessen billing confusion regarding the definition of a GigaByte, Lyon defined an accepted billing amount, coined as the BarretByte.
Lyon left BitGravity in June 2009. BitGravity was acquired in January 2011 by Tata Communications.
In 2009 with funding from Jay Adelson and Kevin Rose, he founded XDN. XDN's first products provide businesses with greater control over existing Content Delivery Networks by allowing them to use CDN's based on factors like price and service. In November 2012, XDN was acquired by Fortinet.
Lyon then founded Defense.Net in December 2012 to build a DDoS defense network for the modern Internet. In 2014, the company was named one of the 100 Hottest Private Companies in North America by Red Herring and acquired shortly after by F5 Networks purportedly for between $50 and $100 million.
Lyon formerly worked as Head of Security Research and Development for Neustar. He has operated a Laser Production company along with designing camping equipment for Alien Buffalo. Recently he announced a new venture Netography and currently serves as Chief Architect, with seed funding from Andreesson Horowitz and Mango Capital.

Radiator Hospital is an American indie rock band. Though songwriter Sam Cook-Parrott (vocals/guitar) is from Grand Rapids, Michigan, they are now based in Philadelphia. The rest of the current lineup is Cynthia Schemmer (guitar/vocals), Jon Rybicki (bass), and Jeff Bolt (drums). They have released six albums; two out of print lo-fi cassettes, and four LPs put out by Salinas Records.
History
After Sam Cook-Parrott's high school band ended, he started recording solo material with a four-track tape recorder. He named the project after an auto body shop in Grand Rapids. Radiator Hospital released their first full-length album in 2010 titled My Most Imaginary Friend.
In September 2012, after a few years of regional shows and some minimal touring, Cook-Parrott relocated to Philadelphia, moving into a house with members of Swearin' and other punk bands. This is where the current full band Radiator Hospital lineup settled, also featuring guitarist/vocalist Cynthia Schemmer, bassist Jon Rybicki, and drummer Jeff Bolt.
Their first official full-length, Something Wild, was released in the summer of 2013 on Salinas Records. It was recorded partially in the same lo-fi manner as earlier cassettes, but added a more studio honed production sound (provided by Swearin' guitarist/vocalist Kyle Gilbride) on the more energetic full-band songs.
Their next album Torch Song, also recorded with Gilbride, was released in 2014. In 2017 Radiator Hospital released Play the Songs You Like, which had been recorded by Jeff Zeigler.
Latest release Sings 'Music For Daydreaming''' came out in early 2019. It was also recorded with Zeigler and is the first full length album credited to Radiator Hospital to be performed entirely by Cook-Parrott since 2011.
Radiator Hospital's recorded output often features collaborations with other vocalists, such as Allison and Katie Crutchfield, Maryn Jones, and Elaiza Santos. Likewise Cook-Parrott has contributed to recordings by Waxahatchee, Japanese Breakfast and Allison Crutchfield.

The Commanding General of United States Army Pacific (CG USARPAC or CG, USARPAC) is the commander of United States Army Pacific, the army service component command of the United States Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM). As CG USARPAC, the officeholder is responsible for United States Army forces stationed within INDOPACOM's area of operations, including Hawaii, South Korea and Japan. United States Army Alaska was initially under CG USARPAC's authority until it was transferred to United States Northern Command.
The current Commanding General, United States Army Pacific is General Charles A. Flynn, who succeeded General Paul LaCamera in a change of command ceremony on June 3, 2021. He is the 37th commanding general since the formation of USARPAC as a regional command, the 13th since the creation of its current iteration, and the 9th since its designation as a service component command in 2000.
Rank
When the modern iteration of USARPAC was created, the holder of the position was a three-star lieutenant general. In July 2013, USARPAC transitioned into a four-star command with the confirmation of Vincent K. Brooks to the position "to broaden political-military aims through increased shaping activities and building partner capacity in the USARPAC area of responsibility".

History
Pre-Partition (1857-1947)
The Eastern Bengal Railway company was formed in 1857 for the construction and working of a line from Calcutta to Dacca, with a branch to Jessore. The construction of the long broad gauge line began in 1859 and was completed in stages up to Kushtia by 1864 but the planned branch to Jessore was not built. The company also acquired a steam vessel service operating between Kushtia and Dacca on the Padma river. In 1871 the line was extended from Poradaha to a new ferry terminal at Goalundo Ghat, about east of Kushtia and reducing the river trip to Dacca. and becoming the main line of the Eastern section of EBR. With the successful construction and opening of the Hardinge Bridge in 1915 and gauge conversion of the Santahar–Parbatipur–Siliguri line from 1924 to 1926, the Calcutta–Siliguri broad gauge line was completed and became the main line of the Eastern section of EBR.
The Bengal Central Railway company constructed two broad gauge lines: one connecting Ranaghat and Bangaon () in 1882 and the other connecting Dum Dum with Khulna (now in Bangladesh), via Bangaon () which opened in stages and was completed in 1884. These lines were merged with Eastern Bengal Railway in 1904, with the Sealdah–Bangaon–Jessore–Khulna line becoming the main line of the Central section of EBR.
The Martin's Light Railways company constructed and opened the long, narrow gauge Ranaghat–Krishnanagar Light Railway line from Aistalaghat (near Ranaghat on the right bank of Churni river) to Krishnanagar via Shantipur in 1899. This line was amalgamated with EBR on 1 July 1904. EBR further extended the line from Krishnanagar to Nabadwip Ghat and opened the line for traffic from 30 June 1926. EBR further built a long broad gauge extension from Ranaghat to the left bank of Churni River on 1902. In 1925 an alternate broad gauge line was built from Kalinarayanpur (Churni Bridge) to Shantipur and the old gauge line between Shantipur and Aistola Ghat was abandoned.
MLR also constructed and opened a long narrow gauge line from Barasat to Basirhat in 1905, known as the Barasat–Basirhat Light Railway . It was further extended via Taki to Hasnabad (Chingrighata) in 1909. A long extension was built from Beliaghata Bridge on the Barasat–Basirhat line to Patipukur in 1910. This was further extended to Belgachia in 1914 and was known as the Shyambazar Branch.
The long Murshidabad Branch railway was constructed by EBR from Ranaghat to Lalgola Ghat in stages from 1905 to 1907.
Post-Partition (1947-)
Post partition of India in 1947, the Eastern and Central sections of EBR were divided between India and East Pakistan. The direct connection between South Bengal and North Bengal was affected as the Calcutta–Siliguri line was snapped resulting in Haldibari–Chilahati and Gede–Darsana becoming international transit points for trains. In the Central section, Petrapole railway station was created as the terminus on the Indian side while the Benapole railway station became the terminus in the East Pakistani side of the line. The Barisal Express, launched in 1884, from Sealdah to Khulna continued post-partition until rail services between the two countries were suspended due to the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965.
The Barasat–Basirhat Light Railway closed down in 1955 due to increasing losses. However a new broad gauge line was built in a new alignment between Barasat and Hasnabad from 1957 to 1962. The Shyambazar branch line was abandoned.
The gauge conversion of the Shantipur–Krishnanagar City–Nabadwip Ghat line to broad gauge began on 2010. The electrified broad gauge line between Shantipur and Krishnanagar City was opened for service in 2012. The construction of the rest of the section along with a new bridge over the Ganges river is blocked due to land disputes.
Electrification
The Sealdah Main and North section lines are fully electrified with 25 kV AC overhead system. The electrification process started in 1963 from to . The Ranaghat–Shantipur and Ranaghat–Krishnanagar City lines were electrified in 1964. The ACCL and Kalyani Simanta branch lines were electrified in 1972 and 1979 respectively.
EMU Carsheds
The Sealdah North section is primarily served by 9-car EMU rakes from the Narkeldanga EMU Carshed. It was originally a steam locoshed which was transformed into an EMU carshed in 1963 alongwith the facility to maintain electric locomotives as well. As of December 2021, it contains 29 9-car EMU rakes, a few of which served the Sealdah South section mostly via the Circular line, while the rest served the Sealdah North section.
To handle the increased traffic requirements of the Sealdah–Bangaon, Barasat–Hasnabad and Ranaghat–Bangaon lines, a new EMU carshed was opened in Barasat in 1990. In 2018, three phase IGBT based 12-car EMU rakes were introduced in this carshed. As of December 2021, the shed contains 8 9-car EMU rakes and 25 12-car EMU rakes, 6 of which are three phase IGBT based.
In 2007, a new EMU carshed was commissioned in Ranaghat to cater to the increased traffic requirements in the Ranaghat–Gede, Ranaghat–Lalgola and Ranaghat–Shantipur–Krishnanagar City lines. MEMU services were also introduced in 2012 between Sealdah and Lalgola. As of December 2021, the shed contains 15 12-car EMU rakes and 5 MEMU rakes of which one is a 8-car rake while the rest are 12-car rakes.

Joseph Maselli (May 30, 1924 - October 18, 2009) was a businessman, philanthropist, and American-Italian activist. Maselli was the founder and publisher of the Italian American Digest. Maselli also founded the American Italian Museum and the Louisiana American Italian Sports Hall of Fame (now known as the American Italian Cultural Center) as well as the American Italian Federation of the Southeast, the first umbrella organization of Italian American groups in the region and now consisting of 30 organizations.
Early life, education and military service
Maselli was born in Newark, New Jersey to Francesco and Maria (née Ianetta) Maselli. His father immigrated to the United States from Deliceto, in the region of Puglia, Italy, and his mother from San Giorgio a Liri in the region of Lazio, Italy. He was the couple's first child and elder brother to Carmine and Domenick. He spent his childhood in Belleville, New Jersey. As a youth, he participated in a number of sports, including baseball, billiards, boxing, and ping pong. He was an avid philatelist and fan of the Lone Ranger. He graduated from Belleville High School in 1942 and matriculated at Rutgers University.
After briefly studying at Rutgers University, Maselli enlisted in the US Army at the start of World War II. He was stationed at Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri and was later transferred to Camp Plauche outside of New Orleans. His duties mainly consisted of administrative work in the transportation corps, and he rose to the rank of sergeant. For his service, he was awarded the Good Conduct Medal.
Maselli attained a degree in Commercial Science at Tulane University in 1950, completing his course of study in three years. Throughout his studies, he continued to work full time and support his growing family.
Business
Maselli opened his first liquor store after graduating from Tulane. His business grew and expanded into City Wholesale Liquor Co. and has been in continuous operation for 70 years. His other primary business interests included commercial real estate.
American Italian activism
By age 50, Maselli turned his attention towards civic and philanthropic endeavors.
In the early 1970s, Maselli partnered with New Orleans Mayor Maurice Edwin “Moon” Landrieu in creating the Piazza d'Italia, a “people place” that has garnered many architectural awards and hosted numerous events.
In 1973 Maselli founded the Italian American Digest.
He oversaw the creation of the Italian Village exhibit at the 1984 World's Fair. He founded the American-Italian Renaissance Foundation in 1985. He made a point of using the term “American-Italian” instead of the more common “Italian-American” to emphasize that, first and foremost, he and his fellow New Orleanians of Italian origin were Americans. Maselli served as the foundation's first director.
He founded the Louisiana American Italian Sports Hall of Fame in 1985.
Throughout his life, Maselli sponsored and supported many amateur athletic teams, from little league to the US Olympic Boxing Team.
He created the Italian-American Federation of the Southeast in the early 1970s, combining more than 30 civic groups under one umbrella organization.
In 1992, Maselli chaired the Louisiana Quincentenary Commission arranging for replicas of Christopher Columbus' three ships, the Nina, the Pinta, and the Santa Maria, to stop for exhibition at the Mississippi riverfront, enabling over 100,000 people to visit the ships.
Maselli provided narration for the WYES documentary “Italian New Orleans” and appeared in numerous television shows in the United States and in Italy speaking about Italian American culture. He also provided narration for the A&E documentary on the Italian immigrant experience in New Orleans.
Civic activities
Maselli served as a board member of the New Orleans Aviation Board, French Market Board, State Ethics Commission, and Metropolitan Crime Commission.
Maselli also served as an ethnic affairs advisor to U.S. Presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan, and Bush.
Author
Along with co-author Dominic Candolero, Maselli published "Italians in New Orleans" in 1995.
Honors and awards
In 1978 Maselli was made a Knight Grand Officer in the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (Grande Ufficiale Ordine al Merito della Repubblica Italiana.)
In 1989 he was awarded the Weiss Award by the National Conference of Christians and Jews.
In 1990, Maselli was awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in recognition of the significant impact Maselli made on his community through a lifetime of service.
In 2007 the Anti-Defamation League bestowed their Torch of Liberty Award upon Maselli.
Personal
Maselli met Antoinette Cammarata at a local USO club show on his first night in town upon being stationed at Camp Plauche in 1945. Antoinette was singing with the band. They were married in 1946 and had four children, Joseph Jr., Frank, Jan, and Michael, and nine grandchildren. Maselli's son Frank has continued in his father's activist footsteps as chairman of the AICC.

Klondike Sunset Casino is a locals casino located on of land at 444 West Sunset Road, west of Boulder Highway, in Henderson, Nevada.
It was initially owned by Tom Yarbrough, who opened it as Tom's Sunset Casino on August 2, 1989. The casino closed in January 1998, due to financial losses and new competition. John Woodrum purchased the casino and reopened it as the Klondike Sunset Casino in October 1999, after a $5 million renovation. The casino was a sister property to Woodrum's Klondike Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip in nearby Paradise, Nevada.
After Woodrum's death in 2014, the casino was closed and sold to Carl Giudici, whose plans to renovate and reopen the casino failed to materialize. Bruce Familian and Jon Athey purchased the casino in December 2015, and reopened it on August 3, 2016, after an eight-month renovation.
History
Tom's Sunset Casino (1989–1999)
In July 1988, Southwest Equities was approved for a limited gaming license for Tom's Sunset Casino, with 243 slot machines and five table games. Shortly thereafter, ownership was transferred to Yarlow, Inc., owned by Thomas Yarbrough, who had to apply for a new gaming license to operate the casino. By that point, new ordinances had been passed which would require the construction of a 200-room hotel to meet approval for a limited gaming license. In July 1989, a city attorney recommended that Yarbrough be approved for a limited gaming license despite the new ordinances, as the property had already been approved prior to the changes. However, the casino would have to add 120 hotel rooms if it were to expand, according to the ordinances.
Tom's Sunset Casino opened on August 2, 1989, with over 240 slot machines and a restaurant. The casino featured the Sunset Slot Seekers club, and was the only Henderson casino to offer a club to regular customers. An official grand opening was scheduled for October 7, 1989. In January 1990, the casino introduced its free "Fun Bus" service. In July 1990, Yarbrough was approved for a addition to the casino, which would include the removal of existing buildings already on the property. Possible amenities that would be added in the expansion included a video game arcade, a gift shop, a snack bar, and a sports book.
The renovation, costing more than $1 million, began in May 1993, with the demolition of an east-facing wall. The expansion was to add , including a three-story façade, with the third floor being non-functional. Other plans included a 38-foot lighted exterior sign, two new entrances, 100 new slot machines, and a new southwestern theme. A grand reopening was scheduled for August 2, 1993, the casino's four-year anniversary. Other expansions included a horseshoe-shaped bar and a larger lounge. In 1997, the casino offered proposition betting, and was among nine other Las Vegas casinos to offer SportXction, a new interactive betting system.
The casino closed on January 12, 1998, partially because of competition from the new, nearby Sunset Station. For 18 months prior to its closure, monthly profits had declined from $650,000 to $275,000, with a 35 percent decrease in customer attendance. Sports book losses were another reason for the closure, as Yarbrough owed more than $150,000 in sports wagers at the casino and three other sports books that he owned, but lacked the funds to pay off the debts.
Following the closure, 92 employees were laid off. The casino had featured 219 video poker machines at the time, while its small restaurant had become known for its $1.99 breakfast specials. Industry observers felt that the closed casino would need to expand and add amenities such as a pool and hotel in order to compete.
Klondike Sunset Casino (1999–present)
In September 1998, John Woodrum, a longtime friend of Yarbrough, purchased the property for $1.4 million in a foreclosure auction. That month, Woodrum announced that the casino would be reopened as the Klondike Sunset Casino, which was expected to employ approximately 150 people upon opening. Woodrum hoped to have the casino opened as early as December 31, 1998, although the opening date was contingent on when the casino would receive approval for gambling and liquor licenses. Woodrum's intended New Year's Eve opening was delayed as he awaited approval of a state gaming license. Woodrum invested $5 million to renovate the building, which included an expansion of the casino's bar.
The Klondike Sunset Casino opened on October 1, 1999. It was Woodrum's second casino property, and a sister property to his Klondike Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip in nearby Paradise, Nevada. Woodrum chose not to add a hotel to the property, opting instead to focus on the locals market. Woodrum's Klondike property on the Las Vegas Strip attracted a clientele consisting mostly of senior citizens and Henderson residents who preferred smaller casinos. Woodrum hoped to attract Henderson residents to his new property with coupons for free food and drinks.
At the time of its opening, the Klondike Sunset Casino consisted of a building and featured an Alaskan wilderness theme. The casino, approximately , included 360 video poker and slot machines, as well as three blackjack tables and a roulette table. The casino offered $2 minimum blackjack and 25-cent roulette, both considered rare at that time.
At approximately 4:00 a.m. on December 30, 1999, two masked gunmen robbed the casino's change cage and then fled with an undisclosed amount of money. Approximately 30 people were present, many of whom were not aware that it was a robbery until police arrived. Another robbery occurred at approximately 1:45 a.m. on March 21, 2002, when two men armed with handguns and assault rifles took approximately $7,700 from a cashier. A third man was waiting outside the casino in a vehicle. After a short chase, one of the three suspects was apprehended. In February 2004, the casino planned to add a staffed Leroy's sports book. In April 2004, Leroy's was approved to place betting kiosk terminals at the casino. The sports book began operating in June 2004.
The casino was known for its cheap restaurant specials, and appealed to customers who preferred smaller casinos. John Woodrum's son, Michael Woodrum, primarily operated the business. During the 2000s, Michael Woodrum was also a principal owner of the casino, although John Woodrum continued to retain ownership as well. In 2006, Michael Woodrum speculated that the casino's future was financially secure: "The area out here is growing fast and because of ordinances, you're not going to see any more little casinos opening up out here. I think the future's bright." Many employees from the Klondike Hotel and Casino, closed in June 2006, were expected to be transferred to the Klondike Sunset Casino.
By July 2008, the casino was struggling financially due to an economic downturn. The Las Vegas Sun reported that the casino would "be lucky" if it could produce a profit of $5 million that year; it had previously generated $7.5 million two years earlier. The Woodrum family, which spent $1 million to keep the business operational, acknowledged that the casino would probably no longer be around in another decade, as they planned to eventually sell the property when it became valuable enough. At that time, the casino had 300 slot machines and eight table games. In February 2012, the casino was among seven other business cited for a first-time offense of making alcohol sales to minors.
In June 2012, Its Gotta Go LLC filed a lawsuit against Klondike Sunset LLC, claiming the casino's owners breached an agreement from a month earlier to sell the property. Its Gotta Go had agreed to pay $3.56 million for the casino. According to the lawsuit, Its Gotta Go put $100,000 into escrow but faced problems as it was not yet licensed as a casino operator. Its Gotta Go accused the casino's owners of refusing to either agree to a lease agreement to continue operating the casino with its nonrestricted gaming license, or to extend the time for Its Gotta Go to obtain a gaming license.
In February 2013, the casino was found to be in violation of state regulations, as its minimum bankroll was $25,706 short, which could have prevented it from paying off potential customer winnings. As a result, the casino's table games were removed and its number of slot machines was decreased from 300 to 65. The casino's sports book was subsequently closed in June 2013.
John Woodrum died in January 2014. In March 2014, the Nevada Gaming Control Board filed an eight-count complaint against the casino, which was cited for continued violations of failing to maintain a minimum bankroll. Ellen Woodrum John Woodrum's wife and the current casino owner reached a tentative agreement that month with the Gaming Control Board to file weekly bankroll reports with the state for a year. A stipulation between Woodrum and the Gaming Control Board was approved the following month.
Closure and reopening
The casino, still financially struggling, was closed on August 15, 2014, during a pending sale to Carl Giudici's CG Enterprises. Giudici had previously owned many other casinos. The sale was finalized in September 2014. That month, Giudici received approval from the Henderson City Council for the casino to retain its zoning for a nonrestricted gaming business license and for a nonrestricted gaming liquor license for up to a year during its closure, allowing it to remain closed during that period for renovations. Giudici had planned to reopen the casino as The Mint. Giudici's first casino opened in Sparks, Nevada, in 1984 was also named The Mint Casino.
In June 2015, Giudici said renovations had been delayed because of recent health problems, which limited his free time. As a result, much of Giudici's time was spent primarily on selling his Club Fortune casino, although he hoped to use the profits from the sale to finish renovations on The Mint. Giudici expected to have the casino reopened on April 2, 2016. Because of unforeseen circumstances, CG Enterprises was unable to proceed with its renovation plans, and sold the casino to Bruce Familian and Jon Athey in December 2015. In March 2016, a $542,000 renovation was being planned.
After an extensive and lengthy renovation, the Klondike Sunset Casino reopened on the night of August 3, 2016, with a special VIP opening held at 6:00 p.m., followed by an opening to the general public at 9:00 p.m. The casino employed approximately 70 people at that time, and exclusively featured slot machines, with no table games. The Klondike Sunset Casino was the first new casino to open in the Las Vegas Valley since the SLS Las Vegas in August 2014. The casino opened with 225 slot machines, and an expanded 24-hour restaurant known as Sarah's Kitchen, named after Familian's wife. A small sports book was expected to open inside the casino in October 2016.
Nevada Gaming Partners LLC, Familian's company which opened and operated the casino, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2016. In October 2017, Nevada Gaming Partners' bankruptcy was converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation due to a halt in a dispute among creditors regarding Familian's continued operation of the casino. After the bankruptcy change, Familian and Las Vegas attorney Brian Shapiro were preparing to sell the casino through an auction but they wanted to keep it open during the process. On November 30, 2017, the Nevada Gaming Commission held an emergency meeting and unanimously approved Shapiro to take over as a bankruptcy trustee for Nevada Gaming Partners and to continue operating the casino, which had been scheduled to close that night and cause the termination of approximately 50 employees. The casino's auction had been scheduled for December 19, 2017. In February 2018, Giudici planned to buy back the casino from Familian, with the sale expected to be complete by March. The casino's long-awaited sports book, operated by William Hill, opened in March 2018.

Harding Senior High School is a public comprehensive high school located on the East Side of Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States. The school is one of the nine high schools in the Saint Paul Public School District and is the largest high school in the city of Saint Paul, with enrollment at approximately 1,908. The school was opened in 1926 as the second high school on the East Side, after Johnson Senior High School. Harding is part of the IB Diploma Programme. Harding is a member of the Minnesota State High School League and the athletic teams compete in the Saint Paul City Conference.
Education
Harding Senior High School was one of several schools participating in smaller learning communities. In a somewhat similar fashion to specific colleges within the University of Minnesota, smaller learning communities were implemented in the 2002–2003 school year to group students that had similar interests together for a career. Freshmen were automatically placed in the 9th Grade Academy, and the following year, select to be in the Academy of Fine Arts, the Medical and Environmental Sciences Academy (MESA), the Human Services Academy, or the Science, Engineering, & Information Technology Academy (SEIT). However, the Academies have been facing difficulties with the large student body and change has been slow. While academic performance has improved over the past few years, there was not enough data to associate the increase with smaller learning communities.
There was a limit of 500 students per academy, which presented a dilemma with the Academy of Fine Arts who have had to reject a number of students. A possible cause is the large base of students involved in some form of fine arts. Another challenge is scheduling students to just their academy teachers.
In 2009 the music listening team made up of Matt Howard, Maivboon Vang, and Colton Moyer, took home a second-place finish at the state competition, this was after placing first in sections. The previous year Matt Howard, Connie Sinks, and Colton Moyer, took second in sections and advanced to state. The state placing team of 2009 was featured in the Star Tribune.
One student from the class of 2006 was the recipient of the Gates Millennium Scholarship, five Harding alumni were named KARE-11 Academic All-Stars and one received a WCCO-TV outstanding graduate award.
Electives
Athletics
Harding's athletic program offers several sports. The girls badminton team have dominated the sport in the decade of 20002009, winning eight state titles (2000, 2002–2004, 2006–2009) in ten years and becoming the first school to win four consecutive team titles. No other Harding sport has won a state title.
In the spring of 2005, freshman Sade Pollard won state titles in the 100-meter and 200-meter dashes. In 2006, she swept all of the sprinting events, taking home state titles in the 100m, 200m and 400m runs. She was the only competitor from Harding to participate in the state meet that year, but scored enough points to give Harding a third-place finish in the state tournament. Pollard won the 200m and 400m dashes again in the 2007 state meet.
In the spring of 2002, Sheila Emms broke the Minnesota single season record for strikeouts as a high school fastpitch softball pitcher. During her final season as a Harding Knight she struck out a staggering 353 batters and pitched seven perfect games. Following her high school career she was offered a full tuition scholarship to pitch for Illinois State University.
All sports are offered for both boys and girls, with exceptions for football, gymnastics, volleyball, wrestling and badminton. Other sports include soccer, tennis, swimming, cross-country, baseball/softball, Nordic skiing, basketball, hockey and golf.
Its chief rival is Johnson Senior High School, also located on the east side of Saint Paul. Both football teams have an annual regular-season game where they play for the Hatchet trophy.
A number of student athletes have, after graduating, found success in collegiate sports (See notable alumni section).
Extracurricular activities
In addition to sports, Harding offers several, non-athletic related activities for students. They include, but are not limited to, Korean Club, S.E.A. Club, Speech Team, Upward Bound, Comic Club, Music Listening, Harry Potter Club, BOOK CLUB, Madrigals Chamber Choir, Jazz Band, Fresh Force, Math Team, Chess Club, Japanese Club, NHS, Student Council, Earth Club, ASAP, FIRST Robotics, etc. Harding High school also has a Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers Jr. Chapter. l
Miscellaneous
Upon the death of comedian Mitch Hedberg, students ran several pictures of him in student of the month columns for various academies along with the inscription "Mitch Hedberg, R.I.P. 1968-2005," to honor him. Hedberg graduated from Harding in 1986.

Giuseppe "Joseph" Ida (; 6 November 1890 − 1970s) was the head of the Philadelphia Mafia during the 1940s and 1950s, following the death of Giuseppe Dovi in 1946. Ida retired and returned to Italy in 1959, leaving the title of boss of the Philadelphia crime family to Angelo Bruno.
Early life
Giuseppe Ida was born on 6 November 1890 in Fiumara, a municipality in Calabria, Italy. In 1919 Ida came to America, settled in South Philadelphia and was naturalized. There he met the head Salvatore Sabella, the sub-boss John "Nazzone" Avena and the consigliere Giuseppe "Joe Bruno" Dovi of the local organization. In 1927, Ida, Sabella and three other gangsters were charged with the murder of two of their rivals, but none of the accused was convicted.
Rise to power
Sabella retired in 1931 and John Avena headed the organization until he was murdered in a drive-by shoot in the summer of 1936, and Giuseppe Dovi became the new boss. Ida was named the new underboss by Dovi. In 1946, Dovi died of natural causes in a hospital in New York City and Ida was appointed new head by the so-called Mafia Commission.
Under his leadership, the family gained far more power; he had driven the Jewish mobsters out of their territories, putting an end to the Jewish mob in Philadelphia and South Jersey.
Ida and his organization were heavily influenced by the bosses of the five families; the Luciano crime family in particular sought to influence the activities of other families. As the Philadelphia family gained more power in Atlantic City and southern Jersey, it was already seen as a larger faction of the Luciano family, under the influence of Underboss Vito Genovese.
Ida and his under boss Dominick "Big Dom" Oliveto were among the around 100 mafia members who took part in the legendary Apalachin meeting in 1957; a gathering of almost all the bosses of the American Cosa Nostra in November 1957, which took place in the community of Apalachin in the State of New York and was stormed by the local police. A total of 62 people were briefly arrested and identified; including Ida and Oliveto. Oliveto withdrew and shortly after Ida was charged with drug trafficking and fled to Italy in 1958.
During his absence, Oliveto's successor Antonio Pollina appointed acting boss; however, was deposed by the commission in 1959 and Angelo "The Gentle Don" Bruno was appointed new boss of the family.

Sir Francis Murphy (1809 – 30 March 1891) was an Australian politician, first Speaker of the Victorian Legislative Assembly.
Life
Murphy was the son of Francis D. Murphy, who was for upwards of thirty years head of the South of Ireland Transport of Convicts Department. Francis was born in Cork, Ireland, in 1809, and after being educated in his native city, entered at Trinity College, Dublin, as a medical student, ultimately being admitted M.R.C.S. of London.
In June 1836 Dr. Murphy emigrated to Sydney, New South Wales, and was immediately nominated by the Governor Sir Richard Bourke to a position on the staff of colonial surgeons. On appointment he proceeded to take charge of a portion of the southern district in the county of Argyle, but soon afterwards being led into agricultural pursuits, he resigned his official position, and finally discontinued practice as a medical man. After leaving the Government service, Dr. Murphy purchased a considerable quantity of land at Argyle, and soon became the largest grain-grower in the district. He married in 1840 Agnes, the eldest daughter of Lieutenant David Reid, R.N., of Inverary Park, N.S.W., and in 1847 went to Victoria, where he purchased a station on the Ovens river, in the Beechworth district.
Dr. Murphy began serving in the partially elective Victorian Legislative Council for the Murray district at the first election which took place after the separation of Victoria from New South Wales. He was for some time Chairman of Committees, and in 1852 he sold his pastoral property and went to reside permanently in Melbourne. In 1853 he was re-elected for the Murray, and resigned the chairmanship of committees to become President of the Central Road Board, which latter position he relinquished in November 1856. He was acting Speaker in the council during the absence, on account of illness, of Dr. (later Sir) James Frederick Palmer in March 1855.
When responsible government was conceded, Murphy was elected to the first Legislative Assembly of Victoria for the Murray Boroughs, and appointed the first Speaker of the House in October 1856. To this post he was re-elected in 1859, 1861, 1864, 1866, and 1868, and held it continuously till the dissolution of Parliament on 24 January 1871, when he resigned, having in the meantime been knighted in 1860.
In 1866, Sir Francis Murphy left Murray Boroughs and was returned for the Grenville electorate till 1871, when he was defeated, and was out of Parliament till the next year, when he entered the Upper House as member for the Eastern Province.
Murphy was in 1861 a member of the commission on the Burke and Wills expedition, and in 1863 chairman of the league directed against further transportation. He was chairman of the National Bank of Australasia and director of other companies. Murphy was one of the three Australian commissioners tasked by the Government of New Zealand with choosing a new capital for that country. Together with Joseph Docker (New South Wales) and Ronald Campbell Gunn (Tasmania), he recommended for the capital to move from Auckland to Wellington.
Murphy resigned his seat in council in 1876, and resided for some time in England. He died on 30 March 1891, at his residence, St. Kilda Road, Melbourne, and was buried in Boroondara cemetery.
Family
In 1840 Murphy married the daughter of Lieutenant Reid, R.N., a settler in his neighbourhood. He left six daughters and three sons, one of whom, Frank Reid Murphy, was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland.

Liberty Aerospace, Inc. was a Bahrainian-owned manufacturer of general aviation aircraft based in Melbourne, Florida, United States.
The company, started by British entrepreneur Anthony Tiarks, produced one model, the Liberty XL2, a two-seat touring aircraft based on the British-designed Europa homebuilt airplane. Originally The XL2 design received FAA production certification in the spring of 2006 and commenced sales in North America and the European market. In early April 2014, Discovery Aviation announced the acquisition of the Liberty XL-2's FAA type certificate, all rights to manufacture the Liberty XL-2 and that the resulting transaction, which saw the former senior management team of Liberty Aerospace join Discovery Aviation, would allow the aircraft to resume production. The Sausalito, California based Discovery Aviation chose to consolidate the companies at the Liberty Aerospace Melbourne, Florida facilities and retired the Liberty Aerospace company name.
Key Personnel
Liberty's key personnel in 2006 were:
President & Chief Executive Officer: Keith Markley
Chief Operating Officer: Paul Bartlett
Chief Financial Officer: Scott Meder
General Counsel: Margaret Napolitan
History
Liberty Aerospace, Inc. was incorporated as a Delaware For-Profit Corporation on October 6, 2000 (File # 3299031). Liberty Aerospace, Inc. was registered as a Florida Foreign For-Profit Corporation on April 7, 2004 (Doc # F03000001707). Liberty Aerospace Holdings, Inc. was incorporated as a Delaware For-Profit Corporation on April 23, 2004 (File # 3517687).
In October 2004, the Kuwait Finance House, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kuwait Finance House of Bahrain, acquired 75% of Liberty Aerospace for approximately US$60 million.
April 2008 outsourcing to Romania
In a news release issued in April 2008, Liberty Aerospace CEO Keith Markley announced that some of the 180 employees at the Melbourne, Florida manufacturing facility will lose their jobs when the company starts outsourcing aircraft production to Romania. He indicated that the company will maintain its headquarters in Melbourne, but it is not clear how many employees will be still be employed by the company in the USA.
August 2008 special certification review controversy
In August 2008 the Federal Aviation Administration, in releasing information on a Special Certification Review (SCR) that was being conducted on Eclipse Aviation, also listed Liberty Aerospace as undergoing an SCR. The company quickly denied that they were subject to an SCR and asked the FAA to retract the statement.
The FAA clarified that Liberty was not under an SCR, but was subject to an unspecified special review of another type.
Liberty Aerospace General Counsel and Safety and Compliance Officer Margaret Napolitan said: "It's a commercial dispute. It has nothing to do with the safety of the aircraft." Neither the company nor the FAA have released any further information.
2008–12 global recession
In November 2008, responding to the global economic crisis, Liberty announced a package of incentives for aircraft buyers who bought a Liberty XL2 before December 31, 2008. The added incentives included free fuel for 125 flying hours, free scheduled maintenance for 125 flying hours, free insurance and five hours of free flight training. The company also matched deposits made on competing aircraft up to $5,000 for buyers who chose a Liberty aircraft over a competitor's product.
In February 2009 the company announced that it will create an independent division called Liberty Composites that will market its composite construction skills outside the aviation industry.
By March 2009 the company had laid off all but 32 workers of its previous 180-person workforce, citing the global economic situation that has resulted in a sharp decline in sales. CEO Keith Markley indicated the company intends to rehire its workers when conditions permit. The company had delivered a total of 100 XL-2s by the end of February 2009.
The company decided to offer its fleet of eight demonstrator aircraft for sale in December 2009 at deeply discounted prices.
In April 2011 the company consolidated its operations in Melbourne, Florida by giving up expiring leases on two of its five buildings. The company continues to supply parts for their fleet in the field and build aircraft to order.
During 2011 the company shipped only two aircraft and none during the first two-quarters of 2012. In late September 2012 the sale of 50 XL-2s to the city of Wuhan, China was announced.
2014 merger
In early April 2014 the company announced that it was merging with Discovery Aviation with the intention of returning the XL-2 to production.

Kaunas Synagogue () is one of two operating choral synagogues in Lithuania. It is located in Centras eldership, Kaunas. The Neo-Baroque synagogue was built in 1872. In 1902, before the Holocaust in Lithuania, it was one of over 25 synagogues and Jewish prayer houses in the city. The radically designed synagogue claims to have one of the most beautiful arks in the entire Jewish world.
The plot for the new synagogue was bestowed to the Kovno Jewish community by the merchant Lewin Boruch Minkowski, the father of Oskar Minkowski and Hermann Minkowski; until 1873 he also subsidized the major part of its construction. A memorial to the estimated 50,000 Lithuanian Jewish children killed during the Holocaust can be found at the rear of the building, complete with 37 stone tablets showing in which towns and cities they lost their lives and just how many of them died in each one.
On 20 April 2011, the anniversary of Hitler's birthday, a sign saying "Jews out" and "Hitler was right" ("Juden raus" "Hitleris buvo teisus") were hung in front of the synagogue.

Whitesmiths Ltd. was a software company founded in New York City by P. J. Plauger, Mark Krieger and Gabriel Pham, and last located in Westford, Massachusetts. It sold a Unix-like operating system called Idris, as well as the first commercial C compiler, Whitesmiths C.
The Whitesmiths compiler, first written for the PDP-11, was released in 1978 and compiled a version of C similar to that accepted by Version 6 Unix (Dennis Ritchie's original C compiler). It was an entirely new implementation, borrowing no code from Unix. Today, it is mainly remembered for lending its name to a particular indentation style, originally used in the code examples which accompanied it. Whitesmith's first customer for their C compiler was Fischer & Porter, a process control company then located in Warminster, Pennsylvania. Besides PDP-11, the compiler had code generators for Intel 8080/Zilog Z80, Motorola MC68000, and VAX-11, and it was commonly used as a cross-compiler. Whitesmiths also developed a Pascal front-end for the compiler, that emitted C-language code for input to the C compiler.
By 1983 Whitesmiths was one of several vendors of Unix-like operating systems. That year Whitesmiths formed a technical and business alliance with France-based COSMIC Software. At that time, Whitesmiths published 16-bit compilers for machines like PDP-11 while COSMIC published 8-bit compilers for Intel and Motorola CPUs. This technology alliance improved compilers for both markets. Whitesmiths are actively involved in developing the original ANSI C standard supplying several members to the standards committee and hosting some technical sessions. They were one of the first suppliers of an ANSI C compliant compiler.
The company's president from 1978 to 1988 was P. J. Plauger. Whitesmiths merged with Intermetrics in December 1988, leading to further mergers and acquisitions.

Cornelis van Huynen (died 1703) was a Flemish still life painter who is known for his fruit and garland paintings. He was active in Antwerp where he had trained with the prominent still life painter Joris van Son.
Life
Information about the life of Cornelis van Huynen is sketchy. The place and date of his birth are unknown. He is first recorded when in the guild year 1654/1655 he was registered at the Guild of Saint Luke of Antwerp as a pupil of the prominent still life painter Joris van Son. He became pupil of van Son in the same year as Frans van Everbroeck, who also became a still life painter. He became a master in the local Guild in the guild year 1661–1662.
Van Huynen was active in Antwerp until 1703. His death dues were paid to the Guild in 1703, which indicates he died that year.
Work
The known oeuvre of van Huynen is very limited. There only signed works are two garland paintings conserved in the Prado Museum. In addition there are two other garland paintings attributed to the artist in the National Museum in Warsaw, which were previously attributed to Catharina Ykens II. Two pendant works representing garlands of fruit auctioned at Bonhams & Butterfields (San Francisco, California) on 14 May 2003, lot 1026 as attributed to Frans Ykens have been attributed to Cornelis van Huynen by F G Meijer
Van Huynen's works fall into two categories: garlands of fruit and garland paintings. He must also have painted garlands of flowers as there is a record of a sale of a work in this genre by the art dealer Forchondt during his lifetime in 1671. His works demonstrate a great affinity with the creations of his master Joris van Son, although the models used in his figures demonstrate a knowledge of the work of Antony van Dyck.
The majority of his still lifes fall into the category of 'garland paintings'. Garland paintings are a type of still life invented in early 17th century Antwerp and whose earliest practitioner was Jan Brueghel the Elder. Paintings in this genre typically show a flower or, less frequently, fruit garland around a devotional image or portrait. Garland paintings were usually collaborations between a still life and a figure painter. Paintings in this genre typically show a flower or, less frequently, fruit garland around a devotional image or portrait. In the later development of the genre, the devotional image is replaced by other subjects such as portraits, mythological subjects and allegorical scenes.
The two garland paintings in the Prado have a devotional theme in the middle of the garland. The two garland paintings in the National Museum in Warsaw contain respectively portraits of a painter holding a palette and a woman reading. Like his master van Son these garland paintings consist of fruits or a combination of fruit and flowers with the upper part being made up of flowers and the lower part of fruit or vice versa. The fruits and flowers in these compositions are bunched together in groups that are attached to sculptural frames.

Prishtina Roller (Akrobatiku i Prishtinës) is a specific and particular breed of pigeons from Kosovo, whose origins date from 19th and the beginning of 20th century.
Because of the long tradition of breeding (more than a hundred years), this breed is also known by several other names: Prishtina Donek – Doneku i Prishtinës, Kosova Donek – Doneku i Kosovës, Prishtina Tumbler, etc. In the process of creating the 'Prishtina Roller' breed, the donek breed was a favourite and from this has developed the 'Prishtina Roller' which takes its name from Prishtina, the capital of Kosovo, where it has a breed standard and is registered as a breed there with the Federal Commission.

The Test Garden of Hamma () () is a botanical garden ( of gardens and of arboretum) located in the Mohamed Belouizdad (formerly Hamma-Anassers) district of Algiers. It was established in 1832.
History
In 1832, Pierre Genty De Bussy, the Civil Intendant, and General Antoine Avisard, interim governor, decided to drain the marshes at the foot of the Arcades hill. The Botanical Garden of Hamma was then created on a area, to make not only a model farm but also a test garden.
In 1837, the organization bought a site under the Fountain of Plane Trees. The garden grew westwards and became the Central Nursery of the Government. The initial site was renamed Little Test Garden until its exchange in 1848 for another piece of land inside the Nursery.
The garden's principal activity is to provide trees to public organisations and to European settlers. From 1833, production of carmine was added.
Auguste Hardy was named director of the Botanical Garden in 1842. Many animal species were introduced to the garden at that time, and it expanded several times. As well as the animal and vegetable produce, industry relating to new technology occupied a lot of space, and employed a lot of people.
Between 1848 and 1867 the garden expanded several times, until it arrived at its current configuration. In 1860, a lake was created and an exterior boulevard constructed. The garden was renamed the Acclimatization Garden () in 1861. In 1867, an estimated 8,214 species could be found in the garden.
The Garden in the 21st century
Between 2001 and 2009 the garden was closed for restoration work. Reopened in 2009, it is now home to the Algerian National Institute of Agronomical Research, and was opened to visitors.
There are currently an estimated 1,200 different species of plant in the garden.

Hugh Alton Carter (August 13, 1920 – June 24, 1999) was an American politician and businessman from Georgia. He was also the first cousin of US president Jimmy Carter.
Early life and education
Born in Plains, Georgia, Carter served in World War II as a United States Army lieutenant seeing combat in Europe. After the war, Carter remained in the reserves and retired as a lieutenant colonel in 1964. Carter graduated from Georgia Southwestern State University, when the college was a two-year college and then from the University of Georgia.
Political career
Carter served seven terms (14 years) in the Georgia State Senate, from 1967 until 1981 and was a Democrat. He represented District 14, and succeeded his cousin future-President Jimmy Carter in that post. He represented eight Georgia rural counties, and served as chairman of the Senate Education Committee and was a senior member of the Appropriations, Rules and Fiscal Affairs Committees.
Business ventures
Carter owned a bait shop and a general (later antique) store. In 1949, Carter started a third business growing fish bait. Originally limited to crickets, he later expanded into worms. By the mid-1950s, Carter was selling worms nationwide and laying claim to the title of "the world's largest worm farmer", producing more than 60 million a year. Carter wrote six pamphlets on worm and cricket farming, the best seller in 1958 was 18 Secrets of Successful Worm Raising The pamphlet originally sold for $1.00. When Carter raised the price to $2.95 sales grew even faster. In 1978, he wrote a book: Cousin Beedie and Cousin Hot: My life with the Carter Family from Plains, Georgia. The book drew the wrath of aunt Lillian Carter and cousin Billy Carter. In the book, he had referred to the President's mother as "domineering", while offering his opinion of Presidential brother, Billy: "He's not a redneck, but can make money as a redneck". Shortly after the book's publication, Carter drew a political opponent. Peanut farmer Malcolm "Chicken" Wishard, was backed by Hugh Carter's aggrieved aunt Lillian and cousin Billy. However, Wishard's campaign slogan "Help the Chicken take the Worm", failed to inspire voters, and Carter was re-elected to another term in the State Senate.
Later years
Carter retired from the State Senate in 1981. His bait growing business suffered declining sales in the 1990s, and he closed it in 1996. At the age of 78, Hugh Carter died in Americus, Georgia on June 24, 1999.

8th Street is a station on the Hudson–Bergen Light Rail (HBLR) in the city of Bayonne, Hudson County, New Jersey. The southernmost stop in Bayonne, 8th Street station serves as the southern terminus of the Hudson–Bergen Light Rail. Located on an elevated track next to Route 440, the station is accessible at the intersection of Avenue C and West 8th Street. The station, unlike the rest of the line, has a full station depot that doubles as accessibility to tracks per the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The depot is two stories high and contains elevators and access to the platform, which is an island platform with two tracks. East of the station, the tracks merge into one to reach 22nd Street station. The station serves tracks for the local service to Hoboken Terminal along with an express service known as the Bayonne Flyer. The station opened on January 31, 2011 as an extension of service from 22nd Street.
The design of the 8th Street station depot is a similar design to the former West 8th Street station on the Central Railroad of New Jersey that served Bayonne from August 1, 1864–August 6, 1978, when Conrail discontinued service.
History
The station is located in the Bergen Point neighborhood of Bayonne. It was once served by a stop on the Central Railroad of New Jersey's main line, as trains made their way from the main CNJ terminal in Jersey City to points in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. This ended in 1967 when CNJ passenger service was diverted to Newark Penn Station as part of the Aldene Plan. Shuttle service from 8th Street ran south across the CRRNJ Newark Bay Bridge and continued until August 6, 1978. The headhouse is reminiscent of the earlier station. Baltimore and Ohio passenger trains passed through until its passenger operations northeast of Baltimore ceased operation in 1958.
On April 18, 2008, NJ Transit awarded a $58.4 million contracts to George Harms Company to begin the process of extending the line to 8th Street from 34th Street. This contract paid for foundations, viaducts, tracks and a new station building. The extension follows the Conrail right of way along Avenue E; a viaduct was constructed to take the trains above local streets to a station served by an elevator and stairs. Ground was broken for the station on October 15, 2008. Originally scheduled to open in late 2010, the new station opened January 31, 2011.

Garfield Park is a urban park located in the East Garfield Park neighborhood on Chicago's West Side. It was designed as a pleasure ground by William LeBaron Jenney and is the oldest of the three large original Chicago West Side parks (Humboldt Park, Garfield, and Douglass Park). It is home to the Garfield Park Conservatory, one of the largest plant conservatories in the United States. It is also the park the furthest west in the Chicago park and boulevard system.
Park history
The first segment of Garfield Park was formally opened to the public in August 1874. Originally known as Central Park, it was conceived as the centerpiece of the West Park System.
Jenney, now best known as the father of skyscrapers, was influenced by the French parks and boulevards he had seen and studied while living in Paris. That influence is reflected in his design of these West side parks and the connecting boulevards. The park was renamed in 1881 in honor of slain President James A. Garfield.
In 1905, Jens Jensen, now known as the Dean of Prairie-style landscape architecture, was appointed as the superintendent of the West Park System where he experimented with design ideas and improvements to the deteriorated and unfinished sections of Garfield Park. Some of the most notable areas are the existing lawns which became the setting for development of the Prairie style of landscape architecture. His most notable work in Garfield Park can be seen in the formal flower garden south of Madison Street where he combined Prairie style elements with traditional formal elements and in the Conservatory.
Garfield Park was initially intended to be used for passive recreation such as strolling and picnicking. Jensen's expertise as an engineer led him to design a large lagoon as a means of draining the park site while creating the requisite water features. The lagoon was used for boating in summer and ice skating in winter.
Jensen's gardenesque approach to his parks endeared itself to those early park users as one of the first significant attempts at landscape art in Chicago. Throughout its history, Garfield Park has successfully responded to the changing demands placed on a highly used urban open space.
During the 1920s, a major addition was incorporated into Garfield Park: a grand, golden domed administration building for the West Park Commission designed by Michaelsen and Rognstad.
Following the 1934 consolidation of the separate Chicago parks commissions into the Chicago Park District, the "Golden Dome" became the park's fieldhouse and center of recreational programs and activities.
Despite additions and modifications in both landscape and buildings in Garfield Park, essential character-defining features such as historic roads and paths, buildings, structures, landforms, water features, and some plant materials still exist. Garfield Park remains as one of the best examples of William LeBaron Jenney's landscape architectural efforts in Chicago, and is a rich tapestry of the contributions of several nationally important designers, architects and artists.
Historic features of Garfield Park include architectural landscaping (flower gardens, water court, bridges, lagoons, and the Conservatory); notable architecture (the Golden Dome fieldhouse); the bandshell (or "gazebo" as it is locally known), designed in 1896 by J. L. Silsbee; and the golf shelter building, attributable to prairie school architect Hugh Gardner and built in 1907. There are also a number of historic sculptures and statues within the park.
Recreational features include baseball and soccer fields, tennis and basketball courts, a swimming pool, playgrounds and an ice skating rink. The Golden Dome houses an Olympic-sized gymnasium, gymnastic and fitness centers, boxing ring, and theater. Park patrons can participate in programs for everyone from senior citizens to pre-schoolers, including picnicking, outdoor concerts, and community festivals.
Race track
Located in the south of Garfield Park from 1896 and 1905 was a double-ring race track for horses and cyclists.
Conservatory
The Garfield Park Conservatory, designed by landscape architect Jens Jensen in 1906-07, is a greenhouse conservatory at the northwest corner of the park.

A radiator cabinet is a structure, often made from wood, that is fixed around a radiator or heater thus concealing it from view. Radiator cabinets are also known as radiator covers.
History
The first radiator cabinet is thought to have been manufactured at some point during the Victorian era. The latter part of the 19th century saw greater emphasis placed on attractive and elegant home design. The old cast iron radiators and pipes were regarded as an eyesore and the desire to cover these blemishes led to the introduction of decorative radiator cabinets.

The double rifle, also known as a double-barreled rifle, is a rifle with two barrels mounted parallel to each other. Synonymous with big game hunting found primarily in Africa and India, the double rifle is a purely sporting weapon with no military heritage.
Design
The double rifle is usually handcrafted and is considered by many to be the pinnacle of sporting rifle design. It is not designed for long-range accuracy but instead for the security of an immediate second shot.
Action
As with double-barrelled shotguns, modern double rifles are all made with either sidelock or boxlock actions, although occasionally old hammer rifles can be found. The majority of double rifles have been built on the boxlock actions as it is a simple design with few parts that can fail and consequently it has an outstanding reputation for reliability. The sidelock action, with its lockwork operating behind the main action body, has exceptional inherent strength and as a result could be built on slimmer action sizes in proportion to the calibre, although it is far more labour intensive to manufacture and so more expensive.
Most double rifles manufactured today, especially those designed for dangerous game, are manufactured with selective ejectors which greatly speeds reloading. However many old hunters preferred non-ejector rifles, feeling that with practice they could reload just as quickly, these rifles can still be found and usually attract a slightly lower price.
Barrels
Double rifles can come in two barrel configurations, over and under designs (usually abbreviated as O/U) where the two barrels are mounted vertically one on top of the other, or side by side (usually abbreviated as SxS) where the two barrels are mounted horizontally next to each other.
For dangerous game hunting, side by side rifles are usually preferred. This is for a number of reasons but predominantly because the barrels of an over and under gun must be pivoted much farther down to clear the lower barrel for reloading.
During manufacture the barrels of double rifles require "regulation" to ensure the bullet paths from both barrels are aimed at a common point of aim. This can be done to ensure either the bullets 1) parallel each other closely at all practical ranges, or 2) converge at a given range, beyond which they begin to diverge. Because of the need to regulate a rifle to a specific loading of its chambered cartridge, once regulated a double rifle cannot satisfactorily shoot bullets of different weights or velocities, as it usually affects the accuracy. The process of regulating a double rifle's barrels is complex and can be time consuming, significantly adding to the cost of the rifle.

Whilst many modern double rifles are fitted with telescopic sights, the need for fast target acquisition in the face of dangerous game led to the development of the "Express" iron sights. Express sights feature a very wide and shallow rear V, usually with a white line marking the bottom of the V. The purpose of express sights is to allow for well aimed shots over moderate ranges when there was time for careful sighting, and to allow the rifle to be pointed like a shotgun to stop the charge of a dangerous animal at very short range when there is little time for aiming.
Calibres
Double rifles have been produced in all calibres from to . Traditional British double rifle calibres include the Rook rifle, Black Powder Express and rimmed Nitro Express families of cartridges and many of these can still be obtained today. European makers tend to chamber their double rifles in metric rimmed calibres developed by European firms, although British and American cartridges are offered.
History
The development of the double rifle has always followed the development of the double-barrelled shotgun, the two are generally very similar but the stresses of firing a solid projectile are far greater than shot. The first double-barrelled muskets were created in the 1830s when deer stalking became popular in Scotland. Previously single barrelled weapons had been used but, recognising the need for a rapid second shot to dispatch a wounded animal, double-barrelled muskets were built along the same format as double-barrelled shotguns already in common use.
These first double-barrelled weapons were black powder, smoothbore muzzleloaders built with either flintlock or percussion cap ignition systems. Whilst true rifling dates from the mid-16th century, the invention of the express rifle by James Purdey "the Younger" in 1856 allowed for far greater muzzle velocities to be achieved through a rifled longarm, significantly improving the trajectory and as such greatly improving the range of these rifles. These express rifles had two deep opposing grooves which were wide and deep enough to prevent the lead bullets from stripping the rifling if fired at high velocities, a significant problem previously.
These muzzle loading rifles came in a large variety of calibres, the most common calibres for medium thin skinned plains and deer sized game were , , , , and 12 bore (). For larger thick skinned type game 10 bore (), 8 bore (), 6 bore (), and 4 bore () were used, the last being a specialist elephant hunting calibre. Whilst most of these calibres could be purchased with rifling, the giant 4 bore and the less common 6 bear were rarely rifled, as the increased friction from the rifling caused excessive recoil.
Various experimental breech loaders had been in existence since the 16th century, however developments such as the Ferguson rifle in the 1770s and early pinfire cartridges in the 1830s had little impact on sporting rifles due to their experimental nature, expense and the extraordinary strength and reliability of the percussion muzzleloader. In 1858, Westley Richards patented the break open, top leaver breech loading action, whilst a useful development these early break open designs had a great deal of elasticity in the action and upon firing they sprung open slightly, a problem that gradually worsened with repeated firing and with more powerful cartridges. Many gunmakers tried various methods to rectify this problem, all to little avail until Westley Richards invented the "Dolls head" lock in 1862 which greatly improved rigidity, this was followed by James Purdey's under-locking mechanism in 1863 and W.W. Greener's "Wedge fast" system in 1873, finally the basic break open action known to this day had the strength required to meet the stresses of large-bore projectiles. By 1914, triple, quadruple and even quintuple locking designs could be found in various proprietary actions.
In 1861 the centrefire rifle cartridge was invented, and quickly a large number of blackpowder centrefire cartridges were developed in the same calibres as their muzzle loading forebears, including the .450/400 Black Powder Express, the extremely popular .450 Black Powder Express, the .500 Black Powder Express, and the .577 Black Powder Express, all with various case lengths. The first brass 10 bore, 8 bore and 4 bore cartridges were not developed until 1870, their arrival spelling the end of the muzzle loading era.
Until this time all double rifles had external hammers whose fall struck the mechanism which fired the cartridge, however attempts to remove them were well under way. The first "hammerless" action of significance was invented by Thomas Murcott in 1871, known as "The Mousetrap", it was a complex design but it sold in significant numbers. In 1875, Westley Richards employees William Anson and John Deeley patented the "Anson & Deeley" hammerless boxlock action, and in 1878 the Birmingham gunmakers W&C Scott & Son invented the basic sidelock action which was so successful it was immediately adopted by Holland & Holland.
By 1900 the boxlock and sidelock hammerless actions had largely superseded the hammer rifles and, with the addition of ejectors and assisted opening, the basic design of the double rifle has changed little to this day. Incidentally, it was Westley Richards who invented the first reliable safety catch for doubles, ejectors, the single selective trigger and the special extractors that enabled rimless cartridges to be used in double rifles, all features found in modern double rifles.
In 1898, John Rigby & Company loaded the .450 Black Powder Express with smokeless cordite creating the .450 Nitro Express, the first Nitro Express cartridge, this was to have a profound impact on sporting cartridge development and the double rifle was to become synonymous with the Nitro Express cartridges. Now in its final form and chambering modern Nitro Express cartridges, the British double rifle entered its golden age at the turn of 20th century and it was to last for the next three decades, with the birth of the White hunter and professional hunting safari industry in East Africa.
After the Second World War, a combination of increased labour costs and a shrinking British Empire saw an end to the demand for handcrafted sporting rifles and the double rifle was largely supplanted by the bolt action rifle. It was not until the 1980s and the emergence of the big game hunting industry in Southern Africa that production of double rifles resumed at a steady rate, driven largely by demand from American sportsmen.
Use
For African hunting the Nitro Express double rifle remains extremely popular, although unaffordable for the majority of hunters.
In Europe, the double rifle remains reasonably popular in Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Scandinavia, Spain, and Eastern Europe for hunting wild boar, bear, stag, and moose.

Kosmos 362 ( meaning Cosmos 362), also known as DS-P1-I No.9 was a satellite which was used as a radar target for anti-ballistic missile tests. It was launched by the Soviet Union in 1970 as part of the Dnepropetrovsk Sputnik programme.
Launch
It was launched aboard a Kosmos-2I 63SM rocket, from Site 133/1 at Plesetsk. The launch occurred at 11:59:55 UTC on 16 September 1970.
Orbit
Kosmos 362 was placed into a low Earth orbit with a perigee of , an apogee of , 71 degrees of inclination, and an orbital period of 95.6 minutes. It decayed from orbit on 13 October 1971.
Kosmos 362 was the ninth of nineteen DS-P1-I satellites to be launched. Of these, all reached orbit successfully except the seventh.

Bicast leather (also spelled as bi-cast leather or bycast leather) is a material made with a split leather backing covered with an embossed layer of polyurethane or vinyl. Bicast leather was originally made for the apparel industry for glossy shoes, and was later adopted by the furniture industry.
Production and features
The hide material used in the making of bicast is usually a portion of the fibrous, lower grade of leather that remains when the higher-grade grain layer is split off.
Bicast leather is produced by building up a layer of plastic (typically polyurethane) on top of an embossed release paper known as casting paper. The embossing is usually giving the appearance of top grain leather, although it may be smooth depending on the desired finish. The plastic layer may optionally include: pigment, foams of various consistencies, and adhesives. Split leather is then applied and pressed onto the plastic, which may have been dried. After the resultant bicast leather has cured, the casting paper is removed, and optionally re-used.
New bicast leather can have a chemical odor, but this typically dissipates about a week after the piece is exposed to air.
The use of terms like "genuine leather" or "100% leather" in relation to bicast treatment is considered a misrepresentation and therefore not permitted in some countries, including the UK, Denmark, and New Zealand.
Furniture manufacturers say that the main benefit of bicast leather is its surface appearance at a low price. With constant use, however, the polyurethane layer may crack and split free of its backing, and abrasion may cause large unsightly marks.

Andreas Andresen Haukeland (born 12 April 1993), better known as Tix (stylized as TIX), is a Norwegian singer. He represented Norway at the Eurovision Song Contest 2021 with the song "Fallen Angel".
He has Tourette syndrome, a condition characterised by involuntary movements called tics. During his childhood, he was bullied for his condition and he was called "Tics", which he later turned into his stage name. Besides being a musician, Andreas is a mental health awareness advocate and has shared his experiences with Tourette syndrome, as well as loneliness and suicidal thoughts.
In 2019, Andreas was a part of Norwegian Paradise Hotel, season 11, checking in as a VIP contestant. After his long run that season, he was part of the jury deciding the winners.
Early life
Andreas was born on 12 April 1993. During his school years, Andreas was bullied for his Tourette syndrome and his tics - leading to him struggling with his mental health for most of his life. During a conversation with his mom, he said "I don't think I'll ever get a girlfriend. I don't think I'll ever find someone who can love me and accept my tics. I don't think anyone will consider me normal... most importantly, I don't think I'll ever find a girl that will have children with me, someone that will marry me. I don't think that's in the cards for me."
In 2010, during a russ celebration, Andreas's girlfriend at the time asked him if he could write a song for the bus crew. This would be his first russ song. In 2011, he would submit a song for that year's Melodi Grand Prix 2011, but to no avail. The song is not planned to ever be released in any media form.
Career
2013–2019: Russ music, controversy, and struggles with mental health
TIX is known for his Russ music, with many of his songs being known for controversial, misogynist, and sexist lyrics. Andreas offered three explanations for the song "Sjeiken": it was satire, it was a result of supply and demand, it was a provocation for the sake of provocation.
In 2015, he was featured in several Staysman and Lazz music videos in which he is seen doing various things, including touching the instructor's breast during a sex ed class, partying excessively and waking up with a man in bed, who he kisses on the forehead before leaving, albeit in a hurry.
Between 2015 and 2017, he would release many songs, all in russ music; 19 in 2015, 17 in 2016, and 12 in 2017.
In September 2016, TIX released his debut studio album, Dømt og berømt, which peaked at number 2 on the VG-lista, the official Norwegian Albums Chart.
In 2017, he would be a co-producer for the song "Game Time" by Flo Rida. In the summer of 2017, TIX was a warm-up artist for Justin Bieber at Forus Travbane in Stavanger. He would also co produce the song "Sweet but Psycho" by Ava Max in 2018.
In 2018, he released his first non-russ pop song, "Shotgun" which reached No. 5 in the singles chart in Norway. However, in the same year and in 2019 he would also create new russ songs, but with a new theme of a foreboding party burnout and depression.
2019–2020: Paradise Hotel, Norwegian Idol, new music videos
In 2019, he was a contestant on Paradise Hotel as a VIP contestant. Before the show, he was interviewed by Dagbladet, where he said "It's like.. now or never. I will die young. (…) Brutally honest." After the show, he was once again interviewed, this time by Se og Hør Norge, where he randomly asked the interviewer who had a fortune teller toy "I wonder if I'm gonna die before I'm 30? Because that's the plan really.”
In 2020, he was a judge on the Norwegian version of Pop Idol, called Norwegian Idol.
2021: Melodi Grand Prix, Eurovision Song Contest, opening up about mental health struggles
On 15 January 2021, during an interview on Norwegian talk show "Lindmo", Andreas told of how he tried to commit suicide in 2018. He said the character of Tix had completely taken over and that there was no room for the real Andreas. He was crying on the floor of his bathroom when his cat, Findus, came in to comfort him. Andreas told Findus about his troubles and, to this day, he says that Findus saved his life.
On 20 February 2021, Tix won the Melodi Grand Prix 2021 with the song "Fallen Angel", and thus earned the right to represent Norway at the Eurovision Song Contest 2021 in Rotterdam. A week later, he apologized for the lyrics he used in his old russ songs on Instagram, saying in part "The Russ era is a time that is normless, that is boundless by nature and that acts as a valve for young people. The music is made to be played in that context. It is made for young people, who party, who drink and who have sex. Could and should I have used other words and phrases? In retrospect - yes. My focus was on the party and the community. My heart's desire... I have, or have never had, any intention of hurting anyone. I want to apologize to everyone who has felt trampled on by the songs. That was not the intention, and I am genuinely sorry." However, he would also say that he would not change anything that he did in the past; he simply had said that he was sorry some had been offended.
On 4 May 2021, two weeks before the first semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2021, Tix released the music video for "Fallen Angel", in which he recreates a moment from his youth where he's bullied for his Tourettes syndrome as well as shows the genesis of the Tix persona. The song would qualify from the first semi-final, finishing 10th place with 118 points, and would finish the grand final in 18th place with 75 points. During the performance, he took off his glasses in order to show his tics to the audience, saying "I'll show the biggest weakness I could do on a stage... I think it will help/comfort/inspire to many out there." He created a 10 part vlog series on social media, which detailed his journeys and experiences at Eurovision, including traveling around Rotterdam and Amsterdam, behind the scenes footage, and a dedicated video to Azerbaijani singer Samira Efendi.
On 14 May 2021, Tix released the single "Engel, Ikke Dra", which was a dedication to a fan of his, Aurora Buerskog, who died from cancer in the summer of 2019. One of her last wishes was to have Tix attend her funeral. Her funeral in Stavanger was the same day as a concert he was doing for VG-Lista in Bergen. He attended the funeral first and then went to perform for a crowd of over 10,000. In an Instagram post on the day of the single's release, he says he was struck with the following thought after getting off the stage that day: "How many of these kids are going through hard times right now? How many people struggle with anxiety, eating disorders, exclusion, violence, loneliness, bullying, etc.? And the biggest question: Statistically speaking… How many of these are perhaps no longer with us the next time I return to the city? That was the beginning of a new chapter, and the reason I chose to show the humanity behind TIX. Meeting Aurora made me understand how important my music is in many people's everyday lives. And therefore I want to be the soundtrack to both the good and the bad moments."
Personal life
Andreas has become an outspoken advocate of mental health and has shared many of his experiences with struggles with it.
He was in relationship with Marthe Elise Brenne, a Norwegian influencer, from early 2019 to late 2020, with whom he met and was partnered in Paradise Hotel. Brenne won Paradise Hotel in 2019. Andreas dedicated one of his songs 'Deg Eller Ingenting' to Marthe in June 2020 and shared on his Instagram romantic photos of the couple saying "I do not have many close ones around me, but over the past year Marthe has been an important part of my life. I love her so much. Actually love her."
On 18 October 2021 he released a book, TIX: Den Stygge Andungen (The Ugly Duckling), based on his childhood in which Andreas Haukeland tells the story of himself. Nearly two weeks after its release, it became Norway's best-selling non-fiction children book.

Felipe Trigo (13 February 1864 in Villanueva de la Serena, Badajoz – 2 September 1916 in Madrid) was a 20th-century Spanish writer.
He studied Medicine in Madrid and practised in several villages in Extremadura. He later become a member of Military Health Corps and he was appointed to the Philippines, where he was about to die and he had to be repatriated as a Lieutenant-Colonel.
In 1900, he quit medicine to concentrate in literature. Eroticism was the main subject of his works, but he was also interested in social denounces and critics about illiteracy and caciquism with peasants in Spain and specially in the Extremadura of his times in particular.
Felipe Trigo committed suicide in 1916 for unclear reasons.
Legacy
In 1981, the City Council of Villanueva de la Serena created the Felipe Trigo Awards in his honor to recognize the year's best novel and short narrative.

WRRB (96.9 FM) is an alternative rock radio station licensed to Arlington, New York and serving the Mid-Hudson Valley of New York state. The station is owned by Townsquare Media and broadcasts at 310 watts ERP from the Illinois Mountain master tower in Marlborough, New York
Programming
WRRB's programming is simulcast with that of 92.7 WRRV Middletown, New York which serves the lower Hudson Valley, Catskills, Sussex County, New Jersey and Pike County, Pennsylvania. Though on paper WRRV is seen as the primary station, in reality WRRB is the more dominant of the two based on cume and sales (and the fact that, since 2000, the station has been run out of the longtime studios of sister WPDH on Pendell Road in Poughkeepsie). Information on the specifics of WRRV's format can be seen in the article on WRRV.
History
The 96.9 frequency came on the air in Fall 1989 as Bridge Broadcasting-owned WEXT ("Next FM") running a "new adult contemporary" format (a combination of smooth jazz and new-age music). Aside from its licence, WEXT had another first in being the first station operated by a local marketing agreement as WKIP/WRNQ owner Richard Novik later controlled WEXT.
WEXT's format was a bit ahead of its time and though it had a strong start and admiration of music critics and musicophiles, however this critical success did not translate into ratings as "Next FM" was the market's lowest rated FM signal in its only Arbitron ratings book in 1990. Even with the station's poor ratings, it was somehow seen as a threat to the ratings of the more mainstream and successful WRNQ.
To boost WRNQ, Novik flipped WEXT's format to a simulcast of the talk radio format of WKIP in February 1991 as WKIP-FM. Though the two stations split off at points, the simulcast of WKIP came with nearly no measurable ratings on 96.9 and at a financial loss on Novik's end. In August 1993, Novik terminated the LMA with Bridge who on September 1 of that year began an LMA with Woodstock-based WDST, bringing that station's storied Adult Album Alternative format to points south under the calls WDSP.
With a dedicated existing WDST audience on board and a good number of new listeners, WDSP became a middle-of-the pack station overall in the market but with good demographics; this success led Bridge to sell the station to WDST owner CHET-5 Broadcasting in 1994. The station remained moderately successful, however a financial crisis in early 1997 led CHET-5 to sell WDSP and WKNY in Kingston to the Crystal Radio Group in April of that year. Seeing an opportunity to take its WRRV in Middletown to a full-market signal, WDSP flipped to a WRRV simulcast as WRRB which continues to this day.
Townsquare Media
In October 2000, Crystal sold its holdings to Aurora Communications, which a year later was bought out by Cumulus Media. On August 30, 2013, a deal was announced in which Cumulus would swap its stations in Dubuque, Iowa and Poughkeepsie, New York (including WRRB) to Townsquare Media in exchange for Peak Broadcasting's Fresno, California stations. The deal was part of Cumulus' acquisition of Dial Global; Townsquare, Peak, and Dial Global are all controlled by Oaktree Capital Management. The sale to Townsquare was completed on November 14, 2013.

Eli Coleman is an American sexologist. He is the director of the Program in Human Sexuality at the University of Minnesota, and a professor in the Department of Family Medicine and Community Health. In 2007, he was appointed the first endowed Chair in Sexual Health at the University of Minnesota Medical School. He has published research on sexual orientation, sexual dysfunction and compulsivity, gender dysphoria, and sex offenders.
Coleman is also on the advisory board to Ro, a service for chronic health conditions.
Membership in scientific societies
Coleman is the founding and current editor of the International Journal of Sexual Health (formerly the Journal of Psychology and Human Sexuality). He was also the founding editor of the International Journal of Transgender Health.
He is one of the past-presidents of the Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality, the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (formerly the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association), the World Association for Sexual Health (WAS), International Academy of Sex Research, and the Society for Sex Therapy and Research.
Views
Regarding sexual addiction, Coleman has said, "I think the term 'addiction' is overused and implies that all behavioral excesses can be explained by some similar mechanism. What we know about alcohol and drug addictions cannot simply be transferred to other behavioral excesses. Sex is a basic appetitive drive that for some people becomes out of balance for a variety of reasons. For some it is a problem of impulse control. For others it is more like an obsession. For others, it is like a compulsion. And for others, it is a part of their personality structure and has nothing to do with impulse control, obsessions, or compulsions."

Poul Fechtels Hospital, originally also known as hamborgerske sjæleboder, was a charity in Copenhagen, Denmark. It was originally located at Møntergade 28 but relocated to a new building at Frederikssundsvej 67A in 1908.
History
Poul Fechtel had served as Royal Mint Master for Christian III from 1536 to 1565.
In 1570, Fechtel created a charity with 3,000 eigsdaler in capital with the aim of providing accommodation for indigent citizens. A row of small houses were constructed on a lot in Møntergade which had been granted to the project by Frederick II . The houses were variously referred to as Poul Fechtels Boder", "Mønterboderne" eller "Hamborgerboderne".
The houses were destroyed along with the rest of the street in the Copenhagen Fire of 1728 but a new building was constructed in 1732. Poul Fechtels Hospital moved to a new building on Frederikssundsvej in 1908 and its old buildings were demolished the following year when the street Christian IX2 Gade was created.

James A. McCartney (1835–1911) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the 19th Attorney General of Illinois from 1881 to 1885.
Early life
He was born on February 14, 1835 in Ireland. His family emigrated to the United States when he was two years old and lived in Lawrence County, Pennsylvania until 1845. His parents then moved to Trumbull County, Ohio, where he and his father engaged in farming. In the winter months he went to school and advanced rapidly in his studies. He became a student at the Western Reserve Seminary in Farmington, Ohio.
Legal practice
In 1856, McCartney began to study law in Warren, Ohio in the office of Hon. Matthew Birchard. In 1857 he went into the office of Harding & Reed in Monmouth, Illinois, where he finished reading and was admitted to the bar in 1858. McCartney moved to Galva, Illinois in 1859 and practiced law there until the Civil War broke out.
Military service
McCartney served in the American Civil War from 1861-1865. In April 1861 he enlisted in a company raised at Galva as a First Lieutenant. The company was mustered into service as Company D, 17th Illinois Infantry. He served with the 17th until after the battle of Fort Donelson in February 1862. He was compelled to resign his commission in March due to health failing from exposure.
After recovering his health with a visit to Lake Superior, he again entered the service in October 1862 as First Lieutenant in Company G, 112th Illinois Infantry, commanded by Col. Thos. Henderson. He was promoted to Captain in April 1863, and served throughout the war, mostly in Kentucky and Tennessee. McCartney mustered out with the regiment at Camp Douglas in July 1865.
Throughout the war, McCartney wrote many letters to his wife Eunice, detailing his experiences in battle. They are housed in the Wayne County Historical Society in Fairfield Illinois. A series of twenty-two columns about his life gleaned from those letters was written by Wasson Lawrence and appeared in the Wayne County Press in the 1960s.
After the war
After the war, McCartney returned to the practice of law, this time in Fairfield, Illinois. He became prominent in Southern Illinois for his legal work. It is in Fairfield that he began to get involved in local and state politics.
Attorney General of Illinois
McCartney was elected to the post of Attorney General as a Republican in 1880, and served from 1881-1885. During his term as the Attorney General, he worked to institute the Chicago Lake Front suits, culminating in the court case Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. Illinois. This case helped preserve the Chicago lakefront at Grant Park in public trust.
Later life
After serving as Attorney General, McCartney continued to practice law in Springfield, Illinois. In 1890, he moved to Chicago where he continued to practice law. He was elected to the Congress of Chicago district and served as attorney for the Lincoln Park board.
Death
James A. McCartney died on May 13, 1911 in a sanitarium in Sherman, Texas. He was buried at Forest Home Cemetery in Chicago.

The Fox Island School is a former public school in Fox Island, Washington.
On 15. July 1987 the National Register of Historic Places listed the building under the reference number 87001167 as a historic building.
Building
There were two classrooms for grades 1-4, and 5-8 on the first floor. The auditorium, which was used as a lunchroom also, has a stage on one side. Kitchen and restrooms are on the first floor also. The furnace, a play room, and storage where placed in the basement. The grounds were furnished with a baseball field, a playground, and a barn used to store the school bus.
History
The school was built under aid of the Works Progress Administration in 1934.
Between 1943 and 1948 the class sizes fluctuated so there were times when only one class was taught.
The Fox Island School District #337 was integrated into the Peninsula School District #401 in 1959 and the Fox Island School was closed in 1961. First the Grange took possession and later the Fox Island Community and Recreation Association (FICRA) took over operating the Fox Island School as a Community Center. In honor of Col. Frederick Nichols the name Nichols Center was given to the Community Center in 1981.

The white-throated jungle flycatcher (Vauriella albigularis), also known as the Negros jungle flycatcher is a species of bird in the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae.
It is endemic to the Philippines (Negros and Panay islands) and formerly on Guimaras before its extirpation there. The natural habitats of the white-throated jungle flycatcher are tropical moist lowland forests and tropical moist montane forests up to 1,350 masl. It is threatened by habitat loss.
This species was previously placed in the genus Rhinomyias but was moved to Vauriella after a detailed molecular phylogenetic study published in 2010 found that Rhinomyias was polyphyletic.
Description
EBird describes the bird as "A fairly small bird. Rufous-brown on the wings, back, and tail, with a gray head, heavily-streaked pale underparts, and a black face and moustache stripe. Often found in mixed-species flocks. Somewhat similar to Stripe-headed rhabdornis and Grand rhabdornis, but smaller, with a white eye-ring rather than a black band through the eye. Voice includes a loud rattling trill and various quiet chips and squeals."
Habitat and Conservation Status
It is found in tropical moist lowland forests and the lower reaches of tropical moist montane forests typically below 1,000 meters above sea level with it being recorded at a maximum of 1,350 meters above sea level. It prefers primary forest but it has also been recorded in secondary forest and forest edge. It forages in the understorey and lower canopy usually below 10 meters above the ground.
The IUCN Red List assessed this bird as endangered with population is estimated to be 2,500 to 9,999 mature individuals. It is mainly threatened by habitat loss. Negros is one of the most deforested islands in the country owing to illegal logging and conversion of forests into sugarcane plantations. An estimated 4% of Negros and 8% of Panay remained forested in 1988, most of it above 1,000 m.
Conservation actions proposed include more surveys, especially on Panay are suggested to fully understand the range and population of this bird. Seek to obtain stronger protection of remaining forest areas including securing funding to increase the number of forest rangers, as well as strengthening enforcement measures to prevent illegal logging.

Alor is an American luxury jewelry, watch and lifestyle brand founded by Jack and Sandy Zemer in 1979. Alor specializes in designing, creating expensive cable pieces. It is headquartered in San Diego, California.
History
Alor was founded in 1979 in California by Jack Zemer, a former nuclear engineer at General Electric, and his wife, Sandy Zemer. Alor was named by combining the first names of the couple's sons, Tal and Ori, who are now both Principals and Presidents of the company and oversee all aspects of the business. Alor first publicly displayed its nautical cable motif jewelry in the early 1980s. Each Alor piece is handcrafted.
From 1970 to 1992, Alor sold stainless steel cable, 18-karat gold and diamond jewelry under the "Alor" name.
In 1992, Alor began a partnership with Phillipe Charriol International and formed Charriol USA. While ALOR International Ltd. remained the parent company, all Alor jewelry designs were sold throughout and U.S. and the Caribbean as Charriol USA. The partnership ended in early 2014, with ALOR International Ltd. reverting to their original brand name of Alor. For the rebranding, the company released a national advertising campaign featuring model Noot Seear and photographed by Justin Coit.
International expansion began in 2012 and now Alor sells to retailers in Dubai, Israel, Kazakhstan, Mexico and Australia.
In 2013, Ori and Tal Zemer launched Alor Swiss Watches, featuring details such as stainless steel cable bands and 18-karat gold and diamond embellishments.
In 2015, Alor released its Black Label jewelry collection. The Black Label pieces are made in 18-karat gold and feature overlapping circles and ovals set with rubies and black, colorless, and canary diamonds.
In 2017, ALOR partnered with EMA Jewelry to launch a bridal collection called Down the Aisle. EMA will handle distribution and sales as Alor's global licensee.
In addition to Down The Aisle, ALOR will partner with Diamond Foundry to bring a full lab grown designer collection of bridal rings to the marketplace, called ALOR EcoEarth. ALOR and EMA have also teamed with the non-profit organization 1% For the Planet to donate a portion of all proceeds back to preserving the precious resources of our planet.
Partnership with Campowerment
From November 2013 through 2014, Alor was the exclusive watch and jewelry sponsor for the women's leadership and revitalization overnight camp, Campowerment. As sponsors, Alor gave the "camper of the day" a watch from their Swiss watch collection. Alor also provided relaxation lounges at all camp sessions, as well as scholarships to attend other Campowerment retreats.
Advertising campaign
In 2015, Alor unveiled a new advertising campaign. In a departure from past campaigns featuring models or other high-profile faces, its cable jewelry was the sole focus in new ads.

Kocamustafapaşa station is a closed railway station on the İstanbul-Halkalı Line (B1). The station is located in the Samatya neighborhood of Istanbul's Fatih district. Kocamustafapaşa was closed in 2013 due to the closure of the whole B1 line, after the opening of the new Marmaray line. The tracks are planned to be used in the future to permit the access of international and main line train services to Sirkeci Terminal. But it is unknown if there will be train services that will stop on this station in the future (like all at-grade stations located between Yedikule and Sirkeci Terminal which are bypassed with the opening of Marmaray).

The National Center of Azerbaijan (Azerbaijani: Azərbaycan Milli Mərkəzi) is a secret organization that operated from 1924 to 1931 in the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic(AzSSR).
History
According to the investigative work carried out by the State Political Department of the Azerbaijan SSR under the name "The Case of the National Center of Azerbaijan", this center was established in Baku in 1924 to overthrow the Soviet government and creating the independent Republic of Azerbaijan. The center was headed by representatives of the intelligentsia, including former ministers and members of the government of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, representatives of the Musavat and Ittihad parties.
In order to jointly fight against the Soviet government, the "United Transcaucasian Committee" was created at the beginning of 1928, which united the Musavat and Ittihad parties under its leadership. Cooperation was also established with an anti-Soviet organization in Dagestan, and with the local peasant party. In its activities, the center was guided by the political charters of the "Joint Committee of Caucasian Political Emigrants", headed by Alimardan bek Topchubashev in Paris, and the Istanbul Bureau of "Musavat", headed by Mahammad Amin Rasulzade.
There were committees on the industry, agriculture, transport, and a military group functioning under the leadership of the center. Financial assistance to the center was provided by political immigrants in Istanbul and Paris.
Links of the National Center with foreign emigration centers were established in 1926 after the return of the former emigrant Yagub Vezirov from Istanbul. Along with the foreign emigration centers, communication was maintained with their offices in Ardabil and Tabriz. According to the investigation materials, these departments served as a transfer point for the delivery of tasks from Paris and Istanbul. Among the members of the Ardabil group were such political emigrants as Gafar Gafarov and Jafar Jafarov, the Tabriz group - Teymur bey Melik-Aslanov, Kalbali Khan of Nakhchivan.
On September 30, 1931, at a court session of the Board of the State Political Administration of the Azerbaijan SSR, and on February 2, 1932, in Tiflis, at the court of the Board of the Transcaucasian GPU, the "Case of the National Center of Azerbaijan" was considered, the activities of which were terminated, and its members were sentenced to various terms of imprisonment.
Goals and objectives

Nebukawa Station accident () is a railway accident that occurred in Japan on September 1, 1923.
Overview
During the Great Kantō earthquake, at three minutes before noon on September 1, 1923, the local train of the Atami-Odawara Line was travelling south towards Manazuru and was stopped at Nebukawa Station. The earthquake caused a mudslide, which covered the station, sweeping the station building, platforms, and train into the ocean, 45 meters down the slope on which the station was built. The Type 960 locomotive and the first 7 cars in the train were submerged, with only the 8th car remaining above water. The train disaster killed 112 people, with an additional 200 people living in the close vicinity of the station also killed by the landslide. The wreck of the train and tracks were salvaged in September 1932 for scrap metal. The Tokyo-bound train on the same line was stopped in the middle of the bridge over the Nebukawa River just before the station, and was overwhelmed by a 35-foot tsunami, which swept the locomotive into the sea, killing six people.

Vegas Dream, released in Japan as is a gambling video game developed by HAL Laboratory for the Nintendo Entertainment System. A sequel, Vegas Stakes, was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1993.
Gameplay
Vegas Dream begins with graphics showing one of the players arriving at Las Vegas by airplane. Featuring a backdrop of old downtown Las Vegas, players choose which of the two game modes to play: "Vegas Dream" (storyline version) or "One Spot" (strictly gaming, no storyline).
Players then start with a bankroll of $700 at the fictional HAL Palace Hotel, to spend on four games: Keno, Blackjack, Roulette or Slot machines. Between rounds of play at the normal casino games, there are randomly occurring social interactions with various characters, such as business people, other patrons, or casino employees (in the "Vegas Dream" version of the game only). These interactions (and the player's responses to them) have different possible results: sometimes the unidentified man is a pickpocket; other times he is just down on his luck and will reward the player's kindness down the road. The results of interactions are reported on a local Las Vegas news station; music with a cheery tone plays for positive happenings, such as the player receiving cash, with more somber music playing for thefts, injuries, etc.
Vegas Dream also allows the player to date and marry as many members of the opposite sex as desired; men marry a woman named Ms. Sophie while women marry a man named Mr. James. Marriage results in increased cash flow for the player, or a loss of funds from theft in the event that the married person is crooked.
There is a password save feature built into the game. The passwords are twenty-six characters long and consist of letters, numbers and symbols. The Japanese version, with gameplay identical to the North American version, uses slightly stronger language in its script and mentions cigarettes. The text within the Japanese version is also entirely in English.
Endings
It is possible to win the game by earning over $10 million, at which point the player is seen reclining by a pool with their household staff (assuming the player has moved into a mansion and has hired servants), and then taking a limousine to a show with their partner.
Should the player lose all their money, the staff at the HAL Palace give the player one final pull on a slot machine in a last-ditch effort to win some more money. If the player wins, they get to resume their gaming; if not, the player is bid goodbye, and a screen appears showing persons heading towards a plane, ready to depart Las Vegas, ending the game.
Music
At this time, Kazuo Sawa was writing music to some of Hal Laboratory's video games such as Tokoro-san no Mamoru mo Semeru mo. Instead, Hal hired professional keyboardist Kuni Kawachi to compose the game's soundtrack while Sawa worked on sound design and provided the sound driver. Vegas Dream is Kuni Kawachi's only video game to date.

Catherine "Kit" Klein (March 28, 1910 – April 13, 1985) was an American speed skater.
Short biography
Kit Klein was born in Buffalo, New York and started competing on the local level. Later, Klein finished first in the 1500 metres event and third in the 500 metres competition at the 1932 Winter Olympics of Lake Placid, where speed skating for women was a demonstration sport. She also participated in the 1000 metres event but was eliminated in the heats.
She also won the 1,000 m race, as well as the overall bronze medal, at the Unofficial World Allround Championships in Oslo, Norway in 1935. At the 1936 first official World Allround Speed Skating Championships for Women in Stockholm, Sweden, Klein won gold.
After the 1936 Winter Olympics, Klein toured Europe before sailing home. During the voyage home Klein actually threw her skates overboard to mark her retirement from competitive skating. Towards the end 1936, she married Dr. Thomas "Tom" Outland of Sayre, Pennsylvania and the couple settled down in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. For a while, Klein toured around North America with the Ice Follies skating show. After her husband's retirement in 1967, they moved to Holmes Beach, Florida, where Catherine "Kit" Klein-Outland died in 1985 at the age of 75.
Klein-Outland was inducted in the National Speedskating Hall of Fame in 1964, and posthumously in both the International Women's Sports Hall of Fame and the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame in 1993.
Medals
An overview of medals won by Klein at important championships she participated in, listing the years in which she won each. Note that the World Allround Championships of 1935 were unofficial. Also note that speed skating for women was a demonstration sport at the 1932 Winter Olympics of Lake Placid. The medals related to these unofficial and demonstration events are in italics.
Klein's championship wins included:
1930 Buffalo City Championships
1931 Buffalo City Championships
1933 National Championships, held in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin
1933 North American Championships
1934 National Championships, held in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin
1934 North American Indoor Championships, held in Toronto, Ontario, Canada (the Jean Wilson Memorial Trophy)
1935 National Indoor Championships, held in St. Louis, Missouri
1935 National Outdoor Championships, held in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin
During the 1932 Winter Olympics, one of Klein's toughest opponents was Canadian skater Jean Wilson, who took gold on the 500 m and silver on the 1500 m. The following year, Wilson died from a progressive muscular disease at 23. The Jean Wilson Memorial Trophy was created in her honor.
World records
Over the course of her career, Klein skated two world records:
Personal records
To put these personal records in perspective, the WR column lists the official world records on the dates that Klein skated her personal records.
Note that Klein's personal record on the 5000 m was not a world record because Verné Lesche skated 10:15.3 at the same tournament.

The Straight to You Tour is the fourth concert tour by American recording artist Josh Groban. Visiting North America, Europe and Africa, the tour will support Groban's fifth studio album, Illuminations.
Background
The tour was announced by Reprise Records on Valentine's Day 2011. Initially with only three dates, many fans speculated Groban was expanding his intimate tour. Upon his 30th birthday, Groban posted a video on his Tumblr blog stating the tour's expansion in North America with additional dates in England. This is later followed by a posting on his official website with a detailed itinerary of the tour. During an interview with Gayle King, Groban mentions he still worries from time to time about his career. He further states given the current atmosphere in the entertainment industry, Groban is always worried about how the media and fans will approach an experimental sound and production. To prepare for the tour, the singer embarked on a mini tour of the United States playing theaters and concert halls. The nine city tour, entailed "Before We Begin", gave the opportunity for Groban to perform in an intimate setting and connect with the audience in new ways. Groban wants to continue the intimate theme even though he will play arenas.
To introduce the tour, Live Nation stated: "The "Straight To You" Tour will bring the feel of a theater experience to an arena setting though stage design, lighting, and projection, as well as through spontaneity and interactivity. Groban delighted his fans during last year's 'Before We Begin' shows, in which he solicited feedback from the audience on which songs should be included in the set-list. As a result, for the 'Straight To You' shows, Groban will continue to interact with audiences and perform favorites from his best-selling albums, including his self-titled debut, Closer, and Awake, as well as songs from Illuminations."

The Battle of Karagak was fought between the armies of the Kingdom of Imereti and the Ottoman Empire at the place of Karagak, Meskheti, in 1543.
History
At the request of Qvarqvare III's son Kaikhosro, the Ottoman Empire invaded Imereti. By orders of Ottoman Sultan beylerbey of Erzurum, Musa Paşa also known as Kizil-Ahmedlu, was sent to Samtskhe with 22,000 men to conquer the surrounding area. Ottoman army equipped by European cannons besieged the Georgian-garrisoned fortress of Oltisi (now Oltu, Turkey). Bagrat called upon the neighboring Georgian potentates to come to aid. Only the prince of Guria Rostom Gurieli responded, while the prince of Mingrelia, Levan I Dadiani, refused to participate in the alliance, and later sided with the Ottomans, even traveling to Istanbul, where he received gifts and assurances of protection. Outnumbered Bagrat surrendered to Ottomans, however he resumed fighting as soon as Ottoman main army was retreated to Erzurum. Georgians unexpectedly annihilated remaining Ottoman garrison and later pursued main army which was decisively defeated at the battle of Karagak, Musa Paşa was himself killed in fighting.
The Ottomans returned in force two years later, and moved into the principality of Samtskhe, where Bagrat and his ally Luarsab I of Kartli suffered a bitter defeat at the Battle of Sokhoista in 1545. As a result, Samtskhe wrested of Bagrat's control, and came under the Ottoman hegemony.
Aftermath
Samtskhe became vassal of the Ottoman Empire. Qvarqvare III's descendants ruled Samtskhe-Saatabago (until 1628) and then Childir Eyalet until 1820s.

The 1979 NASL Budweiser Indoor Soccer Invitational was a four-team indoor soccer tournament held at the Bayfront Center in St. Petersburg, Florida on the final weekend of January 1979.
Overview
Four teams North American Soccer League teams participated in the two-day event; the Dallas Tornado, the Fort Lauderdale Strikers, the Tampa Bay Rowdies, and the Tulsa Roughnecks. Matches were 45 minutes long and divided into three 15-minute periods with an intermission between each. Each session consisted of two games (i.e. a doubleheader). Nearly 12,700 people attended the two sessions. Dallas and Tampa Bay each won both of their matches, but Dallas Tornado were crowned champions based on a greater goal differential. Dallas forward Jim Ryan lead the invitational in scoring with 7 goals. The tournament's final match saw goalkeeper Winston DuBose of Tampa Bay become only the second NASL goalie to record a rare indoor shut-out. Dallas goalkeeper Ken Cooper had accomplished the feat on two previous occasions.
These were not the only indoor games played that winter. With a fully sanctioned season of NASL indoor soccer still eleven months away, NASL teams were free to schedule their own games at that time. Tampa Bay, for example played three other indoor matches. By contrast, Fort Lauderdale scheduled only the two games of the invitational. The competing Major Indoor Soccer League had already begun their first season in December 1978.

In addition to the tournament itself, several NASL teams participated in international indoor friendlies, and tune-ups for both the tournament and 1979 outdoor season. Dallas and Houston played twice in December 1978. The Rowdies–Hurricane match on January 25 was played using the MISL-size goals, timing and ball, as the arena was already set up for the Hurricane's alter ego, the MISL's Houston Summit. As part of a six-match, NASL tour in February, perennial Soviet powerhouse FC Dynamo Moscow scheduled three indoor games.

Protocol No. 12 to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ETS No. 177) is an anti-discrimination treaty of the Council of Europe. It was adopted on November 4, 2000, in Rome and entered into force on April 1, 2005, after tenth ratification. As of 2017, it has been ratified by 20 States (from 47 CoE member states).
Core provisions
Article 1 – General prohibition of discrimination. 1 The enjoyment of any right set forth by law shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status. 2 No one shall be discriminated against by any public authority on any ground such as those mentioned in paragraph 1.
Unlike Article 14 of the Convention itself, the prohibition of discrimination in Protocol 12 is not limited to enjoying only those rights provided by the Convention.
Application
The first case, where the European Court of Human Rights has found a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 12, was Sejdić and Finci v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, adjudicated in 2009.

Edessa in turn falls in love with him; she escapes from court and attempts to flee with him to Lydia but they are shipwrecked and seized by pirates.

B-427 was a Project 641 () diesel-electric attack submarine of the Soviet Navy. The "B" (actually "Б") in her designation stands for большая (bolshaya, "large"). Commissioned in 1971, the submarine operated with the Russian Pacific Fleet until decommissioning in 1994.
The boat was sold to a group of Australian businessmen, who converted her into a museum vessel, which was placed on display at the Australian National Maritime Museum (under the name Foxtrot-540) from 1995 until 1998, then at Long Beach, California (under the name Podvodnaya Lodka B-427 Scorpion) in 1998.
The submarine fell into disrepair, and has been closed to the public since 2015.
Decommissioning and preservation
The submarine was decommissioned by the Russian Navy in December 1994. She was one of the last three Foxtrot-class submarines to serve in the Russian Pacific Fleet. The boat was acquired by a group of Australian businessmen on a three-year lease purchase contract, and was towed from Vladivostok on 25 July 1995. En route to Sydney, the tow company claimed that the deal for the Russian Navy to cover the cost of the tow was invalid, and claimed that A$150,000 in towing expenses was required. The submarine arrived in Sydney on 31 August, and after some modifications, was loaned to the Australian National Maritime Museum for display as a museum vessel under the designation "Foxtrot-540" (the submarine's last pennant number while in service). As the submarine was still the property of the Russian Navy for the duration of the lease, an Australian ex-submariner was commissioned into the Russian Navy to command and look after Foxtrot-540, with the boat's former engineering officer assisting. The submarine was in near-operational condition; the diesel generators and electrical storage system, ballast tanks, and hotel load equipment were functional, and Russian personnel travelled to Australia to teach museum staff about maintenance and operation of the boat. Foxtrot-540 spent three years berthed at the museum, attracting over 700,000 visitors during this period (including intelligence analysts from multiple nations during the first weeks on display).
In May 1998, the submarine was loaded onto a heavy lift ship and relocated to Long Beach, California. On arrival, she was berthed next to , and opened to the public on 14 July under the designation "Podvodnaya Lodka B-427 Scorpion". On 19 April 2011, the company operating Queen Mary (Delaware North) announced that they had acquired Scorpion, and were planning to increase attendance at both attractions through combined ticketing and joint marketing campaigns. Urban Commons took over the lease of the Queen Mary and the Scorpion in April 2016. The Scorpion Submarine is owned by NEWCO Pty Ltd and is on a long-term lease to Urban Commons.
Museum closure
In November 2012, the vessel was discovered to have flooding and as a result was listing 24 degrees to the starboard side. It was closed to the public in 2015, by which time the pressure hull had ruptured and raccoons had taken up residence on board. By 2021, when control of the Queen Mary returned to Long Beach, the city was attempting to have the submarine removed.

The Breaker is a 1974 documentary about Breaker Morant directed by Frank Shields.
Production
It was the first film from Frank Shields. He says he was inspired to make it after visiting Breaker Morant's grave. He was unable to get finance from the funding bodies so made it himself for $7,000. He wrote and shot it in Zimbabwe, researched it in Australia and did the post production in London.
Shields later recalled:
I paid for the horses and cameramen with cases of beer. I didn't know how to work a camera; they taught me how to make a film so it was like my film school... What holds the doco together is the story. It's like a Greek tragedy – Morant was like the Ned Kelly and the Fletcher Christian; at one point he crossed a line that he could never come back from. At the end of the day it all comes down to story.
Reception
The film won the Greater Union Awards for best documentary at the 1975 Sydney Film Festival. It aired on the ABC in 1975.
Shields wrote a book based on the documentary, In Search of Breaker Morant: Balladist and Bushveldt Carbineer, which was published in 1979.

William Reed ( – September 1728) was a British colonial official who served as the acting governor of North Carolina from 1722 to 1724.
Biography
Reed was born in 1670 and he probably arrived to North Carolina from England. Reed was appointed as a Proprietor's deputy and member of the Council in 1712, keeping these occupations for the remainder of his life. Reed was appointed Acting Governor of North Carolina on 7 September 1722, keeping the charge until the arrival of Governor Burrington on 15 January 1724, when Reed was appointed president of Council. Several lawsuits against Reed were made (between them, he was accused of sell liquor without licenses at this home, with others men). Reed repeatedly clashed with colonial governors and even wrote an official complaint from the Council about Gov. Richard Everard's administration to King George II that was sent the day after Reed's death. He died on 1728, at his home in Pasquotank County, North Carolina. Reed was married twice: The first of his wife was named Christian, with who had two sons: Christian and Joseph. His second wife was Jane, with who had a son, William.

The Program Exchange was a syndicator of television programs. It was founded as DFS Program Exchange in 1978, which became elongated to the DFS-Dorland Program Exchange from 1986 to 1987. From 1986 to 2008, it was a division of Saatchi & Saatchi, an advertising agency (which acquired Dancer Fitzgerald Sample, the original owners), while merging with Dorland Advertising in 1986, and would later be acquired by Publicis in 2000. In January 2008, Publicis transferred The Program Exchange from the Saatchi & Saatchi subsidiary to its ZenithOptimedia subsidiary, the logo was then changed to reflect this move. In 2016, the programexchange.com website was shut down; the shutdown coincided with NBCUniversal's purchase of one of its most prominent clients, DreamWorks Classics.
The Program Exchange was a "barter syndicator," distributing programming on behalf of the shows' producers, many of them having their own cash distribution services. Instead of paying a cash fee, television stations who ran those programs agreed to a barter exchange (hence the syndicator name), wherein the station agreed to air a certain number of commercials for various General Mills products per program. This arrangement allowed for the programs to air on stations that may not have large budgets to acquire them. The Program Exchange typically distributed older programming that was no longer widely distributed in syndication, as well as programming designed to meet federal educational/information mandates. The Program Exchange continued to hold distribution rights to the Jay Ward Productions and Total Television archives throughout the exchange's existence; both of those companies' programs were produced at the DFS-owned Gamma Productions studios in Mexico until that studio shut down in 1968.
The Program Exchange handled distribution for all titles listed below. The dates listed are the dates that they were distributed, not the dates they originally aired.
History
From the company's beginnings as DFS Program Exchange, which was originally headquartered in Dallas, the company's initial product was to syndicate several shows that were abandoned by other syndicators, such as Hanna-Barbera and Gamma Productions archives, who had made them more successful, such as Scooby-Doo and The Jetsons. The company grew with Olympic Champions, which starred Bruce Jenner, as its first ever live-action outing distributed by DFS themselves. In 1983, it purchased the exclusive syndication rights of Bewitched from Columbia Pictures Television. It also acquired the rights from CPT, the exclusive syndication rights to two other Screen Gems shows I Dream of Jeannie and The Partridge Family. These shows eventually grew into success that they wanted to come back to popularity.
In 1985, DFS Program Exchange made its first bold move by syndicating their own straight barter strip Dennis the Menace, as well as U.S. syndicated rights to Woody Woodpecker and Friends, which came after the final MCA TV commitment expired in January 1988. In 1986, DFS was bought out by Saatchi & Saatchi, which was then merged with Dorland Advertising, another Saatchi & Saatchi subsidiary, and to reflect the organization, it was renamed to DFS-Dorland Program Exchange. In 1987, it was renamed shortly after to The Program Exchange. On March 14, 1988, it was moved to Hudson Street, New York. In 1990, Susan Radden was appointed vice president at the subsidiary. In 1993, the company made its major breakout hit when it picked up the off-net syndicated rights to the cartoon Garfield and Friends, which was announced on January 20, 1992, and be available on a barter basis. In 1997, The Program Exchange secured the syndication rights to the first 65 episodes of the original English dub of Sailor Moon. A year later, it helped DiC broadcast the remaining 17 episodes on Cartoon Network's programming block Toonami.

Shanmugam Subbaiah (1930–2012) was a well known film distributor in the Madurai district of Tamil Nadu, India, with an experience of 40 years. His initial film career started off as a ticket checker in the Natraj film theatre in Karaikudi. Then he advanced to become the owner of the same theatre. This was followed by a series of successes which made him start a film distribution unit called 'Venkateshwara Films' in the Thirunalveli district of Tamil Nadu. After that turned out to be a success, he proceeded to Madurai and started another unit called 'Vaideki movies ' as a partnership with noted producer, lyricist and writer Panju Arunachalam. He kept closing and opening distribution units due to internal problems. He retired from film distribution at the end of the 20th century due to chronic health problems.
Early life
Shanmugam was born to Subbaiah, a rich businessman, and Seethai, a rich landlady belonging to the Ilupakudi village, in the Karaikudi district of Tamil Nadu. His mother died some time after his birth and his father married another woman. He was hated by his stepmother who did not even give him food to eat. He was a talented boy and was also a star footballer in his school, but he had to discontinue schooling due to lack of support. He was born a rich boy but live like a poor one. His aunt bore witness to this and made him stay at her house in Aravayal. His uncle got him the job of a ticket checker at the Natraj theater, following his interest in the cinema industry. Due to his determination and hard work, he was liked by the theater owner and was eventually given the post of manager. And thus, he started his film career.
Shanmugam married Manimeghalai of Kandadevi, a village adjoining his hometown and moved to a rented flat in Thirunalveli. He had five children in all. He started a film distribution circuit called ‘Venkateshwara films' as a joint venture. It was a success . This was his first attempt at distribution. Then he started his lone distribution project in the form of ‘Priya films'. That too was a success. He received a big income and distributed a large number of films. He wanted to replicate his success at an even bigger scale. So he closed that unit and from the rented flat of Thirunalveli, he shifted to his own house in Madurai.
In Madurai, he started a distribution company called ‘Vaideki movies' with Panju Arunachalam as a partner. It was a major hit. He mostly distributed films of Actors Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan. He had also distributed the films of Actors Sivaji Ganesan and MG Ramachandran from his previous unit, including the super hit Sivaji film ‘Vazhkai'. He closed this unit and started another one called ‘Gayathri films'. This was his last unit and that too was a major hit.
Problems
It was his film career, which brought him his fortune, that caused his downfall. The tension and pressure of success prevented him from sleeping and breathing properly. This made him take overdoses of sleeping tablets. This cost him dearly in his later days. He lost his hearing and could only see partially. He could not walk properly. His neural system got damaged severely. He tried to fight it but could not. He died on 26 May 2012.

The 1913–14 Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey season was the 17th season of play for the program.
Season
After paring the team down to 24 men, Harvard began its first year as a major sport with a tune-up game against the Boston Athletic Association. Soft ice and early-season jitters contributed to a less-than-stellar effort from the Crimson and they lost the match 1–3 while cycling through many of their alternate players. The loss was unfortunate but hardly damaging to their season. A bigger development was the continued and expanding interest of ice hockey for the student body. Undergraduates were so enamored with the idea of joining the team that a second squad of 34 men, completely separate from the Varsity and Freshman teams, was organized and a schedule arranged.
After the rather poor effort in the B. A. A. game, Harvard exploded out of the gate against MIT and did not take the pressure off all game, ending with a dominant 11–1 victory. The convincing victory demonstrated how the good the team could be as they embarked on their first ever holiday trip over the winter break. They would play Syracuse HC and Ottawa each twice with the team being billeted at the home of team captain Willetts in nearby Skaneateles.
The trip started well with the team producing a solid win against the Syracuse Club, but afterwards the results turned sour. Syracuse earned a split with a 2–1 win, then Ottawa strangled the Crimson offense, not allowing a goal in either of the two matches. The defense from Harvard, provided mostly by Willetts and Clafin, was notable but the lack of scoring punch doomed the Crimson from the start. The terrible results portended a bad season for the Crimson, and once they began their intercollegiate schedule began those predictions bore fruit.
Harvard could only just defeat Amherst a team they should have had not trouble against. Despite the close shaves, the Crimson alternates were gaining much needed game experience. Against Massachusetts Agricultural College the offense continued to struggle, showing up just in the nick of time to overcome a deficit in overtime and again escape with a one-goal victory. When the hosted Dartmouth the score was tight once more, but the team looked to be performing much more as a cohesive unit.
Their next game came against Princeton. Harvard had been a thorn in Princeton's side over the previous two years, being the only team to beat the Tigers the previous year. The Crimson defense had faced Princeton star Hobey Baker before and knew how to play against him. They used that experience to restrict the speedy Baker and keep the game tied for most of the contest. Even when Princeton opened the scoring it was a scant few minutes before the game was knotted at 1-all. Afterwards, no matter how hard the Tigers tried, they could not penetrate the stifling defense. A 14-minute overtime session was played to no effect, then an open-ended second overtime began and followed sudden-death rules. Harvard took full advantage of its many alternates while Princeton was forced to play with nearly the same seven players all game. The Tigers flagged from fatigue and in the 78th minute of what was scheduled as a 40-minute game, Saltonstall ended the game in Harvard's favor.
Harvard dropped their next game to McGill but when they faced Yale the four goal effort from Hopkins gave Harvard a chance at a second consecutive intercollegiate title. The Crimson had played each game over the previous month at the Boston Arena, however, and now they would have a second chance to prove their mettle on the road. When they met Yale in New Haven the Crimson were not prepared for the hard checking from the Elis and Yale pushed Harvard around for most of the game.
Three days later in a second rematch, Princeton could have tried to follow Yale's game plan but they stuck to their own high-octane game and simply outplayed the Crimson, scoring the final three goals in 4–2 victory. Worse for Harvard, Willetts and Philips were injured in the game and doubt was cast on their ability to compete in the final games against Princeton and Yale. Both players started the rubber match with Princeton a week later but it was clear that the Tigers were the better team. Despite keying their defense on Baker, the Tiger star could not be contained and assisted on three Princeton goals in a 4–1 victory.

Nowruz Khani, or singing for Nowruz, is a Tabari Gilani tradition in which in the latest days of the year before the Persian New Year (Nowrooz), people go at the door of their neighbors and sing songs about the impending coming of the spring. According to this tradition, people hold lanterns and pay visit to all the houses in their neighborhood, while clattering two pieces of wood together. When they come at a door they take permission for Nowruz Khani by singing: "O my sire, first I say you hail, O good-thought person, grant us an opportunity to sing some words to you". And if they get permission, which is usually the case except when the household visited is mourning for a deceased person or facing other extenuating circumstances, they sing songs eulogizing the Imams of Shiite Muslims. In return, they will be given a gift such as money, rice, or eggs.
Usually Nowruz Khans or singers, give a green stick of "shamshad" tree as a symbol for fortune to the household, and if they were not at home, put it in the porch of the house.

Halse Hall is a plantation great house in Clarendon, Jamaica.
During the Spanish occupation of Jamaica the estate was known as "Hato de Buena Vista". In 1655, following the English capture of Jamaica the site was given to Major Thomas Halse who came from Barbados with Penn and Venables. Here he raised hogs, grazed cattle and built Halse Hall. The house had thick walls and served as the centre of the estate and a rallying point for defence. At the time of Thomas Halse death in 1702, the Great House was just a single-storey building. By the late 1740s the building was owned by his son, Francis Saddler Halse, who developed the property into a more imposing and beautiful two-storey structure. A new entrance was erected, accessed by an elaborate arrangement of stone steps flanked by columns and capped with a fanlight. A peaked portico was added later.
The Halse Hall Burial-Ground contains a tomb of the Halse family— Major Thomas Halse (d. 1702) and Thomas Halse (d. 1727).
The property belonged to Henry De la Beche who stayed there during 1823–24, while he made his geological survey of Jamaica. His Notes on the present condition of the negroes in Jamaica was based on his experiences on the estate. In December 1835 the estate was owned by the Hibbert family who received £3,523 11s 9d compensation when the 172 enslaved Africans were emancipated.
In 1969 it was purchased by Alcoa Minerals of Jamaica who added another wing. Halse Hall is the oldest English building in Jamaica which is still used as a residence.

W.A.K.O. World Championships 2007 in Belgrade were the joint 16th edition of the W.A.K.O. world championships - the second event would be held later that year in Coimbra, Portugal. They were for amateur male and female kickboxers and covered the following categories; K-1, Low-Kick and Light-Contact. Weight classes for men ranged from light bantamweight (51 kg or 112 lb) to super heavyweight (over 91 kg or 200.6 lb), while the women's ranged from featherweight (52 kg or 114.6 lb) to super heavyweight (over 70 kg or 154 lb). More information on the categories, weight classes and rules is provided in the various sections below. In total there were 1085 athletes at the championships, representing sixty countries including China (taking part for the first time), fighting in 49 tournaments. The Belgrade championships were held at the Pionir Hall in Belgrade, Serbia from Monday, September 24 to Monday, October 1, 2007.
K-1
W.A.K.O.'s K-1 category uses the same rules set by the K-1 organization and combine a mixture of techniques from Muay Thai, Karate, western boxing and other forms of stand up fighting. The main difference between K-1 rules and other forms of kickboxing is the use of the clinch and knees – which have recently been limited to one knee per clinch. Attacks that are legal include strikes to the head (front, side and forehead), the torso (front and side), leg (any part) and foot/feet (sweeps only). As mentioned before fighters are also allowed to knees (only one hand to clinch and one knee strike per clinch) and can use the back fist/spinning back fist technique. Strikes that are illegal include attacks to the top of the head, the back, the top of the shoulders, the neck and shots to the groin. Techniques involving elbows are also illegal. Due to the amateur nature of W.A.K.O. championships all fighters must wear protection for their head, teeth, breast (women only) groin, shin and feet, and must fight with the standard gloves.
Each fight is three, two-minute rounds and is scored by three judges who score successful (legal) strikes that are not blocked, and are thrown with full power. As with other forms, illegal strikes may result in a point(s) deduction or even disqualification. Unlike Full-Contact and Low-Kick it is not necessary for the minimum six kicks per round to be counte. Victory can be achieved by a point's decision, technical knockout or knockout, abandonment (when one fighter gives up), disqualification or by a walkover (other fighter is unable to participate). If a fighter is knocked down three times in the fight he will automatically lose via technical knockout. More detail on K-1 rules can be found at the official W.A.K.O. website.
Weight classes in K-1 at Belgrade were similar to that of the Low-Kick category, with the men having eleven weight classes from bantamweight (54 kg or 118.8 lb) to super heavyweight (over 90 kg or 200.2 lb), while the women's had six beginning at featherweight (52 kg or 114.4 lb) and ending super heavyweight (over 70 kg or 154 lb). Belarus was the most successful nation in K-1 winning five gold, three silver and five bronze in both the male and female categories.

K-1 (Women) Medals Table
Low-Kick
Low-Kick is similar to Full-Contact kickboxing only that as well as allowing kicks and punches to the head and body, it also allows clean kicks to be made to opponents legs. Attacks that are legal include strikes to the head (front, side and forehead), the torso (front and side), leg (thigh) and foot/feet (sweeps only). Strikes that are illegal include attacks to the top of the head, the back, the top of the shoulders, the neck and the groin. All fighters are required to wear protection for their head, teeth, breast (women only) groin, shin and feet, and must fight with the standard gloves.
A minimum of six kicks must be thrown each round or points may be deducted by the referee. Each fight is three, two minute rounds and is scored by three judges. The judges will score successful (legal) strikes that are not blocked, and are thrown with full power. Illegal moves may result in points deduction or if repeated, disqualification. In the event of a draw after three rounds the judges will base the victor on who was stronger in the final round, or failing that will use their remarks from each round to deduce who wins. Victory can be achieved by a point's decision, technical knockout or knockout, abandonment (when one fighter gives up), disqualification or by a walkover (other fighter is unable to participate). If a fighter is knocked down three times in the fight he will automatically lose via technical knockout. More detail on Low-Kick rules can be found at the official W.A.K.O. website.
At Belgrade the men's Low-Kick competition had twelve six weight classes starting at light bantamweight (51 kg or 112.2 lb) to super heavyweight (over 91 kg or 200.2 lb), while the women's had six ranging from featherweight (52 kg or 114.4 lb) to super heavyweight (over 70 kg or 154 lb), while . As with Light-Contact, by the championships end, Russia was the strongest nation, having won an impressive haul of six gold, two silver and two bronze medals.

Light-Contact
In this form of kickboxing fighters are scored on their ability to land controlled and clean strikes with an emphasis put on style over power. Fighters that fight too aggressively may be cautioned by the referee and, if the offence is repeated, may be disqualified, although strikes that are too light (such as a push or brush) will not be scored either. Attacks are allowed to the head (front, side and forehead), the torso (front and side) and leg (foot sweeps). As mentioned before excessive force is illegal as well as strikes to the top of the head, the back, the top of the shoulders, the neck and below the belt. Light-Contact is seen as the intermediate stage between Semi and Full-Contact kickboxing involving more physicality than Semi but less so than Full. All fighters are required to wear protection for their head, teeth, breast (women only) groin, shin and feet, and must fight with the standard 10oz gloves.
Fighters score the following points for landing a controlled strike on their opponent; punch, kick to body, foot sweep (1 point), kick to head, jumping kick to body (2 points), jumping kick to head (3 points). Each fight is three, two-minute rounds and is scored by three judges. In the event of a draw the match will be scored electronically. Victory can be achieved by points decision, technical knockout (usually when one fighter is so dominant the referee is forced to stop the contest), abandonment (when one fighter gives up), disqualification or by a walkover (other fighter is unable to participate). More detail on Light-Contact rules can be found at the official W.A.K.O. website.
Light-Contact uses slightly different weight classes from Low-Kick and K-1. At Belgrade the men had nine weight classes, starting at 57 kg or 125.4 lb and ending at over 94 kg (206.8 lb), while the women's Light-Contact competition had five weight classes beginning at 55 kg (121 lb) and ending at over 70 kg (154 lb). At the end of the championships, Russia was the most successful nation in Light-Contact having won five gold and two silver medals.

Druze in Syria is a significant minority religion. According to The World Factbook, Druze makes up about 3.2 percent of the population (as of 2010), or approximately 700,000 persons, including residents of the Golan Heights. The Druzites are concentrated in the rural, mountainous areas east and south of Damascus in the area known officially as the Jabal al-Druze.
Druze is a monotheistic and Abrahamic religion. Syria has the largest Druzite population in the world, and many Syrian Druzites also living abroad, particularly in Venezuela, who have been living there for over the past hundred years.
History
Druze is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion that is a gnostic offshoot and Neoplatonist sect of Isma'ilism, a branch of Shia Islam. The Druze evolved from the religion of Islam and now is an independent religion, separate from Islam.
The Druzites follow a batini or esoteric interpretation of the Five Pillars of Islam. Some modern scholars and the Amman Message identify them as Muslims. However, some Muslims disagree, noting that since they do not practice exoteric interpretations, "fasting during the month of Ramadan and making a pilgrimage to Mecca. Thus, they are not regarded by Muslims as Islamic".
The Druze follow a lifestyle of isolation where no conversion is allowed, neither out of nor into, the religion. When Druze lives among people of other religions, they try to blend in, in order to protect their religion and their own safety. They can pray as Muslims, or as Christians, depending on where they are. This system is apparently changing in modern times, where more security has allowed Druze to be more open about their religious belonging.
The Tanukhids inaugurated the Druze community in Syria when most of them accepted and adopted the new message that was being preached in the 11th century, due to their leaderships close ties with Fatimid caliph al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah.
Historically the relationship between the Druze and Muslims has been characterized by intense persecution. The Druze faith is often classified as a branch of Isma'ili. Even though the faith originally developed out of Ismaili Islam, most Druze do not identify as Muslims, and they do not accept the five pillars of Islam. The Druze have frequently experienced persecution by different Muslim regimes such as the Shia Fatimid Caliphate, Sunni Ottoman Empire, and Egypt Eyalet. The persecution of the Druze included massacres, demolishing Druze prayer houses and holy places, and forced conversion to Islam. Those were no ordinary killings in the Druze's narrative, they were meant to eradicate the whole community according to the Druze narrative.
The Druze community in Syria played an important role in the formation of the modern state of Syria, and even though they are a minority they play an important role in the Syrian political scene.
In Syria, most Druze live in the Jabal al-Druze, a rugged and mountainous region in the southwest of the country, which is more than 90 percent Druze inhabited; some 120 villages are exclusively so. Other notable communities live in the Harim Mountains, the Damascus suburb of Jaramana, and on the southeast slopes of Mount Hermon. A large Syrian Druze community historically lived in the Golan Heights, but following wars with Israel in 1967 and 1973, many of these Druze fled to other parts of Syria; most of those who remained to live in a handful of villages in the disputed zone, while only a few live in the narrow remnant of Quneitra Governorate that is still under effective Syrian control.
The Druze always played a far more important role in Syrian politics than its comparatively small population would suggest. With a community of little more than 100,000 in 1949 or roughly three percent of the Syrian population, the Druze of Syria's southwestern mountains constituted a potent force in Syrian politics and played a leading role in the nationalist struggle against the French. Under the military leadership of Sultan al-Atrash, the Druze provided much of the military force behind the Great Syrian Revolt of 1925–27. In 1945, Amir Hasan al-Atrash, the paramount political leader of the Jabal Druze State, led the Druze military units in a successful revolt against the French, making the Jebel al-Druze the first and only region in Syria to liberate itself from French rule without British assistance. At independence, the Druze made confident by their successes, expected that Damascus would reward them for their many sacrifices on the battlefield. They demanded to keep their autonomous administration and many political privileges accorded them by the French and sought generous economic assistance from the newly independent government.
When a local paper in 1945 reported that President Shukri al-Quwatli (1943–49) had called the Druzes a "dangerous minority", Sultan Pasha al-Atrash flew into a rage and demanded a public retraction. If it were not forthcoming, he announced, the Druzes would indeed become "dangerous" and a force of 4,000 Druze warriors would "occupy the city of Damascus." Quwwatli could not dismiss Sultan Pasha's threat. The military balance of power in Syria was tilted in favor of the Druzes, at least until the military builds up during the 1948 War in Palestine. One advisor to the Syrian Defense Department warned in 1946 that the Syrian army was "useless", and that the Druzes could "take Damascus and capture the present leaders in a breeze."
During the four years of Adib Shishakli's rule in Syria (December 1949 to February 1954) (on 25 August 1952: Shishakli created the Arab Liberation Movement (ALM), a progressive party with pan-Arabist and socialist views), the Druze community was subjected to a heavy attack by the Syrian government. Shishakli believed that among his many opponents in Syria, the Druzes were the most potentially dangerous, and he was determined to crush them. He frequently proclaimed: "My enemies are like a serpent: the head is the Jebel al-Druze, the stomach Homs, and the tail Aleppo. If I crush the head the serpent will die." Shishakli dispatched 10,000 regular troops to occupy the Jebel al-Druze. Several towns were bombarded with heavy weapons, killing scores of civilians and destroying many houses. According to Druze accounts, Shishakli encouraged neighboring bedouin tribes to plunder the defenseless population and allowed his own troops to run amok.
Shishakli launched a campaign to defame the Druzes for their religion and politics. He accused the entire community of treason, at times claiming they were agents of the British and Hashemites, at others that they were fighting for Israel against the Arabs. He even produced a cache of Israeli weapons allegedly discovered in the Jabal. Even more painful for the Druze community was his publication of "falsified Druze religious texts" and false testimonials ascribed to leading Druze sheikhs designed to stir up sectarian hatred. This propaganda also was broadcast in the Arab world, mainly Egypt. Shishakli was assassinated in Brazil on 27 September 1964 by a Druze seeking revenge for Shishakli's bombardment of the Jebel al-Druze.
He forcibly integrated minorities into the national Syrian social structure; his "Syrianization" of Alawi and Druze territories had to be accomplished in part using violence. To this end, al-Shishakli encouraged the stigmatization of minorities. He saw minority demands as tantamount to treason. His increasingly chauvinistic notions of Arab nationalism were predicated on the denial that "minorities" existed in Syria.
After the Shishakli's military campaign, the Druze community lost a lot of its political influence, but many Druze military officers played an important role when it comes to the Ba'ath government currently ruling Syria.
In 1967, a community of Druze in the Golan Heights came under Israeli control, today about 20,000 strong. The Qalb Loze massacre was a reported massacre of 20-24 Syrian Druze on 10 June 2015 in the village of Qalb Loze in Syria's northwestern Idlib Governorate. On 25 July 2018, a group of Islamic State-affiliated attackers entered the Druze city of as-Suwayda and initiated a series of gunfights and suicide bombings on its streets killing at least 258 people, the vast majority of them civilians. See 2018 As-Suwayda attacks for further information.
Demographics
According to scholar Colbert C. Held of University of Nebraska, Lincoln the number of Druze people worldwide is around one million, with about 45% to 50% live in Syria, 35% to 40% live in Lebanon, and less than 10% live in Israel, with recently there has been a growing Druze diaspora. The Syrian Druze are Arabic in language and culture, and their mother tongue is the Arabic Language. The Druze Arabic dialect, especially in the rural areas, is often different from the other regional Syrian Arabic dialects. Druze Arabic dialect is distinguished from others by retention of the phoneme /qāf/. The use of by Druze is particularly prominent in the mountains and less so in urban areas.
The Druze are concentrated in the rural, mountainous areas east and south of Damascus in the area known officially as Jabal al-Druze. The Syrian Druze are estimated to constitute 3.2% of Syria's population of approximately 23 million, which means they amount to between 700 and 736 thousand people.
Before the Syrian civil war, its been estimated that around 700,000 Druze were living in Syria in 2010, or around 3% of the Syrian population. Around 337,5000 Druze lived in As-Suwayda Governorate (or 48.2% of total Syrian Druze), the only governorate in Syria that has a Druze majority (around 90%). While 250,000 Druze (or 35.7%) lived in Damascus and its outskirts (such as Jaramana, Sahnaya, and Jdeidat Artouz), and around 30,000 Druze lived in the east side of Mount Hermon, and around 25,000 Druze lived in 14 villages in Jabal al-Summaq in Idlib Governorate.
There are many Syrian Druzes also living abroad, particularly in Latin America, who have been living there for over the past hundred years. In Venezuela, there are approximately 60,000 Druze of Syrian origin.
By one estimate made by Elisabet Granli from University of Oslo, around 1,920 Syrian Druzes converted to Christianity, according to the same study Christian of Druze background (Druze converts to Christianity) still regard themselves as Druze, and they claim that there is no contradiction between being Druze and being Christian.

Marcus Franklee Foster (born June 3, 1995) is an American professional basketball player for Rytas Vilnius of the Lithuanian Basketball League (LKL) and the Basketball Champions League. He played college basketball for Kansas State University and Creighton University before playing professionally in South Korea, Lebanon, Israel, Turkey, Greece, and Lithuania.
Early life and high school career
Foster is the son of Melvin and Alvita Foster. Foster has two older sisters. Growing up in Wichita Falls, Texas, Marcus Foster began playing basketball at a young age and developed a reputation as a gymrat. He competed for Hirschi High School and was a well-regarded recruit for Kansas State.
College career
Kansas State
Foster was a surprise star at Kansas State, scoring 25 points in his second game in uniform. In a game against Texas in February, he contributed 34 points. Foster had 29 in a matchup versus Baylor in March. He was named Second Team All-Big 12 and led Kansas State to a nine seed in the NCAA Tournament. On the season, Foster averaged 15.5 points, 3.2 rebounds and 2.5 assists per game, and he shot 40 percent from behind the 3-point arc. He went to the LeBron James Skill Academy in the summer.
In his sophomore year, Foster was named to the Preseason First Team All-Big 12. However, Foster had a very disappointing season, which he blamed on focusing too much on the NBA. He gained weight and was suspended three games into the conference season. Foster's per game averages dropped to 12.5 points, 2.3 rebounds and 1.9 assists per game. Kansas State limped to a 15–17 record, and at the end of the season coach Bruce Weber dismissed him. Foster transferred to Creighton since he had developed a relationship with coach Greg McDermott.
Creighton
Per NCAA policy, Foster was forced to sit out a season. Coming into his redshirt junior season, Foster was named Preseason Big East Honorable Mention. He was the first player in 30 years to score 15 or more points in the first eight games of Creighton's season. On February 19, 2017, Foster scored a career-high 35 points in an 87–70 win against Georgetown. At the conclusion of the season, he garnered First Team All-Big East honors. He was named one of five finalists for the Jerry West Award. Foster scored 638 points as a junior, the highest for a Creighton newcomer, for an 18.2 points per game average, third highest in the Big East. After deliberating for a few days, he opted to return for his senior year.
On September 29, 2017, Foster's girlfriend Chelsea Ghasemi gave birth to their first child. Foster was named to the Preseason First Team All-Big East as a senior. He had a season-high 32 points in a 90–81 win versus UT Arlington on December 19. On February 7, 2018, Foster scored his 2,000th career point on a game-winning shot to defeat DePaul. In his final college game, a loss to Kansas State in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, he scored just five points but embraced Bruce Weber after the game. Foster averaged 19.8 points, 3.9 rebounds and 2.7 assists per game as a senior. Foster was named to the First Team All-Big East. After the season he was invited to the 2018 Portsmouth Invitational Tournament.

Teladoc Health, Inc. is a multinational telemedicine and virtual healthcare company headquartered in the United States. Primary services include telehealth, medical opinions, AI and analytics, telehealth devices and licensable platform services. In particular, Teladoc Health uses telephone and videoconferencing software as well as mobile apps to provide on-demand remote medical care. Billed as the first and largest telemedicine company in the United States, Teladoc Health was launched in 2002 and has acquired companies such as BetterHelp in 2015, Best Doctors in 2017, and Advance Medical in 2018. It trades on the NYSE and in 2019 was active in 130 countries and served around 40 million members in 2021.
History
2002–2008
Teladoc was founded in 2002 in Dallas, Texas by G. Byron Brooks EE MD and Michael Gorton. Billing itself as the oldest telemedicine company in the United States, Teladoc's initial business model allowed patients to remotely consult with state-licensed doctors at any time. Companies paid a monthly fee for their employees to access the service, while patients paid a flat fee for each consultation, originally about $35 to $40. With Gorton as both chairman and CEO, Teladoc launched nationally in 2005 at the Consumer Directed Health Care Conference in Chicago, Illinois. Teladoc had around 1 million members by the end of 2007, with large employers such as AT&T providing the service to employees as a health benefit.
2009–2014
Jason Gorevic was named Teladoc's chief executive in 2009. The company's initial private funding rounds raised $9 million in December 2009, $4 million in January 2011, and $18.6 million in September 2011. That year, Aetna began offering Teladoc for its fully insured members in Florida and Texas, later offering Teladoc in all 50 states. Teladoc acquired Consult A Doctor for $16.6 million cash in August 2013, allowing smaller companies to access Teladoc's services. At the time, Teladoc completed 120,000 consults annually. Teladoc raised $15 million in September 2013, with total funding at that point equaling $46.6 million.
The Affordable Care Act led to a large number of insurance companies signing with Teladoc, resulting in a growth surge around 2014. By that time, insurance companies such as Blue Shield of California and Oscar had signed with Teladoc, as well as other companies such as Home Depot, T-Mobile, CalPERS, and Rent-A-Center. Teladoc acquired AmeriDoc for $17.2 million in May 2014. The acquisitions of Consult A Doctor and AmeriDoc, both Teladoc's main competitors, resulted in Teladoc becoming the largest telemedicine provider in the United States. With 8 million individual patients, Teladoc's doctors performed 299,000 consults that year. Teladoc's sales doubled in both 2013 and 2014, and Teladoc raised $50 million from private investors in September 2014, bringing total funding to $100 million.
2015–2016
The company acquired BetterHelp in January 2015 for $3.5 million, followed by Stat Health Services, Inc. (StatDoc) in June 2015 for $30 million. After beginning the process that April, Teladoc went public on the New York Stock Exchange on July 1, 2015. The only telemedicine company on the NYSE, Teladoc's initial public offering listed at $19 per share, giving the company a market capitalization of $758 million and an enterprise value of $620 million. The initial response to the IPO was positive, as shares surged 50 percent on the opening day. Three months after the IPO, health insurer Highmark, which represented 1.5% of Teladoc's 2015 revenue, ceased to renew a contract. Teladoc shares fell significantly as a result, before rising to earlier levels.
Teladoc acquired the behavioral health services provider Compile Inc. in January 2015, followed by the competitor Stat Health Services Inc. in June 2015. In 2016 Teladoc began aggressively expanding, acquiring other companies and launching health segments for dermatology, behavioral health, and sexual health. That year the company won a patent infringement lawsuit filed against competitor American Well. In July 2016, Teladoc acquired HealthiestYou for $45 million. Teladoc had 15 million members by November 2016 and a market share of 75% in the United States. It also operated its full service suite in 48 states, excluding Arkansas and Texas. In December 2016, the American Hospital Association exclusively endorsed Teladoc's telehealth technology platform. Teladoc logged 952,000 patient visits that year.
2017–2021
In its largest acquisition at the time, in 2017 Teladoc spent $440 million purchasing Best Doctors, a medical consultation firm and provider of medical second opinions and pay-to-play medical award listings. On February 28, 2019, non-profit group ProPublica released a report critical of companies like subsidiary Best Doctors that sell physician awards, including "Best Doctors" awards. Teladoc had 7,500 clients in 2017, of which 220 were Fortune 1000 companies. Sales that year were $233 million, 89% higher than the year prior.
As of July 2018, Teladoc Health brands included Teladoc, Advance Medical, Best Doctors, BetterHelp and HealthiestYou. With a market capitalization of $4.1 billion, on August 10, 2018, Teladoc, Inc. changed its name to Teladoc Health, Inc. while continuing to trade on the NYSE. Teladoc Health began partnering with CVS in August 2018 on remote consults at MinuteClinics. In December 2018, Teladoc Health's chief financial officer and chief operating officer Mark Hirschhorn resigned after a report that he engaged in a sexual relationship and insider trading with an employee. According to Yahoo Finance, stock value fell roughly 20% in the days following, while an investor class action lawsuit alleged that Teladoc Health had violated securities laws by failing to disclose Hirschhorn's behavior. Teladoc Health denied making false statements or any legal violations. Joining from American Express, Mala Murthy was appointed CFO in June 2019.
In late 2018, Teladoc Health acquired the telemedicine company Advance Medical for $352 million, which employed doctors in Latin America, Europe, and Asia. In 2019, the French health company MédecinDirect was acquired.
Teladoc Health provides free telehealth visits to natural disaster and hurricane victims, and in 2019 it provided the telemedicine system implemented for patients in Paradise, California after the Camp Fire, working through Blue Shield of California. In April 2019, Teladoc launched in Canada with the Teladoc Telemedicine Service. In May 2019, the company created a virtual care patient safety organization (PSO) dubbed the Institute for Patient Safety and Quality of Virtual Care. Currently headquartered in Purchase, New York, as of 2019, the company was active in 130 countries and had around 27 million members. David Sides was appointed COO in 2019. In 2019, the company had revenues of $533 million and 4.1 million total visits.
In January 2020, Teladoc announced that it was acquiring InTouch Health for both cash and stock. Closing the deal in July 2020, Teladoc predicted that its "hospital-based telemedicine business" would grow significantly as a result. In March 2020, Teladoc was "partnering with the CDC to provide near real-time surveillance data on the spread of the [novel coronavirus]." By July 2020, Teladoc's reported revenue was up 85% from 2019, with its paid US membership doubled from 26.8 million to 51.5 million.
In August 2020, the business announced it would acquire Livongo Health for $18.5 billion. It was the "third-largest deal for a U.S. company" that year, with the combined companies to have a joint enterprise value of around $37 billion.
Services and business model
Teladoc Health divides its services into six categories: platform and program services, guidance and support, expert medical services, mental health services, telehealth, and integrated virtual care. As a software company, Teladoc Health is involved with artificial intelligence, analytics, telehealth devices and "licensable platform services." The company uses telephone and videoconferencing software to provide on-demand remote medical care, with patients able to log on to the service at any time and be connected with a board-certified, state-licensed physician within several minutes.
The company's physicians treat non-emergencies such as the flu, pink eye, infections, sinus issues, mental health issues, and dermatological conditions, among others. The company has an expert network of 55,000 involved in 450 medical subspecialties. While medication can be prescribed remotely, physicians do not prescribe narcotics or "lifestyle" drugs such as Viagra, and refer some cases to clinics or emergency rooms. In 2014, Teladoc Health reported that it sent around 1% of consultations to the emergency room, and around 6% to a primary care physician or urgent care center. In 2019, the company also claimed that 92% of medical issues were resolved after the first visit. Physicians overall follow "more than 100 proprietary clinical guidelines" developed by Teladoc Health, and are prohibited from physically meeting their telemedicine patients. Teams of nurses review around 10% of each physician's consults monthly.
Contracting largely with insurers and large employers, Teladoc Health generates revenue through a yearly or monthly fee charged per subscriber, as well as a fee for individual consults. Some companies waive or subsidize the consult fee for their employees. Teladoc Health has around 3,100 licensed physicians and nurses and services offered in about 30 languages.
By July 2020, the company stated it served "60 of the top 100 hospitals," with telemedical robots being used at hospitals such as Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, Washington and Sheba Medical Center in Israel, minimizing the potential spread of coronavirus.
Lobbying and legislation
Teladoc Health has been involved in lobbying for legislation in several states. In 2015 the Texas Medical Board ruled that state physicians had to physically meet patients before remotely treating ailments or prescribing medication. The bill undermined Teladoc Health's business model in Texas, where it had around 2 million subscribers. Teladoc Health sued in federal court over the rule in Teladoc v. Texas Medical Board, arguing the bill violated antitrust laws by inflating prices and limiting the supply of health care providers in the state. The bill, meant to go active on June 3, 2015, was stalled while the lawsuit went through a federal appeals court, allowing Teladoc Health to continue operating in Texas in the interim. Teladoc voluntarily dropped the lawsuit in 2017 after Texas passed a new bill allowing for remote treatment without a prior in-person interaction, which Teladoc Health had lobbied heavily for.
In January 2019, Teladoc Health opposed a telemedicine bill proposed by the North Dakota Board of Medicine, which required telemedicine providers to perform initial video examinations or have initial exams done by another physician. Proponents argued the bill protected patients, while Teladoc Health and critics argued it decreased access to healthcare in rural areas. The year prior, Teladoc Health had completed 1,500 virtual visits in the state.

Network
CDMA/3G network
Originally, UScellular used analog, then Digital AMPS "TDMA" cell phones in most markets, but the company started shifting over to 1xRTT CDMA technology in 2003. After the switch, UScellular has discontinued all analog and TDMA services. Starting in 2009, UScellular converted its network to EVDO which offered 3G speeds.
The company offers national LTE & 5G coverage through roaming agreements. Native coverage is mainly in the Pacific Northwest, Midwest, parts of the East and New England. Although headquartered in Chicago, UScellular did not offer service in the Chicago metropolitan area until it acquired territories from PrimeCo Communications between 2002 and 2003, after the formation of Verizon Wireless.
As of January 1, 2023, customers on CDMA will only be able to make voice calls and roaming will no longer be available. The carrier plans to discontinue CDMA, but has not announced when the carrier will completely shut down that network.
4G LTE network
UScellular announced that it would start offering 4G coverage to customers beginning in the first quarter of 2012. Just like the other larger wireless competitors, the company decided to go with LTE for its 4G coverage. The rollout was planned for selected cities in Iowa, Wisconsin, Maine, North Carolina, Texas and Oklahoma. These include some of UScellular's leading markets such as Milwaukee, Madison and Racine, Wis.; Des Moines, Cedar Rapids and Davenport, Iowa; Portland, Bangor and Houlton, Maine; and Greenville, N.C. As of November 14, 2012, UScellular has added additional 4G LTE markets, including Southern Oregon (Roseburg, Grants Pass, and Medford areas).
UScellular's LTE network is primarily built upon two low-frequency LTE bands; 12 and 5. Through the agreement with King Street Wireless, UScellular has access to the lower 700 MHz A, B, and C blocks across most of their operating markets. Spectrum bandwidth on LTE includes,
5*5, or 10*10 MHz on band 12 700 MHz
5*5 MHz on band 5 850 MHz
5*5, or 10*10 MHz on band 4 AWS 1. UScellular also has 5Mhz or 10Mhz of spectrum on Band 66 (AWS-3) in some markets.
Supplementary spectrum in the band 2 1900 PCS, and band 4 2100/1700 AWS 1 and 3 bands can be deployed across UScellular's LTE network for additional capacity in the future. Furthermore, additional 850 MHz Cellular spectrum could be refarmed from 1X CDMA to create a wider 10*10 MHz channel allocated for LTE.
UScellular made plans to launch their first market with VoLTE during the first quarter of 2017. The company began VoLTE trials during 2016 and continued upgrading equipment in select markets to allow the trial process to continue following the services official launch.
In December 2019, UScellular was found in an FCC investigation to have lied about its 4G LTE coverage by as much as 38%, only managing to reach the federally mandated minimum speeds 45% of the time.
Throughout the past few years, UScellular has begun deploying 5G in their markets. In most markets, this is achieved using 5Mhz or 10Mhz on band n71, while other markets have begun using Band 48 (3.5Ghz) for additional capacity.
Nationwide Coverage Through Roaming
UScellular has roaming agreements with both AT&T Mobility and T-Mobile U.S. This allows customers to roam on these networks with LTE or 5G speeds with no extra charges.
5G network
UScellular announced plans to launch its first phone with 5G support, the Samsung Galaxy S20, as well as coverage maps for its first commercial 5G network in both urban and rural parts of Iowa and Wisconsin in February 2020.

Nobody Wants to Be Alone is an album by American country music singer Crystal Gayle. Released in April 1985, it peaked at #17 on the Billboard Country albums chart.
In a front page New York Times article titled, "Country Music in Decline," this album was noted as one of many that were indicative of a trend, marking "the end of an era" for the genre: despite two top 5 hits, "Crystal Gayle's latest album sold fewer than 80,000 copies" six months after its release.
Two singles from the album also made the Country singles charts; the title track reached #3 in early 1985, and "A Long and Lasting Love" reached #5 later that year. Though the song wasn't released as a single to Country radio, a video was produced for "Touch and Go."

Saint-André () is the fifth-largest commune in the French overseas department of Réunion. It is located on the northeast part of the island of Réunion. The small lake Étang de Bois Rouge is located in the commune.
This area between the Saint-Jean and the Mât rivers was populated from the middle of the 17th century. Indeed, the first exiles were confined to Bourbon in 1646 by Mr. Promis, governor of the French Comptoir of Fort-Dauphin, to curb their mutinous ardor. Disembarked from the Saint-Laurent, they were settled in the Quartier des Français, on the banks of the Saint-Jean River. The region of Saint-André has historically seen the landing of the first French.

In cryptography, ciphertext stealing (CTS) is a general method of using a block cipher mode of operation that allows for processing of messages that are not evenly divisible into blocks without resulting in any expansion of the ciphertext, at the cost of slightly increased complexity.
General characteristics
Ciphertext stealing is a technique for encrypting plaintext using a block cipher, without padding the message to a multiple of the block size, so the ciphertext is the same size as the plaintext.
It does this by altering processing of the last two blocks of the message. The processing of all but the last two blocks is unchanged, but a portion of the second-last block's ciphertext is "stolen" to pad the last plaintext block. The padded final block is then encrypted as usual.
The final ciphertext, for the last two blocks, consists of the partial penultimate block (with the "stolen" portion omitted) plus the full final block, which are the same size as the original plaintext.
Decryption requires decrypting the final block first, then restoring the stolen ciphertext to the penultimate block, which can
then be decrypted as usual.
In principle any block-oriented block cipher mode of operation can be used, but stream-cipher-like modes can already be applied to messages of arbitrary length without padding, so they do not benefit from this technique. The common modes of operation that are coupled with ciphertext stealing are Electronic Codebook (ECB) and Cipher Block Chaining (CBC).
Ciphertext stealing for ECB mode requires the plaintext to be longer than one block. A possible workaround is to use a stream cipher-like block cipher mode of operation when the plaintext length is one block or less, such as the CTR, CFB or OFB modes.
Ciphertext stealing for CBC mode doesn't necessarily require the plaintext to be longer than one block. In the case where the plaintext is one block long or less, the Initialization vector (IV) can act as the prior block of ciphertext. In this case a modified IV must be sent to the receiver. This may not be possible in situations where the IV can not be freely chosen by the sender when the ciphertext is sent (e.g., when the IV is a derived or pre-established value), and in this case ciphertext stealing for CBC mode can only occur in plaintexts longer than one block.
To implement CTS encryption or decryption for data of unknown length, the implementation must delay processing (and buffer) the two most recent blocks of data, so that they can be properly processed at the end of the data stream.
Ciphertext format
There are several different ways to arrange the ciphertext for transmission. The ciphertext bits are the same in all cases, just transmitted in a different order, so the choice has no security implications; it is purely one of implementation convenience.
The numbering here is taken from Dworkin, who describes them all. The third is the most popular, and described by Daemen and Schneier; Meyer describes a related, but incompatible scheme (with respect to bit ordering and key use).
CS1
Arguably the most obvious way to arrange the ciphertext is to transmit the truncated penultimate block, followed by the full final block. This is not convenient for the receiver for two reasons:
The receiver must decrypt the final block first in any case, and
This results in the final block not being aligned on a natural boundary, complicating hardware implementations.
This does have the advantage that, if the final plaintext block happens to be a multiple of the block size, the ciphertext is identical to that of the original mode of operation without ciphertext stealing.
CS2
It is often more convenient to swap the final two ciphertext blocks, so the ciphertext ends with the full final block, followed by the truncated penultimate block. This results in naturally aligned ciphertext blocks.
In order to maintain compatibility with the non-stealing modes, option CS2 performs this swap only if the amount of stolen ciphertext is non-zero, i.e. the original message was not a multiple of the block size.
This maintains natural alignment, and compatibility with the non-stealing modes, but requires treating the cases of aligned and unaligned message size differently.
CS3
The most popular alternative swaps the final two ciphertext blocks unconditionally. This is the ordering used in the descriptions below.
Ciphertext stealing mode description
In order to encrypt or decrypt data, use the standard block cipher mode of operation on all but the last two blocks of data.
The following steps describe how to handle the last two blocks of the plaintext, called Pn−1 and Pn, where the length of Pn−1 equals the block size of the cipher in bits, B; the length of the last block, Pn, is M bits; and K is the key that is in use. M can range from 1 to B, inclusive, so Pn could possibly be a complete block. The CBC mode description also makes use of the ciphertext block just previous to the blocks concerned, Cn−2, which may in fact be the IV if the plaintext fits within two blocks.
For this description, the following functions and operators are used:
Head (data, a): returns the first a bit of the 'data' string.
Tail (data, a): returns the last a bit of the 'data' string.
Encrypt (K, data): use the underlying block cipher in encrypt mode on the 'data' string using the key K.
Decrypt (K, data): use the underlying block cipher in decrypt mode on the 'data' string using the key K.
XOR: Bitwise Exclusive-OR. Equivalent to bitwise addition without use of a carry bit.
||: Concatenation operator. Combine the strings on either side of the operator.
0a: a string of 0 bits.
ECB ciphertext stealing
Ciphertext stealing in ECB mode introduces an inter-block dependency within the last two blocks, resulting in altered error propagation behavior for the last two blocks.
ECB encryption steps (see figure)
En−1 = Encrypt (K, Pn−1). Encrypt Pn−1 to create En−1. This is equivalent to the behavior of standard ECB mode.
Cn = Head (En−1, M). Select the first M bits of En−1 to create Cn. The final ciphertext block, Cn, is composed of the leading M bits of the second-to-last ciphertext block. In all cases, the last two blocks are sent in a different order than the corresponding plaintext blocks.
Dn = Pn || Tail (En−1, B−M). Pad Pn with the low order bits from En−1.
Cn−1 = Encrypt (K, Dn). Encrypt Dn to create Cn−1. For the first M bits, this is equivalent to what would happen in ECB mode (other than the ciphertext ordering). For the last B−M bits, this is the second time that these data have been encrypted under this key (It was already encrypted in the production of En−1 in step 2).
ECB decryption steps
Dn = Decrypt (K, Cn−1). Decrypt Cn−1 to create Dn. This undoes step 4 of the encryption process.
En−1 = Cn || Tail (Dn, B−M). Pad Cn with the extracted ciphertext in the tail end of Dn (placed there in step 3 of the ECB encryption process).
Pn = Head (Dn, M). Select the first M bits of Dn to create Pn. As described in step 3 of the ECB encryption process, the first M bits of Dn contain Pn. We queue this last (possibly partial) block for eventual output.
Pn−1 = Decrypt (K, En−1). Decrypt En−1 to create Pn−1. This reverses encryption step 1.
ECB ciphertext stealing error propagation
A bit error in the transmission of Cn−1 would result in the block-wide corruption of both Pn−1 and Pn.
A bit error in the transmission of Cn would result in the block-wide corruption of Pn−1. This is a significant change from ECB's error propagation behavior.
CBC ciphertext stealing
In CBC, there is already interaction between processing of different adjacent blocks, so CTS has less conceptual impact in this mode. Error propagation is affected.
CBC encryption steps
Xn−1 = Pn−1 XOR Cn−2. Exclusive-OR Pn−1 with the previous ciphertext block, Cn−2, to create Xn−1. This is equivalent to the behavior of standard CBC mode.
En−1 = Encrypt (K, Xn−1). Encrypt Xn−1 to create En−1. This is equivalent to the behavior of standard CBC mode.
Cn = Head (En−1, M). Select the first M bits of En−1 to create Cn. The final ciphertext block, Cn, is composed of the leading M bits of the second-to-last ciphertext block. In all cases, the last two blocks are sent in a different order than the corresponding plaintext blocks.
P = Pn || 0B−M. Pad Pn with zeros at the end to create P of length B. The zero padding in this step is important for step 5.
Dn = En−1 XOR P. Exclusive-OR En−1 with P to create Dn. For the first M bits of the block, this is equivalent to CBC mode; the first M bits of the previous block's ciphertext, En−1,are XORed with the M bits of plaintext of the last plaintext block. The zero padding of P in step 4 was important, because it makes the XOR operation's effect on the last B−M bits equivalent to copying the last B−M bits of En−1 to the end of Dn. These are the same bits that were stripped off of En−1 in step 3 when Cn was created.
Cn−1 = Encrypt (K, Dn). Encrypt Dn to create Cn−1. For the first M bits, this is equivalent to what would happen in CBC mode (other than the ciphertext ordering). For the last B−M bits, this is the second time that these data have been encrypted under this key (It was already encrypted in the production of En−1 in step 2).
CBC decryption steps
Dn = Decrypt (K, Cn−1). Decrypt Cn−1 to create Dn. This undoes step 6 of the encryption process.
C = Cn || 0B−M. Pad Cn with zeros at the end to create a block C of length B. We are padding Cn with zeros to help in step 3.
Xn = Dn XOR C. Exclusive-OR Dn with C to create Xn. Looking at the first M bits, this step has the result of XORing Cn (the first M bits of the encryption process' En−1) with the (now decrypted) Pn XOR Head (En−1, M) (see steps 4-5 of the encryption process). In other words, we have CBC decrypted the first M bits of Pn. Looking at the last B−M bits, this recovers the last B−M bits of En−1.
Pn = Head (Xn, M). Select the first M bits of Xn to create Pn. As described in step 3, the first M bits of Xn contain Pn. We queue this last (possibly partial) block for eventual output.
En−1 = Cn || Tail (Xn, B−M). Append the tail (B−M) bits of Xn to Cn to create En−1. As described in step 3, En−1 is composed of all of Cn (which is M bits long) appended with the last B−M bits of Xn. We reassemble En−1 (which is the same En−1 seen in the encryption process) for processing in step 6.
Xn−1 = Decrypt (K, En−1). Decrypt En−1 to create Xn−1. This reverses encryption step 2. Xn−1 is the same as in the encryption process.
Pn−1 = Xn−1 XOR Cn−2. Exclusive-OR Xn−1 with the previous ciphertext block, Cn−2, to create Pn−1. Finally, we reverse the XOR step from step 1 of the encryption process.
CBC implementation notes
For CBC ciphertext stealing, there is a clever (but opaque) method of implementing the described ciphertext stealing process using a standard CBC interface. Using this method imposes a performance penalty in the decryption stage of one extra block decryption operation over what would be necessary using a dedicated implementation.

Pad the last partial plaintext block with 0.

Regina Cassandra (born 13 December 1990) is an Indian actress who primarily works in Tamil and Telugu films. She made her acting debut with the Tamil film Kanda Naal Mudhal in 2005 and made her Telugu film debut with Siva Manasulo Sruthi (2012), for which she won the SIIMA Award for Best Female Debut (Telugu). She then made her Kannada debut with Suryakaanti (2010) and Hindi debut with Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga (2019).
Cassandra played the lead in various successful films including Siva Manasulo Sruthi, Kedi Billa Killadi Ranga, Kotha Janta, Power, Rajathandhiram, Subramanyam for Sale, Awe, Silukkuvarupatti Singam, 7 and Mughizh. She received praises for her role in Jyo Achyutananda and Evaru.
Cassandra made her web debut with the 2022 series Rocket Boys portraying classical dancer Mrinalini Sarabhai.
Early life
Regina Cassandra was born on 13 December 1990 in Madras (now Chennai), India. Her mother tongue is Tamil.
Career
Debut and Early career (2005-2010)
Cassandra started anchoring when she was nine for Splash, a kids' channel, and then moved on to work in commercials.
Her first feature film appearance was the Tamil film Kanda Naal Mudhal (2005). She later played the lead in the Kannada film Suryakaanti (2010) by director K. M. Chaitanya of Aa Dinagalu fame. The film featured her alongside actor Chetan, and as she could not speak Kannada, she was told to act out scenes in English and add Kannada to it. The film won good reviews and performed moderately at the box office. However, the film's low-key release meant that the film failed to gain attention, so she took time out from films and then went on to graduate in psychology from Women's Christian College, Chennai and took another year off before taking a final call on joining movies.
During her break, Cassandra also acted in several short films, including Balaji Mohan's Kadhalil Sodhappuvadhu Yeppadi alongside Adith Arun, which was later made into a feature film in 2012 under the same name. In 2010, it was announced that she would feature in the Tamil film Maalai Pozhudhin Mayakathilaey alongside Adith Arun, but the film was eventually delayed and then restarted with a fresh cast.
Debut in Telugu cinema, various roles and success (2012-2018)
In 2012, Cassandra appeared in Shiva Manasulo Shruti by Tatineni Sathya, which was a remake of the 2009 Tamil film Siva Manasula Sakthi. She was next seen in the Telugu romantic-comedy, Routine Love Story, alongside Sundeep Kishan, which she signed even before her first release in Telugu.
In 2013 she had two Tamil releases, Kedi Billa Killadi Ranga by Pandiraj, in which she was one of the two lead actresses, and Nirnayam in which she played a vital role. Although the former proved successful at the box office, she did not sign more films in Tamil and instead shifted her focus to Telugu films. Kotha Janta directed by Maruthi was Cassandra's first 2014 release. She received positive response for her performance in the film. Deccan Chronicle wrote, "The star of the film is undoubtedly Regina Cassandra. She looks cute and bubbly and delivers a delightful performance. She has done her character with ease and with the right expressions". Her next releases were Ra Ra... Krishnayya, which saw her reuniting with Sundeep Kishan, and Power in which she played a Bengali girl, the film was a commercial success. She played the lead role opposite Sai Dharam Tej in Pilla Nuvvu Leni Jeevitam directed by AS Ravi Kumar Chowdary.
Seen after two years in Tamil cinema in Rajathandhiram (2015), her acting was praised. Cassandra's next was the successful Subramanyam for Sale and Soukhyam. In 2016, she appeared in the action thriller Shankara (2016), which is remake of the Tamil hit Mouna Guru and also the source for the Hindi film Akira, starring Sonakshi Sinha. She also appeared in the commercially successful film Jyo Achyutananda, receiving critical acclaim for her role.
In 2017, her Tamil films were Maanagaram, Saravanan Irukka Bayamaen and Gemini Ganeshanum Suruli Raajanum. Cassandra In 2018, she appeared in the critical acclaimed Awe and is also part of films like Mr. Chandramouli and Silukkuvarupatti Singam in 2018. The latter was a critical and commercial success.
Further success and recent work (2019-present)
Cassandra's Bollywood debut Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga (2019) had her playing an unconventional role. She states that cinema in general is evolving, and Tamil industry picked up faster in doing unconventional films. In 2019, she received critical acclaim for her role in Evaru. She played a negative character for the first time in 7.
In 2021, she again played a negative role in Chakra and went onto star in Nenjam Marappathillai, Kasada Thapara and the critical success Mughizh all in leading roles. She did a cameo in Thalaivii playing B. Saroja Devi.
Her first release in 2022 is the long-delayed 1945. Cassandra made her web debut with the Sony LIV's series Rocket Boys where she portrays Mrinalini Sarabhai. It received positive reviews from critics. She then had a special number in Chiranjeevi's Acharya.
Cassandra's upcoming movies include Telugu Tamil bilingual Soorpanagai, Telugu films Saakini Daakini and Karungaapiyam. She also has Tamil films Borrder, Party and Kallapart in her kitty. She will appear alongside Vijay Sethupathi in the series Farzi.

Lieutenant-General Geoffrey Walsh, CBE, DSO, CD (19 August 1909 – 3 April 1999) was a Canadian soldier and Chief of the General Staff, the head of the Canadian Army from 1961 – 1964; Walsh was the last officer to hold this appointment as it was eliminated in 1964 as part of the reorganization of Canada's military in the lead-up to the 1968 unification of the Canadian Forces. The most senior army appointment after unification, the Commander of Mobile Command, had a much-reduced scope of authority.
Military career
Educated at St Catherine's Collegiate School, Walsh was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Engineers in 1930.
He served in World War II with the Canadian Army Service Force and took part in the Spitsbergen Raid in 1941. In 1942 he transferred to the 1st Canadian Division and fought in Sicily and Italy. In 1944 he was made Commander Royal Engineers for 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division. and he later became CRE with II Canadian Corps, commanded by Guy Simonds, which took part in Operation Overlord.
After the war he was appointed Commander, Eastern Ontario Area, followed by Commander, 27th Brigade before his appointment as Director-General of Military Training. In 1955 he was appointed Quartermaster-General of the Canadian Army and in 1959 he became General Officer Commanding, Western Command. In 1961 he was made Chief of the General Staff and in 1964, became Vice Chief of the Defence Staff.
Family
In 1935, he married Gwynn Abigail Currie with whom he had one son.

The Konthoujam Lairembi Stone Inscription (; ) or Konthoujam Lairemma Stone Inscription (; ) is a Meitei language stone inscription found in a sacred site dedicated to Goddess Konthoujam Tampha Lairembi of Sanamahism (Meitei religion) in Konthoujam village of Manipur.
Description
The stone inscription is in the sacred temple complex of Goddess Konthoujam Tampha Lairembi () in the Konthoujam village. It is on the south of the National Highway No. 53 in the west of Imphal city. The stone engaged in this inscription is the sandstone. The inscription consists of 14 lines of writings in Meitei language (Manipuri language) in archaic Meetei script.
Notably, the writings from the fifth to the seventh lines were highly damaged and distorted. So, proper study on these particular lines has been very hard and unsuccessful.
History
It does not mention any particular date. But paleographic study confirmed that it was written in two different times. The first 7 lines of writings have been assigned to the time of King Khagemba (1592 AD-1652 AD). The remaining 7 lines of writings are assigned to the time of King Charairongba (1697 AD-1709 AD).
Reading
The inscription shows that King Khagemba assigned compulsory state duty for the Konthoujam clan to worship goddess Huimu Leima. Notably, the Loyumba Shinyen Constitution also assigned the Konthoujam clan to look after the worship of Goddess Huimu Leima, and not Konthousu (Tampha Lairembi). And according to the Konthoujam Nongarol (), Goddess Huimu Leima is the mother of goddess Konthoujam Tampha Lairembi (Chingphulon Konthousu), the one who got married to Salailen (Soraren), the king of heaven.

Madagascar sent a delegation to compete at the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 7 to 18 September 2016. This was the island country's fourth appearance at a Summer Paralympic Games since it made its debut sixteen years prior at the 2000 Summer Paralympics. Sprinter Revelinot Raherinandrasana was the sole athlete to represent the nation in Rio de Janeiro. In his event, the men's 1500 metres T45–T46, he finished tenth and last out of all the finishing athletes with a time of 4 minutes and 38.60 seconds.
Background
Madagascar first competed in the Paralympics at the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney, Australia. With the exception of the 2004 Summer Paralympics, they have sent a delegation to most Summer Paralympic Games since, making Rio de Janeiro its fourth time participating at a Summer Paralympiad. The 2016 Summer Paralympics were held from 7–18 September 2016 with a total of 4,328 athletes representing 159 National Paralympic Committees (NPC) taking part. Madagascar sent a solitary athlete to Rio de Janeiro: athletics competitor Revelinot Raherinandrasana. He was accompanied by chef de mission and president of the Federation Malgache Handisport (the NPC of Madagascar (FMH)) Monja Dinard, FMH secretary-general Olivier Razafimandimby, doctor Mamy Andrianaly and administrative director Temisy Aristide Andriamahavonjy. The delegation departed for Rio de Janeiro on 2 September. Raherinandrasana was chosen as the flag bearer during the parade of nations for the opening ceremony.
Disability classification
Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.
Athletics
Revelinot Raherinandrasana was 38 years old at the time of the Rio Summer Paralympic Games. These Rio de Janeiro Games were his second time competing in the Summer Paralympics after he represented Madagascar at the 2012 Summer Paralympics. Raherinandrasana is a left arm amputee and is classified as T46. He qualified for the Games because the International Paralympic Committee granted him a wild card slot. Monja Dinard, president of the FMH, said that the NPC expected Raherinandrasana to improve on his performance from four years earlier because it felt the runner would be more comfortable competing in a middle-distance competition rather than a sprint. On 16 September, he competed in the men's 1500 metres T45–T46 event with ten other athletes. Raherinandrasana finished the race in a time of 4 minutes and 38.60 seconds, which put him tenth and last of all those who finished. Samir Nouioua of Algeria won the gold medal in a time of 3 minutes and 59.46 seconds, the silver medal was taken by David Emong of Uganda, and the bronze medal was claimed by Michael Roeger of Australia. He did not receive official recognition for his performance because of a lack of focus on sport in Madagascar and he returned to his job as a laundry worker with his wife.

The Wolf of the Malveneurs (French: Le loup des Malveneur) is a 1943 French mystery horror film directed by Guillaume Radot and starring Madeleine Sologne, Pierre Renoir and Gabrielle Dorziat. It was shot at the Cité Elgé studios in Paris with location shooting at the Château d'Anjony in Tournemire. The film's sets were designed by the art director Marcel Magniez. It is Gothic in style with use of chiaroscuro lighting. It was part of a group of films produced in German-occupied France that used fantasy or historical costume settings to subtly express dissent.
Synopsis
The Malveneur family live at the same gloomy, isolated castle in the countryside they have held for centuries. The current owner Reginald de Malveneur strongly believes in an ancient curse that turned one of his ancestors into a werewolf. As he has only a daughter rather than a son he will be the last of the line, unless his obsessive scientific experiments in his laboratory bear fruit. A young governess arrives from Paris to educate Malveneur's daughter. When both Malveneur, his gamekeeper and his wife disappear or die within weeks of each other, the governess join forces with a young painter to investigate the mystery.

Philip E. Mason is a British chemist and YouTuber with the online pseudonym Thunderf00t (also VoiceofThunder). He is best known for criticising topics such as religion and pseudoscience, as well as creationism. He works at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences.
Early life
Mason received a BSc (2:1) (1993) and PhD (1997) in chemistry from the University of Birmingham. From 2003 until at least August 2010, Mason was affiliated with the University of Bristol.
Career
Mason worked at Cornell University's department of food science from 2002 until 2012, where he studied the molecular interactions between water and sugar molecules, as well as molecular modeling with regard to proteins and guanidinium solutions. As of 2013, he was working at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic as a member of a research group headed by Pavel Jungwirth.
Alkali metals research
Mason, on his own and with some fellow technical workers, did original physical chemistry research into the nature of the alkali metals (sodium and potassium, for example) and their chemistry with oxygen and water. It has been known since the metals could be obtained in pure forms that they are explosive when dropped into water. It has long been thought this was caused by the dissociation of water by the metal, releasing hydrogen and oxygen which recombined in an explosion. Mason developed experimental methods and results that indicate the first reaction of alkali metals and water was coulombic (that is, electrical charge forces) in nature which shatters and drives the metal in an extremely pure state into the water, causing both further coulombic and water dissociation. This result, developed in 2015, was completely new to chemistry. His co-authored research was published in the journal Nature Chemistry.
On 5 June 2020, his co-authored research on solvated electrons dissolved in ammonia was published in the science journal Science.
Online activities
Mason's YouTube videos, where he writes as Thunderf00t, have often drawn attention. A 2012 journal article stated that Thunderf00t's channel and P.Z. Myers' blog were "among the two most popular secularist hubs online."
Mason has used his online persona to critically examine a range of topics, including proposals to build roads surfaced with glass solar panels. He has also attracted media attention for his criticisms of Elizabeth Holmes, Anita Sarkeesian, and Elon Musk.
In 2015, Jenny Keller, who ran the YouTube channel "Laughing Witch", attempted to get Mason fired by sending letters to his employer. Keller stated that these efforts were intended to pressure Mason to change what she considered sexist and Islamophobic content on his channel. After promoting the campaign online, Keller eventually provoked a response from Mason, who posted a series of videos scrutinizing Keller and the Bowie, Maryland-based company she runs with her husband, Porcelain Tub Restoration. These videos led to many of Mason's fans posting negative reviews online for that company. On several occasions, Mason has made guest appearances on the Drunken Peasants Podcast.
In July 2020, Mason had several of his videos on YouTube debunking COVID-19 conspiracy theories falsely flagged and taken down.
Creationism
Through his YouTube account Thunderf00t, Mason produced a series of videos titled "Why do people laugh at creationists?", focusing primarily on Kent Hovind's arguments in public seminars. Sociologist Richard Cimino has described the tone of these videos as "that of the professional, well-educated, and articulate British academic expert exposing—in voiceover—the irrational behavior and attitudes of the believer." Mason (originally known only as Thunderf00t) debated with VenomFangX, a YouTube blogger who supports creationism, in a series of public exchanges that lasted almost two years. The series also covered other creationists, such as Ray Comfort and intelligent design proponent Casey Luskin.

Guarenas is a city in Miranda, Venezuela. It was established in 1621 as Nuestra Señora de Copacabana de los Guarenas. It is part of the Guarenas-Guatire conurbation
On February 27, 1989, a morning protest in this city over the recent nationwide hike in bus fares, spread to Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, which resulted in several days of rioting known today as the Caracazo.
Today, Guarenas has virtually merged with its neighbor, Guatire. As of 2006, its population has been estimated at 185,010.
The Curupao Power Plant, which was inaugurated in 1933, still provides electricity to Guarenas and Guatire. The state also owned movie production facilities, as the Villa del Cine is situated in the city.
History
On February 14, 1621, Guarenas was established as a city of people with an indigenous doctrine. Due to the opposition of the encomenderos, construction began two years later, in 1623, forced by an order issued by the Real Hearing of Santo Domingo, in order that the provision of the king of Spain Felipe III is fulfilled, in that where indigenous peoples live under the supervision of a doctrinaire priest, to end the abuses committed against them encomenderos were built. Previous to this royal decree natural inhabitants of the estates of their trustees, which facilitated the abuses committed against them, and that made them work all week in the planting of the trustees not provided them land to sow for them and they did not recognize their day of rest nor religious holidays, to all of which the trustees were obliged by Spanish law, as well inflicting physical abuse him like slaves. The foundation originally took place in the mountains of Mariche, on a site that later became known as "El Rodeo". There the founding ceremony of the "Indian Village" was held called Our Lady of Copacabana of Guarenas, the site where would the square and the church as well as the stables of the population are marked.
Parcels assigned to inhabit were those of Hernando Closed and Avila, Francisco Infante de Ponte, Antonio Gamez de Acosta and Dona Micaela Perez de Ávila (wife of Lucas Martinez de Porras), made up of indigenous Chagaragotos (or Guarenas) and Mariches, so the indigenous council of Guarenas representation had two chiefs, one of Guarenas or Chagaragoto nation and a nation Mariche. Each of the trustees were assigned what they had to contribute to the manufacture and ornament of the church. The name "Guarenas" or "Huerena" comes from the Caribbean language and means "meadow" or "land of much grass" or "grassland" and was as chagaragotos Indians called these lands. The subsequent removal of the people to the place where it is currently held by the end of the seventeenth century.
It is approximately 39.2 miles or 36 minutes from Caracas.
Economy
Traditionally, the city has three major industrial zones (Cloris, Maturin and Guairita) where medium and small industries are located, including textile factories, laboratories, distribution centers of various products and commercial vehicle dealers. However, this industrial area it has never been fully developed, and currently (with the exception of some companies such as laboratories) is in outright depression and abandonment.
Guarenas economy is based on its role as a bedroom community about Caracas. In modern times, the city has served as housing relief Caracas where the commercial sector (formal and informal) and services is the main economic activity, as the vast majority of the people get their jobs and income in the neighboring Venezuelan capital.

James Clyde Fry (25 December 1897 – 27 October 1982) was a Major General in the United States Army who served as an infantry regiment and division commander during World War II and the Korean War. Fry was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for extraordinary heroism during World War II.
Early life
A native of Idaho, Fry grew up on his parents' farm several miles from Sandpoint, Idaho where Fry and his brothers and sisters attended school. Fry quit high school and went to work in the nearby Talache silver mines for a few years. Then one day when walking past a local country store Fry observed two men loafing on the store porch spitting tobacco juice and it was at that moment Fry decided he would return to school as such a life was not for him. Fry graduated from high school in 1919 and was appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point that same year.
Military career
Early career
Fry graduated from West Point in 1922 and was commissioned a second lieutenant of infantry in the United States Army. Prior to World War II Fry's assignments included Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, the Army General Staff, Washington D.C., and the Philippines under General Douglas MacArthur.
World War II
In 1941 Fry volunteered for and was assigned duty as a U.S. Military Observer with the British 8th Army then engaged in combat operations against German and Italian forces in the western Libyan Desert. Upon returning to the United States in 1942 he was assigned to the War Department General Staff in Washington D.C., training duties as commander, 69th Armored Regiment, in the California desert, and subsequently to staff duties as assistant G3 Headquarters Armored Command, Fort Knox, Kentucky. After months of frustrated efforts to obtain a combat assignment Fry was finally given the opportunity to command an infantry regiment in Italy. During U.S. combat operations in Italy from 1943 to the end of the war in 1945 Fry commanded the 350th Infantry Regiment, 88th "Blue Devil" Infantry Division, and was ultimately promoted to assistant division commander. Fry's extraordinary bravery and reputation for personally leading attacks at the front of the forward platoon with no riflemen in front of him earned Fry the nickname "Fearless Fosdick" and endeared him to his subordinates.
Korean War
During the Korean War Fry commanded the 2nd Infantry Division during combat operations against Communist Chinese and North Korean forces from 4 May 1952 to 17 May 1953.
Military awards and decorations
Fry's United States Military awards and decorations include the Distinguished Service Cross, Distinguished Service Medal, Silver Star, Legion of Merit, Bronze Star, Purple Heart with three oak leaf clusters, and the Combat Infantry Badge. His foreign decorations include the Legion of Honor from France, the Order of the Crown of Italy, the Order of Orange Nassau with Swords from the Netherlands, and the Most Exalted Order of the White Elephant from Thailand.
Retirement
Following his retirement from the United States Army in 1957 Fry became an advocate for military readiness and was a founder, lifetime member, board chairman, and president of the National Association of the Uniformed Services. Fry was also a leading figure in the evolution of Civil War reenactments into their modern form and was the driving force behind the Centennial re-enactment of the First Battle of Bull Run, July 21, 1961. Fry also wrote the book Combat Soldier, which is a documentary of the U.S. Army World War II Italian Campaign and a tribute to the American "doughboys" who fought there. The book is based on personal notes written by Fry during the war and was published in 1968. In 1973 Fry served as a member of President Nixon's Executive Board of the National Citizens Committee for Fairness to the President. During the Cold War Fry was one of 170 prominent retired generals and admirals who were signatories of a public letter to President Jimmy Carter published in the New York Times urging the president to reinforce Israel's military capability, restore the global military balance between the United States and the Soviet Union and reestablish America's credibility as a leader of the free world, and desist from any arms control agreements with the Soviet Union that would reinforce permanent Soviet strategic superiority. Fry was also one of the original organizers of the 88th Infantry Division Association.
Personal life
Fry was married to the former Marjorie Holloway of Teaneck, New Jersey in February 1924. Fry and Marjorie had one son, James C. Fry Jr., who was also a United States Military Academy graduate (1948) and served in the United States Army as an infantry officer until 1951. Their son died at age 31 in a boating accident on the Potomac River in 1956, leaving a wife, Patricia Knotts, with five children; three of the children were still in diapers. In August 1970 after a long illness Marjorie died. Fry was subsequently married to Catherine Kiel of College Station, Pennsylvania from 1971 until her death in June 1974. Then in 1975, at the suggestion of his sister Ruby Fry, he contacted his high school sweetheart Helen Ramsey, who was then a widow living in Ellensburg, Washington. The two were soon married in June 1975.
Death and burial
Fry is buried in Arlington National Cemetery along with his first wife, Marjorie Fry (1902 - 1970) and his second wife, Catherine Fry (1899 - 1974).
Distinguished Service Cross citation
The official United States Army citation for Fry's World War II Distinguished Service Cross reads:
The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Colonel (Infantry) James Clyde Fry (ASN: 0-15023), United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy while serving as Commanding Officer of the 350th Infantry Regiment, 88th Infantry Division, in action against enemy forces on 4 October 1944, in Italy. Colonel Fry led his regiment, which was extremely tired from its arduous mountain fighting of the preceding days, in a swift and well executed maneuver towards Mount Battaglia and succeeded in taking this feature before the enemy had fully organized its defenses. The enemy, realizing the strategic importance of Mount Battaglia, launched a series of vicious counterattacks from three directions. Although his regiment was completely exposed on both flanks, and subjected to terrific artillery and mortar fire as well as flame throwers, Colonel Fry planned and supervised his defense in such a manner that the hill was held. During the six days that this hill was held against the determined enemy attacks, Colonel Fry, by his superior tactical skill and calm courage under murderous fire, inspired his troops to repulse intrepidly the terrific enemy assaults. On one occasion while he was with his front line elements, Colonel Fry was wounded in the arm by a shell burst, but remained with his troops until ordered by higher authority to go to the rear for treatment. Colonel Fry's courage and brilliant leadership contributed immeasurably to the success of a vital operation in the Allied advance towards the Po Valley and provided a lasting inspiration to those who served under him. His outstanding leadership, personal bravery and zealous devotion to duty exemplify the highest traditions of the military forces of the United States and reflect great credit upon himself, the 88th Infantry Division, and the United States Army.

Chiswick Eyot is a narrow, uninhabited ait (river island) of the Thames. It is a tree- and reed-covered rise on the Tideway by Chiswick, in London, England and is overlooked by Chiswick Mall and by some of the Barnes riverside on the far bank.
Position
Chiswick Eyot lies beside The Championship Course and marks the approximate half-way point of The Boat Races (OUBC versus CUBC Men's and Women's first eights (1st 8+s) races) and the country's international Head of the River Race among others. A green pole stands on one end used for timings by rowers of that course, at the southwest, church end of the island. It is the most downstream island purely in the Thames, since Canvey Island and two nearby islets in the lower estuary are co-fed by creeks, while the Isle of Sheppey is skirted by much flow from the River Medway.
Small craft can pass between Chiswick Eyot and Chiswick Mall on the north bank for about two hours at high tide, but the small channel is generally impassable. At low tide it is possible to walk to the tidal island, though this is discouraged, both because it is now a nature reserve, and to avoid the risk of being cut off by rising water. Visitors can readily be trapped as the shape of the river causes the tide to rise locally twice as rapidly as it falls, while the tidal range is large, at over .
History
Chiswick Eyot is one of 43 unbridged tidal islands which can be walked to from the mainland of Great Britain. The eyot was long-owned by the rectory of Chiswick and its natural successors the Ecclesiastical Commissioners until 1934 when ownership passed to the local council. Little is known of its archaeology. St. Nicholas Church, Chiswick, whose tower was built in the 15th century, is 200m west of the island. Thus an early medieval parish church is beside it as with Isleworth Ait, Eel Pie Island (Twickenham Ait) and others upstream.
The eyot was used during the industrial revolution mostly for the growing of grass and osiers (basket willows, used for basketry, furniture, cart-making, as well as cattle fodder). Its south-west end, opposite end and east has become indented. The island is partially submerged (excluding trees) by the highest tides.
The naturalist C. J. Cornish wrote in 1902 that the river bank of Chiswick Mall beside the eyot had once been a "famous fishery"; he recorded that "perhaps the last" salmon was caught between the eyot and Putney in 1812, and expressed the hope that if the "purification" of the river continued, the salmon might return. He noted that people had "taken" the wild irises from the eyot, but that marsh marigold, camomile, comfrey, ragged robin, buttercups and many composites still grew there.
Local nature reserve
The London Borough of Hounslow declared the island a local nature reserve of Greater London in 1993.

Alvin Thompson Smith (November 17, 1802 – January 22, 1888) was an American missionary and politician in what became the state of Oregon. A native of Connecticut, he lived in Illinois before moving to the Oregon Country to preach to the Native Americans in the Tualatin Valley. There he served in both the Provisional Government of Oregon and the government of the Oregon Territory, as well as helping to establish Tualatin Academy, later becoming Pacific University. Smith's former home, the Alvin T. Smith House in Forest Grove, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Early years
Alvin Thompson Smith was born in Branford, Connecticut, on November 17, 1802, to Thomas Smith. In the early 1830s he moved to Quincy, Illinois, where he worked as a carpenter and where he married Abigail Raymond (born April 21, 1793) on March 19, 1840. In 1840, he and his new wife crossed the Great Plains on what became the Oregon Trail with P. B. Littlejohn and the Reverend Harvey L. Clark and their wives, along with fur traders. They left in March after Smith had heard a speech about a group of Native Americans who had traveled to St. Louis, Missouri, and asked to learn about Christianity. Clark and Littlejohn invited him to help establish a mission independent of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions.
Oregon
The group traveled first to Independence, Missouri, where they were joined by frontiersman Henry Black before heading west. Along the trail they caught up to a fur brigade of the American Fur Company at Hickory Grove and joined the group that included Joel Walker, Pleasant Armstrong, and Robert Moore among others. This larger group continued on to the Rocky Mountain Rendezvous where the Oregon bound missionaries continued on with guidance from Caleb Wilkins and Robert Newell to Fort Hall where they abandoned their wagons and traded their cattle for Mexican cattle to be delivered once in the Willamette Valley. Smith and the group continued on to the Whitman Mission, arriving on August 14, 1840.
After arriving in the Oregon Country in September, the group wintered at Henry H. Spalding's mission in what is now Eastern Washington. At the mission Smith assisted in building saw mills, a grist mill, and what was the first spinning wheel and loom in what became the Oregon Territory. He remained for nearly a year before leaving in September 1841 for the Willamette Valley.
Smith settled on the Tualatin Plains near what became Forest Grove, Oregon. He and his wife were the first permanent Euro-American settlers at what would become Forest Grove. There he built a log cabin on his farm and later donated to Tabitha Moffatt Brown's orphan school in 1845 that grew to become Tualatin Academy and then Pacific University. The couple's first cabin was lost to a flood, but they built a new log cabin on the farmstead.
Political career
In May 1843, he participated in the Champoeg Meetings where pioneers debated on whether to create an independent government for the Oregon Country prior to the settlement of the Oregon boundary dispute. At the meetings, Smith voted for the creation of the Provisional Government of Oregon and was elected as a magistrate for the Twality District, now Washington County. Smith was appointed by the Provisional Legislature of Oregon as a road viewer for a proposed road from the Willamette Falls to the Tualatin Plains in 1844. In 1851, he was elected as the probate judge for Washington County and received his commission from Territorial Governor John P. Gaines on July 3, 1851.
Later years
Smith volunteered in 1848 to fight in the Cayuse War that broke out after the Whitman Massacre, but was never called up for service. In 1851, Smith was appointed postmaster of West Tualatin, now Forest Grove, serving in that position until 1855, with his wife assisting. The post office was located in the Smith's log cabin, and was the first post office in the county. In 1856, he completed building a new two-story frame home, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 8, 1974, as the Alvin T. Smith House.
On April 17, 1858, his wife Abigail died, and later that year Smith assisted in building the Forest Grove Congregational Meeting House in September. Smith remarried on October 19, 1869, eleven years after his first wife died. Smith traveled home where he married Jane Averill from his hometown of Branford, Connecticut, before returning to Oregon and his farm. He and Jane moved into Forest Grove proper in 1870, but continued to own the farm and old home. Alvin Thompson Smith died on January 22, 1888, in Forest Grove at the age of 85 and was buried at Mountain View Memorial Gardens in that city.

Siegfried Kasche (18 June 1903 – 7 June 1947) was an ambassador of the German Reich to the Independent State of Croatia and Obergruppenführer of the Sturmabteilung (SA), a paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party. Kasche was the proposed ruler of the Reichskommissariat Moskowien, but the Reichskommissariat failed to materialize. He was hanged for war crimes in Yugoslavia on 7 June 1947.
Early life
Kasche was born in Strausberg. After attending cadet school in Potsdam and the Lichterfelde military academy, he spent 1919-20 in the Freikorps in Berlin and the Baltic states. He joined the Sturmabteilung in 1925 and the Nazi Party in 1926. He was also a leader of the SA in Pommerania. From 1928-31, Kasche was deputy Gauleiter in Ostmark, and in September 1930 was elected to the Reichstag. In 1934, Kasche was promoted to SA-Obergruppenführer, a rank equal to a lieutenant general in the Wehrmacht. Kasche was one of the few SA general officers to survive the Night of the Long Knives. Kasche survived by pleading his case with Göring until he arranged for Kasche to be left unharmed.
Ambassador to Croatia
In April 1941, Kasche was assigned to the Foreign Ministry for diplomatic service. On 15 April 1941, when Germany recognized the Independent State of Croatia, Kasche was named ambassador. He arrived in Zagreb on 20 April. At a meeting of the Nazi leadership on 16 July he was designated as the future Reichskommissar of the planned Nazi colony called Moskau, which was to comprise the main territories of central and northern Russia up to the Ural Mountains. Military realities on the Eastern Front during the 1941–42 winter prevented its establishment, leaving the project in the planning stages.
In the Independent State of Croatia, Kasche advocated a joint effort of the Axis forces against the Yugoslav Partisans. Since he was very affectionate to Ante Pavelić and "Ustaše revolution", he justified the policy and actions of Ustaše and Hitler called him a "greater Croat than Pavelić". Kasche was in constant conflict with Edmund Glaise-Horstenau, a Plenipotentiary General in the Independent State of Croatia. After the unsuccessful Lorković–Vokić plot in 1944, an attempt to align the Independent State of Croatia to the Allies, Kasche finally found a chance to denigrate Horstenau and make him withdraw from Croatia, as he was involved in the plot.
War crimes
During World War II, many Serbs were deported from Croatia — some to Serbia and others to Germany. The order to deport Serbs did not originate with the leaders of the Independent State of Croatia, which preferred to forcibly convert, kill, or detain as slave labor those Serbs within its boundaries. According to the Nuremberg Tribunal, a conference was held in the German Legation presided over by Siegfried Kasche, "at which it was decided forcibly to evacuate the Slovenes to Croatia and Serbia and the Serbs from Croatia into Serbia. This decision results from a telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Number 389, dated 31 May 1941". He reported to Berlin on 18 April 1944 that "Croatia is one of the countries in which the Jewish problem has been solved".
Post-war
After the war in Europe ended, Kasche was returned to Yugoslavia by the Allies. He was tried by the Supreme Court of the People's Republic of Croatia in May 1947, convicted, and executed by hanging on 7 June 1947.

Palazzo Capponi alle Rovinate is a late-Gothic and early Renaissance-style residential palace located on Via de' Bardi in Florence, region of Tuscany, Italy. There are apparently three other palaces once associated with the Capponi family:
Palazzo Capponi.
Palazzo Capponi-Vettori.
Palazzo Capponi-Covoni.
Description
The palace was built perhaps by Lorenzo di Bicci (although other scholars have attributed it to Filippo Brunelleschi) for Niccolò da Uzzano. It was finished around 1426. After his death a few years later, it was acquired by the Capponi family
It has a 15th-century late-Gothic façade with a sober rustication at the lower floor, surmounted by irregular rows of mullioned windows (some closed and replaced by rectangular openings). The plan is nearly square, with a central courtyard in Renaissance style. This has porticoes on each side, with graffiti decorations dating to the 1450s and octagonal capitals in a still late medieval style. The porticoes are cross-vaulted.
The entrance on Via de' Bardi has fresco, attributed to Lorenzo di Bicci himself, with two flying figures holding the Uzzano coat of arms. Internally, at the feet of the main staircase, is a porphyry lion, an ancient Roman sculpture from the 2nd century AD. In the piano nobile is a small chapel with an altarpiece by Pontormo, perhaps taken from the Barbadori Chapel of the church of Santa Trinita. There is also a stained glass window, with the Deposition from the Cross, by Guillaume de Marcillat (1526).
The rear façade, added in the 19th century, overlooks the Arno River.

Azie Faison Jr. (born November 11, 1964), sometimes known by the nickname "AZ", is an American former drug dealer and businessman who attained notoriety during the War on Drugs era as an individual drug dealer in New York. His five-year reign as crime boss ended when he was 26. Faison was born in New York City, and turned to selling drugs, advising youth in impoverished neighborhoods to avoid the lures of drug trafficking. He formed the hip-hop group MobStyle, where he released an album as a member in the 1990s, as well as a solo release. He has also been subject to various dramatic portrayals, with his legacy serving as inspiration for rap songs, documentaries, books, and movies, notably the 2002 film, Paid in Full.
Biography
Early life
Faison was born in New York City on November 11, 1964. He lived with his single mother and older sister in the neighborhood until 1970, where, at age 6, a fire destroyed his tenement. The family were then forced to relocate to the Sugar Hill neighborhood in Harlem, New York. Faison, who struggled academically, dropped out of high school following the ninth-grade, and worked at several odd jobs around Harlem, including a two-year stint at a local dry cleaner.
Career
After attending a screening of the 1983 film Scarface, Faison was influenced to enter the drug trade, and later that year, established a working relationship with a local Dominican supplier, who would frequently go to the dry cleaners. Faison would then become introduced to cocaine, and would become one of the first distributors of the drug within New York in 1984.
By the time he turned 21, Faison would transition into becoming the cocaine wholesaler in Harlem, reportedly earning $40,000 a week or more. He would eventually expand operations until 1990, and became one of the most notable distributors during the War on Drugs era in the United States. During this, he would become re-introduced to Rich Porter, a childhood friend who lived in the neighborhood prior to serving a sentence in prison. After his release, Porter would introduce Alpo Martinez to Faison, and the trio worked to expand operations in order to rise and become the largest distributors of cocaine in the state of New York.
However, Faison's downfall began in 1987, after he was the victim of attempted murder in August, after a robbery went awry, which left three people dead and three others seriously injured. Faison was shot nine times in the robbery attempt, and caused the drug network to falter as he aimed to recover from his injuries. This caused severe strains in the relationship between Faison, Porter, and Martinez, with the latter eventually murdering Porter in 1990, and while later being arrested and convicted for a plethora of charges in 1991.
Retirement and later life/career
After Porter's death, Faison effectively retired from drug dealing, and adopted a mission to steer youth away from the lure of drugs. In 1989, he formed a rap group called MobStyle, which then transitioned into a conscious hip-hop group. They released an album in 1991, while Faison also released a solo album. Faison also aimed to extend his outreach through television and media, eventually working on an autobiographical movie. The movie, titled Paid in Full, was released in 2002, with Faison being portrayed by Wood Harris.
Faison also collaborated with street documentarian Troy Reed, in order to produce documentary about his life called Game Over, while also working with Agyei Tyehimba in order to write Game Over: The Rise and Transformation of a Harlem Hustler.
The documentary and book were both released in 2007, and the latter was discussed at the Harlem Book Fair later that year, on a panel which featured co-author Tyehimba, and Congressman Charles Rangel. The discussion was broadcast live by C-SPAN's Book TV.

Imperial Leather is a brand of soaps, toiletries and healthcare products manufactured by PZ Cussons. The brand originates in Britain and is now available in a number of other countries including Australia, Denmark, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Iran, Ireland, Kenya, Malawi, Malta, Nepal, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Uganda, the United Arab Emirates and Zambia. The brand is not widely available in the United States but can be obtained via online sales and in some speciality shops.
Origins
The brand name had its origin in 1768 when Russian nobleman Count Orlof commissioned a brand of perfume from Bayleys of Bond Street in London. The perfume was called 'Eau de Cologne Imperiale Russe'. Russia leather was a high-quality leather exported widely from Russia and recognisable by a distinctive aroma from its birch oil tanning process. In 1921 Bayleys was acquired by Cussons Sons & Co, owned by Alexander Tom Cussons. It was not until some years later in 1938 that, using a version of the original perfume, the soap 'Imperial Leather' was created by Alexander Tom Cussons. The soap was initially called 'Russian Leather' but was soon renamed 'Imperial Leather'. In 1975 the Cussons Group was itself acquired by Paterson Zochonis, and renamed PZ Cussons in 2002.
Advertising
World War II advertising
In 1942 due to World War II all soaps were rationed in Britain. Imperial Leather soap was therefore marketed as being the best choice because it lasted longer than other soaps. The following is an extract from a World War II advertisement:
"Imperial Leather Toilet Soap is one of the few luxuries still available to the discriminating. Supplies are obviously limited, but if only because Imperial Leather lasts longer and increases the purchasing power of your coupons, you should buy it wherever and whenever you can."
Themed printed advertisements 1940s-1950s
During the 1940s to late 1950s Cussons Sons and Company Ltd embarked upon a prolific printed advert campaign with a new theme for the advertising of Imperial Leather released every year. The advertising campaign was under the direction of Alexander Tom Cussons' daughter Marjorie Goodwin (née Cussons). The adverts have become collectable as vintage adverts. Below is a table of some of the advertising themes:
Printed advertisements 1980s to present
In 1988 Cussons selected French model Estelle Lefébure for their printed Imperial Leather advertisements.
In 2013 Cussons ran a series of printed adverts for the Imperial Leather Foamburst range with a genie theme and the tagline "release the lather, feel the magic".
Television advertisements
Television has been an important part of Imperial Leather advertising for decades. Amongst the most popular Imperial Leather adverts were the ‘triple bath' series. This series of adverts began in the 1970s and continued into the 1980s. The adverts featured a family of three, each in three separate baths, using Imperial Leather whilst travelling to an exotic location by train, plane or spacecraft.
Imperial Leather adverts have previously featured Richard Stapley, Paolo Di Canio, Ralph Ineson, Julie Walters and Paul Merton. The Julie Walters advert featured her singing, with the final line "Imperial Leather: our only comfort in life." The Paul Merton series of adverts included a commercial where he attempts to interview an unsuspecting man in the shower and a further commercial where he wears a lab coat and conducts an experiment on identical twins.
More recent Imperial Leather television adverts include the rose tattoo (1999), the firemen fantasy (2002), the footballer fantasy (2002), the dancing duck (2002) and the secret shower advert (2005).
Sponsoring
Cussons Imperial Leather sponsored the XIX World Modern Pentathlon Championships, held in London in 1973.
Cussons Imperial Leather sponsored the XVII Commonwealth Games, held in Manchester in 2002. In 2004 Imperial Leather sponsored the TV show Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway. In 2004 Imperial Leather also sponsored a model cow called Imperial Heifer. The cow was on public display in Manchester. The model was later sold at auction with money donated to the Manchester Kids charity.
In 2004, Imperial Leather sponsored a theme park ride called The Flume which opened at Alton Towers. Also, in 2006 The Bubbleworks was opened at Chessington World of Adventures sponsored by the company. Both rides had the same 'bath time with attitude' theme with many rubber ducks. Original Source, another PZ Cussons product sponsored a ride called Tidal Wave at Thorpe Park. The contract with the rides ended in 2009, the rides had all of the Imperial Leather logos removed.
Imperial Leather was a sponsor of the 2011 Australian Open tennis tournament in Melbourne. The Imperial Leather logo was depicted on the players' chairs.
Discontinued and revived products
In the 1950s a number of Imperial Leather products were manufactured which have since been discontinued, although some have later returned. The discontinued products include Imperial Leather Cologne (Cussons branded version of the original product), Imperial Leather Brilliantine (solid and as lotion), Imperial Leather After Shave Lotion, Imperial Leather Bath Cubes, Imperial Leather Shaving Stick, Imperial Leather Shaving Bowl and Imperial Leather Shaving Cream. Below is an extract from a 1957 advert for Imperial Leather Shaving Stick:
"Cussons' Imperial Leather is the choice of men of fame and men of promise. It is the choice of men of good taste."
In Australia, two of these products have fairly recently returned in a new attempt to diversify the brand. The Imperial Leather Shaving Cream and the Aftershave Lotion have returned to supermarkets in that country, in two varieties (Original Red and Vertigo Grey), and are joined by Imperial Leather Deodorant and a range of bodywash and handwash lotions. The bodywash and handwash lotions do not come in the original Imperial Leather scent, despite making use of the brand name, but instead come in various other exotic variations such as ‘Japanese Spa'.
Toys
Die-cast toy vans have been manufactured with the Cussons Imperial Leather livery. There are two different types. Both have been discontinued and are collectable. They are an Austin A40 van made by Lledo (released in 1997) and a 30 cwt Bedford van also made by Lledo.
An Imperial Leather yellow duck beanie was produced as part of the promotion for a 2001 relaunch.

The Oxford University Society of Bibliophiles is a book collecting and bibliophile club run by, and primarily for, students at Oxford University. It was founded in 1950 by a group of young bibliophiles headed by John Granger, Bent Juel-Jensen and R. John Rickett, and the first meeting was held in Hilary Term of 1951. For fifty years the Society held regular lectures, visits and other events during the University terms, and many of the leading bibliographers, librarians, book collectors, booksellers and other literary figures of the period spoke to the Society or hosted visits. Many of the Society's junior members went on to become prominent figures in the world of books, and some later served as senior members of the Society. One of the most influential members was John Sparrow, Warden of All Souls, who encouraged a love of books and manuscripts in a generation of students, and hosted a termly "Warden's Meeting" at which members were encouraged to bring items from their own libraries to pass round and say a few words about; the tradition of the "Warden's Meeting" continued after 1986, when the Warden himself was too ill to host the meetings and, indeed, after his death in 1992. Another of the Society's traditions was the quality of the termly programme cards, often produced by the leading printers and private presses of the age, including the Oxford and Cambridge University Presses, the Rampant Lions Press, the Samson Press, the Fantasy Press, the Kit-Cat Press, Big Wheel Press, the Perpetua Press, the Incline Press, the Whittington Press, the Libanus Press, the Rocket Press, the Stanbrook Abbey Press and the Stamperia Valdonega.
After a period of difficulties and disrupted activities in the last decade of the twentieth century, the Society closed in 2000, when interest among the students had declined so far that a junior committee could no longer be formed. However, due to the efforts of a new generation of Oxford students led by Geri Della Rocca de Candal, Enrico Emanuele Prodi and Matthew Cheung Salisbury, aided by Cristina Dondi, Richard Ovenden and a few surviving members of the former Society (notably Colin Franklin and Paul W. Nash), the Oxford University Society of Bibliophiles was refounded in Trinity term 2008 and became fully active in Michaelmas term in the same year. The first termcard for the new Society was printed by the Rampant Lions Press (and was among the last jobs printed by Sebastian Carter).
The Society's device, shown opposite, was designed by Michael Harvey.

Francis Masson (August 1741 – 23 December 1805) was a Scottish botanist and gardener, and Kew Gardens' first plant hunter.
Life
Masson was born in Aberdeen.
In the 1760s, he went to work at Kew Gardens as an under-gardener.
Masson was the first plant collector to be sent abroad by the newly appointed director Sir Joseph Banks; he sailed with James Cook on HMS Resolution to South Africa, landing in October 1772.
Masson stayed until 1775, during which time he sent back to England over 500 species of plant.
In 1776, Banks sent Masson abroad again, this time to Madeira, Canary Islands, the Azores and the Antilles.
Whilst in Grenada, Masson was captured and imprisoned by the French, a traumatic experience which haunted him for the rest of his life. Although he was eventually released, his collections deteriorated during the delay in securing a passage home, and a hurricane in St. Lucia destroyed almost all of what little had survived. Returning to Kew, Masson found the gardening life tedious by comparison, and again turned to Banks for another opportunity to collect abroad. However, the war with France had made such ventures increasingly difficult.
In 1783, Masson collected plants in Portugal, and in October 1785, he left England on his second voyage to South Africa. The political climate there had altered much since his first visit, owing to the attempt by a British expeditionary force to annexe the Cape in 1781. The restrictions imposed on his movements by the Governor caused Masson considerable frustration, and when he sailed for England in March 1795, his plant collections bore little comparison with those of his triumphant first expedition.
In September 1797, Masson set sail for North America. The voyage was particularly perilous, his ship captured by a French pirate. Anticipating execution, Masson and his fellow travellers were much relieved to find themselves transferred to a German vessel bound for Baltimore, whence he was able to secure a passage to New York City, arriving in December. During the next seven years he travelled widely collecting plants and seeds, visiting Niagara Peninsula and Lake Ontario, but amassed only 24 new species, a minuscule tally compared with his South African spoils.
Death
Masson was unsuited to the harsh winters of North America. He died after a short illness in Montreal on 23 December 1805, and was buried there at the Scotch Presbyterian Church (later known as the St. Gabriel Street Church) on Christmas Day.
Legacy
Masson described in excess of 1700 new species including:
Publications
Masson's only book, Stapeliae Novae, on the South African succulents also known as "carrion-flowers" because of their smell, was published in 1796.
Eponymy
The genus of plants Massonia is named for Masson. There is a commemorative plaque to Masson in the Cruickshank Botanic Garden, Old Aberdeen.

The 24th Intelligence Squadron is an active United States Air Force unit stationed at Ramstein Air Base, Germany. The squadron was first activated as the 24th Observation Squadron during World War II. it conducted aerial reconnaissance training, until converting to the photographic mission as the 33d Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron. it deployed to the European Theater of Operations, where it conducted combat reconnaissance missions, earning a Distinguished Unit Citation and being cited in the Belgian Army Order of the Day on two occasions. It remained in Europe following V-E Day, becoming non operational in August 1945. Its ground echelon returned to the United States in the fall of 1945 and it was inactivated at the port of embarkation.
The squadron was redesignated the 24th Air Intelligence Squadron and activated in Panama in 1992. It provided intelligence support until it was inactivated in 1995 as the United States withdrew its forces from Panama. The squadron was reactivated in its current role in 2002.
Mission
The 24th Intelligence Squadron plans, directs and conducts multi-source intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) tasking, processing, exploitation and dissemination operations in support of United States Air Forces Europe, United States European Command, United States Africa Command, United States Central Command, NATO, and joint and combined force air component commanders. The squadron operates two primary mission systems: Distributed Common Ground System (DGS-4) and Eagle Vision One.
DGS-4 is a part of the Distributed Common Ground System, which is the Air Force's AN/GSQ-272 "Sentinel" weapon system. DGS-4 is one of five core sites executing collection, processing, exploitation and dissemination of intelligence data derived from Air Force ISR platforms including Lockheed U-2 and General Atomics MQ-1 Predator unmanned aerial vehicles. DGS-4 is the only DGS involved in operations across three different commands on a recurring basis.
Eagle Vision One executes collection, processing, exploitation and dissemination of commercial satellite imagery. The 24th Intelligence Squadron's Eagle Vision One is one of five Eagle Vision systems worldwide. It is the only active duty Eagle Vision unit with its own pool of Eagle Vision imagery analysts. Eagle Vision is a deployable ground station with the capability to produce CSI and geospatial products.
History
World War II reconnaissance
The squadron was first activated at Army Air Base, Wilmington in late February 1942 as the 24th Observation Squadron, one of the three original squadrons of the 76th Observation Group. The squadron trained with various single engine and twin engine aircraft in aerial reconnaissance and ground support missions and supported the training of Army ground units through May 1943. Starting in May 1943, the squadron assisted in Second Army maneuvers.
In August 1943, the squadron mission was changed from visual to photographic reconnaissance and it was redesignated the 33d Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron and relieved from the 76th Group. in April 1944, the squadron deployed to the European Theater of Operations.
At its first combat station, RAF Chalgrove, the squadron equipped with long-range Lockheed F-5 Lightnings. The squadron engaged in tactical reconnaissance over the Normandy Beaches of France prior to the Allied invasion on D-Day, 6 June 1944. Afterwards engaged in highly dangerous unarmed reconnaissance of Northern France, the Low Countries and Germany as Allied armies moved west during the Northern France Campaign during the balance of 1944 and the Allied Invasion of Western Germany, spring 1945. Provided battlefield intelligence primarily to the United States Third Army, however also flew reconnaissance missions for the United States First and Ninth Armies as requested.
Assigned to the United States Air Forces in Europe after the V-E Day, was part of the Army of Occupation in Germany before becoming non-operational in August 1945. The squadron inactivated in October 1945.
Intelligence operations
In 1992, the squadron returned to its original number as the 24th Air Intelligence Squadron and was activated at Howard Air Force Base, Panama to provide intelligence support for Air Force activities in South and Central America. It continued this mission until inactivating in 1995 as the United States withdrew its forces from Panama.
The squadron reactivated at Ramstein Air Base, Germany on 8 January 2003 as the 24th Intelligence Squadron.

Larry Lujack (born Larry Lee Blankenburg; June 6, 1940 – December 18, 2013), also called Superjock, Lawrence of Chicago, Uncle Lar, and King of the Corn Belt, was a Top 40 music radio disc jockey who was well known for his world-weary sarcastic style. Some of his more popular routines included Klunk Letter of the Day, the darkly humorous Animal Stories with sidekick Tommy Edwards as Little Tommy, and the Cheap Trashy Show Biz Report.
Professional life
Lujack came to Chicago to work for WCFL-AM. He spent a few months there before being hired at WLS. While at WCFL, Lujack closed the air studio curtains during public visiting hours.
His Animal Stories routine came about because WLS was still receiving farm magazines long after the station changed to a rock-music format in 1960. Lujack started reading some of them and began airing stories from them instead of reading the grain reports connected with the Farm Report. When the Farm Report was officially discontinued, the feature became Animal Stories. A perfectionist about his work, Lujack would review every word he spoke on the air after each broadcast by listening to an audio cassette skimmer tape which recorded only when the microphone was open.
Lujack retired in 1987, shortly after his son John from his first marriage died in an accident. In 1997, Lujack moved from Palatine, Illinois to the outskirts of Santa Fe, New Mexico and, in May 2000, began working again, for then-WUBT (WKSC-FM) in Chicago, via a remote Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) link from a New Mexico recording studio, teaming up with Matt McCann who was based in the Chicago studio. The ratings for the show out-paced the rest of the radio station. In 2003, he reteamed with his Animal Stories partner, Tommy Edwards (Little "Snot-Nosed" Tommy), on WRLL (1690 AM) in Chicago, to broadcast his signature features on weekday mornings. On August 16, 2006, Lujack was terminated with the entire WRLL on-air staff as it was announced that the station's Real Oldies format would cease on September 17, 2006. The broadcast duo were on the air once again as part of the WLS "The Big 89 Rewind" on Memorial Day, 2007 and 2008 when the station returned to its MusicRadio programming, featuring many of the former WLS personalities and special guests, other DJs, etc.
Lujack was inducted into the Illinois Broadcasters Association's Hall of Fame in June 2002, the National Radio Hall of Fame on November 6, 2004, and the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame on April 15, 2008, during their annual convention in Las Vegas.
Personal life
Born in Quasqueton, Iowa as Larry Lee Blankenburg, the family moved to Caldwell, Idaho when he was 13. He later changed his last name to that of his football idol, Johnny Lujack. He attended the College of Idaho in Caldwell, Idaho, and Washington State University and was a radio disc jockey, starting in 1958, at KCID in Caldwell. His entry into radio while a biology major at College of Idaho was a matter of finances; at the time he was looking for a part-time job. He originally intended to go into wildlife conservation. He subsequently worked at several other radio stations, including KJR (AM) in Seattle, but is best known for his antics on Chicago AM radio stations WLS and WCFL.
Lujack had three children from his first marriage and a stepson from his second.
Away from the job, he was a golf enthusiast. After triple coronary artery bypass surgery in 1991, Lujack marked his calendar for the date his doctor told him he could return to the sport. Not just a "fair weather" golfer, Lujack suited up in winter clothing and snowshoes to play Chicago area golf courses in winter. On January 23, 1985, he played a full 18 holes at Buffalo Grove, Illinois; the temperature was 27 degrees below zero with a windchill of -75 degrees. Lujack collapsed afterward.
Lujack died December 18, 2013 at a Santa Fe, New Mexico hospice of esophageal cancer.

Picnic Paranoia is an action game written by Russ Segal for the Atari 8-bit family and published by Synapse Software in 1982. A version for the [TI-99/4A]] was published by Atarisoft in 1983.
Segal later wrote New York City for Synapse.
Gameplay
Playing as "George" the player attempts to protect their picnic from ants, who will carry off the food, spiders, who will weave webs to slow George down or bite, and wasps, who will sting to paralyze. While fending off the insects the player must move the food back on to the tables. Points are gained for food still visible on the screen at the end of each round. Each round lasts 90 seconds. There are sixteen rounds in a game. If all the food is pushed off the screen the game ends.
Reception
Allen Doum reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, and stated that "Animation and graphics are excellent. George, the wasp, and a multitude of ants all move smoothly around the screen, though the spiders suffer by comparison. Sound cues for walking, being stung, the wasp, and for food being pushed are all well done. The music that accompanies the copywrite screen is great, even by Synapse standards."

Gendercide is the systematic killing of members of a specific gender. The term is related to the general concepts of assault and murder against victims due to their gender, with violence against women and men being problems dealt with by human rights efforts. Gendercide shares similarities with the term 'genocide' in inflicting mass murders; however, gendercide targets solely one gender, being men or women. Politico-military frameworks have historically inflicted militant-governed divisions between femicide and androcide; gender-selective policies increase violence on gendered populations due to their socioeconomic significance.
Etymology
The term gendercide was first coined by American feminist Mary Anne Warren in her 1985 book, Gendercide: The Implications of Sex Selection. It refers to gender-selective mass killing. Warren drew "an analogy between the concept of genocide" and what she called "gendercide". In her book, Warren wrote:
By analogy, gendercide would be the deliberate extermination of persons of a particular sex (or gender). Other terms, such as "gynocide" and "femicide," have been used to refer to the wrongful killing of girls and women. Nevertheless, "gendercide" is a sex-neutral term in that the victims may be either male or female. There is a need for such a sex-neutral term since sexually discriminatory killing is just as wrong when the victims happen to be male. The term also calls attention to the fact that gender roles have often had lethal consequences and that these are in important respects analogous to the lethal consequences of racial, religious, and class prejudice.
Femicide
Femicide is defined as the systematic killing of women for various reasons, usually cultural. The word is attested from the 1820s. According to the United Nations, the biologically normal sex ratio at birth ranges from 102 to 106 males per 100 females. However, ratios higher than normal – sometimes as high as 130 – have been observed. This is now causing increasing concern in some South Asian, East Asian, and Central Asian countries. Such disparities almost always reflect a preference for boys as a result of deeply embedded social, cultural, political and economic factors.
The most widespread form of femicide is in the form of gender-selective infanticide in cultures with strong preferences for males such as China and India. According to the United Nations, male-to-female ratios have experienced radical changes from the normal range. Gendercide of girls is reported to be a rising problem in several countries. Census statistics report that in countries such as China, the male to female ratio is as high as 120 men for every 100 women. Gendercide also takes the forms of infanticide and lethal violence against a particular gender at any stage of life. The World Bank describes violence against girls and women as a "global pandemic". One in three women experiences gender-based violence in their lifetime. In research released in 2019, 38% of murdered women were killed by an intimate partner.
Sex ratios at birth over time in China:
106:100 in 1979 (106 boys for every 100 girls, close to the upper limit of the 'normal' range)
111:100 in 1988
117:100 in 2001
120:100 in 2005
In India, parents may prefer male children because they desire heirs who will care for them in their old age. Additionally, the cost of a dowry, the family's price for their daughter to be married off, is very high in India, while a male heir would bring a dowry to the family by way of marriage. According to the British publication, The Independent, the 2011 census revealed 7.1 million fewer girls than boys aged under the age of seven, up from 6 million in 2001 and from 4.2 million in 1991. The sex ratio in the age group is now 915 girls to 1,000 boys (109 boys for every 100 girls), the lowest since records began in 1961.
The honor killing and self-immolation condoned or tolerated by the Kurdish administration in Iraqi Kurdistan has been labeled as "gendercide" by Mojab (2003).
There have been reports of femicide in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico, where 411 assassinations of women were qualified as serial and/or of sexual characteristic, by domestic violence, intimate femicides and hatred against women. The response to these murders has included the criminalisation of feminicide in the country.
Contemporary mechanisms of gendercide lie within sexualized violence against women; the females of "sub-Saharan Africa (Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola) in areas that are also at the heart of the "AIDS belt", are not only at-risk due to living in places where there are "current cases of large-scale rape", but are also susceptible to contracting HIV. Less popularized tactics of gendercide against women include the systemic withholding of critical medical, and nutritional care, predominantly occurring "across the belt of "deep patriarchy" extending from East through West Asia and into Northern Africa"; here. Adam Jones, a co-founder of Gendercide Watch, an online research platform created to spread awareness, estimates that the denial of healthcare for women equates to approximately the same toll as that of the 1994 Rwandan Genocide per year.
Over 200,000 dice from bleeding, with many giving birth in buses or bullock carts. Lack of health education restricts commonplace medical knowledge; thus, bystanders are unable to offer assistance. In addition, the casualty rate from self-administered abortions is roughly 75,000. Eclampsia, a condition possible pre-, during, and post-childbirth, is characterized by seizures due to high blood pressure, and its effects kill another 75,000 through damage to the brain and kidneys. Moreover, 100,000 dice from sepsis, contracted through untreated infections of the uterus and remaining fragments of the placenta that poison the bloodstream. Also, female casualties due to labor obstructions stagger around the 400,000 range.
Adam Jones drafted possible solutions to aid the crisis in Africa. He concluded treatment "would mean training some 850,000 health workers, according to UNICEF and World Health Organization reports, as well as [funding] the necessary drugs and equipment. The total cost would be US $200 million, about the price of half a dozen jet fighters".
Androcide
Androcide is the systematic killing of men or boys for various reasons, usually cultural. Androcide may happen during war to reduce an enemy's potential pool of soldiers. According to the Global Justice Center, perpetrators of genocide almost exclusively target men and boys - who may also suffer "other acts of violence ... such as torture, rape, and enslavement" that tend to be obscured by a focus on the killings themselves.
Examples include the 1988 Anfal campaign against Kurdish males that were considered "battle-aged" (or approximately ages 15–50) in Iraqi Kurdistan. While many of these deaths took place after the Kurdish men were captured and processed at a concentration camp, the worst instances of the gendercide happened at the end of the campaign (August 25 – September 6, 1988).
Another incident of androcide was the Srebrenica massacre of approximately 8,000 Bosniak men and boys on July 12, 1995, ruled as an act of genocide by the International Court of Justice. From the morning of July 12, Serb forces began gathering men and boys from the refugee population in Potočari and holding them in separate locations, and as the refugees began boarding the buses headed north towards Bosniak-held territory, Serb soldiers separated men of military age who were trying to clamber aboard. Occasionally, younger and older men were stopped (some as young as 14 or 15).
According to genocide scholar Adam Jones, "non-combatant men have been and continue to be the most frequent targets of mass killing and genocidal slaughter, as well as a host of lesser atrocities and abuses."
Third gender
Gendercide against third gender people is the systemic killing of people who do not fit within the Western gender binary. Deborah Miranda uses the term gendercide to identify the Spanish colonial practice of systemically targeting joyas (the Spanish term for third gender people) in an attempt to exterminate them. Qwo-Li Driskill writes how this violence was waged against people now understood as two-spirit.
In 1513, Spanish explorer Vasco Nuñez de Balboa encountered about forty Indigenous men dressed as women. He commanded his soldiers to execute them through making them prey for their war dogs, which were specially bred mastiffs or greyhounds. They were dismembered and eaten alive by the dogs. Third gender people from around the area were rounded up in service of Spanish authority. Miranda writes that "the Spanish had made it clear that to tolerate, harbor, or associate with the third gender meant death."
In his 1775 memoir, Spanish soldier Pedro Fages wrote that about two or three joyas could be identified in each Indigenous Californian village and were "held in great esteem" in their communities. Fages sought to initiate a swift reduction of the joyas, writing "we place our trust in God and expect that these accursed people will disappear with the growth of the missions. The abominable vice will be eliminated to the extent that the Catholic faith and all the other virtues are firmly implanted there, for the glory of God and the benefit of those poor ignorants."
In fiction
The 2015 film No Men Beyond This Point is a science fiction mockumentary set in an alternate timeline in the 1950s nine months after a near-Earth object almost hit Earth in 1952, making it possible for women to reproduce by parthenogenesis and without men. Men are no longer born, and they have disappeared from all critical positions. Sex is outlawed, and the male sex becomes a dying breed. The few remaining men are kept in reserve and are no longer part of the society, except for a few men who are allowed to do low work. In this world where women are wearing the pants, are asexual, and have no male offspring, it is now up to the quiet and modest household helper Andrew Myers to ensure that the male does not die out. The 37-year-old is the youngest living man on Earth and works for a family made up only of women.
The 2003 film Matrubhoomi: A Nation Without Women, an Indian movie directed by Manish Jha, features a dystopian situation resulting in 2050 from accumulated violence against women over many years. A wealthy man in one village discovers the existence of a young woman not too far from his home, and he buys the woman as a sex slave to be used by him and his sons. In this wretched town in which only men exist aside from her, the wealthy man's family is torn apart while the victim finds herself mercilessly dominated by more men. The film received critical acclaim, with the frank nature of the brutality and despair portrayed being cited by many reviewers, and it sparked increased debate over the contemporary problem of rape in India and other human rights issues in the nation.
The 1985 book The Handmaid's Tale depicts a story of a fascist military dictatorship controlled by a clique of theocratic ideologues. With the population of both men and women having been vastly cut down, fertile women are relatively scarce and mass numbers of non-fertile women are forced into becoming unpersons. Fertile women are regarded as property with few rights, being unable to read and do other basic activities. Canadian author Margaret Atwood created the work as a warning about totalitarianism and oppression of women in the modern age; in particular, she had experienced a fellowship in the then divided Berlin in the early 1980s, visiting the Soviet-dominated areas and witnessing a general despair, which helped inspire the book's beginnings.
In The Walking Dead (TV series), Oceanside's backstory is that the Saviors rounded up and executed every man and boy over 10. It is not until the penultimate episode of season 8 that it is revealed to have all been orchestrated by Simon and not Negan.

The Alpini Battalion "Tirano" () is an inactive battalion of the Italian Army's mountain infantry speciality, the Alpini, which distinguished itself in combat during World War I and World War II.
History
The battalion was raised on 1 November 1886 by renaming Alpini Battalion "Valtellina" of the 5th Alpini Regiment. The battalion's name, like the names of all Alpini battalions raised before World War I, was the name of the location where the battalion was based; in the Tirano battalion's case the village of Tirano in the Valtellina valley. As with all Alpini battalions the recruits for the battalions were drafted exclusively from the area surrounding the battalions base. The battalion consisted of the 46th, 48th and 49th Alpini companies.
The Tirano battalion's history is intertwined with the history of the 5th Alpini Regiment, with which it served in World War I and in World War II. During the latter the regiment was part of the 2nd Alpine Division "Tridentina" and served in the Greco-Italian War and as part of the Italian Army in Russia on the Eastern Front, where regiment and battalion barely escaped annihilation during the Battle of Nikolayevka in January 1943. For its conduct during the two campaigns the 5th Alpini Regiment was awarded two Gold Medals of Military Valour.
The 150 survivors of the Tirano battalion were repatriated in spring 1943 and garrisoned in the village of Mühlbach in South Tyrol. After Italy changed sides with the Armistice of Cassibile on 8 September 1943, regiment and battalion were disbanded by the Germans.
Cold War
After World War II the 5th Alpini Regiment was reformed on 1 January 1953, in the city of Meran with the battalions "Tirano" and "Edolo", and was the infantry component of the Alpine Brigade "Orobica". During the 1975 army reform the 5th Alpini was disbanded on 30 November 1975 and its battalions came under the direct command of the Orobica brigade. As the traditions and war flag of the 5th Alpini Regiment were assigned to the "Morbegno" battalion, the Tirano battalion was granted a new war flag on 12 November 1976 by decree 846 of the President of the Italian Republic Giovanni Leone. The two Gold Medals of Military Valour and the Messina earthquake Medal of Merit awarded to the 5th Alpini Regiment, were duplicated for the new flag of the Tirano battalion, and the Bronze Medal of Civil Valour awarded to the Tirano battalion for its work after the Gleno Dam disaster was transferred from the flag of the 5th Alpini to the Tirano's flag. The battalion's structure on 1 December 1975 was as follows:
Alpini Battalion "Tirano", in Mals
46th Alpini Company, in Glurns
48th Alpini Company, in Mals
49th Alpini Company, in Glurns
109th Mortar Company, in Mals
The battalion's task in case of war with the Warsaw Pact was to defend the Reschen Pass.
With the end of the Cold War the Italian Army began to downsize its forces and on 27 March 1991 the Tirano was disbanded and its flag transferred to the shrine of the flags at the Vittoriano in Rome.

Charming Shoppes is a specialty and plus size clothing retail holding company based in Bensalem, Pennsylvania; a suburb of Philadelphia. Its subsidiaries include Lane Bryant, Cacique, Fashion Bug, and Catherines Plus. Clothes were sold from over 2300 retail stores in the United States, as well as numerous catalogs and online sites. In 2012, the company and assets were acquired by Ascena Retail Group.
History
Charming Shoppes was founded in 1940, it went public in 1971, and was ranked 927th on the 2012 Fortune 1000.
On May 2, 2012, Ascena Retail Group, the parent company of DressBarn, announced that it would acquire Charming Shoppes with a $900 million transaction through a combination of cash in hand and $325 million of borrowings from credit facilities.
Services and products
The Company's operation were divided into two segments: Retail Stores and Direct-to-Consumer.
The Retail Stores segment derived its revenues from sales through retail stores and store-related e-commerce sales under its Lane Bryant (including Lane Bryant Outlet), Fashion Bug, and Catherines Plus Sizes brands.
Lane Bryant — A retailer of specialty plus-size fashion, Lane Bryant was acquired by Charming Shoppes in 2001. With more than 900 stores nationwide, Lane Bryant stores sell clothes for plus size women. In July 2006, Charming Shoppes launched Lane Bryant Outlet.
Catherines Plus — A plus-size specialty retailer with more than 500 stores throughout the country, the Catherines brand targets women 40–65 years old and sells clothing and accessories for career and casual wear.
The Direct-to-Consumer segment derives its revenues from catalog sales and catalog-related e-commerce sales under its FIGI'S title, a leading food gift retailer. On Oct 16, 2013 the company announced that it had closed the sale of Figi's, to Mason Companies, Inc.
Defunct brands
Fashion Bug — Fashion Bug was the chain that founded Charming Shoppes—and, for many years, was their only brand. The chain, at one point, grew to over 1200 stores nationwide. The stores sold women's fashion apparel and were located in strip shopping centers, catering to middle and lower-class segments. It offered fashion apparel and accessories in plus, misses' and junior size ranges. In June 2012, Charming Shoppes announced that Fashion Bug stores would be closing; the final stores closed in February 2013.
Added Dimensions and The Answer — Two chains which were acquired as part of Catherine's in January, 2000. These chains operated plus-size women's stores in the Northeastern and Southeastern US and had previously been a part of Virginia Specialty Stores, which was acquired by Catherines Inc. in 1992. Charming operated the 77-store chain until 2002, and then announced it would close 80% of the locations, and convert the remaining 20% into its Catherines brand.
Modern Woman — Modern Woman was a 125-store chain of plus-size women's clothing stores, operating primarily in strip shopping centers in the US. The chain was acquired by Charming in 1999. The stores were mostly converted to the Catherine's Brand, and the remainders to the Fashion Bug Plus brand.
PS...Plus Sizes, Plus Savings — These stores were created by Catherines Inc. in 1980 and acquired by Charming Shoppes when they acquired Catherines Inc. in January, 2000. The stores were converted to other Charming brands.
Monsoon and Accessorize — Opened as a joint venture between Charming Shoppes Inc. and Monsoon plc of the UK, the partnership aimed to bring the 2 successful UK brands to traditional enclosed shopping malls in the US. Approximately 10 pilot locations were opened in malls in Virginia, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania in 2002. The partnership ended and the stores were shuttered in 2007.

The Amazon Defense Coalition (Frente de Defensa de la Amazonia) is an Ecuadorian non-governmental organization created on May 16, 1994, and approved by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Social Welfare on June 4, 1998, under ministerial reference #535. It is led by the environmental and human rights activist Luis Yanza.
Purpose
The coalition focuses on regional, national and global environmental and collective rights in the Ecuadorian Amazon. It has offices in the Amazonian towns of Nueva Loja (also known as Lago Agrio) and Coca, as well as the nation's capital, Quito.
Structure
The Amazon Defense Coalition (ADC) structure is focused on training (a three-year integral leadership training course offered to Amazonian residents in Orellana and Sucumbíos provinces), legal (legal advice and defence of campesino and indigenous socio-environmental community rights), environmental monitoring (a technical team which monitors and reports on areas and communities that suffer from oil pollution as a result of drilling in the Amazon), and alternative products (promotion of cleaning and energy products that do not harm the environment as well as seeking local sustainable development and biodiversification).
History
The Amazon Defense Coalition was formed in 1994 after a group of 75 indigenous people and farmers brought an environmental clean-up lawsuit against Texaco (consolidated into Chevron Corporation in 2001) in the name of 30,000 Amazonian residents near the Lago Agrio oil field. The accumulation of waste there over three decades now fills a region the size of Rhode Island. The case was initially heard in a U.S. court in New York City where it received representation from New York human rights lawyer Steven Donziger. It 2003, it was moved to Nueva Loja at the request of Chevron who cited the lack of a jury system in Ecuador as one of its reasons. With a 2011 judgement of $18 billion against the oil giant, confirmed but lowered to $9.5 billion in 2013 by the Ecuador Supreme Court, it is potentially the biggest environmental litigation ever brought against a multi-national corporation.
The money would have been used by the ADC to detoxify the soil and treat cancer patients. However, as of 2020, Chevron has evaded the judgement by moving all of its operations out of Ecuador's jurisdiction. Attempts to seek the $9.5 billion in the United States have been blocked by Judge Lewis A. Kaplan who decried the proceedings as a "five-year effort to extort and defraud Chevron". The main witness supporting Kaplan's ruling was found to have lied and been paid by Chevron in 2015. The Ontario Court of Appeals has ruled against the collection on the grounds that Chevron Canada operates with sufficient autonomy from the American company.
The ADC was initially the main organization to follow up the lawsuit. In 2001, the Assembly of People Affected by Texaco (ADAT) was created to better represent the affected communities and make the most significant decisions about the judicial process. The Amazon Defense Coalition became part of the ADAT, which later evolved into the Union of People Affected by Texaco (UDAPT) in 2012. However, the ADC continued to maintain its former structure and internal rules and to act as a social organization in defense of the rights of the Amazonian communities.

Madschun is a Turkish fairy tale from Andrew Lang's The Olive Fairy Book. The tale was first published by folklorist Ignác Kúnos in a collection of Turkish folktales.
Translations
The tale was also translated into English as "Madjun".
Summary
Once, there was a young man who, even from childhood, had never grown any hair. One day, he saw the Sultan's daughter and became determined to marry her.
He first sent his mother to tell the Sultan that her son wanted to marry his daughter. The Sultan was intrigued by the request, and told the woman to send her son. However, by the time the son arrived, the Sultan's interest had waned, and he only wanted to be rid of the boy. So he told the boy that he must first gather all the birds of the world and bring them to the Sultan's garden, which had no birds.
After wandering for a time, the boy met a dervish, and asked his help. The dervish told him to go to a huge cypress tree down the road, and hide in its shadow until he heard a huge rush of wings. This would be all the birds in the world coming for a rest. He was to wait until they were sitting, then say the word "madschun", which would cause them to freeze and become motionless. He could then gather the birds and take them to the palace. And that is what the boy did.
The sultan was a little dismayed. He told the boy that he could marry the princess - after he grew a full head of hair.
Upset, the boy went home and brooded until he heard that the princess was to marry the son of the wazir. At this, he sneaked into the palace, found where the princess, the wazir's son, and some others were waiting, and said "Madschun". This froze all of them to the spot. The Sultan sent for a magician to explain what had happened, and the magician told him that it was because the Sultan had mistreated the boy. The Sultan sent for the boy at once, and the boy, hiding nearby, raced home.
The boy told his mother that she was to tell the sultan's messengers that the boy had left awhile ago, and that if they asked her to go look for the boy, she was to say that she was too poor to travel. She did this, and the messengers gave her a bag of gold for expenses and asked her help.
After they left, the boy went to the palace, freed everyone, and married the princess.

Olyk Ipai (Mari: О́лык Ипа́й, 24 March 1912 – 11 November 1937) was a Mari poet.
He was born as Ipatiy Stepanovich Stepanov () in the village of Toimetsola in the Mari El. He attended a school in the village of Aryn, of which the Mari national poet Sergei Chavain was the headmaster at the time. He studied at a pedagogical college in Yoshkar-Ola, and later studied cinematography in Moscow; however, he chose to pursue poetry instead. He also translated many works of Alexander Pushkin, Nikolay Nekrasov, Vladimir Mayakovsky and Eduard Bagritsky from Russian to Mari. Like many of the Mari intelligentsia at the time, he was executed during the Great Purge.

Parens patriae is Latin for "parent of the nation" (lit., "parent of one's country"). In law, it refers to the public policy power of the state to intervene against an abusive or negligent parent, legal guardian, or informal caretaker, and to act as the parent of any child, individual or animal who is in need of protection. For example, some children, incapacitated individuals, and disabled individuals lack parents who are able and willing to render adequate care, thus requiring state intervention.
In U.S. litigation, parens patriae can be invoked by the state to create its standing to sue; the state declares itself to be suing on behalf of its people. For example, the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976 (15 USC 15c), through Section 4C of the Clayton Act, permits state attorneys general to bring parens patriae suits on behalf of those injured by violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act.
Discussion
Parens patriae relates to a notion initially invoked by the King's Bench in the sixteenth century in cases of non compos mentis adults. The notion dates from at least 1608, as recorded in Coke's report of Calvin's Case, wherein it is said "that moral law, honora patrem… doubtless doth extend to him that is pater patriae."
The parens patrae doctrine was gradually applied to children throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and has since evolved from one granting absolute rights to the sovereign to one more associated with rights and obligations of the state and courts towards children and incapacitated adults.
Many jurisdictions incorrectly apply the "best interests" standards in family law cases however, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in Reno v. Flores, 507 US 292 - 1993 that the ..."Similarly, "the best interests of the child" is not the legal standard that governs parents' or guardians' exercise of their custody: So long as certain minimum requirements of child care are met...". In order for the court to invade on the custody or control of fit parent or guardian "harm" to the child needs to be established in some way. Absent the establishment of that harm a constitutional violation would not be taking place.
In some situations, the parties may have submitted their dispute to formal arbitration proceedings. Such proceedings, whether judicial or quasi-judicial, cannot displace the supervisory power of the court in the exercise of its parens patriae function to the child. To the extent that such an award conflicts with the best interests of the child, the courts will treat it as void in respect of the child, even though it might be binding on the parents. The test of the best interests of the child can always be the basis of a challenge by a parent, grandparent, an interested relative, or the child acting through a friend.
Thus, for example, the spouses might already have been through a religious form of divorce known as the get before the Beth Din, the Jewish rabbinical court, which included provision for the children. Even though there might appear to be a grant of custody in absolute terms by this court, public policy always requires that it can be reviewed by a secular court and, if the state court is of the view that it is not in the best interests of the child, it will be set aside (see Stanley G. v. Eileen G. New York Law Journal, 10-13-94, P.22, Col.6, Sup. Ct., NY Co.).
Within the EU, the right of the child to be heard in any proceedings is a fundamental right provided in Article 24 Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The views of the child shall be considered on matters which concern them in accordance with their age and maturity. It also provides that the child's best interest shall be the primary consideration in all actions relating to children, whether taken by public authorities or private institutions.
The same principles apply to individuals whose mental capacity is impaired and who are being abused by carers or other individuals, whether family members or otherwise. Since these individuals cannot protect themselves, the courts have an inherent jurisdiction to appoint a guardian ad litem for particular proceedings. In English Law, long-term care is arranged through the Court of Protection.
In US federal courts
The concept of the parens patriae suit has been greatly expanded in the United States federal courts beyond those that existed in England.
In Louisiana v. Texas, the State of Louisiana brought suit to enjoin officials of the State of Texas from so administering the Texas quarantine regulations as to prevent Louisiana merchants from sending goods into Texas. The US Supreme Court recognized that Louisiana was attempting to sue, not because of any particular injury to a particular business of the state, but as parens patriae for all its citizens. While the Court found that parens patriae could not properly be invoked in that case, the propriety and utility of parens patriae suits were clearly recognized, thus setting a precedent. Thus, in a series of cases after Louisiana v. Texas the Supreme Court followed that precedent to allow states to sue as parens patriae:
Missouri v. Illinois, 180 U.S. 208 (1901) (holding that Missouri was permitted to sue Illinois and a Chicago sanitation district on behalf of Missouri citizens to enjoin the discharge of sewage into the Mississippi River);
Kansas v. Colorado, 206 U.S. 46 (1907) (holding that Kansas was permitted to sue as parens patriae to enjoin the diversion of water from an interstate stream);
Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co., 206 U.S. 230 (1907) (holding that Georgia was entitled to sue to enjoin fumes from a copper plant across the state border from injuring land in five Georgia counties);
New York v. New Jersey, 256 U.S. 296 (1921) (holding that New York could sue to enjoin the discharge of sewage into the New York harbor);
Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U.S. 553 (1923) (holding that Pennsylvania might sue to enjoin restraints on the commercial flow of natural gas);
North Dakota v. Minnesota, 263 U.S. 365 (1923) (holding that Minnesota could sue to enjoin changes in drainage which increase the flow of water in an interstate stream).
The Supreme Court recognized a different kind of parens patriae suit in Georgia v. Pennsylvania R. Co. While the earlier cases were common-law actions to prevent or repair harm to a state's "quasi-sovereign" interests. Georgia now sought relief under the federal antitrust statute, alleging that twenty railroads had conspired to restrain trade and to fix prices in a manner that would favor shippers in other states (particularly northern states) to the detriment of Georgia shippers and the state's economy. The court upheld Georgia's claim as parens patriae with respect to injunctive relief, but did not consider whether the antitrust laws also authorized damages for an injury to the state's economy, because the ICC's approval of the challenged rates barred any damage recovery.
Then, three decades later, in Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., the court considered a generally similar damages action Hawaii brought under the antitrust laws for damages to its general economy resulting from a price fix by four oil companies. The court held that the state could sue as parens patriae only for injunctive relief and not for damages. Its citizens would have to sue individually for damages.
In Massachusetts v. EPA, a group of states (mostly coastal states) sought to sue the EPA to require it to regulate greenhouse gas emissions because they were causing global warming and rising sea levels. "These rising seas have already begun to swallow Massachusetts' coastal land." The court stated:
Therefore, states such as Massachusetts had standing as parens patriae to sue EPA to seeks to require it to regulate to protect their coastlines. The Court held that EPA would have to consider the matter and give a reasoned explanation of whatever its decision on the merits would be.
In Pennsylvania v. Mid-Atlantic Toyota Distributors, Inc., the Fourth Circuit held that several state attorney generals were proper parens patriae plaintiffs to sue a group of car dealers for price fixing, in order to recover damages for their citizen injured by overcharges. The court held that because plaintiffs were authorized to pursue antitrust litigation against defendants on behalf of their states' natural-person residents under both 15 U.S.C. §§ 15c-15h and state laws and constitutions, they could sue on behalf of their citizens.
The relation of parens patriae suits brought under state law to the federal Class Action Fairness Act is an unclear issue with implications related to American federalism.
Animals
Supreme Court of India invoked the doctrine of parens patriae in Animal Welfare Board Of India vs A. Nagaraja & Ors, the court observed, "PCA Act (Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act), is a welfare legislation which has to be construed bearing in mind the purpose and object of the Act and the Directive Principles of State Policy. It is trite law that, in the matters of welfare legislation, the provisions of law should be liberally construed in favour of the weak and infirm. Court also should be vigilant to see that benefits conferred by such remedial and welfare legislation are not defeated by subtle devices. Court has also a duty under the doctrine of parens patriae to take care of the rights of animals, since they are unable to take care of themselves as against human beings."

The Kato theorem, or Kato's cusp condition (after Japanese mathematician Tosio Kato), is used in computational quantum physics. It states that for generalized Coulomb potentials, the electron density has a cusp at the position of the nuclei, where it satisfies
Here denotes the positions of the nuclei, their atomic number and is the Bohr radius.
For a Coulombic system one can thus, in principle, read off all information necessary for completely specifying the Hamiltonian directly from examining the density distribution. This is also known as E. Bright Wilson's argument within the framework of density functional theory (DFT). The electron density of the ground state of a molecular system contains cusps at the location of the nuclei, and by identifying these from the total electron density of the system, the positions are thus established. From Kato's theorem, one also obtains the nuclear charge of the nuclei, and thus the external potential is fully defined. Finally, integrating the electron density over space gives the number of electrons, and the (electronic) Hamiltonian is defined. This is valid in a non-relativistic treatment within the Born–Oppenheimer approximation, and assuming point-like nuclei.

Empodisma gracillimum is a species of sedge-like plant endemic to coastal areas of Southwest Australia. Described within an Australian and New Zealand genus of the rush- or bamboo-like Restionaceae family, it is the only species of Empodisma to be found in Western Australia.
A perennial herb, growing to a height between 0.2 and 1.2 metres, found near winter wet ground and permanent waterways. The inflorescence is brown, appearing between July to December or January to February. The preferred soil type is grey to black sand and peat. The habit of the species is to cluster together, the leaves becoming an entangled barrier that inspired the Greek derivation of the genus and its common name of wire rush. The rhizomatous roots form dense mats that retain water, the detritus of the plant assemblage creating a peat habitat that is also occupied by bryophytes.
The species was formerly named Calorophus gracillimum, by Ferdinand von Mueller, until the erection of a new genus that split out Empodisma minus and E. gracillimum.

The Nachtigal Hydroelectric Power Station is a 420 megawatt run-of-the-river hydroelectric power station under development in Cameroon across the Sanaga River, which harnesses the energy of the Nachtigal Falls. The development rights were granted to Nachtigal Hydro Power Company (NHPC), a company owned by a consortium comprising (a) Électricité de France (b) International Finance Corporation and (c) the Government of Cameroon. A 35-year power purchase agreement is in place, between Eneo Cameroon S.A. and NHPC.
Location
The dam lies across the Sanaga River, about north-east of Yaoundé, the capital city of Cameroon.
Overview
The design calls for a gravity dam with a power potential of 420 megawatts, powered by seven turbines, each with a capacity of 60 megawatts. The roller-compacted concrete (RCC) dam will create a reservoir with a surface area of , capable of storing 2.78 million m³ of water.
As part of this project, NHPC the concessionaire, will construct a double circuit 225 kilovolt high voltage transmission line measuring in length, that will transmit the generated power to a substation where it will be integrated into the national electricity grid. Once the high voltage transmission line is constructed and operational, ownership, operation and maintenance will transfer to National Electricity Construction Company (Sonatrel).
Ownership
The power station is owned by the special purpose company named Nachtigal Hydro Power Company (NHPC). The table below illustrates the shareholding in NHPC.
Construction costs
The estimated costs for the dam and power plant was €1.2 billion in 2018. Approximately €300 million (25 percent) was raised internally by the NHPC consortium as equity investment. The remaining amount, about €900 million, was borrowed from the eleven international financiers and four Cameroonian banks. Some of the lenders to this project include the following:
African Development Bank
French Development Agency
Proparco
International Finance Corporation
Société Générale des Banques au Cameroun
Standard Chartered Cameroon
FMO (Netherlands)
European Investment Bank
Timeline and commissioning
In December 2021, Afrik21 reported that the first 60 megawatt turbines was expected to be commissioned in July 2023. The final and seventh of equally rated turbines is expected to come online in July 2024.

The Sandra Day O'Connor Institute For American Democracy is a non-profit organization founded in 2009 by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor following her retirement from the Court. Headquartered in her native home state in Phoenix, Arizona, United States, its mission is to "continue Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's legacy and lifetime work to advance American Democracy through civics education, civic engagement and civil discourse". Leaders and luminaries who have spoken at the O'Connor Institute include General Colin Powell, President George W. Bush and the former Soviet Union President Mikhail Gorbachev.
History
The Institute, a non-profit, nonpartisan organization, was originally founded as an effort to save and preserve the historic adobe home of Sandra Day O'Connor which was slated for demolition. The house, built in 1959 in Paradise Valley, Arizona, was painstakingly dismantled brick by brick and successfully reassembled in a new location in Tempe's Papago Park near the Arizona Historical Society in 2009 and named O'Connor House thereafter. The O'Connor Institute For American Democracy conserves the house. In 2019, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Sandra Day O'Connor House. In 2015, Justice O'Connor and the organization's Board of Directors authorized the renaming from O'Connor House to the Sandra Day O'Connor Institute to better represent the broader spectrum of programs and emphasis on civil discourse, civic engagement and civics education . In 2020, inspired by the wishes and directive of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the Sandra Day O'Connor Institute For American Democracy was launched to reflect the organization's commitment to advance and preserve American Democracy through civil discourse, civic engagement and civics education providing a spectrum of programs for multi-generational impact. The Institute's programs serve individuals of all ages from 50 states and six continents through its digital education platform, O'Connor U.
Programs
O'Connor U
Launched in 2020, O'Connor U consists of free, online, multi-generation educational programs which include civic engagement webinars, podcasts, interactive online lectures, and civics education digital experiences.
